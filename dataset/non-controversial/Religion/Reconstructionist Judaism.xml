'''Reconstructionist Judaism''' ({{Lang-he|'' 'יהדות מחדשת''}}) ({{Lang-yi|'''יידישקייַט רקאָנסטראָאָקטיביט'''}}) is a modern American-based [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish movement]] based on the ideas of [[Mordecai Kaplan]] (1881–1983). The movement views Judaism as a progressively evolving [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org/showres&amp;rid=143 What Are The Institutions Of The Reconstructionist Movement?]&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as a branch of [[Conservative Judaism]], before it splintered. The movement developed from the late 1920s to 1940s, and it established a rabbinical college in 1968.

There is substantial theological diversity within the movement. [[Halakha]] is not considered binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary. The movement emphasizes positive views toward [[modernism]], and has an approach to Jewish custom which aims toward communal decision making through a process of education and distillation of values from traditional Jewish sources.

==Origin==
Reconstructionism was developed by [[Rabbi]] [[Mordecai Kaplan]] (1881&amp;ndash;1983) and his son-in-law, Rabbi [[Ira Eisenstein]] (1906&amp;ndash;2001), over a period of time spanning from the late 1920s to the 1940s. It made its greatest stride in becoming the fourth movement in North American [[Judaism]] ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] being the other three) with the founding of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] in 1968.

Reconstructionist Judaism is the first major movement of Judaism to originate in North America; the second is the [[Humanistic Judaism]] movement founded in 1963 by Rabbi [[Sherwin Wine]].

==Theology==
Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]] believed that, in light of advances in [[philosophy]], [[science]] and [[history]], it would be impossible for modern Jews to continue to adhere to many of Judaism's traditional theological claims. In agreement with Orthodox theology (articulated by prominent medieval Jewish thinkers including [[Maimonides]]), Kaplan affirmed that God is not [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] in any way. As such, all anthropomorphic descriptions of God are used metaphorically. Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that God is not [[Personal]], in that, God is not a conscious being, nor can God in any way relate to or communicate with Man. Furthermore, Kaplan's theology defines God as the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled.

&lt;blockquote&gt;To believe in God means to accept life on the assumption that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;Sonsino, Rifat. ''The Many Faces of God: A Reader of Modern Jewish Theologies''. 2004, page 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all of Kaplan's writings on the subject were consistent; his position evolved somewhat over the years, and two distinct theologies can be discerned with a careful reading. The view more popularly associated with Kaplan is strict [[Philosophical naturalism|naturalism]], ''à la'' Dewey, which has been criticized as using religious terminology to mask a [[Nontheism|nontheistic]], if not outright [[atheism|atheistic]], position. However, a second strand of Kaplanian theology exists, which makes clear that at times Kaplan believed that God has [[Ontology|ontological]] reality, a real and absolute existence independent of human beliefs. In this latter theology, Kaplan still rejects classical forms of theism and any belief in miracles, but holds to a position that in some ways is [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Most &quot;classical&quot; Reconstructionist Jews (those agreeing with Kaplan) reject traditional forms of theism, though this is by no means universal. Many are [[Deism|deists]], a small number accept [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] views of God or the concept of a personal God.

Kaplan's theology, as he explicitly stated, does not represent the only Reconstructionist understanding of theology and theology is not the cornerstone of the Reconstructionist movement. Much more central is the idea that Judaism is a [[civilization]], and that the Jewish people must take an active role in ensuring its future by participating in its ongoing evolution.

Consequently, a strain of Reconstructionism exists which is distinctly non-Kaplanian. In this view, Kaplan's assertions concerning belief and practice are largely rejected, while the tenets of an &quot;evolving religious civilization&quot; are supported. The basis for this approach is that Kaplan spoke for his generation; he also wrote that every generation would need to define itself and its civilization for itself. In the thinking of these Reconstructionists, what Kaplan said concerning belief and practice is not applicable today. This approach may include a belief in a personal God, acceptance of the concept of &quot;[[chosen people|chosenness]]&quot;, a belief in some form of [[resurrection]] or continued existence of the dead, and the existence of an obligatory form of ''[[halakha]]''. In the latter, in particular, there has developed a broader concept of ''halakhah'' wherein concepts such as &quot;eco-[[Kashrut]]&quot; are incorporated.

==Jewish law and tradition==
{{ProgressiveJudaism}}
Reconstructionist Judaism holds that contemporary Western secular morality has precedence over Jewish law and theology. It does not ask that its adherents hold to any particular beliefs, nor does it ask that [[halakha|Jewish law]] be accepted as normative. Unlike classical Reform Judaism, Reconstructionism holds that a person's default position should be to incorporate Jewish laws and tradition into their lives, unless they have a specific reason to do otherwise. The most important distinction between Reconstructionist Judaism and traditional Judaism is that Reconstructionism concludes that all of [[halakha]] should be categorized as &quot;[[folkways (sociology)|folkways]]&quot;, and not as [[religious law]].

Reconstructionism promotes many traditional Jewish practices. Thus, ''[[613 mitzvot|mitzvot]]'' (commandments) have been replaced with &quot;folkways&quot;, non-binding customs that can be democratically accepted or rejected by the congregations. Folkways that are promoted include keeping [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the [[List of Jewish Prayers and Blessings|prayer]] service, studying [[Torah]], daily prayer, wearing ''[[Yarmulke|kipot]]'' (''yarmulkas''), ''[[tallit]]ot'' and ''[[tefillin]]'' during prayer, and observance of the [[Jewish holiday]]s.

==Principles of belief==
In practice, Rabbi Kaplan's books, especially ''The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion'' and ''Judaism as a Civilization'' are ''de facto'' statements of principles.  In 1986, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) and the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH) passed the official &quot;Platform on Reconstructionism&quot;. It is not a mandatory statement of principles, but rather a consensus of current beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;See the FRCH Newsletter, Sept. 1986, pages D, E.&lt;/ref&gt; Major points of the platform state that:

{{quote|&quot;Judaism is the result of natural human development. There is no such thing as divine intervention; Judaism is an evolving religious civilization; [[Zionism]] and [[aliyah]] (immigration to Israel) are encouraged; Reconstructionist Judaism is based on a democratic community where the laity can make decisions, not just rabbis; The Torah was not inspired by God; it only comes from the social and historical development of Jewish people; The classical view of God is rejected. God is redefined as the sum of natural powers or processes that allows mankind to gain self-fulfillment and moral improvement; The idea that God chose the Jewish people for any purpose, in any way, is &quot;morally untenable&quot;, because anyone who has such beliefs &quot;implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others&quot;.}}

Most Reconstructionists do not believe in [[revelation]] (the idea that God reveals his will to human beings). This is dismissed as [[supernatural]]ism. Kaplan posits that revelation &quot;consists in disengaging from the traditional context those elements in it which answer permanent postulates of human nature, and in integrating them into our own ideology ... the rest may be relegated to archaeology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers have criticized the movement's most widely held theology, [[religious naturalism]]. [[David Ray Griffin]] and [[Louis Jacobs]] have objected to the redefinitions of the terms &quot;revelation&quot; and &quot;God&quot; as being intellectually dishonest, and as being a form of &quot;conversion by definition&quot;; in their critique, these redefinitions take [[non-theistic]] beliefs and attach [[theistic]] terms to them. Similar critiques have been put forth by Rabbis [[Neil Gillman]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sacred Fragments'', p.&amp;nbsp;200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Steinberg]],&lt;ref&gt;''Milton Steinberg: Portrait of a Rabbi'' by Simon Noveck, Ktav, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;259-260M&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Samuels.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lord is My Shepherd: The Theology of a Caring God'' 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructionist Judaism is [[egalitarian]] with respect to [[gender roles]]. All positions are open to both genders; they are open to lesbians and gay men as well.

==Jewish identity==
Reconstructionist Judaism allows its rabbis to determine their own policy regarding officiating at [[intermarriage]]s. Some congregations accept [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] as well as [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent, and children of one Jewish parent, of either sex, are considered Jewish if raised as Jews. This is less restrictive than the traditional standard that only considers children with Jewish mothers to be Jewish, regardless of how they were raised.

The role of non-Jews in Reconstructionist congregations is a matter of ongoing debate. Practices vary between synagogues. Most congregations strive to strike a balance between inclusivity and integrity of boundaries. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (JRF) has issued a non-binding statement attempting to delineate the process by which congregations set policy on these issues, and sets forth sample recommendations. These issues are ultimately decided by local lay leadership.&lt;ref&gt;''Can Halakha Live?'' by Rabbi Edward Feld, ''The Reconstructionist'', Vol.59(2), Fall 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;64-72&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed Jewish/Non-Jewish couples, however, are welcome in Reconstructionist congregations.

==Organizations==
Over 100 synagogues and ''[[havurot]]'', mostly in the United States and Canada, were affiliated with the [[Jewish Reconstructionist Federation]]. As of June 3, 2012 the Reconstructionist movement has been restructured. The [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] is now the primary organization of the movement, headed by Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz, a 1989 graduate of the College.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rrc.edu/node/1193, &quot;Movement Restructuring FAQs&quot;, Reconstrucitonist Rabbinical College, June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/25852/Do_the_Jewish_Streams_Have_a_Future/, &quot;Do the Jewish Streams Have a Future?&quot;, The Jewish Exponent,May 09, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's new designation is simply the Jewish Reconstructionist Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishrecon.org Jewish Reconstructionist Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] educates rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantor]]s. The [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] is the professional organization of Reconstructionist rabbis.

==Relation to other Jewish movements==
Originally an offshoot of [[Conservative Judaism]]/[[Masorti|Masorti Judaism]], Reconstructionism retains warm relations with both the Conservative/Masorti movement and [[Reform Judaism]]. [[Orthodox Judaism]], however, considers Reconstructionism to be in violation of proper observance of interpretation of Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, George. Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs and Rituals. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000. ISBN 0-671-03480-4, pgs 232&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Reconstructionist Federation]] is a member of the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]].
