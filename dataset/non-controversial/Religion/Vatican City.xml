It has an area of approximately {{Convert|44|ha}}, and a population of just over 800.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vt.html|title=Holy See (Vatican City)|accessdate=9 July 2011|work=CIA—The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/homepage.htm|title=Vatican City State|publisher=Vatican City Government|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Vatican City the [[List of countries by land area|smallest independent state]] in the world by both area and population. 

Vatican City State was established in 1929  by the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]], on behalf of [[Pope Pius XI]] and by [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister and Head of Government]] [[Benito Mussolini]] on behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].&lt;ref name=Preamble&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Preamble of the Lateran Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican City State is distinct from the [[Holy See]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/europe/holy-see | work = UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office | title = Living and working abroad - Holy See }}&lt;/ref&gt; which dates back to [[early Christianity]] and is the main [[episcopal see]] of 1.2&amp;nbsp;billion [[Latin Rite|Latin]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] adherents around the globe. Ordinances of Vatican City are published in Italian; official documents of the Holy See are issued mainly in [[Latin]]. The two entities have distinct passports: the Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City State issues normal passports. In each case very few passports are issued.

The [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929, which brought the city-state into existence, spoke of it as a new creation (Preamble and Article III), not as a vestige of the much larger [[Papal States]] (756–1870) that had previously encompassed much of central Italy. Most of this territory was absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, and the final portion, namely the city of Rome with [[Lazio]], ten years later, in 1870.

Vatican City is an [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]]&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; or [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|sacerdotal]]-[[Monarchy|monarchical]]&lt;ref name=pages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp |title=catholic-pages.com |publisher=catholic-pages.com |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; state, ruled by the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]—the Pope. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergymen of various national origins. It is the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]] (''Sancta Sedes'') and the location of the Pope's residence, referred to as the [[Apostolic Palace]].

The Popes have generally resided in the area that in 1929 became Vatican City since the return from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] in 1377, but have also at times resided in the [[Quirinal Palace]] in Rome and elsewhere. Previously, they resided in the [[Lateran Palace]] on the [[Caelian Hill]] on the far side of Rome from the Vatican. [[Constantine I|Emperor Constantine]] gave this site to [[Pope Miltiades]] in 313. The signing of the agreements that established the new state took place in the latter building, giving rise to the name of [[Lateran Treaty|Lateran Pacts]], by which they are known.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Vatican City}}
[[File:Vatican panorama from St. Peters Basilica.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A panorama of the country from atop St. Peter's Basilica.]]
The Vatican [[climate]] is the same as Rome's; a temperate, [[Mediterranean climate]] with mild, rainy winters from September to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to August. There are some local features, principally mists and dews, caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains and the size of the large paved square.

The Vatican City is the world's smallest [[State (polity)|state]], being only around {{Convert|44|ha|abbr=on}}.

In July 2007, the Vatican agreed to become the first [[carbon neutrality|carbon neutral]] state. They plan to accomplish this by offsetting [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] with the creation of a [[Vatican Climate Forest]] in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news103554442.html |title=The Vatican to go carbon neutral |publisher=United Press International |date=13 July 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territory===
[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|250px|Territory of Vatican City according to the [[Lateran Treaty]]]]
The name &quot;Vatican&quot; predates Christianity and comes from the Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Vatican Hill|Mons Vaticanus]]}}'', meaning Vatican Mount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Vatican|title=Vatican (search)|publisher=Online Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'', and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields. It is in this territory that [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman ''[[rione]]'' of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] river, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847–55), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534–49), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559–65) and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623–44).

When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.

The territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]], distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]] which runs from close to the Tiber River to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.

According to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably [[Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[Papal basilica|major basilicas]], enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty text&quot;/&gt; These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty text&quot;&gt;Excerpt of [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] as per the Lateran Treaty of 1929:

; Article 13
: Italy recognizes the full ownership of the Holy See over the patriarchal Basilicas of [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St. John Lateran]], Sta. Maria Maggiore, and St. Paul, with their annexed buildings.
: The State transfers to the Holy See the free management and administration of the said Basilica of St. Paul and its dependent Monastery, also paying over to the Holy See all monies representing the sums set aside annually for that church in the budget of the Ministry of Education.
: It is also understood that the Holy See shall remain the absolute owner of the edifice of S. Callisto, adjoining Sta. Maria in Trastevere.

; Article 14
: Italy recognizes the full ownership by the Holy See of the Papal Palace of [[Castel Gandolfo]], together with all endowments, appurtenances, and dependencies thereof, which are now already in the possession of the Holy See, and Italy also undertakes to hand over, within six months after the coming into force of the present Treaty, the Villa Barberini in Castel Gandolfo, together with all endowments, appurtenances, and dependencies thereof.
: In order to round off the property situated on the northern side of the Janiculum Hill, belonging to the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Sacred Congregation of Propaganda]] Fide and to other ecclesiastical institutions, which property faces the Vatican Palaces, the State undertakes to transfer to the Holy See or other bodies appointed by it for such purpose, all real estate belonging to the State or to third parties existing in that area. The properties belonging to the said Congregation and to other institutions and those to be transferred being marked on the annexed map.
: Finally, Italy shall transfer to the Holy See, as its full and absolute property, the Convent buildings in Rome attached to the Basilica of the Twelve Holy Apostles and to the churches of San [[Andrea della Valle]] and S. Carlo ai Catinari, with all annexes and dependencies thereof, and shall hand them over within one year after the entry into force of the present Treaty, free of all occupants.

; Article 15
: The property indicated in Article 13 hereof and in paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 14, as well as the Palaces of the Dataria, of the Cancelleria, of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide in the [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]] of the S. Offizio with its annexes, and those of the Convertendi (now the Congregation of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church]]) in Piazza Scossacavalli, the Vicariato, and all other edifices in which the Holy See shall subsequently desire to establish other offices and departments although such edifices form part of the territory belonging to the Italian State, shall enjoy the immunity granted by [[International law|International Law]] to the headquarters of the diplomatic agents of foreign States. Similar immunity shall also apply with regard to any other churches (even if situated outside Rome) during such time as, without such churches being open to the public, the [[Pontifex Maximus|Supreme Pontiff]] shall take part in religious ceremonies celebrated therein.

; Article 16[[File:Ponte - piazza s Apollinare e ex collegio germanico 1060303.JPG|thumb|right|Saint Apollinaris Building (Palazzo sant'Apollinare)]]
: The property mentioned in the three preceding Articles, as also that used as headquarters of the following Papal institutions—the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian University]], the Biblical, Oriental, and Archaeological Institutes, the Russian Seminary, the [[Lombard College]], the two Palaces of St. Apollinaris and the Home of the Retreat of the Clergy dedicated to St. John and St. Paul—shall never be subject to charges or to expropriation for reasons of [[public utility]], save by previous agreement with the Holy See, and shall be exempt from any contribution or tax, whether ordinary or extraordinary and payable to the State or to any other body.
: It shall be permissible for the Holy See to deal with all buildings above mentioned or referred to in the three preceding Articles as it may deem fit, without obtaining the authorisation or consent of the Italian governmental, provincial, or communal authority, which authorities may in this regard rely entirely on the high artistic traditions of the Roman Catholic Church.
&lt;/ref&gt; Castel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italian police]]. St. Peter's Square is ordinarily policed jointly by both.&lt;ref name='treaty'&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Treaty between the Holy See and Italy]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Gardens of Vatican City}}

Within the territory of Vatican City are the [[Gardens of Vatican City|Vatican Gardens]] ({{lang-it|Giardini Vaticani}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;VaticanMap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/vaticancity-map.htm |title=Map of Vatican City |publisher=www.saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which account for more than half of this territory. The gardens, established during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.

The gardens cover approximately {{convert|23|ha|acres}} which is most of the [[Vatican Hill]]. The highest point is {{convert|60|m}} [[above mean sea level]]. Stone walls bound the area in the North, South and West.

The gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal [[Apostolic Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pellegrino&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pellegrinocattolico.com/ctv/gardens.htm|title=Al Pellegrino Cattolico: ''The Vatican Gardens''|accessdate=21 November 2008 |publisher=2008 Al Pellegrino Cattolico s.r.l.

{{Main|Papal States|History of the Papacy}}
In this originally uninhabited area (the ''ager vaticanus'') on the opposite side of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] from the city of Rome, [[Agrippina the Elder]] (14 BC&amp;nbsp;– 18 October AD 33) drained the hill and environs and built her gardens in the early 1st century AD. Emperor [[Caligula]] (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) started construction of a circus (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the ''Circus Gaii et Neronis'',&lt;ref&gt;Lanciani, Rodolfo (1892). [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Lanciani/LANPAC/3*.html#sec16 Pagan and Christian Rome] Houghton, Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; usually called, simply, the [[Circus of Nero]]. In AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], when the northern army that brought [[Aulus Vitellius]] to power arrived in Rome, &quot;a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''The Histories'', II, 93, translation by Clifford H. Moore (The Loeb Classical Library, first printed 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vatican [[obelisk]] was originally taken by Caligula from [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]], Egypt to decorate the spina of his circus and is thus its last visible remnant. This area became the site of martyrdom of many Christians after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64. Ancient tradition holds that it was in this circus that [[Saint Peter]] was [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]].

Opposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the [[Via Cornelia]]. Funeral monuments and mausoleums and small tombs as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter's in the first half of the 4th century. Remains of this ancient [[list of necropoleis|necropolis]] were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries increasing in frequency during the [[Renaissance]] until it was systematically excavated by orders of [[Pope Pius XII]] from 1939 to 1941.

In 326, the first church, the Constantinian basilica, was built over the site that early [[Christian apologetics|Roman Catholic apologists]] (from the first century on) as well as noted Italian archaeologists argue was the [[Saint Peter's tomb|tomb of Saint Peter]], buried in a common cemetery on the spot. From then on the area started to become more populated, but mostly only by dwelling houses connected with the activity of St. Peter's. A palace was constructed near the site of the basilica as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of [[Pope Symmachus]] (reigned 498–514).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Vatican.html Columbia Encyclopedia]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, Sixth Edition, 2001–2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Popes in their secular role gradually came to govern neighbouring regions and, through the [[Papal States]], ruled a large portion of the [[Italy|Italian peninsula]] for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century, when all of the territory of the Papal States was seized by the [[Italian unification|newly created]] Kingdom of Italy. For much of this time the Vatican was not the [[habitual residence]] of the Popes, but rather the [[Lateran Palace]], and in recent centuries, the [[Quirinal Palace]], while the residence from 1309–77 was at [[Avignon]] in France.

===Italian unification===
{{main|Roman Question}}
[[File:Vatican city and san pietro.JPG|thumb|250px|right|left|View of the dome of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] from ''Borgo [[Santo Spirito in Sassia|Santo Spirito]]''.]]
In 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by the [[Piedmont]]-led forces which had united the rest of Italy, after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the &quot;[[Roman Question]]&quot;. The successive Popes were undisturbed in their palace, and certain prerogatives recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they [[prisoner in the Vatican|refused to leave the Vatican compound]] until the dispute was resolved in 1929. Other states continued to maintain international recognition of the Holy See as a sovereign entity.

In practice Italy made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, they confiscated church property in many other places, including, perhaps most notably, the [[Quirinal Palace]], formerly the pope's [[official residence]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846–78), the last ruler of the Papal States, claimed that after Rome was annexed he was a &quot;[[Prisoner in the Vatican]]&quot;.

===Lateran treaties===
{{main|Lateran Treaty}}
[[File:0 Palazzo Apostolico - Piazza San Pietro (1).JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Apostolic Palace]].]]
This situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the [[Lateran Treaty]] between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister and Head of Government]] [[Benito Mussolini]] on behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] for [[Pope Pius XI]].&lt;ref name=Preamble/&gt; The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Roman Catholicism in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html Lateran Treaty, article 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{main|Vatican City during World War II}}
Vatican City officially pursued a policy of neutrality during [[World War II]], under the leadership of [[Pope Pius XII]]. Although the city of Rome was occupied by Germany from 1943 and the Allies from 1944, Vatican City itself was not occupied. One of Pius XII's main diplomatic priorities was to prevent the bombing of Rome; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Before the American entry into the war, there was little impetus for such a bombing, as the British saw little strategic value in it.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222–32&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American entry, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, while the British then supported it.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232–36&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII similarly advocated for the declaration of Rome as an &quot;[[open city]]&quot;, but this occurred only on 14 August 1943, after Rome had already been bombed twice.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 236–44&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Italians consulted the Vatican on the wording of the open city declaration, the impetus for the change had little to do with the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
In 1984, a new [[concordat]] between the [[Holy See]] and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion.

==Governance==

{{Politics of Vatican City|Government of Vatican City}}
{{Main|Politics of Vatican City}}
The politics of Vatican City takes place in an [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]], in which the head of the Roman Catholic Church takes power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the [[Holy See]]), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Vatican-City-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html|title=Vatican City (Politics, government, and taxation)|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City is currently the only widely recognised independent state that has not become a member of the UN. The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer status]] with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]].

===Political system===
The government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state. Legislative authority is vested in the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the President of that commission, assisted by the General Secretary and Deputy General Secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the [[Holy See]]'s [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the pope has full and absolute executive, legislative and judicial power over Vatican City. He is currently the only absolute monarch in Europe.

There are specific departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp|accessdate=4 March 2007|title=Vatican City|work=Catholic-Pages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Cardinal Camerlengo]] presides over the [[Apostolic Camera]] to which is entrusted the administration of the property and the protection of the temporal rights of the [[Holy See]] during a [[sede vacante|papal vacancy]]. Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state. All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the [[College of Cardinals]] as a whole.

The nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see [[Master of the Horse#Papal Master of the Horse|Papal Master of the Horse]], [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household]], [[Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], [[Black Nobility]]). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, [[executive functions]] were entrusted to some of them, including that of Delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated President of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of 28 March 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19680328_pontificalis-domus_lt.html ''Pontificalis Domus''], 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Paul VI]] abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as [[Quartermaster general|Quartermaster General]] and [[Master of the Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;The site [http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm Hereditary Officers of the Papal Court] continues to present these functions and titles as still in use, several decades after their abolition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of the Vatican City, created in 1929 by the [[Lateran Treaty|Lateran Pacts]], provides the [[Holy See]] with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognised as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]] to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929). The Holy See has the oldest active continuous diplomatic service in the world, dating back to at least AD 325 with its legation to the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/diplomacy.asp Vatican Diplomacy, Catholic-Pages.com]. Retrieved 15 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassadors are accredited to the Holy See, never to the Vatican City State.

===Head of state===
{{Main|Pope}}
[[File:Vatican City OSM 20110615.png|thumb|Vatican City]]
The Pope is [[Ex officio member|''ex officio'']] [[head of state]]&lt;ref&gt;One of the titles of the Pope listed in the [[Annuario Pontificio]] is &quot;Sovereign of Vatican City State&quot; (page 23* in recent editions).&lt;/ref&gt; of Vatican City, functions dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the [[diocese of Rome]]. The term [[Holy See]] refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the [[Roman Curia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P19.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 361] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_P7.HTM Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 48]&lt;/ref&gt; His official title with regard to Vatican City is ''Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City''.

His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City is the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the [[Governor of Vatican City]]. Since 2001, the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of President of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City.

The Pope resides in the [[Papal Apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace|Papal Palace]] overlooking off [[Saint Peter's Square]]. It is here he carries out his business and meets foreign representatives.

The current Pope is [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], born Joseph Alois Ratzinger in [[Bavaria]], Germany. Italian Cardinal [[Giovanni Lajolo]] serves as President of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. He was appointed on 11 September 2006.

===Administration===
[[Legislature|Legislative]] functions are delegated to the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], led by the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the pope, through the [[Holy See]]'s [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]''. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.

[[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title &quot;President of the Governorate of Vatican City&quot;—a General Secretary, and a Vice General Secretary, each appointed by the pope for five year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.

The Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the pope for five year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the ''[[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano]]''.

[[Judiciary|Judicial]] functions are delegated to a supreme court, an [[Appeal|appeals court]], a tribunal ([[Tribunal of Vatican City State]]), and a trial judge.&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[Outline of Vatican City#Judicial branch of the government of Vatican City]].&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, the pope may choose at any time to exercise supreme legislative, executive, or judicial functions in the state.

The [[Postal code#Country code prefixes|Country code prefix]] is ''SCV'', and the only postal code is ''00120'' – altogether ''SCV-00120''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;International postal code: SCV-00120.&quot; [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/sp_ss_scv_info-generale_en.html#Targa www.vatican.va] [[Holy See Press office]] – General Information. Retrieved 23 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military and police===
{{Main|Military of Vatican City|Crime in Vatican City}}
Though, like various European powers, earlier Popes recruited Swiss [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] as part of an army, the [[Pontifical Guard|Pontifical Swiss Guard]] was founded by [[Pope Julius II]] on 22 January 1506 as the personal bodyguard of the Pope and continues to fulfil that function. It is listed in the [[Annuario Pontificio]] under &quot;Holy See&quot;, not under &quot;State of Vatican City&quot;. At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and [[Switzerland]]. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their [[basic training]] with the [[Swiss Army]] with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least {{convert|174|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} in height. Members are armed with [[small arm]]s and the traditional [[halberd]] (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics.

[[File:Swiss Guard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Swiss Guard]]s in their traditional uniform]]
[[File:0 Palazzo del Governatorato - Vatican.JPG|thumb|right|Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State]]
The [[Palatine Guard]] and the [[Noble Guard (Vatican)|Noble Guard]] were disbanded by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican State&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/Vatican_City_today.htm|title=Vatican City Today|publisher=Vatican City Government|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the first body was founded as a militia at the service of the [[Papal States]], its functions within the Vatican State, like those of the Noble Guard, were merely ceremonial.

The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corpo della Gendarmeria]] acts as a police force. Its full name is Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano (which means &quot;[[Gendarmerie]] Corps of the Vatican City State&quot;), although it is sometimes referred to as the ''Vigilanza'', as a shortening of an earlier name. The Gendarmeria is responsible for [[Public order crime|public order]], law enforcement, crowd and [[Road traffic control|traffic control]], and criminal investigations in Vatican City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican State&quot;/&gt;

The military defence of the Vatican City is provided by Italy and its [[Military of Italy|armed forces]], given the fact that Vatican City is an enclave within the [[Italy|Italian Republic]]. Vatican City has no armed force of its own, the [[Swiss Guard]] being a corps responsible for the security of the Pope.

===Foreign relations===
{{See also|Foreign relations of the Holy See}}
Vatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into [[treaty|international agreements]] in its regard. The Vatican City State thus has no diplomatic service of its own. Because of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies.

Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.

The size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukinholysee.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/news/2007/4485113/gregorian The Holy See and Diplomacy], ''[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See.

These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status.

They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:&lt;ref name=Participation&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/Internationalrelations/Participation_with_international_Organizations.htm Vatican City State: Participation in International Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also appendix at end of [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_20010123_holy-see-relations_en.html Bilateral Relations of the Holy See]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Vatican City}}

The Vatican City State budget&lt;ref&gt;This is distinct from the budget of the Holy See, which is supported financially by a variety of sources, including investments, real estate income, and donations from Catholic individuals, dioceses, and institutions; these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic missions, and media outlets. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.&lt;/ref&gt; includes the [[Vatican museums]] and post office and is supported financially by the sale of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Vatican City|stamps]], [[Vatican euro coins|coins]], medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales. The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;economy factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vt.html|title=Holy See (Vatican City): Economy|work=CIA – The World Factbook|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms.

The [[Institute for Works of Religion]], also known as the Vatican Bank, and with the acronym IOR (''Istituto per le Opere di Religione''), is a bank situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has an [[automated teller machine|ATM]] with instructions in [[Latin]], possibly the only such ATM in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinalseansblog.org/?p=232|title=A Glimpse Inside the Vatican &amp; Msgr.

Vatican City [[Vatican euro coins|issues its own coins]]. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/CE). Euro coins and notes were introduced in 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue [[euro banknotes]]. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/l25040_en.htm|title=Agreements on monetary relations (Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican and Andorra)|accessdate=23 February 2007|work=Activities of the European Union: Summaries of legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/604/100.php|title=Benedict Vatican euros set for release|accessdate=23 February 2007|work=Catholic News|date=21 April 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own [[Vatican lira]] currency, which was on par with the Italian [[lira]].

The Vatican City State, which employs nearly 2000 people, had a surplus of 6.7&amp;nbsp;million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15&amp;nbsp;million euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue6216.html Christian Telegraph: Holy See's budget shortfall shrinks in 2008.] The report quoted deals mainly with the revenues and expenses of the Holy See and mentions only briefly the finances of Vatican City.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the U.S. State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Pullella, Philip.

==Demographics==
===Population and languages===
[[File:0 Chapelle Sixtine - Palais du Belvédère et Musées du Vatican.JPG|thumb|[[Vatican Museums]]]]
{{main|Languages of Vatican City}}
Almost all of Vatican City's 826 (2009 est.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vt.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Holy See (Vatican City) |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; citizens either live inside the Vatican's walls or serve in the Holy See's [[List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See|diplomatic service]] in embassies (called &quot;[[Apostolic Nunciature|nunciatures]]&quot;; a papal ambassador is a &quot;nuncio&quot;) around the world. The Vatican citizenry consists almost entirely of two groups: clergy, most of whom work in the service of the Holy See, and a very few as officials of the state; and the Swiss Guard. Most of the 2,400 lay workers who comprise the majority of the Vatican workforce reside outside the Vatican and are citizens of Italy, while a few are citizens of other nations. As a result, all of the City's actual citizens are Catholic as are all the [[Place of worship|places of worship]].

[[File:Seal of the State of Vatican City.png|thumb|250px|right|The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.]]
Vatican City has no formally enacted [[official language]], but, unlike the Holy See, which most often uses [[Latin]] for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican City State appendix to the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] is entirely in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages, German, French, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] or Italian. Vatican City's official website languages are Italian, English, French, German, and Spanish. (This site should not be confused with that of the Holy See, which uses all these languages, along with Portuguese, with [[Latin]] since 9 May 2008 and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] since 18 March 2009.)

===Citizenship===
====Pre-March 2011====
Unlike [[citizenship]] of other states, which is based either on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on ''[[jus soli]]'' (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted ''jus officii'', namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is extended also to the spouse, parents and descendants of a citizen, provided they are living with the person who is a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,VAT,3ae6b52f10,0.html |title=Law on Citizenship and Residence, 7 June 1992 |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=7 June 1992 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadinanza_it.html |title=Cittadinanza vaticana |publisher=Vatican.va |date=31 December 2001 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an [[Italian citizenship|Italian citizen]] as judged by Italian law.&lt;ref name='treaty'/&gt;

As of 31 December 2005, there were, apart from the Pope himself, 557 people with Vatican citizenship, while there were 246 residents in the state who did not have its citizenship.

Of the 557 citizens, 74% were clergy:
* 58 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], resident in Rome, mostly outside the Vatican;
* 293 clergy, members of the Holy See's diplomatic missions, resident in other countries, and forming well over half the total of the citizens;
* 62 other clergy, working but not necessarily living in the Vatican.

The 101 members of the [[Swiss Guard|Papal Swiss Guard]] constituted 18% of the total, and there were only 43 other lay persons with Vatican citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadini-vaticani_en.html|title=Vatican citizenship|accessdate=3 December 2006|publisher=Holy See Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-February 2011====
On 22 February 2011, Pope Benedict XVI promulgated a new &quot;Law concerning citizenship, residency and access&quot; to Vatican City, which became effective on 1 March. It replaced the 1929 &quot;Law concerning citizenship and residence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law on Citizenship, Residency and Access to the Vatican|date=1 March 2011|publisher=VIS – Vatican Information Service|url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.com/2011/03/law-on-citizenship-residency-and-access.html|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 16 articles in the new law, whereas the old law had 33 articles.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Now Allows for Vatican Residents: 1929 Code Replaced|date=2 March 2011|publisher=Innovative Media, Inc.|work=ZENIT|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-31900?l=english|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican citizenship now has four categories: (1) the pope, (2) cardinals residing in Vatican City, (3) active members of the Holy See's diplomatic corps, and (4) other directors of Vatican offices and services.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt; The new law created a new status, that of official Vatican &quot;residents&quot;, i.e., people who live in Vatican City but are not citizens.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt; As of 1 March 2011, the Vatican had 572 citizens, but only 220 of them were living in Vatican City.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt; The other 352 citizens were [[apostolic nuncio]]s and diplomatic staff.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt; The 220 citizens living in Vatican City were among more than 800 people living in the Vatican.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt;

{{Main|Culture of Vatican City}}
Vatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. [[St. Peter's Basilica]], whose successive architects include [[Bramante]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Giacomo della Porta]], [[Carlo Maderno|Maderno]] and [[Bernini]], is a renowned work of [[Renaissance architecture]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is famous for its frescos, which include works by [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] as well as the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|ceiling]] and [[Last Judgement]] by [[Michelangelo]]. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include [[Raphael]] and [[Fra Angelico]].

The [[Vatican Library]] and the collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance. In 1984, the Vatican was added by [[UNESCO]] to the List of [[World Heritage Site]]s; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/286 |title=Vatican City – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=whc.unesco.org |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a ''centre containing monuments'' in the &quot;International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection&quot; according to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;/&gt;

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Vatican City}}
Vatican City has a reasonably well developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a plaza and walkways). As a country that is 1.05&amp;nbsp;kilometres (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi) long and 0.85&amp;nbsp;kilometres (0.5&amp;nbsp;mi) wide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/sp_ss_scv_info-generale_en.html|title=Holy See – State of the Vatican City|publisher=Vatican Papal Conclave|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has a small [[Transport network|transportation system]] with no airports or highways. There is one [[heliport]] and a [[standard gauge]] [[rail transport in Vatican City|railway]] connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an {{Convert|852|m|yd|adj=mid|-long}} spur, only {{Convert|300|m|yd|}} of which is within Vatican territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinfin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinfin.net/railways/world/vatican/vaticanrail.html#Origini Vatican City State Railway|title=Railways of the World|publisher=Sinfin.net|accessdate=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John XXIII]] was the first Pope to make use of this railway, and [[Pope John Paul II]] used it as well, albeit very rarely. The railway is mainly used to transport freight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinfin&quot;/&gt; As Vatican City has no airports (it is one of the few [[List of countries without an airport|independent states]] in the world without one, except for the aforementioned heliport), it is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, namely: [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport]] and to a lesser extent, [[Rome Ciampino Airport|Ciampino Airport]], both of which serve as the departure gateway for the Pope's international visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinfin&quot;/&gt;

===Communications===
The City &lt;!-- Referring to Vatican City, not city. Do not decapitalise. --&gt; is served by an independent, modern telephone system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20631 On call 24/7: Vatican phone system directs thousands of call each day], 24 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vatican Pharmacy]], and post office. The [[Mail|postal system]] was founded on 11 February 1929, and two days later became operational. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the [[Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanphilately.org/vc.htm|title=The Early Definitives|publisher=Vatican Philatelic Society|accessdate=28 November 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071211191109/http://www.vaticanphilately.org/vc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City's [[Mail|postal service]] is sometimes recognised as &quot;the best in the world&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CEFDE1738F934A15755C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Vatican%20City|title=Hail Marys Not Needed: Vatican Mail Will Deliver|work=New York Times |accessdate=28 November 2007 |first=Al |last=Baker |date=27 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mail has been noted to get to its target before the postal service in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;

The Vatican also controls its own Internet [[Top-level domain|TLD]], which is registered as ([[.va]]). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio [[ITU prefix]], HV, and this is sometimes used by [[amateur radio]] operators.

[[Vatican Radio]], which was organised by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], broadcasts on [[Shortwave|short-wave]], [[Medium wave|medium-wave]] and FM frequencies and on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/radio/index.htm |title=Vatican Radio – Index |publisher=Vatican.va |date=2 September 2005 |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory. Television services are provided through another entity, the [[Vatican Television Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/television/index.htm |title=Vatican Television Center – Index |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Roman Catholic laymen but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', the [[Gazette|official gazette]] of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.

Vatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the [[Annuario Pontificio]], which places them in the section &quot;Institutions linked with the Holy See&quot;, ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the [[Diplomatic corps|Diplomatic Corps]] accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.

==Crime==
{{Main|Crime in Vatican City}}

In accordance with Article 22 of the 1929 [[Lateran Treaty]] between the Holy See and Italy, the [[Politics of Italy|Italian government]], when requested by the Holy See, handles the prosecution and detention of criminal suspects, at the expense of the Vatican.&lt;ref name='treaty'/&gt; Capital punishment was envisaged in the legislation adopted in 1929 on the basis of Italian law, but the Vatican state never exercised it and abolished it in 1969.
