      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36085">: ''For the general identity of an individual with certain core essential religious doctrines, see [[Christianity]]''.
'''Christian Identity''' is a label applied to a wide variety of loosely affiliated believers and [[church (building)|church]]es with a [[white supremacist]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eck |first=Diane |year=2001 |authorlink=Diana L. Eck|title=A New Religious America: How a &quot;Christian Country&quot; has become the world’s most religiously diverse nation |location=New York: |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buck|first=Christopher|title=Religious Myths and Visions of America: How Minority Faiths Redefined America's World Role|year=2009|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0313359590|pages=107, 108, 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most promote a [[racist]] interpretation of [[Christianity]].

According to Chester L. Quarles, professor of criminal justice at the [[University of Mississippi]], some of the Christian Identity movement's followers hold that non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] peoples have no [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, and can therefore never earn God's favor or be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quarles|first=Chester L.|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2004|location= |page=68|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=r5BzY2eeyngC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22christian+identity%22+%22no+soul%22+pre-adamic&amp;num=100|doi= |isbn=978-0-7864-1892-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Carol|title=Killing for Life: The Apocalyptic Narrative of Pro-Life Politics|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801488191|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in the theology affirm that [[Jesus Christ]] paid only for the sins of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|House of Israel]] and the [[House of Judah]] and that salvation must be received through both redemption and race.

In many variations of Christian Identity thought, a key commonality is [[British Israelism]], which teaches that many white Europeans are the literal descendants of the [[Israelite]]s through the [[Ten Lost Tribes|ten tribes]] which were taken away into captivity by the armies of [[Assyria]]. Christian Identity asserts ''in addition'' that these (White European) Israelites are still God's Chosen People, that Jesus was an Israelite of the [[tribe of Judah]], and that modern [[Jew]]s are not at all Israelites nor [[Hebrew]]s, but are instead descended from people with [[Turkic peoples|Turco]]-[[Mongols|Mongolian]] blood, or [[Khazar]]s, or are descendants of the biblical [[Esau]]-Edom, who traded his birthright for a bowl of red stew (Genesis 25:29–34).

{{quote|Modern Identity Christianity evolved from the nineteenth-century doctrine of British Israelism. The ideological transformations that would arise from a theology originally ''favorable'' to the Jews into the [[racism|racist]] and [[anti-Semitic]] doctrines of Christian Identity took place in the [[interwar years]] of the twentieth century....While it is impossible to locate the precise moment at which modern Identity Christianity was born, several key events are particularly notable. A 1930 Bible conference brought together a number of leading American British Israelites, including [[Howard Rand]], the head of the [[Anglo-Saxon Federation of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Encyclopedia of white power: a sourcebook on the radical racist right|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2000|location= |page=68|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=nNWbbhUYv8oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|doi=  |isbn= 0-7425-0340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Christian Identity movement first received widespread attention by mainstream media in 1984, when the [[white nationalist]] organization known as [[The Order (group)|The Order]] embarked on a murderous crime spree before being taken down by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. [[Tax resister]] and [[militia movement]] organizer [[Gordon Kahl]], whose death in a 1983 shootout with authorities helped inspire The Order, also had connections to the Christian Identity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/Ext_US/SCM.asp |title=Sovereign Citizen Movement - Extremism in America |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DE163FF932A1575BC0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|work=The New York Times|first=Wayne|last=King|accessdate=April 30, 2010|title=Books of The Times; A Farmer's Fatal Obsession With Jews and Taxes|date=August 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement returned to public attention in 1992 and 1993, in the wake of the deadly [[Ruby Ridge]] confrontation, when newspapers discovered that former [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] and [[right-wing]] separatist [[Randy Weaver]] had at least a loose association with Christian Identity believers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/9310/fe.bock.shtml Reason Magazine – Ambush at Ruby Ridge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

No single document expresses the Christian Identity belief system; however, adherents draw upon arguments from linguistic, historical, archaeological and [[Bible|biblical]] sources to support their beliefs. Estimates are that these groups have 2,000 to 50,000 members in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barkun|first=Michael|year=1996|title= Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement|pages=x|chapter=preface|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-4638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an unknown number in [[Canada]] and the rest of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]].

Christian Identity believers reject the beliefs of most contemporary Christian denominations. They claim that modern Christian churches are teaching a [[heresy]]: the belief that God's promises to [[Israel]] (through [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]) have been expanded to create a spiritual people of &quot;Israel&quot;, which constitutes the Christian &quot;Church&quot;. In turn, most modern Christian denominations and organizations denounce Christian Identity as heresy and condemn the use of the Christian [[Bible]] as a basis for promoting white supremacy and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]. Adherents of Christian Identity claim that Europeans are the true descendants of the biblical [[Jacob]], hence they are the true Israel, and that it is those who are against the interests of European-descended Christians that are the true anti-Semites.

==Origins==
Christian Identity (CI) emerged as an offshoot sect from [[British Israelism]] in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Religion and the racist right: the origins of the Christian Identity movement'', Michael Barkun, 1997, Preface, xii, xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Christian_Identity.asp?xpicked=4&amp;item=Christian_ID |title=Christian Identity |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to British Israelism===
Paradoxically, while early British Israelites such as [[Edward Hine]] and [[John Wilson (historian)|John Wilson]] were [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semites]], Christian Identity emerged in sharp contrast to be strongly [[anti-semitic]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as an 'ugly turn':

{{quote|An Ugly Turn - Once on American shores, British-Israelism began to evolve. Originally, believers viewed contemporary Jews as descendants of those ancient Israelites who had never been &quot;lost.&quot; They might be seen critically but, given their significant role in the British-Israel genealogical scheme, not usually with animosity. By the 1930s, however, in the U.S., a strain of anti-Semitism started to permeate the movement (though some maintained traditional beliefs - and a small number of traditionalists still exist in the U.S.)&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;}}

Another source describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as a 'remarkable transition', also noting that traditional British Israelites were advocates of [[Philo-Semitism]] which paradoxically changed to [[antisemitism]] and [[racism]] under Christian Identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Identity: the Aryan American bloodline religion'' By Chester L. Quarles, 2004, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[British Israelism]] itself had several Jewish members and it received support from [[rabbi]]s throughout the 19th century and within British politics it supported [[Benjamin Disraeli]] who was descended from [[Sephardic]] [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, pp. 13-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life From The Dead'', 1875, Vol. III, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christian Identity which emerged in the 1920s, began to be antisemitic teaching that the Jews are not descended from the [[tribe of Judah]] (as British Israelites maintain) but are instead descended from Satan or Edomite-[[Khazars]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 62-97.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Israel form of the belief held no anti-Semitism, its followers instead held the view that Jews made up a minority of the tribes of Israel (Judah and Benjamin), with the British and other related Northern European peoples making up the remainder.

===Early years===
Christian Identity (CI) has first been traced back to the 1920s to [[Howard Rand]] (1889–1991).&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement, Charles H. Roberts, 2003, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand was a Massachusetts lawyer who obtained a law degree at the University of Maine. He was raised as a British Israelite, and his father introduced him to [[J. H. Allen]]'s work ''Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright'' (1902) at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;''Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement'', Charles H. Roberts, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; While Rand's father was not an antisemite, nor was even Rand in his early British Israelite years, Rand first added to British Israelism in the 1920s an antisemitic element. He claimed as early as 1924 that the Jews were not really descended from the [[tribe of Judah]], but were instead the descendants of [[Esau]] or [[Canaanites]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 45-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand never though claimed that modern Jews were descendants of Satan, or were in anyway inferior, just that they were not the true lineal descendants of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Rand is considered a 'transitional' figure between British Israelism and Christian Identity, but not its actual founder.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Roberts, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; However Rand first coined the term 'Christian Identity'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phinehas Priesthood: Violent Vanguard of the Christian Identity Movement'', Danny W. Davis, 2010, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Rand had set up the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America in 1933 which promoted his view that Jews were not from Judah, which marked the first key transition of British Israelism to Christian Identity. Beginning in May 1937 there were key meetings between British Israelites in America who were attracted to Rand’s new theory that the Jews were not really from Judah. This provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of Christian Identity, and by the late 1930s the Jews were considered to be the offspring of Satan and were heavily demonised, as were non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] races.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Roberts, pp. 11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Dudley Pelley]], founder of the fascist [[Silver Shirts]] movement, also promoted an anti-semitic form of British Israelism in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lobb, David. 'Fascist Apocalypse: William Pelley and Millennial Extremism', Paper presented at the 4th Annual Conference of the Center for Millennial Studies, November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Links between Christian Identity and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] also emerged in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 60-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key developers===
[[Wesley Swift]] (1913–1970) is considered by the [[FBI]] to have been the single most significant figure in the early years of the Christian Identity movement. Swift was born in [[New Jersey]], and eventually moved to [[Los Angeles]] in order to attend Bible college. It is claimed that he may have been a &quot;[[Ku Klux Klan]] organizer and a Klan rifle-team instructor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuban-exile.com/doc_026-050/doc0046.html Christian Defense League by D. Boylan 2004 Revision&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he founded his own church in [[Lancaster, California]]. In the 1950s, he was [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]'s West Coast representative of the [[Christian Nationalist Crusade]]. In addition, he had a daily radio broadcast in [[California]] during the 1950s and 60s, through which he was able to proclaim his ideology to a large audience. With Swift's efforts, the message of his church spread, leading to the creation of similar churches throughout the country. In 1957, the name of his church was changed to The Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which is used today by [[Aryan Nations]] (AN) churches. One of Swift's associates was retired Col. [[William Potter Gale]] (1917–1988). Gale had apparently been an aide to General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and had coordinated guerrilla resistance in the [[Philippines]] during [[World War II]]. Gale became a leading figure in the [[Tax protester (United States)|anti-tax]] and [[paramilitary]] movements of the 1970s and 80s, beginning with the [[California Rangers]] and the [[Posse Comitatus (U.S. movement)|Posse Comitatus]], and helping to found the [[militia movement]]. Numerous Christian Identity churches preach similar messages and some espouse more violent rhetoric than others, but all hold to the belief that [[Aryan]]s are [[God]]'s chosen race. Gale introduced future [[Aryan Nations]] founder [[Richard Girnt Butler]] to Swift. Until then, Butler had admired [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] and Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], and had been relatively secular. Swift quickly converted him to Christian Identity. When Swift died, Butler took over the Church, to the apparent dismay of both Gale and Swift's family. Neither Butler nor Gale were anything like the dynamic orator that Swift had been, and attendance dwindled under the new pastor. Butler eventually renamed the organisation &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations&quot; and moved it to [[Hayden Lake, Idaho]].

Lesser luminaries were also present as Christian Identity theology took shape in the 1940s and 1950s, such as [[Baptist]] minister and California [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] [[San Jacinto Capt]] (who claimed that he had introduced Wesley Swift to Christian Identity), and one-time [[San Diego]] Deputy City Attorney (and lawyer for [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]) [[Bertrand Comparet]] (1901–1983).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/who-deny/who-deny4.html&lt;/ref&gt; But for the most part, today's Christian Identity groups seem to have been spawned by Wesley Swift, through his lieutenants William Potter Gale and Richard Butler.

==Ideology, tenets and beliefs==
Christian Identity asserts that the white people of [[Europe]] or Caucasians in general are God's servant people according to the promises that were given to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. It further asserts that the early European tribes were really the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israel]] and therefore the rightful heirs to God's promises, and God's chosen people.

===Two House Theology===
Like British Israelites, Christian Identity (CI) adherents believe in [[Two House Theology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles H. Roberts, pp.40-60&quot;&gt;Charles H. Roberts, pp.40-60&lt;/ref&gt; However the major difference between British Israelism and CI is that British Israelites have always maintained that Jews are descended from the [[tribe of Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, F. E, ''The Bible Distinction Between the House of Israel and the House of Judah'', Radio Address, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, while also maintaining a Two House distinction, Christian Identity proponents believe that the true lineal descendants of Judah are ''not'' contemporary Jews, but instead White Europeans who settled mainly in Scotland, Germany, and other European nations, alongside the [[House of Israel]].  They are Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Germanic, Nordic, and kindred peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles H. Roberts, pp.40-60&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/BasicIdentity1 |title=BASIC CHRISTIAN IDENTITY : Dr. Wesley A. Swift : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some CI scholars teach that many contemporary Jews are the descendants of [[Cain]], citing [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;c=3&amp;v=15&amp;t=KJV#15 Gen. 3:12],[http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Jhn&amp;c=8&amp;v=44&amp;t=KJV#44 John 8:44] and [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Jo&amp;c=3&amp;t=KJV#12 1 John 3:12]) in support of their position and that Cain was the spawn of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://study.faithweb.com/study/Serpentseed.html Jewish Rabbis recognize Serpent Seedline as well as Sumerians, Targums and Biblical Accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin beliefs===

Identity teaches that &quot;Israel&quot; was the name given to [[Jacob]] after battling the angel at Peniel in {{bibleverse||Genesis|32:26-32|KJV}}. &quot;Israel&quot; then had twelve sons, which began the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}} In 975 B.C. the ten northern tribes revolted, seceded from the south, and became the [[Kingdom of Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}} After being subsequently conquered by [[Assyria]], the ten tribes disappear from Biblical record, becoming the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}}

According to Identity doctrine, {{bibleverse|2|Esdras|13:39-46|NRSV}} then records the history of the nation of Israel journeying over the [[Caucasus mountains]], along the [[Black Sea]], to the [[Siret River|Ar Sereth]] tributory of the [[Danube]] in [[Romania]] (&quot;But they formed this plan for themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the nations and go to a more distant region, where no human beings had ever lived... Through that region there was a long way to go, a journey of a year and a half; and that country is called Arzareth&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}} The tribes prospered, and eventually colonised other European countries. Israel's leading tribe, the [[Tribe of Dan]], is attributed with settling and naming many areas which are today distinguised by place names derived from its name - written ancient Hebrew contains no vowels, and hence &quot;Dan&quot; would be written as DN, but would be pronounced with an intermediate vowel dependent on the local dialect, meaning that ''Dan'', ''Den'', ''Din'', ''Don'', and ''Dun'' all have the same meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}} Various modern place names are said to derive from the name of this tribe:&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}}

* [[Macedonia]] - Mace''don''ia - derived from Moeshe-don-ia (Moeshe being &quot;the land of Moses&quot;)
* [[Danube]] - ''Dan''-ube,  [[Dneister]] - ''Dn''-eister, [[Dneiper]] - ''Dn''-eiper, [[Donetz]] - ''Don''-etz, [[Danzig]] - ''Dan''-zig, [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] - ''Don''

Some followers claim that the Identity genealogy of the [[Davidic line]] can be traced from its beginnings right down to the Royal rulers of Britain and [[Queen Elizabeth]] herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|102-105}} Thus [[Anglo-Saxons]] are the true [[Israelites]], God's chosen people who were given the divine right to rule the world until the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|101}}

===Adamites and pre-Adamites===
A major tenet of Christian Identity is [[Pre-Adamism]]. Christian Identity followers believe that [[Adam and Eve]] are ancestors of [[White people|whites]] alone, and that that Adam and Eve were preceded by [[lesser race|lesser]], non-Caucasian races often (though not always) identified as &quot;beasts of the field&quot; (Gen. 1:25); for example, the &quot;beasts&quot; which wore sackcloth and cried unto God ({{bibleref|Jonah|3:8|ESV}}) are identified with [[Black people|the black races]] by Christian Identity adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Roberts, pp.23-60&lt;/ref&gt; To support their theory on the racial identity of Adam, Christian Identity proponents point out that the Hebrew etymology of the word 'Adam' translates as 'be ruddy, red, to show blood (in the face)' often quoting from [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]]'s ''Hebrew Dictionary'' #119 (1890) and from this conclude that only Caucasians or people with light white skin can blush or turn rosy in the face (because [[hemoglobin]] only appears under pale skin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxonisrael.com/docBibStudies/KingdomBasics.html |title=Basics for Understanding Yahweh's Kingdom |publisher=Anglo-Saxon Israel |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of Christian Identity believe that Adam was only created 6,000 years ago, while the other non-Caucasian races were created during far older epochs that occurred on the other continents.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;churchoftrueisrael.com&quot;&gt;http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/verboten/vb-02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Dual Seedliner&quot; Christian Identity proponents&amp;mdash;those who believe that [[serpent seed|Eve begat children by Satan]] as well as Adam&amp;mdash;believe that Eve was seduced by the Snake (Satan), shared her fallen state with Adam by lying with him, and gave birth to twins with different fathers: Satan's child [[Cain]] and Adam's son [[Abel]]. Cain then became the progenitor of the [[Jew]]s in his subsequent matings with the non-Adamic races. This is referred to as the [[two-seedline]] doctrine. This doctrine is a revival of a medieval folk belief ascribing the ancestry of legendary monsters such as [[Grendel]] to Cain.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive1&quot;/&gt;

A seminal influence on the Christian Identity movement's views on pre-Adamism was a book published in 1900 by [[Charles Carroll (racist)|Charles Carroll]] entitled ''The Negro a Beast or In the Image of God?''. Carroll concludes in the book that the [[White race]] was made in the image and likeness of God and that Adam gave birth to the White race only, while [[Negro]]s are pre-Adamite beasts and could not have possibly been made in God's image and likeness because they are beastlike, immoral and ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Carroll The negro a beast&quot;; or, &quot;In the image of God&quot;; the reasoner of the age, the revelator of the century! The Bible as it is! The negro and his relation to the human family! The negro not the son of Ham, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races such as blacks did not have souls. Carroll believed that race mixing was an insult to God and spoiled God's racial plan of creation. According to Carroll the mixing of races had also lead to the errors of [[atheism]] and [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creationism===
Christian Identity proponents are [[Old Earth creationism|Old Earth Creationists]], but believe that Adamic man (who they believe was the father of the white race or [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]) was only created around 6,000 years ago, while they also believe that the Universe, Earth is billions of years old and that non-Caucasian races were created hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;churchoftrueisrael.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Wesley Swift]] strongly criticised Young Earth Creationism and the traditional Judeo-Christian view that Noah's flood was global, but instead believed that the flood was only local and that the Earth was billions of years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive1&quot;/&gt; Christian Identity adherents claim that the flood in Genesis only rose high enough to drown the region of the [[Tarim Basin]] below sea level (Gen. 7:20) and that therefore the Hebrew word &quot;eretz&quot; which appears in those verses should be rendered &quot;the land&quot; (as in a specific place) rather than &quot;the earth.&quot;{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Racialism===
Racialism, or race based philosophy is the core tenet of Christian Identity, and most CI adherents are White Nationalists or support [[racial segregation]]. Some believe that Jews are genetically compelled by their Satanic or Edomite ancestry to carry on a conspiracy against the Adamic seedline and today have achieved almost complete control of the Earth through their illegitimate claim to the white race's status as God's chosen people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/who-are-jews.html WHO ARE THE JEWS? By: Bertrand Comparet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, Christian Identity followers adhere to the traditional orthodox Christian views on the role of women, [[abortion]], and [[homosexuality]], and view racial [[miscegenation]] as a sin and a violation of God's laws as dictated in Genesis of &quot;kind after kind&quot; (Ex. 21:22, Lev. 20:13).

In addition to their strict fundamentalist racial views Christian Identity adherents distinguish themselves from mainstream [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Fundamentalism]] in various areas of theology. Some Christian Identity adherents follow the Mosaic law of the [[Old Testament]] (e.g., dietary restrictions, the [[seventh-day Sabbath]], certain annual festivals such as [[Passover]]). It is also commonplace for adherents to follow the [[Sacred Name Movement]] and they insist on using the original Hebrew names when referring to God (Yahweh) and Jesus Christ (Yahshua). Some Christian Identity writers criticize modern Bible editions as well as the Jews for the removal of the original Hebrew name of God from the Bible. Although their adherence to Old Testament Mosaic law may make them appear &quot;Jewish&quot;; they claim that the Jewish interpretation of the law has been corrupted through the Jews' [[Talmud]]. Unlike many Protestant Fundamentalists, Christian Identity adherents reject the notion of a [[Rapture]], believing it to be a Judaized doctrine which the Bible does not teach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/compthief.html I Come As A Thief&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===World's end and Armageddon===
Christian Identity supporters believe in the [[Second Coming]] and [[Armageddon]]. Predictions vary, including race war or a Jewish-backed [[United Nations]] takeover of the USA and endorse physical struggle against what they see as the forces of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|title=Millennial violence: past, present, and future|year=2002|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-5294-8|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qb92tBxVOZgC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Christian+Identity+adherents+believe+in+the+inevitability+of+the+end+of+the+world#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Identity%20adherents%20believe%20in%20the%20inevitability%20of%20the%20end%20of%20the%20world&amp;f=false|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Jew and anti-homosexual===
Identity Christianity asserts that disease, addiction, cancer, and sexual venereal disease (herpes and AIDS) are spread by human &quot;rodents&quot; via contact with &quot;unclean&quot; persons, such as through &quot;race-mixing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|85}} The [[1 Enoch|first book of Enoch]] is used to justify these social theories; the fallen angels of Heaven sexually desired Earth maidens and took them as wives, resulting in the birth of abominations, which God ordered [[Michael the Archangel]] to destroy, thus beginning a cosmic war between Light and Darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|85}} The mixing of separate things (e.g. people of different races) is seen as defiling both, and is against God's will.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|86}}

Identity preachers proclaim that, according to the King James Bible, &quot;the penaltys for race-mixing, homo-sexuality, and usury are death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Righteousness: Idaho Christian Patriotism|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1995|page=86|author=James Alfred Aho|isbn=029597494X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}} The justification for killing homosexuals is provided by {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}} &quot;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.&quot;  {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:21-22|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:35-37|KJV}} and Deuteronomy explicitly condemn usury.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|92}} {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|18-13|KJV}} states &quot;He who hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.&quot; and is quoted as justification for killing Jews, since Jews have traditionally had a large presence in the [[usury]] business.

Identity followers reject the label of &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;, stating that they can't be anti-Semitic, since in fact the true [[Semites]] &quot;today are the great White Christian nations of the western world&quot;, with modern Jews in fact being descendants of the [[Canaanites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;

===Anti-banking system===
Identity doctrine asserts that the &quot;root of all evil&quot; is paper money (in particular [[Federal Reserve Note]]s), and that usury and [[History_of_banking|banking]] systems are controlled by Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|87}} The creation of the [[Federal Reserve Corporation]] in 1913 shifted control of money from Congress to private institutions and violated the Constitution. The money system encourages the [[Federal Reserve]] to take out loans, creating trillions of dollars of government debt and allowing international bankers to control America. Credit/debit cards and computerised bills are seen as the fulfillment of the Biblical scripture warning against &quot;the beast&quot; (i.e. banking) as quoted in {{bibleverse||Rev|13:15-18|KJV}}. Identity preacher Sheldon Emry claims &quot;Most of the owners of the largest banks in America are of Eastern European (Jewish) ancestry and connected with the (Jewish) [[N_M_Rothschild_%26_Sons|Rothschild European banks]]&quot;, thus, in Identity doctrine, the global banking conspiracy is led and controlled by Jewish interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;aho&quot;/&gt;{{rp|91}}

==Groups==
Christian Identity is a major unifying [[theology]] for a number of diverse groups of [[white nationalist]] Christians. It is a belief system that provides its members with a religious basis for racial separatism. [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] is inaccurately described by some of his critics, as well as by supporters of Christian Identity, as having supported Christian Identity, due to his belief in a modified form of British Israelism, and the fact that during his lifetime, he propounded observances favoured by many Christian Identity groups, such as [[seventh-day Sabbatarianism]] and biblical festivals. The [[Worldwide Church of God]] that Armstrong founded did not subscribe to the anti-Semitism commonly espoused by the Christian or Israel Identity groups but instead adhered to the traditional beliefs of British Israelism; i.e., the belief held that modern day Jews were descendants of the [[Tribe of Judah]] whereas the Anglo-Saxons, [[Celts]], Danes, etc. were descendants of the remaining Ten Tribes of Israel formerly known as the Northern Kingdom. Note: the [[LaPorte Church of Christ]] is often mischaracterized as sympathetic to Christian Identity, but the organization explicitly rejects this association.

Christian Identity groups include &quot;[[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]&quot;, the [[Phineas Priesthood]], the [[Oklahoma Constitutional Militia]], also known as [[The Universal Church of God]]. Christian Identity is also related to other groups such as [[Aryan Nations]], the [[Aryan Republican Army]] (ARA) and the [[Patriots Council]], [[Church of Jesus Christ Christian]], [[Thomas Robb]], [[Mission To Israel]], [[Folk And Faith]], [[Jubilee (newspaper)]], [[Yahweh's Truth]] ([[James Wickstrom]]), [[Church of Israel]]&lt;ref name = adl&gt;{{cite web|title=Extremism in America: Dan Gayman|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/gayman.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=gayman|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=16 August 2012|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = jg&gt;Max McCoy, [http://www.gaymangate.com/JoplinGlobe1-28-2001-1.pdf &quot;Separatist by faith: Church of Israel's patriarch rebuts claims of racism&quot;], ''Joplin Globe'', January 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kingdom Identity Ministries]].

South African branches of Christian Identity have been accused of involvement in terrorist activity, including the [[2002 Soweto bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Volk' Faith and Fatherland: The Security Threat Posed by the White Right|author=Martin Schönteich and Henri Boshoff|isbn=1-919913-30-0|publisher=Pretoria, South Africa, Institute for Security Studies|year=2003|url=http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aryan Nations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
The [[Aryan Nations]] (AN) is a group that adheres to the Christian Identity belief system. The group espouses dislike towards Jews, blacks and other minorities, as well as the United States federal government. The original ultimate goal of the AN is to forcibly take five northwestern states – [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Montana]] – from the [[United States government]] in order to establish an Aryan homeland. This particular ideology is known throughout the [[White nationalism#White power|White power]] movement as the [[Northwest Territorial Imperative]]. The AN was headquartered at Hayden Lake, Idaho from the late 1970s until February 2001. Its annual World Congress attracted a number of different factions from the [[far-right]]. The World Congress was a sort of round table to discuss [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialist]] issues. Since the main Aryan Nations property in Idaho was dismantled following a costly lawsuit against the group and the death of Richard Butler, there have been several struggles over control of the movement that are as yet unresolved.
