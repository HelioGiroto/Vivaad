'''Iconoclasm'''&lt;ref&gt;Literally, &quot;image-breaking&quot;, from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:εἰκών|''εἰκών'']] and [[wikt:κλάω|''κλάω'']]}}. ''Iconoclasm'' may be also considered as a [[back-formation]] from iconoclast (from Greek ''εἰκοκλάστης''). The corresponding Greek word for iconoclasm is ''εἰκονοκλασία – eikonoklasia''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate destruction of [[religion|religious]] [[icon]]s and other symbols or monuments, usually with [[religious]] or political motives.  It is a frequent component of major political or religious changes. The term encompasses the more specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (''[[damnatio memoriae]]''), for example, following [[Akhenaten]]'s death in [[Ancient Egypt]].

People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called &quot;iconoclasts&quot;, a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any individual who challenges established dogma or conventions. Conversely, people who revere or venerate religious images are (by iconoclasts) called &quot;iconolaters&quot;. In a Byzantine context, they are known as &quot;[[iconodule]]s&quot;, or &quot;iconophiles&quot;.

Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. In Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by people who adopt a literal interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the making and worshipping of &quot;graven images or any likeness of anything&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them. . . .&quot; (Exodus 20:4-5a, ESV.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree of iconoclasm among Christian sects has varied greatly.

==Major instances==
*In [[Judaism]], King [[Hezekiah]] purged [[Solomon's Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Land of Israel]] of figures, including the [[Nehushtan]], as recorded in the [[Books of Kings|Second Book of Kings]]. His reforms were reversed in the reign of his son [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]].
*A Midrash included in Genesis Rabba attributes a major act of iconoclasm to Abraham. Although not attested in the Biblical account of the Partriarch's life, it became an important aspect of Abraham's character in later Jewish tradition.
*During [[Constantinian shift|the process of Christianisation]] under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], groups destroyed the images and sculptures expressive of the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[polytheist]] state religion.
*The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] had a period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] during the late medieval years, in which some groups destroyed the church's religious imagery.
*During the rule of [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in [[Florence]] between 1494 and 1497, the [[Bonfire of the Vanities]] took place. Books, works of art, mirrors, cosmetics, sculptures, gaming tables, chess pieces,         musical instruments, fine dresses and women’s hats were burnt in public view.
*When Spanish and Portuguese Christians took control of Iberia, they built churches over mosques and destroyed other imagery of Islam.
*[[Shahjahan]] during his rule destroyed hundreds of Hindu temples.
*[[Muhammad of Ghor]] destoyed several Hindu temples and relics and looted the temple wealth.
*During the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[European wars of religion]], known as the [[Beeldenstorm]] in the Netherlands, [[Protestant]]s destroyed [[Catholic Church|traditional]] (by then considered Catholic) imagery in churches, including paintings, sculptures and other representations.  In some instances, Protestants destroyed the imagery of other Protestants.
*Most of the [[moai]] of [[Easter Island]] were [[History_of_Easter_Island#The_.22statue-toppling.22|toppled during the 18th century]] in the iconoclasm of civil wars.
*Most of the Polytheistic religious deities and texts of Pre-Western Americas, Oceania, and Africa, were destroyed by Christian missionaries and their converts.
*During the [[French Revolution]], people widely destroyed religious and monarchical imagery.
*During and after the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery took place, as well as destruction of imagery related to [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Czar]].
*During and after the [[Communist]] overthrow of the monarchy in China, as well as during the later [[Cultural Revolution]], there was widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery in China, including in [[Tibet]].
*After the [[Second Vatican Council]] in the late twentieth century, some Roman Catholic parish churches [[Wreckovation|discarded]] much of their traditional imagery, art, and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sthughofcluny.org/2011/02/hetzendorf-and-the-iconoclasm-in-the-second-half-of-the-20th-century.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] in [[Stalin Monument (Budapest)|Budapest]], and through the [[fall of Communism]] in 1989, protesters often attacked and took down sculptures and images of [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auyezov|first=Olzhas|title=Ukraine says blowing up Stalin statue was terrorism|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/05/us-ukraine-stalin-idUSTRE7043D920110105|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine iconoclasm==
{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}
[[File:Seventh ecumenical council (Icon).jpg|thumb|250px|An [[icon]] of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] (17th century, [[Novodevichy Convent]], Moscow).]]

In the [[Byzantine Empire]], iconoclasm began with Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]]. The religious conflict created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society.  It was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford History of Byzantium,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; who had to deal frequently with raids from Arab lands.{{clarify|date=March 2012}}  On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of Constantinople, and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces, strongly opposed iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Byzantine Empire, which included both Christians and Muslims, the government had likely been adopting Christian images more frequently. One notable change came in 695, when [[Justinian II]]'s government added a full-face image of Christ on the [[obverse]] of imperial gold coins.  The change caused the [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] to stop his earlier adoption of Byzantine coin types.  He started a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC&quot;&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', 1985, George Philip, London, ISBN 0-540-01085-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter by the patriarch Germanus written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that &quot;now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter&quot; but there is little written evidence of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;C Mango, &quot;Historical Introduction&quot;, in Bryer &amp; Herrin, eds., ''Iconoclasm'', pp. 2-3., 1977, Centre for Byzantine Studies, [[University of Birmingham]], ISBN 0-7044-0226-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first iconoclastic period: 730–787===
[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&amp;Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG Byzantine iconoclasm]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Sometime between 726 and 730, the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] began the iconoclast campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ordered the removal of an image of [[Jesus]] prominently placed over the [[Chalke]] gate, the ceremonial entrance to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], and its replacement with a cross.  Some of those assigned to the task were murdered by a band of [[iconodules]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theoph1&quot;&gt;see Theophanes, ''Chronographia''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Over the years conflict developed between those who wanted to use the images, claiming that they were &quot;icons&quot; to be &quot;venerated&quot;, and the purists who claimed they were simply idols. [[Pope Gregory III]] &quot;convoked a synod in 730 and formally condemned iconoclasm as heretical and excommunicated its promoters.  The papal letter never reached Constantinople as the messengers were intercepted and arrested in Sicily by the Byzantines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] convened the [[Council of Hieria]] in 754.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinstitute.org/index.php/chm/eighth-century/icons/&lt;/ref&gt; The 338 bishops assembled concluded, &quot;the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation--namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods. . . . If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, etc. . . . let him be anathema.&quot; This Council claimed to be the legitimate &quot;Seventh Ecumenical Council.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Council of Nicaea 787===
{{Main|Second Council of Nicaea}}
In 780, Constantine VI ascended the throne in Constantinople, but being a minor, was managed by his mother Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]].  She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to Pope Hadrian I (772–795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings.  The council was reassembled at Nicaea 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 ... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.
 ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136&quot;&gt;Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J. A., Joannou, P. P., Leonardi, C., and Prodi, P., ''Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils Volume OneNicaea I to Lateran V'', p. 132–136, Sheed &amp; Ward and Georgetown University Press, London and Washington, D.C., [ISBN 0-87840-490-2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; (Note:see &lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136&quot;/&gt; also for the original pretranslation text of this council in Greek and Latin)

===Views in Byzantine iconoclasm===
Accounts of iconoclast arguments are largely found in iconodule writings.  To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:
# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g. painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The &quot;Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum&quot; ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:&lt;ref name=&quot;hieria1&quot;/&gt; {{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters.... If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (χαρακτήρ, ''charaktēr'') of the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be anathema! .... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, let him be anathema!}}
#  For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype – of the same substance – which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life.  Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) &quot;icon&quot; of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.
#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).
#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice. &lt;blockquote&gt;Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin. ... But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil...gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;hieria1&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Epitome of the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 AD |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.html |publisher=[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] |postscript=,}} also available from [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xvi.x.html Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images.

The chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur ([[John of Damascus]]), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and [[Theodore the Studite]], abbot of the [[Stoudios]] monastery in Constantinople.  John declared that he did not venerate matter, &quot;but rather the creator of matter.&quot;  However he also declared, &quot;But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace.&quot;  He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the body and blood of Jesus.

The iconodule response to iconoclasm included:
#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the second person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.
#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons.  Essentially the argument was &quot;all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated.&quot; This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.
#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18–22|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim.
#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''parádosis'', sanctioned in Orthodoxy as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).
#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.
#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.

== Muslim iconoclasm ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Umayyad]] --&gt;
Within [[Muslim history]], the act of removing idols from the [[Ka'ba]] in Mecca is considered by all believers to be of great symbolic and historical importance.

In general, Muslim societies have [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided]] the depiction of living beings (animals and humans) within such sacred spaces as [[mosque]]s and [[madrasah]]s. This opposition to figural representation is not based on the [[Qur'an]], but rather on various traditions contained within the [[Hadith]]. The prohibition of figuration has not always extended to the secular sphere, and a robust tradition of figural representation exists within [[Islamic art|Muslim art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;flood2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flood |first=Finbarr Barry |title=Between cult and culture: Bamiyan, Islamic iconoclasm, and the museum |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=84 |year=2002 |pages=641–659 |doi=10.2307/3177288}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, western authors have tended to perceive &quot;a long, culturally determined, and unchanging tradition of violent iconoclastic acts&quot; within [[Islamic society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;flood2002&quot;/&gt;

=== Start of iconoclasm ===

The first act of Muslim iconoclasm was committed by [[Muslims]] in 630, when the various statues of [[Arabian mythology|Arabian deities]] housed in the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] were destroyed. There is a tradition that Muhammad spared a fresco of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.  A translation of Ishaq's &quot;Sirat Rasul Allah&quot;. | publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Guillaume | first=Alfred | authorlink=Alfred Guillaume | year=1955 | page=552 | isbn=978-0-19-636033-1 | quote=Quraysh had put pictures in the Ka'ba including two of Jesus son of Mary and Mary (on both of whom be peace!). ... The apostle ordered that the pictures should be erased except those of Jesus and Mary. | url=http://www.archive.org/details/IbnIshaq-SiratRasulAllah-translatorA.Guillaume | accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was intended to bring an end to the [[idolatry]] which, in the Muslim view, characterized [[Jahiliyya]].

The destruction of the idols of Mecca did not, however, determine the treatment of other religious communities living under Muslim rule after the expansion of the [[caliphate]]. Most Christians under Muslim rule, for example, continued to produce icons and to decorate their churches as they wished. A major exception to this pattern of tolerance in early Islamic history was the &quot;Edict of Yazīd,&quot; issued by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Yazid II]] in 722–723.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grabar, ''L'iconoclasme byzantin: le dossier archéologique'' (Paris, 1984), 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This edict ordered the destruction of crosses and Christian images within the territory of the caliphate. Researchers have discovered evidence that the order was followed, particularly in present-day [[Jordan]], where [[archaeological]] evidence shows the removal of images from the mosaic floors of some, although not all, of the churches that stood at this time. But, Yazīd's iconoclastic policies were not continued by his successors, and Christian communities of the Levant continued to make icons without significant interruption from the sixth century to the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;G.R.D. King, &quot;Islam, iconoclasm, and the declaration of doctrine&quot;, ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 48 (1985), 276–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical acts of iconoclasm ===

The [[Great Sphinx of Giza#Missing nose and beard|missing nose]] on the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is attributed to iconoclasm by a Sufi Muslim fanatic in the mid-1300s.&lt;ref&gt;[[al-Maqrīzī]], writing in the 15th century, attributes the damage to [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr]], a Sufi Muslim fanatic from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada, in 1378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a religious prohibition against destroying or converting houses of worship,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} certain conquering Muslim armies have used local temples or houses of worship as mosques. An example is [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), which was converted into a mosque in 1453. Most icons were desecrated whilst the rest were covered with plaster. In the 1920s, Hagia Sophia was converted to a museum, and the restoration of the mosaics was undertaken by the American Byzantine Institute beginning in 1932.

[[Image:babri rearview.jpg|285px|right|thumb|A view of the [[Babri Mosque]], pre-1992]]
More dramatic cases of iconoclasm by Muslims are found in parts of India where [[Hindu]] and Buddhist temples were razed and mosques erected in their place (for example, the [[Qutub Complex]] and [[Babri Mosque]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Another notable iconoclast was Mughal ruler [[Aurangzeb]] (reigned 1658–1707), who destroyed the famous Hindu temples at [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Recent events ===

Certain Muslim denominations continue to pursue iconoclastic agendas.  There has been much controversy within Islam over the [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites|recent and apparently on-going destruction of historic sites]] by [[Mecca]]'s [[Wahhabism|Wahhabist]] authorities, prompted by the fear they could become the subject of &quot;[[idolatry]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article304029.ece Independent Newspaper on-line, London, Jan 19, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicamagazine.com/content/view/161/59/ ''Islamica'' Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent act of iconoclasm was the 2001 destruction of the giant [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the then [[Taliban]] government of [[Afghanistan]]. The act generated world-wide protests and was not supported by other Muslim governments and organizations. It was widely perceived in the Western media as a result of the Muslim prohibition against figural decoration. Such an account overlooks &quot;the coexistence between the Buddhas and the Muslim population that marveled at them for over a millennium&quot; before their destruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood2002&quot;/&gt; The Buddhas had twice in the past been attacked by [[Nadir Shah]] and [[Aurengzeb]]. According to the art historian F.B. Flood, analysis of the Taliban's statements regarding the Buddhas suggest that their destruction was motivated more by political than by theological concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood2002&quot;/&gt; Taliban spokespeople have given many different [[Buddhas of Bamyan#Destruction|explanations of the motives]] for the destruction.

In 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoon controversy]] sparked worldwide controversy and rioting. In December 2010, a group of iconoclasts were arrested as they were about to attack the Jyllands-Posten newspaper's office.

During the [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|Tuareg rebellion of 2012]], the radical Islamist militia [[Ansar Dine]] destroyed various ancient [[Sufism|Sufi]] shrines from the 15th and 16th century in the city of [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tharoor |first=Ishaan |title=Timbuktu’s Destruction: Why Islamists Are Wrecking Mali’s Cultural Heritage |url=http://world.time.com/2012/07/02/timbuktus-destruction-why-islamists-are-wrecking-malis-cultural-heritage/ |publisher=TIME |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Destruction of icons in Zurich 1524.jpg|thumb|250px|Destruction of icons in [[Zurich]], 1524.]]
Some of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] reformers, in particular [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven (sculpted) images of God. As a result, individuals attacked statues and images, and others were lost during unauthorised iconoclastic riots. However, in most cases, civil authorities removed images in an orderly manner in the newly reformed Protestant cities and territories of Europe.

Significant iconoclastic riots took place in [[Zurich]] (in 1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), [[Augsburg]] (1537), [[Scotland]] (1559), and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[La Rochelle]] (1562).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ekSkZXXjVWUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA148 Neil Kamil, ''Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life'', p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (now the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of Northern France) were disrupted by widespread Protestant iconoclasm in the summer of 1566. This is called the &quot;[[Beeldenstorm]]&quot; and began with the destruction of the statuary of the Monastery of [[Saint Lawrence]] in [[Steenvoorde]] after a ''&quot;Hagenpreek&quot;'', or field sermon, by Sebastiaan Matte.  

Hundreds of other attacks included the sacking of the Monastery of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] after a sermon by Jacob de Buysere. The ''Beeldenstorm'' marked the start of the [[Eighty Years' War|revolution]] against the Spanish forces and [[Roman Catholic Church|the Catholic Church]].

[[File:Iconoclasm Clocher Saint Barthelemy south side La Rochelle.jpg|thumb|250px|Remains of [[Reformation iconoclasm]], Clocher Saint-Barthélémy, [[La Rochelle]], France.]]
The Iconoclast belief was causing havoc throughout [[Europe]], and in 1523, specifically due to the Swiss reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]], a vast amount of his followers viewed themselves as being involved in a spiritual community that in matters of faith should obey neither the visible Church nor lay authorities. According to author R.W Scribner:&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;&gt;Wallace, Peter George. &quot;Evangelical Movements and Confessions.&quot; The Long European Reformation: Religion, Political Conflict, and the Search for Conformity, 1350-1750. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. 95. Print&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |&quot;Zwingli's attack on images, at the first debate, triggered iconoclastic incidents in [[Zurich]] and the villages under civic jurisdiction that the reformer was unwilling to condone.&quot;  And due to this action of protest against authority, “Zwingli responded with a carefully reasoned treatise that men could not live in society without laws and constraint.”|Wallace,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; pp. 95}}

During the [[English Civil War]], Bishop [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] of [[Norwich]] described the events of 1643 when troops and citizens, encouraged by a Parliamentary ordinance against superstition and [[idolatry]], behaved thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lord what work was here! What clattering of glasses! What beating down of walls! What tearing up of monuments! What pulling down of seats! What wresting out of irons and brass from the windows! What defacing of arms! What demolishing of curious stonework! What tooting and piping upon organ pipes! And what a hideous triumph in the market-place before all the country, when all the mangled organ pipes, vestments, both copes and surplices, together with the leaden cross which had newly been sawn down from the Green-yard pulpit and the service-books and singing books that could be carried to the fire in the public market-place were heaped together.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Foxe-martyrs-iconoclasm-1563.png|thumb|300px|An illustration from a 1563 edition of ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' depicts &quot;The Temple well purged&quot;, &quot;Burning of images&quot;, and &quot;the [[Papist]]s packing away their paltry.&quot;]]
[[William Dowsing]] was commissioned and salaried by the government to tour the towns and villages of [[East Anglia]] to destroy images in churches. His detailed record of his trail of destruction through Suffolk and Cambridgeshire survives:&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowsing&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.archive.org/details/journalofdowsing00whituoft |title=The journal of William Dowsing of Stratford, parliamentary visitor, appointed under a warrant from the Earl of Manchester, for demolishing the superstitious pictures and ornaments of churches &amp;c., within the county of Suffolk, in the years 1643–1644 |year=1885 |last=White |first=C.H.

Protestant Christianity was not uniformly hostile to the use of religious images. [[Martin Luther]], initially hostile, came round to the view that Christians should be free to use religious images as long as they did not worship them in place of God.  Lutheran scholar Jeremiah Ohl writes:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohl|first=Jeremiah F.|series=Memoirs of the Lutheran Liturgical Association|year=1906|pages=83–99|publisher=Lutheran Liturgical Association |location=Pittsburgh|chapter=Art in Worship|volume=2|url=http://www.blc.edu/comm/gargy/gargy1/Memoirs.Volume2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{quote|Zwingli and others for the sake of saving the Word rejected all plastic art; Luther, with an equal concern for the Word, but far more conservative, would have all the arts to be the servants of the Gospel. “I am not of the opinion” said {{interp|Luther}}, “that through the Gospel all the arts should be banished and driven away, as some zealots want to make us believe; but I wish to see them all, especially music, in the service of Him Who gave and created them.” Again he says: “I have myself heard those who oppose pictures, read from my German Bible. … But this contains many pictures of God, of the angels, of men, and of animals, especially in the Revelation of St. John, in the books of Moses, and in the book of Joshua. We therefore kindly beg these fanatics to permit us also to paint these pictures on the wall that they may be remembered and better understood, inasmuch as they can harm as little on the walls as in books. Would to God that I could persuade those who can afford it to paint the whole Bible on their houses, inside and outside, so that all might see; this would indeed be a Christian work. For I am convinced that it is God’s will that we should hear and learn what He has done, especially what Christ suffered. But when I hear these things and meditate upon them, I find it impossible not to picture them in my heart. Whether I want to or not, when I hear, of Christ, a human form hanging upon a cross rises up in my heart: just as I see my natural face reflected when I look into water. Now if it is not sinful for me to have Christ’s picture in my heart, why should it be sinful to have it before my eyes?”|Ohl,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;/&gt; pp. 88–89}}

==Political and revolutionary iconoclasm==
[[File:Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C. ca. 1859.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Sons of Liberty]] pulling down the statue of [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], 1776.]]

Revolutions and changes of regime, whether through uprising of the local population, foreign invasion or a combination of both, are often accompanied by the public destruction of statues and monuments identified with the previous regime. This may also be known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the modern term used to describe the Ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual.  Stricter definitions of &quot;iconoclasm&quot; exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as Revolutionary Russia or Ancient Egypt, this distinction can be hard to make.  Examples of political destruction of images include:

* All public references to the &quot;heretical&quot; [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]] were destroyed soon after his death in about 1334 BC; a very laborious process with stone carved reliefs and inscriptions.

* Several Roman emperors and other political figures were subject to decrees of damnatio memoriae, including [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]].

* During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Sons of Liberty]] pulled down and destroyed the [[Gilding|gilt]] lead statue of [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], melting it down for use as [[Musket#Ammunition|musket balls]] against the British Army.  Similar acts have accompanied the independence of most ex-colonial territories.  Sometimes relatively intact monuments are moved to a collected display in a less prominent place, as in India and also post-Communist countries.

* During the [[French Revolution]], the statue of [[King Louis XV]], in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed. This was a prelude to the guillotining of his successor [[Louis XVI]] in the same site, renamed &quot;Place de la Révolution&quot; (at present [[Place de la Concorde]]).

* The statue of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the column at [[Place Vendôme]], Paris was the target of iconoclasm several times: destroyed after the [[Bourbon Restoration]], restored by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], destroyed during the [[Paris Commune]] and restored  by [[Adolphe Thiers]].

* The [[October Revolution]] in 1917 was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past [[Tsar]]s, as well as Russian [[National emblems of the Russian Empire|Imperial Eagles]], at various locations throughout Russia. &quot;In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground. After a considerable amount of time, the statue was decapitated and its remaining parts were broken into rubble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wharton, &quot;The Hammer and Sickle: The Role of Symbolism and Rituals in the Russian Revolution&quot; [http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]] included [[Cultural_Revolution#Destruction_of_antiques.2C_historical_sites_and_culture|very widespread destruction of historic artworks]] in public places and private collections, whether religious or secular.  Objects in state museums were mostly left intact.

* The fall of Communism in 1989 was followed by destruction or removal of statues of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other Communist leaders in the former Soviet Union. Particularly well-known was the destruction of &quot;[[Felix Dzerzhinsky#Iron Felix|Iron Felix]]&quot;, the statue of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] outside the [[KGB]] headquarters.

==Iconoclasm against Hindus==

[[Mahmud of Ghazni]] was an [[Demography of Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Sultan]] who invaded the Indian subcontinent during the early 11th century. His campaigns across the [[gangetic plains]] are often cited for their iconoclastic plundering and destruction of temples such as those at [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and he looked upon their destruction as an act of ''&quot;[[jihad]]&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Historical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the iconoclasm of [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]]. The first mosque built in Delhi, the &quot;[[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat al-Islam]]&quot; was built after the demolition of the Hindu temple built previously by Prithvi Raj and certain parts of the temple were left outside the mosque proper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hai&quot;&gt;Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai &quot;Hindustan Islami Ahad Mein&quot; (Hindustan under Islamic rule), Eng Trans by Maulana Abdul Hasan Nadwi.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign, although an argument goes that such iconoclasm was motivated more by politics than by religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routes/1200_1299/index_1200_1299.html Index_1200-1299],''Columbia.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ruler of the sultanate, Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]], conquered and subjugated the Hindu pilgrimage site [[Varanasi]] in the 11th century and he continued the destruction of Hindu temples and idols that had begun during the first attack in 1194.&lt;ref&gt;

No aspect of Aurangzeb's reign is more cited – or more controversial – than the numerous desecrations and even the destruction of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurangzeb&quot;&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Aurangzeb.htm The South Asian] ''Aurangzeb profile''.&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, tens of thousands of temples were desecrated: their facades and interiors were defaced and their murtis (divine images) looted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurangzeb&quot;/&gt; In many cases, temples were destroyed entirely; in numerous instances mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones. Among the temples Aurangzeb destroyed were two that are most sacred to Hindus, in [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mughaltemples&quot;&gt;[http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/temple_aurangzeb.html Rajiv Varma] ''Destruction of Hindu Temples by Aurangzeb.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he had large mosques built on the sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurangzeb&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Benares well.jpg|thumb|250px|The original holy well – Gyanvapi in between temple &amp; mosque.]]
The [[Kesava Deo]] temple in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], marked the place that Hindus believe was the birthplace of Shri [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mughaltemples&quot;/&gt; In 1661 Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, and constructed the Katra Masjid mosque. Traces of the ancient Hindu temple can be seen from the back of the mosque. Aurangzeb also destroyed what was the most famous temple in [[Varanasi]] – the [[Vishwanath Temple]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mughaltemples&quot;/&gt; 

The temple had changed its location over the years, and in 1585 [[Akbar]] had authorized its location at Gyan Vapi. Aurangzeb ordered its demolition in 1669 and constructed a mosque on the site, whose minarets stand 71 metres above the Ganges. Traces of the old temple can be seen behind the mosque. Centuries later, emotional debate about these wanton acts of cultural desecration continues. [[Aurangzeb]] also destroyed the [[Somnath]] temple in 1706.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mughaltemples&quot;/&gt;

[[Hindu nationalists]] claim that Mughals destroyed the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Mandir]] in [[Ayodhya]], located at the birthplace of [[Rama]], and built the [[Babri Masjid]] on the holy site, which has since been a source of tension between the Hindu and Muslim communities.

Writer Fernand Braudel wrote in ''A History of Civilizations'' (Penguin 1988/1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–236), Islamic rule in India as a &quot;''colonial experiment''&quot; was &quot;''extremely violent''&quot;, and &quot;''the Muslims could not rule the country except by systematic terror. Cruelty was the norm &amp;ndash; burnings, summary executions, crucifixions or impalements, inventive tortures. Hindu temples were destroyed to make way for mosques. On occasion there were forced conversions. If ever there were an uprising, it was instantly and savagely repressed: houses were burned, the countryside was laid waste, men were slaughtered and women were taken as slaves.''&quot;

===During Goa inquisitions===
Diago de Boarda, a priest, and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz, had made a 41 point plan for torturing Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy Antano de Noronha issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:&lt;ref name=&quot;vgweb.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.vgweb.org/unethicalconversion/GoaInquisition.htm The Goa Inquisition by Christian Historian Dr. T. R. de Souza ]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1567 the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. In 1583 Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed through army action.&lt;ref name=&quot;vgweb.org&quot;/&gt;

&quot;The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers.&quot; wrote [[Filippo Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588.&lt;ref name=&quot;vgweb.org&quot;/&gt;  

An order was issued in June 1684 eliminating the [[Konkani language]] and making it compulsory to speak [[Portuguese language]].  Following that law all the symbols of non-Christian sects were destroyed and the books written in local languages were burnt.&lt;ref name=&quot;vgweb.org&quot;/&gt;

===Contemporary iconoclasm against Hindus===

The [[2010 Deganga riots]] began on 6 September when mobs resorted to [[arson]] and [[violence]] over a disputed structure at [[Deganga]], Kartikpur and Beliaghata under the [[Deganga]] police station area.

====In Pakistan====
{{Further|Decline of Hinduism in Pakistan}}
Several Hindu temples have been destroyed in Pakistan. A notable incident was the destruction of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]] in former [[East Pakistan]]. The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistan Army on March 27, 1971.The [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] was severely damaged during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. In a major disrespect of the religion, the main worship hall was taken over by the [[Pakistan]] Army and used as an ammunitions storage area. Several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled first to their ancestral villages and then to India and therefore escaped death.

In 2006, the last Hindu temple in [[Lahore]] was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-storied commercial building. The temple was demolished after officials of the Evacuee Property Trust Board concealed facts from the board chairman about the nature of the building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/05/28/nat23.htm Another temple is no more],''Dawn''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several political parties in Pakistan have objected to this move, such as the Pakistan People's party and the Pakistani Muslim League-N.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/13temple.htm Hindu temple in Lahore demolished],''Rediff.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1643844.cms Only Hindu Temple in Lahore demolished],''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; The move has also evoked strong condemnation in India from minority bodies and political parties, including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], as well as Muslim advocacy political parties such as the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1651762.cms India protests demolition of Hindu temple in Pak],''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm of lawyers representing the Hindu minority has approached the Lahore High Court seeking a directive to the builders to stop the construction of the commercial plaza and reconstruct the temple at the site. The petitioners maintain that the demolition violates section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code prohibiting the demolition of places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/16/10047337.html Order for temple's reconstruction sought],''Gulf News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2005, following the arrest of an illiterate Christian janitor on allegations of allegedly burning Qur'an pages, a mob of between 300 and 500 Muslims destroyed a Hindu temple and houses belonging to Christian and Hindu families in [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]]. Under the terms of a deal negotiated between Islamic religious leaders and the Hindu/Christian communities, Pakistani police later released all previously arrested perpetrators without charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;usdep&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71443.htm US Department of State International Religious Freedom Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Malaysia====
Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please],''malaysiakini.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple,''gatago.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built &quot;illegally&quot;. However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finexp&quot;&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia],''Financial Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finexp&quot;/&gt;

====In Saudi Arabia====
On March 24, 2005, [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi authorities]] destroyed religious items found in a raid on a makeshift Hindu shrine found in an apartment in [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Paul. ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20060522223359/http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/news/bn2005/bn-2005-00-16.htm Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Crack Down]''. Freedom House.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Fiji====
In Fiji according to official reports, attacks on Hindu institutions increased by 14% compared to 2004. This intolerance of Hindus has found expression in anti-Hindu speeches and destruction of temples, the two most common forms of immediate and direct violence against Hindus. Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighboring Australia and New Zealand. organized religious institutions, such as the Methodist Church of Fiji, have repeatedly called for the creation of a theocratic Christian State and have propagated anti-Hindu sentiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindusin&quot;&gt;[http://www.hafsite.org/pdf/hhr_2005_html/fijiislands.htm Hindus in South Asia and the Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; State favoritism of Christianity, and systematic attacks on temples, are some of the greatest threats faced by Fijian Hindus. Despite the creation of a human rights commission, the plight of Hindus in Fiji continues to be precarious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindusin&quot; /&gt;

==Chinese iconoclasm==
During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, [[Kuomintang]] Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing idols, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai%20smashing%20idols%20decapitating%20statues&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925-1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=98|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that almost all of Buddhist monasteries in Guangxi were destroyed by Bai in this manner. The monks were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LxDUeWdMubkC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=bai+chongxi+buddhist+temples#v=onepage&amp;q=bai%20chongxi%20buddhist%20temples&amp;f=false|title=Toward a modern Chinese Buddhism: Taixu's reforms|author=Don Alvin Pittman|year=2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=|page=146|isbn=0-8248-2231-5|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bai led a wave of anti-foreignism in Guangxi, attacking American, European, and other foreigners and missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners. Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary%20crowd&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925-1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three goals of the movement were anti-foreignism, anti-imperialism, and anti-religion. Bai led the anti-religious movement against superstition. Muslims do not believe in polytheism (see [[shirk (Islam)]]) and his religion may have influenced Bai to take action against the images in the temples and the practices denounced as superstitious in the campaign. [[Huang Shaoxiong]], also a Kuomintang member of the New Guangxi clique, supported Bai's campaign.  Huang was not a Muslim, and the anti-religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai's%20as%20a%20moslem%20other%20religions&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925-1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
