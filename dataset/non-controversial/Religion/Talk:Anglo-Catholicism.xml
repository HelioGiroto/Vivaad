==B.V.M.==
I changed a reference to the Virgin Mary. While she is prayed to as 'Blessed Mary, ever virgin', that is not her formal title. It is in fact the 'Blessed Virgin Mary' (BVM) or the Virgin Mary. [[User:Jtdirl|JTD]] 07:22 Dec 24, 2002 (UTC)

==&quot;High Church&quot;==
I see that [[High Church]] is simply a redirect to this page. Not my religion, and I don't claim expertise, but I've always been under the impression that, while Anglo-Catholics are necessarily High Church, one can be High Church without being an Anglo-Catholic. Can someone with more expertise clarify?

The Oxford Movement which ave birth to Anglo-Catholicism itself grew out of the High Church movement, which pre-dated it.  They were conservative in politics and against emotion in worship, hence gaining the name &quot;High and Dry.&quot; Indeed many High Churchmen were appalled at the enthusiasm shown by the young Tractarians, Newman and Froude. Of course the High Church article now links to the High church article. [[User:MnJWalker|MnJWalker]]

== Ascension and St Agnes ==
What is so special about this parish? If we're going to have a link to it in this article, why not link to the hundreds of other Anglo-Catholic parishes in the world as well?

==Pope Benedict==
''Many Anglo-Catholics are hopeful that with the recent election of Pope Benedict XVI new chances of reunion with the Holy See may be made possible, since Pope Benedict appears to share the same sense of unity as the late Pope John Paul II.''

This surely is POV?  Many also don't or don't care or don't think Benedict can deliver the goods.  [[User:Gerry Lynch|Gerry Lynch]] 18:24, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

Can I suggest we cut down the number of parish links on this page - Wikipedia is not a link repository and the list is almost getting longer than the article. [[User:EconomistUK|EconomistUK]] 09:44, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

Should there be any links to the Continuing Anglicans in an article about &quot;Anglo-Catholicism&quot;? Perhaps this should be removed as it seems a wider link than the article intended?[[User:Spiorad|Spiorad]] ([[User talk:Spiorad|talk]]) 11:53, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

==Anglo-Catholic Central==
Okay, the contention is that Anglo-Catholic Central is too exclusive to the conservative, [[Forward in Faith]]-style of Anglo-Catholicism. However, I put the link there in the first place, and I am definitely of the [[Affirming Catholicism]] school of Anglicanism. The reason for the link was that a number of people were cluttering the External links with hyperlinks to skillions of different individual Anglo-Catholic parishes, and ACC provides, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive directory. So basically, instead of having links to fifteen different parishes, we could link to one directory of many more than that. The reasoning for this was elucidated in the conversation above between myself and [[User:EconomistUK|EconomistUK]], under the heading &quot;Links&quot;. Please discuss. [[User:Carolynparrishfan|Carolynparrishfan]] 13:24, 5 December 2005 (UTC) 

I don't know why or why not Anglo-Catholic Central lists or does not list certain parishes that are in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, but I think a more genuine link would be one that lists all Anglo-Catholic parishes. To me, it would be the Anglican thing to do. I have seen other posts in Wikipedia with numerous links, with no custodian cleaning things up for them. I suppose that we who, like the ECUSA and the Anglican Church in Canada, are welcome to come but are told to be quiet just have to do so. I hope that people who go to the parishes allowed to be named in Anglo-Catholic Central will some day visit my parish, one not deemed worthy to be named, yet focused on the Lord's vision of justice, and joyfully Anglo-Catholic [[User:Thurifer|Thurifer]] 19:54 12 Dec 2005 (UTC)

== Merge ==

:Not really.  The Anglican Catholic Church is a denomination which formed in protest to the ordination of women in the Episcopal Church/Anglican Communion.  Anglo-Catholicism is a movement with a primarily liturgical and theological focus; there are many Anglo-Catholics and Anglo-Catholic parishes within the Anglican and Episcopal Churches, who do not support further schism.  In addition, many Anglo-Catholic churches are quite politically liberal; I attend an Anglo-Catholic church with several female priests and a Gay Christians Reading Group, neither of which (I think) would be welcome in an Anglican Catholic parish. —[[User:Josiah Rowe|Josiah Rowe]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Josiah Rowe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe|contribs]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

== Links to [[Ritualism]] ==
[[User:Pgg7]] has, along with many useful contributions to this article, been linking a number of terms and phrases to [[ritualism]].  I think it's sufficient to have one explicit link within the article and a mention in the &quot;see also&quot; section, but perhaps we should open the discussion to other opinions.  I don't see the advantage in linking &quot;worship and ceremonial&quot; or &quot;despite the opposition of the press and of the Government&quot; to [[ritualism]], but perhaps that's just me.  What do other people think? —[[User:Josiah Rowe|Josiah Rowe]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Josiah Rowe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe|contribs]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:04, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

:Not only do I think its disadventageous, such links smack of POV-ness, since &quot;ritualism&quot; is a somewhat perjorative name for Catholic ceremonial. [[User:Fishhead64|Fishhead64]] 03:46, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

==The Mass and the priesthood==
The article presently says &quot;Anglicans share with Roman Catholics a belief in the sacramental nature of the priesthood, the sacrificial character of the Mass, and the Real Presence in the Eucharist, but Anglo-Catholics lay great stress on these points to counter the tendency of Evangelicals to try to promote ideas such as lay presidency at the Eucharist&quot;. 

This is misleading and wrong. The belief in the sacrifice of the Mass is not a belief of middle-of-the-road Anglicanism. The belief is specifically denied in the 39 articles and was unknown in Anglicanism until the Oxford Movement - Newman writes in his &quot;Apologia&quot; of a well-meaning typical Anglican who wrote a letter to correct Newman's use of the phrase &quot;Sacrifice of the Eucharist&quot; in a tract, which he assumed must have been a printing error in place of &quot;Sacrament of the Eucharist&quot;. As for the sacramental priesthood and the Real Presence (in any Catholic sense), one cannot say that these are accepted Anglican teachings. The large Evangelical party in the Anglican church has never accepted either of them (and indeed the original reformers reduced the sacraments to two (Baptism and the Lord's Supper) on the model of the Continental Reformation). I am a Roman Catholic from Sydney and you would be hard-pressed to find an Anglican here in this Low church city who would believe any of these things. The article gives a false impression by presenting these doctrines as ordinary Anglican doctrines which the Anglo-Catholics merely put more emphasis on - rather, in large part they are doctrines held ''only'' by the Anglo-Catholic party in the Anglican church. This seems to me rather obvious bias to prop up the Anglo-Catholic position that the Church of England can be considered a branch of the Catholic Church (justifying their own existence within it) rather than as essentially Protestant.

I have altered the section in question. (User: Casuabon).

== Paragraph on Anglo Papalists ==

This states that &quot;A minority of Anglo-Catholics (sometimes called Anglo-Papalists) consider themselves under Papal supremacy..&quot; and that &quot;A significant portion of Britain's present Roman Catholics are former Anglicans or their descendants.&quot; I do not think that the second sentence is meaningful or belongs with the first. A significant portion of Roman Catholics in Britain will descended from former Anglicans but whether those former Anglicans were originally Anglo Papalists is questionable. The paragraph seems to suggest that the Catholic church in England contains a large number of people who were, or whose familise were, originally Anglo-Papalists. This seems unlikely. Is there a citation for this?

Unless there are any objections, I am goint to remove this sentence. [[User:Glow worm64|Glow worm64]] 19:03, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

==Cut==
This material was deleted by an anon. IP.  I am uncertain if it should be restored or not:

{{cquote|The [[Liturgical Movement]], ignited by Anglican divine Dom [[Gregory Dix]] with his book, ''The Shape of the Liturgy'' shaped the sweeping simplifications and standardizations in liturgical practice of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after Vatican II, as well as of the churches in the [[Lutheran World Federation]] and the [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic Churches of the Union of Utrecht]] and the [[Independent Catholic Churches]] derived from them. What little distinction is left in the Western liturgy has to do with the Anglican recourse to the customary of the [[Sarum Rite]]. }}

:That was probably a good cut.  Some of those statements aren't factually correct, and even if they were, they probably don't belong in an article about Anglo-Catholicism. [[User:Dgf32|Dgf32]] 19:02, 2 November 2007 (UTC)

==Succession==

The article states &quot;Today, however, all Anglican bishops have been consecrated in succession with Old Catholic or Orthodox episcopal lines...&quot;

I dispute the factual accuracy of this statement. I have added the &quot;citation needed&quot; tag. While I cannot &quot;prove a negative&quot; that all Anglican bishops have not been so consecrated, I have consulted several Anglican priests (no bishops, sorry) and none of them have heard of this.  Unless someone can supply a citation, I will remove this and related sentences.

In addition, the lack of valid succession is not the only historical reason that the Roman Catholic church has regarded Anglican Orders as invalid; the view of the priesthood and Eucharist is also fundamentally different.

:It ''was'' in quotes, and I think deliberately so. I certainly haven't heard any Anglicans use the word &quot;Papist&quot;, except perhaps as a joke. You will hear &quot;[[Anglo-Papalism|Anglo-Papalist]]&quot; (non-pejorative) used for a certain stream of Anglo-Catholicism (q.v.) but it's a specific technical term. Comparing it to the N-word, however, would overstate your case. (I certainly would never use the n-word under any circumstances, but I might jokingly refer to myself as &quot;papist&quot;).

== &quot;laxity in theology&quot; Should to be Changed to &quot;unorthodox practices&quot; ==
In the first sentance of the third paragraph, under the heading &quot;Background,&quot; the words used are &quot;laxity of theology.&quot;  Despite the aukwardness of the sentance structure, I do not believe this is how Catholics, Orthodox, or &quot;High Church&quot; Anglicans would describe the state of things described in this article.  What the author is trying to convey is the situation where some members are displeased with the Anglican church, at large, over situations like the admission of women and openly homosexual persons to major orders, the admission of married men into the episcopal ranks, acceptance of contraception, etc.  

These are not situations where the &quot;theology is lax,&quot; meaning none of this is addressed, specifically, in any of the four Gospels.  These situations are instead unorthodox, in that they have never been acceptable by any particular (orthodox and catholic) church until the 20th century.  The most broad view of what is &quot;orthodox&quot; is what is found in the Gospels, the Pauline letters, and the traditions of the early church.  Theology, on the other hand, is what is found within The Word itself and, to a lesser extent, how it is explained by the Church Fathers, including The Acts and the Letters.  

I make this point because Protestants, by and large, focus on &quot;The Word,&quot; and how this is something a particular person understands and acts on.  (In the prior sentance, &quot;Protestant&quot; focusses largely on particular churches without any espiscopal tradition, such as those among the evangelical movement, and not necessarily those in the Anglican and Lutheran movement, per se.)  This entire orientation is entirely unorthodox in its nature, since it has no regard to the traditions and teachings of any church.  

Hence, my discertation concerning how to describe the actions of the Anglican Church as &quot;unorthodox&quot; and not lax in their theology.  Tear me apart, people.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.62.82.125|71.62.82.125]] ([[User talk:71.62.82.125|talk]]) 19:29, 25 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==&quot;branch&quot; of the universal Catholic Church==
The article says: &quot;The theological basis of Anglo-Catholicism - that the Anglican Church is a &quot;branch&quot; of the universal Catholic Church, with valid bishops, priests sacraments - has never been accepted by the other two putative branches of the Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, since each claims that it itself is the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church&quot;. However, don't RCC and EOC reognise that their respective bishops, priests and sacraments ARE valid? And so, do they not reciprocally recognise themselves as &quot;branch&quot; of the universal Church, their position toward the Anglican Church being quite different? To say that &quot;each claims that it itself is the One&quot; is so not entirely correct in that specific context.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.168.72.28|85.168.72.28]] ([[User talk:85.168.72.28|talk]]) 14:56, 10 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==But aren't you Protestants?==

:*Mumford152 mistakenly added the following comments into the article itself, and Fremte correctly removed them at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anglo-Catholicism&amp;curid=59949&amp;diff=331191844&amp;oldid=331176440 this edit]. I thought they should be copied here. [[User:Moonraker2|Moonraker2]] ([[User talk:Moonraker2|talk]]) 22:17, 12 December 2009 (UTC)

But aren't you Protestants? The terms 'Protestant' and 'Catholic' are often used and very often misunderstood!

Firstly one must understand that to be 'Catholic' one doesn't necessarily have to be 'Roman' Catholic despite what some in the Roman Church may claim. The Orthodox Churches of the East and in other places are Catholic Churches but not in communion with the Pope. The term protestant is equally often misunderstood.

The Catholic Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church during the sixteenth century. However, although a Protestant Reformation was taking place on the Continent the English Reformation was fundamentally different in nature and intention. Primarily the reasons for its formation were political. King Henry VIII, whilst wanting to be independent of Rome, was not a Protestant in intention, although his reasons for separation were not especially honourable.

Of course there are Anglicans who have wanted to be Protestant (in the way that continental reformers meant), just as there are Anglicans who want complete union with Rome. However, the Church of England was not formed in the same way as the Continental Protestant Churches. The Continental Reformation was primarily German, under the leadership of Martin Luther; French, under John Calvin and Swiss, under Ulrich Zwingli. The Continental Reformers accepted the principle called Sola Scriptura, that is, Scripture alone as the basis for faith and practice. However, the English Reformers appealed to Scripture as interpreted by the ancient Church, especially through the Seven Ecumenical Councils of the Undivided Church. The Continental Reformers also almost unanimously rejected or dropped the principle of apostolic succession. That is, bishops, by virtue of their consecration, being successors of the apostles, tracing a straight link back to them through history. But the English Reformation retained apostolic succession.

Since the Continental Reformers rejected the apostolic succession of bishops and indeed developed a different understanding of the priesthood, they lost a 'valid' ordained priesthood. But at the English Reformation, the Church of England deliberately retained the title 'priest', because it contained a real truth and intention. Christ is the perfect priest. The Church is His body. The organ of a priestly body cannot be less than priestly.

The Church of England maintained its apostolic ministry of bishops, priests and deacons. Its form of worship, though translated into English and somewhat reformed, nonetheless stood in continuity with the Church's historical worship. The goal of the English Reformation was to reform the practice of the Church and return to the ancient and Catholic faith of the Undivided Church.

:The terms '''Anglo-Catholic''', '''Anglican Catholic''', and '''Catholic Anglican''' describe people, beliefs, and practices within [[Anglicanism]] that affirm the [[Catholicism|Catholic]], rather than the churches' [[Protestantism|Protestant]], heritage and identity of the various Anglican churches.

So &quot;the churches'&quot; is now within the comparison, which means that the Anglican churches are inherently Protestant and the A-Cs are an exception. This is a change to the meaning of the text and not a cleanup.
