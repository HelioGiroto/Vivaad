==Tract 90==
Reduced the little screed about &quot;Tract 90&quot; to a reference that's sort of encyclopedic; removed the numerous links and the insults. Probably one could use the data to construct a link to its text. But I don't see why I should do this hostile fellow's work for him. [[User:Dandrake|Dandrake]] 02:02, Aug 29, 2004 (UTC)

==Merge proposal==
I do not think that there is a compelling reason to have [[Forty-Two Articles]] as a separate entry.  Surey, a section in this article would be sufficient to explain the evolution.  Thoughts?  [[User:Fishhead64|Fishhead64]] 18:29, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:I '''agree''': it's not worth a whole article, so long as it can be found by searching Wikipedia. [[User:Myopic Bookworm|Myopic Bookworm]] 14:58, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

:'''Agree''': Even better, merge the articles and redirct [[Forty-Two Articles]] to [[Thirty-Nine Articles]]. --[[User:Wine Guy|Wine Guy]] 21:31, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

:'''Disagree'''. Two different documents, two different articles, IMO. Unless I misunderstand. [[User:Carolynparrishfan|Carolynparrishfan]] 14:15, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' My rationale is that the Thirty-Nine Articles evolved from the Forty-Two.  It would be nice to have one article cover the document and its development.  &quot;Forty-Two Articles&quot; could then be a redirect here. [[User:Fishhead64|Fishhead64]] 16:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

:'''Agree''' It looks like Forty-Two Articles is likely to remain stubby for some time, and a few lines about its development belong here, even when ''in the future'' there is a full article about the Forty-Two.  --[[User:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Hroðulf]] (or Hrothulf) ([[User talk:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Talk]]) 10:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

:'''Weak Disagree'''While I agree that a few lines about the 42 are always going to be neccessary for a history section in an article about the 39, substantial and notable differences exist between the two versions.  Discussing the forty-two in a separate artcle seems worthwhile goal.

A new WikiProject focussing on [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Anglican Communion]] has just been initiated:  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Anglicanism|WikiProject Anglicanism]].  Our goal is to improve and expand Anglican-reltaed articles.  If anyone (Anglican or non-Anglican) is interested, read over the project page and consider signing up.  Cheers!

== Summaries ==

I have added brief summaries for those articles whose title is not entirely self-explanatory, with the exception of Artcle XVI (Of Predestination and Election), as I'm not confident that I understand what it is or is not affirming. [[User:Myopic Bookworm|Myopic Bookworm]] 13:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
:Very cool summaries, Myopic Bookworm, thanks.  If you can also back up your summaries with a reference, (so that people don't think it is your original research) then I would suggest it would be time to remove the '''stub''' template. --[[User:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Hroðulf]] (or Hrothulf) ([[User talk:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Talk]]) 11:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
::I'm not sure what &quot;original research&quot; means in this context. My source for the information is the Book of Common Prayer. Writing an encyclopedia article of any kind is a matter of presenting information in summary form. If I were summarizing scholarly opinion on the Thirty Nine Articles, then I would give references. But I'm not: I have written these summaries myself (so they violate no copyright), they are verifiable (by referring to the original Articles), and though the text is plainly &quot;original&quot; since I originated it, I do not regard it as &quot;research&quot;. I think a summary is useful, because some of the Articles are rather long, and use rather opaque contemporary religious terminology. [[User:Myopic Bookworm|Myopic Bookworm]] 13:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
::: I agree that your summaries are  both verifiable and useful.  But, I think there is problem with a Wikipedia editor summarizing in this case.  The problem is that you are not summarising a suitable source, but instead summarising the primary source.  To me , it feels similar to telling us how many stones are at Stonehenge by counting them in a photograph, rather than citing a good history book - it could invite dispute when there is no need for one.  I really like your summaries, but that is my POV, so if we point to one or two sources that back up your summaries, that will make the article all the stronger.  I am definitely not suggesting either deleting your summaries, nor plagiarizing someone else's summary - merely checking that respected authorities would summarize the articles in a broadly similar manner.  Anyway, I won't labour the point.  If and when I have non-Calvinist sources in my hands, I will reference them in the article.   --[[User:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Hroðulf]] (or Hrothulf) ([[User talk:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Talk]]) 14:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

==Inspiration==

I have just scanned today's featured article:  [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  I think it is a great model for what [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] could ultimately look like in overall shape and style.  I think it would be anachronistic to have a section called ''Enforcement'' here, so lets not follow it slavishly, but use it for inspiration. --[[User:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Hroðulf]] (or Hrothulf) ([[User talk:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Talk]]) 09:49, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

==Sources==

===More sources please===
I am interested in this topic and would like to see more content.  However I am personally hampered here and at [[Anglican doctrine]] by my lack of expertise, and a lack of a balanced list of sources.  Has anyone noticed that a Google search produces a preponderance of conservative articles?  Tract 90 is not the only paper with a non-Calvinist view of the Thirty-Nine Articles.  I am making a personal plea: &lt;i&gt;please suggest more sources here, or right in the article itself.&lt;/i&gt;  --[[User:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Hroðulf]] (or Hrothulf) ([[User talk:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Talk]]) 10:02, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

===Citation style?===
We only have one citation so far (apart from the document text itself) and this is in the form of an embedded HTML link.  Personally I would prefer either a Harvard style or a footnote style, as I suspect most references will not be web links.  Style guide is at [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Citation styles]]. Do you think we should change from HTML links to Harvard, HTML link to footnotes, or stick with HTML links? --[[User:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Hroðulf]] (or Hrothulf) ([[User talk:Hro%C3%B0ulf|Talk]]) 15:37, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

==Subscription==
Another area I think we need to improve is the historic requirement of subscription to the articles especially for office with government, and to take a degree from the Oxbridge systems.  [[User:Mgriffin|Mgriffin]] 02:54, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Article XII ==

The claim that Article XII is a middle way between Lutheran ''sola fideism'' and Catholic practice seems unsupportable.  I can't imagine any protestant group denying the precepts of Article XII.  It's standard issue protestant stuff - salvation doesn't come from good works, but good works which come through faith are pleasing to god, and are a sign of election.  This would be perfectly acceptable to Calvinists, as far as I can tell. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 05:01, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

== Anglo-Catholic bias? NPOV dispute ==

What on earth does this mean?

:''Most of the substance of the articles can be labelled as Reformed Catholicism[1], and were not intended as a complete statement of the Christian faith, but of the position of the Church of England vis-a-vis the Roman Catholic Church and dissident Protestants.''

&quot;Reformed Catholicism?&quot;  This isn't a term anyone would possibly have used in 1563.  The 39 Articles are basically Calvinist.  This article seems to basically strive to obscure this.  Look, Anglo-Catholicism is a product of the 19th century.  It is completely inappropriate to try to force sixteenth century documents into nineteenth century frames of interpretation.  The 39 Articles are not &quot;Reformed Catholicism.&quot;  The Elizabethan settlement was essentially a merger of Calvinist doctrine with a hierarchical organization and a more ritualized liturgy.  But the Thirty-nine Articles are about doctrine, and that doctrine is not some kind of compromise between Catholicism and &quot;Protestantism.&quot;  It is pretty much entirely Reformed, and Reformed in this sense means &quot;Calvinist.&quot;  Is it too much to ask to keep presentist positioning out of the discussion of a sixteenth century document? [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 05:16, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

:You may disagree, but the source of the remark is cited, if you find a source that argues for your point of view, feel free to add it as a coutner, but don't simply remove cited statements. [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] 09:36, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

::There's nothing untouchable about cited statements.  Present-day Anglican sources are not particularly reliable sources on centuries old historical documents.  Even worse is that the main source for this article appears to be [[Tract 90]], which is anything but a neutral analysis of the articles.  Newman was writing to advance a partisan  POV, and his interpretation of the 39 Articles was pretty clearly tendentious, and almost got him censured by the Church at the time.  The citations made are basically worthless.  This is not a neutral article about the XXIX Articles.  It's a recapitulation of Newman's highly controversial analysis of them, backed up by a lot of tendentious language using nineteenth century Anglo-Catholic terms as though they had meaning to the 16th century Calvinists who wrote the article. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 16:26, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

What ever other points you raise, I DO think the point &quot;Present-day Anglican sources are not particularly reliable sources on centuries old historical documents.&quot; is a very weak one. Are you saying modern day historians have LESS of a grasp of an extant 16th century document then a writer from the 18th century did? Should Gibbon, or Maculay, or Treveylan, or any historian be discounted? No. Should they be taken at face value here in the 21st century? Certainly not. -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 17:11, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

:You have misunderstood me.  Present-day ''Anglican'' sources are not particularly reliable.  We should be looking at what academic historians say about the Articles, not what partisans have to say. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 17:27, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with you that older writers are even more problematic - thus my problem that this article seems largely to be based on Newman. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 17:27, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

Have at it and lets see where it takes us. -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 17:39, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

:What did you think of my changes which David  Underdown reverted? [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 18:02, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] is a considered a trusted source. I reworded the paragraph in an effort to reduce bias.  I hope I have succeded, at least somewhat. I also did some major reworking and citation.  Where are we at now on this? -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 19:13, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

Wikimporovement!!! Looks fine to me! -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 23:29, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

As I said on your talk page, I think it's a step in the right direction.  I'm going to try to run down continuing problems I see with the summary of individual points:

#VI ought to compare the 39 Articles doctrine with respect to scripture with those of Luther and Calvin, to which it is similar, but not identical.
#VIII probably shouldn't refer to the three creeds as &quot;Catholic&quot;.
#IX-XII ought also to more directly compare to Luther and Calvin, and perhaps to contemporary Roman practice.  I've seen it claimed online that this material is directly based  on the Lutheran Confession of Württemberg, presented as a statement of moderate Lutheran beliefs to the Council of Trent in 1563.
#I have a very big problem with XII, specifically.  The claim that continental protestants completely reject any role for good works is simply untrue, as is the implication that Luther and Calvin would find the article's statement unamenable.  I don't see anything in this article which Calvin would have disagreed with - it is classic Calvinist doctrine that good works proceeding from faith are a sign of election.
#XVII needs to make clear that this is, essentially a restatement of Calvin's doctrine of predestination and election.  In general, there is far too large an attempt here to put air between the 39 Articles and Calvin, when quite clearly the articles are in most ways very close to orthodox Calvinism.
#XXV seems to weak on the discussion of sacraments.  The article seems fairly close to denying the sacramental nature of the five &quot;so-called sacraments&quot;.  
#XXVIII-XXIX also obfuscates, I think.  The &quot;spiritual presence&quot; of Christ in the eucharist is not at all out of line with Calvinist thinking on the subject.  I think the implication of  the way we write about this is, again, to claim that this is a compromise between the Catholic and the Calvinist position, when in fact it is really very close to the Calvinist position.
#XXIX, in particular, elaborates a false compromise.  Nothing in the article suggests that ''the Eucharist'' is defiled by a non-believer taking it.  It merely says that the non-believer is.  This, again, doesn't seem to me to be a compromise.  In general, the  Articles' doctrine of the Eucharist is on the left side of the Anglican - a lot closer to the Calvinist position than it is to [[consubstantiation]].
#XXXVII ought to mention [[Erastianism]].  

More broadly, I think the key is to give more context in terms of contemporary disputes, in order to explain what is  meant, what is controversial, where the Articles agree with contemporary Roman Catholic doctrine (a fair amount, but largely in areas where all the Reformation churches agree with  Roman Catholic doctrine), where they agree with contemporary Calvinism (a considerably greater extent), where they differ (Erastianism is a particular difference), and so forth.  I also think it's a bit much to argue that the articles themselves represent very much of a compromise between Catholicism and the continental reformers.  On almost every question of note, the articles side with the continental reformers, and even with Calvin, against Rome.  There are some definite differences with the continental reformers, particularly in terms of the authority of the state (although even that isn't so different from Lutheranism, at least), but most of the differences at the time were in matters of ritual and organization, which aren't really covered by the Articles.  On a somewhat tangential  note, I was interested as to what the status of the  Articles was under the Commonwealth.  It strikes me that the Presbyterians could have accepted the vast majority of them, and that even the INdependents probably could have accepted most of it, but I'd be interested to know more on that.  [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 23:57, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

:Well, be bold. I don't know that anyone is refusing to make these changes...as I said before, maybe nobody but you cares to - or can - make them.  I do have some problems with some of things you have suggested, but let's see what it looks like in the article with a cite next to them.  We all seem quite civil here. Nothing will touch off an edit war or anything unpleasent.  Change, cite, and discuss! -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 03:46, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

::I will say that I do have a problem in terms of citation, as I'm not sure what a good source  on this stuff would be.  I took a (graduate level) class a few years ago on the English Reformation, and we discussed the 39 Articles, which is where most of my stuff is coming from, but I haven't actually read any books on it, specifically.  Also, could you perhaps elaborate on specific reservations you have with the changes I've laid out - I'd like to be careful about them, in hopes of avoiding further conflict. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 16:28, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

I killed the offending exposition, which probably did not belong here anyways.  I moved the lot of it to the [[Tract 90]] article, where it can be as Anglo-Catholic as it wants to be. I replaced the Article by Article descriptions with a brief NPOV summary of each subsection of the document.  I then added two opposed assesments of the meaning of the Articles.  I removed the NPOV tag as the offending material was banished and I hope the Article can now continue to move forward in the direction of GA status. -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 19:43, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

:I think a detailed summary would be useful, if we could find an NPOV one.  Personally, I think the key perspective we ought to provide is that of historians, not that of low church and high church schools.   My basic understanding is that most historians are closer to the Low Church understanding of the articles (which  makes sense - Low Church people like the Articles a lot more than High Church types, and the Low Church interpretation is, I think, more natural - as you say in your new version,  it takes the Articles at face value), but they're not really the same.  I'll try to find a good source on the subject when I have a chance, to provide summaries based on scholarly understandings of the intentions and views of the men who wrote the 39 Articles, rather than the later interpretations of Anglican theologians who wish to use the articles to advance their own POV about the nature of the Church.   The latter ought to be discussed  (and I think the quotes you use do  a decent job of elaborating on the various views, although perhaps a bit more detail on Newman's analysis would be in order), but ought to be secondary. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] 20:26, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

I will be watching and I will return here when there is movement on this. -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 20:32, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

Not to belabor controversies which seem to have gone on here for a while...but the paragraph introducing the 39 Articles seems to warrant at least some mention of the historical differences of opinion over the Catholic/Protestant significance of the articles. For instance, the sentence &quot;The &quot;via media&quot; was expressed so adroitly in the Articles&quot; glosses over these debates and creates and illusion of consensus in the direction of a 'via media'...this despite the fact that many--scholars and otherwise--regard the articles as essentially Protestant, if not Calvinist. As has been mentioned elsewhere on this page, there is nothing uniquely Catholic about the Elizabethan settlement compared, for example, to the Lutheran Reformation. The 39 articles reflect in many regards a more thoroughgoing &quot;reformation&quot; than the Augsburg Confession or the Book of Concord. My sense is that, more often than not, the term via media is invoked by Anglo-Catholics trying to read more Catholicism into the early history of the C of E than the historical record warrants. This is accomplished by letting 'Puritanism' stand in for 'Protestantism' and counting every thwarted Puritan attempt to shape the Church of England as a victory for Catholicism, which is misleading. The changes in the Church under Elizabeth were as dramatic as reformations elsewhere--in theology, liturgy, the abolition of non-parochial orders, its quintessentially Lutheran Erastianism, etc...despite post-Tractarian efforts to describe the Church of England as unique in its continuity with the pre-Reformation church.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mwd321|Mwd321]] ([[User talk:Mwd321|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mwd321|contribs]]) 22:02, 9 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I'm adding a NPOV tag to the front page. The article has clearly been questioned as biased by giving far too much weight to Tractarian interpretations of the articles, and can't even bring itself to say that it opposed Roman Catholic doctrine. IMHO the whole article is impossibly complex and hard to understand and filled with in-house discussions, completely unaccessable to the average reader. The 39 articles are clearly Calvinistic, Protestant but this article can't bring itself to say anything close to this![[User:Sbmackay|Sbmackay]] ([[User talk:Sbmackay|talk]]) 03:16, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

==Lutheran leanings?==
What were the &quot;Lutheran leanings&quot; in the ''Ten Articles''?  The articles were published in 1536, Lutherans were still being burned [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/timeline/06reformation.html] in England up until the arrival of the German delegation in 1539 that came to discuss doctrine.  I often see it glossed over that this meeting led to &quot;Lutheran leanings&quot; that were visible in the Articles.  The meeting took place three years AFTER the ten articles were published and it angered the king so much to hear the Lutheran positions that the meeting lead directly to the Six Aricles, which restate Roman Catholic doctrine more clearly then was done in the Ten. It would not be fair to say that the church &quot;swung away from Luther and back towards Rome&quot; with the Six Articles.  Doctrine never really strayed during the reign of Henry.  The [[Bishop's Book]], written by Cranmer, had slight Lutheran leanings, but none really worthy of menention. Geneva's influence on the 42 Articles is more obvious, but keep in mind those never were in effect. 

I have not reworked that paragraph yet, but I would like to discuss this.  My research for the Cranmer articles leads me to pose the questions above. -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 05:22, 14 August 2007 (UTC)
:Restricting the sacraments to penance, eucharist and baptism was a leaning to early Lutheran thought. The Bishop's Book of 1537 strayed towards Lutheran sympathies enough that there was an anti-Lutheran backlash by people like Thomas Howard so that by 1538 Henry stopped the experimentation - he was the one who requested the exploration of doctrine by Cromwell and Cranmer in 1537 - and begun burning a few people at the stake for holding Lutheran ideas like denying the real presence of Christ in the eucharist. By 1539, Howard brought forth th Six Articles. The Lutheran idea of justification by faith which made its way into the Ten Articles and the Bishop's Book was repudiated when the King's Book came out in 1543 which is perhaps the doctrinal document that is furthest away from Lutheranisms.  Anyway, I was trying to prevent a dry and incomprehensible list of doctrinal statements that mean nothing to the outsider. Lutheran-like, Calvinist, or Catholic all convey something like the flavour of these documents in a short-hand that has some universal meaning outside of English church history. And, my knowledge of this sort of thing is very basic.  Cheers! [[User:Wassupwestcoast|Wassupwestcoast]] 12:16, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

::We will get something together that is lively and accurate when we do the merges.  Let me know when we have a consensus. -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 12:18, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

::A &quot;list of doctrinal statements&quot; does not have to be &quot;a dry and incomprehensible&quot;, and would be very useful for those who come to the article wanting something more than bare-bones generalisation.  We are, afterall, dealing with a progression of ideas towards a final product.  The differences between the steps that make up the progression are exactly, I submit, what people would expect to find coming to an article such as this.  Compare, for example, many wiki articles on topics of science or (especially) maths; they strive to give as much relevant information as possible - in a clear manner - without presupposing the reader's inability to comprehend the finer points.

==Question - Are Articles Overruled by Lambeth Council Resolutions?==

I have a question:  Are the Thirty-Nine Articles overruled by resolutions made by the Lambeth Council? I think this is a timely question given that Lambeth is being held this year but, more to the point, I personally find the last sentence of Article 37 deeply troubling in our current day and age and, frankly, antithetical to Christ's teachings.  However, I am aware that Lambeth 1988 Resolution 27 (see here [http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-27.cfm] ) and Lambeth 1978 Resolution 5 (here [http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1978/1978-5.cfm]) clearly counter Article 37.  

What, then, is the relationship between the Articles and the Lambeth Resolutions?  Can someone please explain it to me?  Thanks in advance.  [[Special:Contributions/210.50.60.34|210.50.60.34]] ([[User talk:210.50.60.34|talk]]) 09:17, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

:To my understanding, the Thirty Nine Articles are of no binding authority in any province of the Anglican Communion other than the Church of England, in which case even now only the clergy are required to prescribe to it. So the resolutions of Lambeth are probably of greater authority with respect to the Anglican Communion in general than the 39.

==Order of Books in Article 6==
It looks like they were pasted into here from a three column list and were consequently out of order. I fixed it and think it's correct now. I tried adding a link to the &quot;additions of esther&quot; subheading in the Book of Esther page, but couldn't figure it out. I'm not sure if the links are properly formatted, so I ask someone to take a look at it. Shouldn't &quot;The&quot; be in the hyperlink display text? I left that part &quot;as was&quot; but think it looks wrong. [[User:Davidfmurphy|Davidfmurphy]] ([[User talk:Davidfmurphy|talk]]) 06:17, 12 December 2008 (UTC)

== What rubbish is this? ==

The article reads: &quot;They were willing to separate from Rome, but their plan was to unite with the Greek Church and not with the evangelical Protestants on the continent.[6] The bishops also refused to eliminate what the Germans called the &quot;Abuses&quot; (e.g., private Masses, celibacy of the clergy, invocation of saints) allowed by the reformed English Church.[7] Stokesley considered these customs to be essential because the Greek Church, as the Eastern Orthodox Church was called at that time, practised them.[8]&quot;. I don't really understand where you guys are getting these ideas. Where is there any evidence that private Masses have ever been general practice in the EOC. Where is there any evidence that the EOC has ever generally required its clergy to be celibate (beyond the episcopate)?

== Bancrofts Cannons? ==

Were these articles also known as Bancroft's Cannons?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/212.219.118.148|212.219.118.148]] ([[User talk:212.219.118.148|talk]]) 09:45, 1 June 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Six Articles ==

Under &quot;Six Articles,&quot; it's unclear to what act &quot;penalties under this [A]ct&quot; refers.

I suggest &quot;examine six doctrinal questions which eventually became the basis of the ''Six Articles''.&quot;  be changed to:

&quot;examine six doctrinal questions which eventually became part of an act of Parliament, ''The Act of the Six Articles''.&quot;

Also, the text reads 

&quot;the articles were repealed by his son, Edward VI.&quot;  

How could the king repeal and Act of Parliament?  If he didn't do that, were the articles memorialized separate from and in addition to the act of Parliament, and thus something he could influence independently of Parliament?

==Articles IX-XVIII and the &quot;Via Media==

This summary is need of reworking:

&quot;Articles IX—XVIII: Personal religion: These articles dwell on the topics of sin, justification, and the eternal disposition of the soul. Of particular focus is the major Reformation topic of justification by faith. The Articles in this section and in the section on the Church plant Anglicanism in the via media of the debate, portraying an Economy of Salvation where good works are an outgrowth of faith and there is a role for the Church and for the sacraments.&quot;

This is not evidence of a via media--not on any point. Such a reading is Anglo-Catholic wishful thinking, I'm afraid. Articles XI and XIII are classic Reformation statements on justification by faith, and are in essential agreement with reformed (Calvinist) Protestantism regarding the importance of works as signs or expressions of justified faith, and not, in their own right, means of salvation. &quot;Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God&quot; (XIII). All the major reformed Protestant theologians of the 16th and 17th centuries were careful not to discount the importance of works (constantly on guard against Antinomianism), but, as the Articles express, similarly positioned works in their proper place in the salvation process: as effects of, not means to, salvation. And article XVII &quot;On Predestination and Election&quot; is about as &quot;Genevan&quot; as you can get. If evidence of a via media is to be found anywhere, it is not in these sections of the 39 articles. 

The Articles in general are Protestant and land the Elizabethan Church squarely in the Reformed Protestant camp, with a few nods to Luther as well: no purgatory, no transubstantiation, services must be in the vernacular, etc. Articles 20, 21 and 23 &quot;On the Church&quot; etc would have pleased Calvin: Calvinists too placed enormous emphasis on the authority of the church offices, &quot;the keys,&quot; the proper calling of ministers, and the absolute centrality of the sacraments, administered by ordained preachers, as vehicles of grace. Article XIX states that the Church of Rome is &quot;in error&quot; regarding &quot;manners of ceremonies&quot; and &quot;matters of faith.&quot;

== So, ... what are the Thirty-Nine Articles? ==

Have I missed something? This page is supposed to be about the Thirty-Nine Articles. Well, there's a lot of preamble about former lists of Articles by different authors; then there's a summary of the articles. At any point will the reader get to see a list of the Thirty-Nine Articles? [[User:Francish7|Francis Hannaway]] ([[User talk:Francish7|talk]]) Francis Hannaway 13:31, 7 July 2012 (UTC)

:It does seem a bit of an omission, but the list is linked from the bottom of the page. This follows the [[WP:NPS#Summarise, quote from and link to]] policy. --[[User:Old Moonraker|Old Moonraker]] ([[User talk:Old Moonraker|talk]]) 14:04, 7 July 2012 (UTC)</text>
