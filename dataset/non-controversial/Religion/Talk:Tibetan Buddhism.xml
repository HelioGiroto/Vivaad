== Lead ==

The lead stated: ''[[List of Buddhists|Teachers]] such as [[Chogyam Trungpa]], [[Sogyal Rinpoche]], [[Lama Jampa Thaye]] ([[Karma Thinley Rinpoche]]'s western regent), have helped Western understanding of Tibetan Buddhism through Western [[Sanghas]] and their books.'' This list contains at least one obscure person and is highly selective anyhow. The dalai lama misses, on the other hand. Either replace it by a reference to Tibetan Buddhism outside Tibet (not necessarily the West) or establish a list of important teachers outside Tibet. -- [[User:Zickzack|Zz]] ([[User talk:Zickzack|talk]]) 12:25, 2 May 2012 (UTC)


===Schools: Tuguan zongpai yuanliu===

Under &quot;Schools&quot;, the article has:

&quot;Tuguan zongpai yuanliu was a classic history of the different schools written by Turken.&quot;

I don't know anything about this and have no issue with it as fact, but there are some strange things about it:

1) It is the first sentence in the &quot;Schools&quot; section, but is not the topic of its paragraph. The rest of the paragraph, and indeed, of the section ignores it. What is it trying to say? Whatever it is getting at, why isn't it in a footnote? There seems to be a stylistic/ content need to integrate it, if it is to remain included.

2) It uses the past tense. Is this source lost now, or what?

3) One word: &quot;zongpai&quot; looks like Tibetan. Otherwise, &quot;yuanliu&quot; looks Chinese and the rest, including the author's name, may be Mongolian, Chinese or something. The footnote, apparently the original title, all looks like Chinese ideographs. Presumably, there are many other native sources besides this. Why is this source singled out from others? Is it distinguished in some way, and from what? If it is not Tibetan, why is it given prominence over Tibetan ones?

Does anyone get what this is about?

: I've deleted it pending clarification. The text was: &quot;''Tuguan zongpai yuanliu'' was a classic history of the different schools written by Turken.&quot; with the following citation: &quot;[http://www.fodian.net/zangchuan/zangchuan.htm 藏传佛教典籍]&quot;.

===Schools: Grub mthah thams cad kyi khuvs dav hdod tshul ston pa legs bśad śel gyi me lov===

Under &quot;Schools&quot;, the article now has:

'''Grub mthah thams cad kyi khuvs dav hdod tshul ston pa legs bśad śel gyi me lov '' was a classic history of the different schools written by Turken.'
with this footnote (in square brackets instead of arrows): &quot;&lt;http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/BDLM/sutra/tibet/keru/author_J01_1.htm 土觀宗派源流&gt;&quot;

I have the same problems as with the previous bit just above:

1) The rest of the section ignores this bit of information. It is not integrated into the other things that are written there. Because of this, it is incoherent.

2) It uses the past tense. Is this source lost now, or what?

3) Most of the words are Tibetan but the transliteration system is not a standard one, so that the words are not all identifiable as Tibetan. Standard Tibetan transliteration systems do not use word-final &quot;v&quot; or &quot;vs&quot;. It is hard to tell, but the correct substitutions may be &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;ngs&quot;. Also, we don't use the &quot;s&quot; with a slash over it.

4) The footnote includes Chinese ideographs. What are they and why are they there? The web page it links to: &lt;http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/BDLM/sutra/tibet/keru/author_J01_1.htm 土觀宗派源流&gt;, is in Chinese. Could the editor please give us a summary in this talk page of what it says. If it is to remain included in the Tibetan Buddhism article, some such summary needs to also end up in the footnote.

5) It's good that the reference is now in a footnote, but the whole paragraph is highly technical. So what is it trying to say? Whatever it is getting at, why isn't all of it in a footnote? The article is to introduce people to Tibetan Buddhism, and to put this in the body of the text instead of a footnote puts readers off.
