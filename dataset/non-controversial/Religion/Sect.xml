A '''sect''' is a group with distinctive [[religion|religious]], [[politics|political]] or [[philosophy|philosophical]] beliefs.  Although in past it was mostly used to refer to religious groups, it has since expanded and in modern culture can refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles. The term is occasionally used in a malicious way to suggest the broken-off group follows a more negative path than the original.  The historical usage of the term ''sect'' in [[Christendom]] has had [[pejorative]] connotations, referring to a group or movement with [[Christian heresy|heretical]] beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Wilson|Wilson, Bryan]] ''Religion in Sociological Perspective'' 1982, ISBN 0-19-826664-2 [[Oxford University Press]] page 89&lt;br&gt;&quot;In English, it is a term that designates a religiously separated group, but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation. A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A sect as used in an [[India]]n context refers to an organized tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;sai.uni-heidelberg&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The word ''sect'' comes from the [[Latin]] noun ''secta'' (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb ''sequi'', to follow&lt;ref name=oel_sect&gt;
{{cite web
| url         = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sect&amp;searchmode=none

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning &quot;(beaten) path&quot;, and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence [[metonym]]ously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines. The present gamut of meanings of ''sect'' has been influenced by confusion with the [[homonym]]ous (but etymologically unrelated) Latin word ''secta'' (the feminine form of the past participle of the verb ''[[Wikt:secare | secare]]'', to cut), as sects were scissions cut away from the mainstream religion.&lt;ref name=oel_sect/&gt;

==Sociological definitions and descriptions==
{{Main article|Church-sect typology}}
There are several different sociological definitions and descriptions for the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;available online&quot;&gt;McCormick Maaga, Mary excerpt from her book ''Hearing the Voices of [[Jonestown]]'' (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1998) [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/AboutJonestown/Articles/three.htm  available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first to define them were [[Max Weber]]  and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] (1912).&lt;ref name=&quot;available online&quot;/&gt; In the [[church-sect typology]] they are described as newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a [[Religious denomination|denomination]]). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or [[heresy]] in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to true religion. The American [[sociology|sociologists]] [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] assert that &quot;sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and Williams Sims Bainbridge (1979) ''Of Churches, Sects, and Cults: Preliminary Concepts for a Theory of Religious Movements'' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 18, no 2: 117-33&lt;/ref&gt; They further assert that sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark|Stark, Rodney]], and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] (1985) ''The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival, and Cult formation'' Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists of religion such as Fred Kniss have asserted that sectarianism is best described with regard to what a sect is in tension with.  Some religious groups exist in tension only with co-religious groups of different ethnicities, or exist in tension with the whole of society rather than the church which the sect originated from.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Kniss|Kniss, Fred]], and [[Paul Numrich|Numrich, Paul]] (2007) ''Sacred Assemblies and Civic Engagement''Rutgers University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sectarianism]] is sometimes defined in the [[sociology of religion]] as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Meredith B. &quot;Religion: the Social Context&quot; fifth edition (2002) ISBN 0-534-54126-7 page 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The English sociologist [[Roy Wallis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Barker|Barker, E]]. ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'' (1990), Bernan Press, ISBN 0-11-340927-3&lt;/ref&gt; argues that a sect is characterized by “[[epistemology|epistemological]] authoritarianism”: sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, “sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation and “their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'”. He contrasts this with a cult that he described as characterized by “epistemological individualism” by which he means that “the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member.”&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''[[The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology]]'' (1976) [http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html available online (bad scan)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corresponding words in other European languages==
In [[Europe]]an languages other than [[English language|English]] the corresponding words for &quot;sect&quot;, such as ''secte'' (French), ''secta'' (Spanish), ''seita'' (Portuguese), ''sekta'' (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Croatian, Serbian), ''sekt'' (Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish), ''sekte'' (Dutch), ''Sekte'' (German) or ''szekta'' (Hungarian), are used sometimes to refer to a harmful religious or political sect, similar to how English-speakers popularly use the word &quot;[[Cult (disambiguation)|cult]]&quot;. In [[France]], since the 1970s, ''secte'' has a specific meaning which is very different from the English word.&lt;ref&gt;Esquerre Arnaud, &quot;Lutter contre les sectes: l’invention d’un psycho-pouvoir&quot;, ''Le Banquet'', n°24, février 2007, p. 199-212&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==
{{seealso|List of Christian denominations|Christian denomination}}
The historical usage of the term '''sect''' in [[Christendom]] has had [[pejorative]] connotations, referring to a group or movement with [[Christian heresy|heretical]] beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Wilson|Wilson, Bryan]] ''Religion in Sociological Perspective'' 1982, ISBN 0-19-826664-2 [[Oxford University Press]] page 89&lt;br&gt;&quot;In English, it is a term that designates a religiously separated group, but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation. A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic sects===
There are many groups outside the Roman Catholic Church which regard themselves as Catholic, such as the [[Community of the Lady of All Nations]], the [[Palmarian Catholic Church]], the [[Philippine Independent Church]], the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]], the [[Free Catholic Church]], the [[Society of St. Pius X]], the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]], and others.

The ''[[Sodalitium Christianae Vitae]]'' started in Lima, Peru, has multiple cases of psychological abuses experienced by youth that were attracted to the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Los Misterios del Sodalicio | year=2001 | publisher= | url =http://www.agenciaperu.com/sociedad/2001/nov/sodas.htm | work =Agencia Peru | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-18 | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
{{Main|Hindu denominations}}
The [[Indology|Indologist]] Axel Michaels  writes in his book about [[Hinduism]] that in an Indian context the word {{quote|sect does not denote a split or excluded community, but rather an organized tradition, usually established by founder with ascetic practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;sai.uni-heidelberg&quot;&gt; {{cite book | url =[http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/abt/IND/mitarbeiter/michaels/cv.html uni-heidelberg website]|title = Hinduism past and Present (2004) translated from German &quot;Der Hinduismus&quot; (1998) page 319| publisher = Princeton University Press, ISBN 0-691-08952-3| accessdate = 21st of October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}} 
according to Michaels, 
{{quote|Indian sects do not focus on [[heresy]], since the lack of a center or a compulsory center makes this impossible – instead, the focus is on adherents and followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;sai.uni-heidelberg&quot;/&gt;}}
