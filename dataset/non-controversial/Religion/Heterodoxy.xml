'''Heterodoxy''' in a religious sense means &quot;any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] position&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of orthodoxy from[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=heterodoxy]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, heterodoxy is similar to unorthodoxy, while the adjective &quot;heterodox&quot; could be applied to a [[dissident]].

Heterodoxy is also an ecclesiastical [[Technical terminology|term of art]], defined in various ways by different religions and churches. For example, in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches heterodoxy may describe beliefs that differ from strictly orthodox views but that fall short of [[heresy]].

==Ecclesiastic usage==
===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Church]], the term is used to refer to [[Christianity|Christian]] churches not belonging to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox communion]] and holding doctrines different from those of Orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Orthodox Dogmatic Theology, by Fr. Michael Pomazansky, trans. by Fr. Seraphim Rose (Platina, CA: St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, 1994), pp. 243-246&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is used for any idea, thought, dogma, principle or lifestyle that is in conflict with the [[Orthodox Faith]]. In general, this term is used in two distinct cases: 1. Whenever Eastern Orthodoxy wants to classify something different, but not as different or thought to be as erroneous as [[heresy]]; 2. Whenever Eastern Orthodoxy wants, for any reason, to abstain from the use of the word [[heresy]].

===Roman Catholicism===
Heterodoxy in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] refers to views that differ from strictly orthodox views, but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid [[heresy]]. Many Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views, either on doctrinal or social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Hornsby-Smith, Raymond M. Lee and Peter A. Reilly (1985). &quot;Common Religion and Customary Religion: A Critique and a Proposal&quot;. ''Review of Religious Research 26(3)'', 244-252.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain, and &quot;the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God&quot; (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1261). A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are allotted to purgatory and then offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment. The belief is not orthodox, as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants; however, it is also not heresy, as the Church accepts that such a scenario ''might'' be possible.

===Protestantism===
Many Protestants, such as Lutherans, use the term ''heterodox'' to describe Christian teachings which are not in agreement with their understanding of scripture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Thus, other Christian (Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant) denominations with different teachings which are not heretical are considered heterodox. For example, the Catholic belief that the mother of Christ was born without original sin and remained a virgin throughout the rest of her life would be heterodox under this logic.

===Other usage===
The term ''heterodox'' is occasionally used by some [[Christianity|Christians]] to refer to themselves when they are in disagreement with orthodox understandings, but voice this disagreement while still maintaining the overall value of the tradition.{{cn|date=July 2012}} The heterodox Christian therefore remains in the tradition and attempts to stimulate constructive dialog around issues with which they disagree.

In 1912, a group of women, called the Heterodoxy, begin to meet as a feminist luncheon group. This group for &quot;unorthodox women&quot; included many prominent lesbians and would meet regularly until the 1940s in Greenwich Village.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

==Islam==
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''[[ghulat]]'' is used by Muslims for beliefs perceived as being extremely heterodox (more in line with the Christian use of the word &quot;heresy&quot;). In particular, the term is used by mainstream [[Muslims]] to describe the beliefs of minority Muslim groups who ascribe divine characteristics to a member of [[Prophet Muhammad]]'s family (especially [[Ali]]) or the early [[Sahabah|companions of the Prophet]] such as [[Salman the Persian]].  The assumption is that the groups thus described have gone too far and have come to associate them with God (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').

[[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam]] Muslims see each other as heterodox, differing in practice mainly on matters of jurisprudence or ''[[fiqh]]'', splitting historically on the matter of the succession of [[Ali]] to the caliphate by [[Muawiyah]]. A third and much smaller movement is [[Ibadi]], which differ from both of these groups on a few key points. Several ultra-orthodox groups such as the [[Wahhabis]], in turn, see themselves as the only truly orthodox groups within Islam.

The Shia [[Ismailis]], who in turn split from the Shia mainstream of [[Twelvers]] over another succession dispute, have subsumed several groups which the majority of Muslims view as heterodox, such as the [[Seveners]], and [[gnostic]]-influenced [[Alawites]], and many other [[religious sect|sects]] and subsects. The gnostic-influenced [[Druze]] sect has also been affiliated with the Ismailis, but some of its followers go so far as to see it as a [[religious denomination|distinct religion]] altogether. The [[Sufis]], divided into many [[List of Sufi orders|sects and orders]], incorporate many [[mysticism|mystical]] [[doctrine]]s and [[religious ritual|rituals]] into Islam, but many also consider themselves Shi'i or Sunnis. Another Shia group, influenced heavily by the Sufis, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] religion and other mystical movements, is that of the [[Alevi]]. Historical groups viewed as highly heterodox by most Muslims include the [[Kharijites]], who took a third view on Ali's succession (and are today succeeded by the [[Ibadi]]), the [[Mu'tazili]]tes, who most famously asserted that the [[Qur'an]] was created, a view which enjoyed [[Caliph]]al approval before the time of [[Mutawakkil]], the [[Qarmatians]], a branch of the [[Seveners]] within Ismaili Islam who took control of much of the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the 9th and 10th century, practiced [[vegetarianism]], took control of the [[Well of Zamzam]] and the [[Ka'bah]], and the [[Hashashin]] or [[Assassin]]s, another Ismaili group, famous for their reclusive lifestyle, manners of indoctrination and assassinations in the years after the [[First Crusade]].

According to [[Philip Hitti]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of the Arabs&quot;, Philip Khuri Hitti, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[caliphate]]s there was a marked tendency among several quite unrelated heterodox groups to affiliate themselves with the Shiites, particularly the Ismailis, in a general feeling of heterodox solidarity in a Sunni-controlled empire. The cause of the [[Alids]] thus became a rallying point for a diverse range of heterodox Islamic movements. The view that [[Ali]] was divine, though never mainstream within Shiism, is attested in the early centuries of Islam.

Two more recent movements seen as particularly at odds with the majority Muslim view are the [[Ahmadiyya]] and [[Nation of Islam]] movements. Many followers of the former consider its 19th-century founder, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], to have been a [[prophet]], as well as such other religious figures as [[Krishna]] and [[Buddha]], despite the mainstream Muslim view that [[Muhammad]] [[Seal of the Prophets|was the last]]. Both Ahmadi denominations consider Ahmad to have been the [[Mahdi]] and [[second coming of Jesus]]. The Nation of Islam is a [[Black people|black]] [[black supremacism|supremacist movement]] which acknowledges its 20th-century founder, [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], as an incarnation of [[Allah]], a view most Muslims consider [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism). [[Babism]] (most followers of which came to follow [[Baha'u'llah]] and became the [[Baha'i]]s) is viewed by many non-followers as originally having been a highly divergent movement within the Twelver Ismailism practiced in 19th-century Persia. Beyond heterodoxy, many elements of Islam have been incorporated into distinct belief systems several times, most specifically into [[Sikhism]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]], whose predecessor movement was [[Babism]]. As a more unusual example, several [[Thuggee]] were self-reportedly Muslims, and according to [[William Sleeman]] equated the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] with [[Fatima bint Muhammad|Fatima]], a daughter of Muhammad.

==Political usage against religion==
===China===
In late 1999 legislation was created in China to outlaw &quot;heterodox religions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 – 784&lt;/ref&gt; This was applied retroactively to [[Falun Gong]], a spiritual practice introduced to the public in China by Li Hongzhi (李洪志) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php Statement of Professor David Ownby], Unofficial Religions in China: Beyond the Party's Rules, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-ecclesiastic usage==
{{Main|Heterodox economics}}
Heterodox economics refers to [[schools of economic thought]] that are considered outside of mainstream orthodox economics. Heterodox economics refers to a variety of separate unorthodox approaches or schools such as [[institutional economics|institutional]], [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]], [[Socialist economics|socialist]], [[Marxian economics|Marxian]], [[Feminist economics|feminist]], [[Austrian School|Austrian]], [[Ecological economics|ecological]], and [[social economics]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[[JEL classification codes#History of economic thought, methodology, and heterodox approaches JEL: B Subcategories]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Frederic S., 2008. &quot;heterodox economics,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'',  2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_H000175&amp;q=heterodox%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1  Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;
