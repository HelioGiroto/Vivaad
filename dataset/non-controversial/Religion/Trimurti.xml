The '''Trimurti''' ({{lang-en|‘three forms’}}; [[Sanskrit]]: त्रिमूर्तिः ''{{IAST|trimūrti}}'') is a concept in [[Hinduism]] &quot;in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of [[Brahma|Brahmā]] the creator, [[Vishnu]] the maintainer or preserver and [[Shiva|Śhiva]] the destroyer or transformer,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For quotation defining the trimurti see Matchett, Freda. &quot;The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}&quot;, in: Flood (2003), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Trimurti system having [[Brahma]] as the creator, [[Vishnu]] as the maintainer or preserver, and [[Shiva]] as the transformer or destroyer see: Zimmer (1972) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; These three deities have been called &quot;the Hindu triad&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of trimurti as &quot;the unified form&quot; of Brahmā, {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} and Śiva and use of the phrase &quot;the Hindu triad&quot; see: Apte, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; or the &quot;Great [[Trinity (disambiguation)|Trinity]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;For the term &quot;Great Trinity&quot; in relation to the Trimurti see: Jansen, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; often addressed as &quot;Brahma-Vishnu-Maheshwara.&quot;

One type of depiction for the Trimurti shows three heads on one neck, and often even three faces on one head, each looking in a different direction.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 83; picture p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
[[File:Halebid3.JPG|right|300px|thumb|An art depiction of the Trimurti at The Hoysaleswara temple in [[Halebidu]].]]
[[File:Brahma Vishnu Mahesh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Trimurti, Painting from Andhra Pradesh]]
The Puranic period (c. CE 300-1200) saw the rise of post-Vedic religion and the evolution of what R. C. Majumdar calls &quot;synthetic Hinduism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For dating of Puranic period as c. CE 300-1200 and quotation, see: Majumdar, R. C. &quot;Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India&quot;, in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

This period had no homogeneity, and included orthodox [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in the form of remnants of older Vedic faith traditions, along with different sectarian religions, notably [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]], and [[Shaktism]] that were within the orthodox fold yet still formed distinct entities.&lt;ref&gt;For characterization as non-homogeneous and including multiple traditions, see: Majumdar, R. C. &quot;Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India&quot;, in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the important traits of this period is a spirit of harmony between orthodox and sectarian forms.&lt;ref&gt;For harmony between orthodox and sectarian groups, see: Majumdar, R. C. &quot;Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India&quot;, in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding this spirit of reconciliation, [[R. C. Majumdar]] says that:

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;toccolours&quot; style=&quot;float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;&quot;&gt;
Its most notable expression is to be found in the theological conception of the {{IAST|Trimūrti}}, i.e., the manifestation of the supreme God in three forms of {{IAST|Brahmā}}, {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}, and {{IAST|Śiva}}.... But the attempt cannot be regarded as a great success, for {{IAST|Brahmā}} never gained an ascendancy comparable to that of Śiva or {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}, and the different sects often conceived the {{IAST|Trimūrti}} as really the three manifestations of their own sectarian god, whom they regarded as [[Brahman]] or Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;For quotation see: see: Majumdar, R. C. &quot;Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India&quot;, in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maurice Winternitz notes that there are very few places in Indian literature where the Trimurti is mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Winternitz, volume 1, p. 452, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma as one being is strongly emphasized in the ''{{IAST|Kūrma}} Purāṇa'', where in 1.6 [[Brahman]] is worshipped as Trimurti; 1.9 especially inculcates the unity of the three gods, and 1.26 relates to the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;For references to {{IAST|Kūrma}} Purana see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 573, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham|A. L. Basham]] explains the background of the trimurti as follows, noting Western interest in the idea of trinity:

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;toccolours&quot; style=&quot;float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;&quot;&gt;Early western students of Hinduism were impressed by the parallel between the Hindu trinity and that of Christianity.  In fact the parallel is not very close, and the Hindu trinity, unlike the Holy Trinity of Christianity, never really &quot;caught on&quot;. All Hindu trinitarianism tended to favor one god of the three; thus, from the context it is clear that {{IAST|Kālidāsa}}'s hymn to the {{IAST|Trimūrti}} is really addressed to {{IAST|Brahmā}}, here looked on as the high god.  The {{IAST|Trimūrti}} was in fact an artificial growth, and had little real influence.&lt;ref&gt;Basham, pp. 310-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Freda Matchett characterizes the Trimurti system as one of &quot;several frameworks into which various divine figures can be fitted at different levels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matchett, Freda. &quot;The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}&quot;, in Flood (2003), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of trimurthi is also present in the [[Maitri Upanishad]], where the three gods are explained as three of his supreme forms&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Brahma, Rudra and Vishnu are called the supreme forms of him. His portion of darkness is Rudra. His portion of passion is Brahma. His portion of purity is Visnu&quot; Maitri Upanisad [5.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views within Hinduism==
===Sauram===
The Saura sect that worships [[Surya]] as the supreme person of [[Deity|godhead]] and [[saguna brahman]] doesn't accept the Trimurti as they believe Surya is God.  Earlier forms of the Trimurti sometimes included Surya instead of Brahma, or as a fourth above the Trimurti, of whom the other three are manifestations, Surya is Brahman in the morning, Vishnu in the afternoon and Shiva in the evening.  Surya was also a member of the original Vedic Trimurti, which included Agni and Vayu.  Some Sauras worship either Vishnu or Shiva as manifestations of Surya, others worship the Trimurti as a manifestation of Surya, and others exclusively worship Surya alone.

===Vaishnavism===
[[File:Shesh shaiya Vishnu.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Vishnu]] with [[Lakshmi]], on the serpent [[Ananta Shesha]], as [[Brahma]] emerges from a lotus risen from Vishnu's navel.]]
[[Vaishnavism]] generally does not accept the Trimurti concept.  For example, the [[Dvaita]] school holds Vishnu alone to be the supreme God, with [[Shiva]] subordinate, and interprets the [[Puranas]] differently. For example, Vijayindra Tîrtha, a Dvaita scholar interprets the 18 [[purana]]s differently. He interprets that the Vaishnavite puranas as [[satvic]] and Shaivite puranas as [[tamas (philosophy)|tamasic]] and that only satvic puranas are considered to be authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;name= Sharma&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first= B. N. Krishnamurti|title=A history of the Dvaita school of Vedānta and its literature: from the earliest beginnings to our own times|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|accessdate=2010-01-15| url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=Varaha+sarabha&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=sarabha&amp;f=false|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=2000|isbn=81-208-1575-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], a leading scholar of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], also distinguishes between Vishnu and Shiva, and states: ''&quot;Similarly, by expanding Himself as Lord Shiva, the Supreme Lord is engaged when there is a need to annihilate the universe. Lord Shiva, in association with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]], has many forms, which are generally numbered at eleven. Lord Shiva is not one of the [[jiva|living entities]]; he is, more or less, [[Krishna]] Himself. The example of [[milk]] and [[yogurt]] is often given in this regard – yogurt is a preparation of milk, but still yogurt cannot be used as milk. Similarly, Lord Shiva is an expansion of Krishna, but he cannot act as Krishna... The essential difference is that Lord Shiva has a connection with material nature, but Vishnu or Lord Krishna has nothing to do with material nature.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedabase.net/tlc/8/en1 The Teachings of Lord Chaitanya, Chapter 8: The Avataras] Author: [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other Vaishnavite schools such as those of [[Ramanuja]], [[Madhva]] and [[Chaitanya]], [[Swaminarayan]], guru of the Hindu Swaminarayan sects (including [[Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha|BAPS]]),did not differentiate between [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]]; [[Swaminarayan]], notably differs from practically all Vaishnavite schools in holding that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of the same God.;&lt;ref&gt;According to this site, http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll, verses 47, 84, of their scripture, [[Shikshapatri]], a key scripture to all followers of the Swaminarayan faith. [http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll] states, &quot;And the oneness of [[Narayana]] and [[Shiva]] should be understood, as the Vedas have described both to be brahmaroopa, or form of [[Brahman]], i.e., [[Saguna Brahman]], indicating that Vishnu and Shiva are different forms of the one and same God.&lt;/ref&gt; see also, verses 47, and 84 of [[Shikshapatri]], a key scripture to all followers of the Swaminarayan faith.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/index.asp?idCategory=2&amp;curPage=2&amp;MediaType= Swaminarayan Satsang - Scriptures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/index.asp?idCategory=2&amp;curPage=4&amp;MediaType== Swaminarayan Satsang - Scriptures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Swaminarayan followed a [[Smarta]] approach (see more detail on the Smarta view below) by instructing his followers to venerate all five deities of the [[Panchayatana puja]] with equal reverence.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism, by Raymond Brady Williams at http://books.google.com/books?id=tPkexi2EhAIC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Shikshapatri+Vishnu+shiva&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Shikshapatri%20Vishnu%20shiva&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaivism===
[[File:Main shrine of Prambanan temples.JPG|thumb|right|x216px|text|Shiva temple, the main shrine of 9th century [[Prambanan]] temple dedicated to Trimurti, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia]]
[[Shaivites]] hold that, according to [[Shaiva]] [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agama]], Lord Shiva performs five actions - creation, preservation, dissolution, concealing grace, and revealing grace. Each of the five actions corresponds to a name and form of Shiva. Respectively, these first three actions are associated with Shiva as Sadyojata (akin to Brahma), Vamadeva (akin to Vishnu), Aghora (akin to Rudra). Thus, Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra are not Deities different from Shiva, but rather are forms of Shiva. As Brahma/Sadyojata, Shiva creates. As Vishnu/Vamadeva, Shiva preserves. As Rudra/Aghora, he dissolves. This stands in contrast to the idea that Shiva is the &quot;God of destruction.&quot; To Shaivites, Shiva is God and performs all actions, of which destruction is only but one. Ergo, the Trimurti is a form of Shiva Himself for Shaivas. Shaivites believe that Lord Shiva is the Supreme, who assumes various critical roles and assumes appropriate names and forms, and also stands transcending all these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaivam.org/shpdestr.htm How can the god of destruction be the Supreme ?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smartism===
[[Smartism]] is a denomination of Hinduism that places emphasis on a group of five deities rather than just a single deity.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;worship of the five forms&quot; ({{IAST|[[pañcāyatana pūjā]]}}) system, which was popularized by the ninth-century philosopher [[Adi Shankara|{{IAST|Śankarācārya}}]] among orthodox Brahmins of the [[Smartism|Smārta]] tradition, invokes the five deities [[Ganesha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Devī]], and [[Sūrya]].&lt;ref&gt;Dating for the pañcāyatana pūjā and its connection with Smārta Brahmins is from Courtright, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For worship of the five forms as central to Smarta practice see: Flood (1996), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara|{{IAST|Śankarācārya}}]] later added [[Murugan|Kumara]] (Muruga/Subrahmanya/Karttikeya) to these five, making six total. This reformed system was promoted by {{IAST|Śankarācārya}} primarily to unite the principal deities of the six major sects on an equal status.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[monistic]] philosophy preached by {{IAST|Śankarācārya}} made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading [[Brahman]].
