The '''Torah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔː|r|ə}}; {{lang-he-n|תּוֹרָה}}, &quot;Instruction&quot;, &quot;Teaching&quot;) is the Jewish name for the first five books of the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]]. In Hebrew the five books are named by the [[Incipit|first phrase]] in the text: ''Bereshit'' (&quot;In [the] beginning&quot;, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]), ''Shemot'' (&quot;Names&quot;, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]), ''Vayikra'' (&quot;He called&quot;, [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Miller ''The Gutnick Edition Chumash—the Book of Leviticus'' p. 1. 2005 &quot;... Vayikra means &quot;He called&quot;, as in the opening verse of our Parsha, &quot;He called to Moshe&quot;. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;), ''Bamidbar'' (&quot;In the desert&quot;, [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]) and ''Devarim'' (&quot;Words&quot;, [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]).

In [[rabbinic literature]] the word Torah denotes both these five books, ''Torah Shebichtav'' (תורה שבכתב, &quot;Torah that is written&quot;), and an [[Oral Torah]], ''Torah Shebe'al Peh'' (תורה שבעל פה, &quot;Torah that is spoken&quot;). The Oral Torah consists of the traditional interpretations and amplifications handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation and now embodied in the [[Talmud]] (תַּלְמוּד) and [[Midrash]] (מדרש).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Concepts 1964, page 630&quot;&gt;Birnbaum (1979), p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; The words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a ''[[sofer]]'' on parchment in Hebrew. A [[Weekly Torah portion|Torah portion]] must be read publicly at least once every three days, in the [[Halakha|halachically]] prescribed tune, in the presence of a [[Weekly Torah portion|congregation]],&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Bava Kama 82a&lt;/ref&gt; which is the basis for Jewish communal life.

According to religious tradition, all of the laws found in the Torah, both written and oral, were given by God to [[Moses]], some of them at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] and others at the [[Tabernacle]], and all the teachings were written down by [[Moses]], which resulted in the Torah we have today. According to a Midrash, the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for Creation.&lt;ref&gt;Vol. 11 Trumah Section 61&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exilic]] period (c. 600&amp;nbsp;BCE) and that it was completed by the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian period]] (c. 400&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref&gt;page 1, {{Cite book |last=Blenkinsopp |first=Joseph |title=The Pentateuch: An introduction to the first five books of the Bible |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=1992 |isbn=0-385-41207-X |series=[[Anchor Bible Series|Anchor Bible]] Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning and names==
[[File:ReadingOfTheTorah.jpg|thumb|Reading of the Torah]]
The word &quot;Torah&quot; in [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] is derived from the root ירה, which in the ''[[hifil]]'' [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] means &quot;to guide/teach&quot; (cf. [[Leviticus|Lev]]. 10:11). The meaning of the word is therefore &quot;teaching&quot;, &quot;doctrine&quot;, or &quot;instruction&quot;; the commonly accepted &quot;law&quot; gives a wrong impression.&lt;ref name=&quot;EJ&quot;&gt;Rabinowitz, Louis Isaac and Harvey, Warren. &quot;Torah&quot;. ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 20. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. pp. 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Other translational contexts in the English language include [[Tradition|custom]], [[theory]], [[guide|guidance]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Birnbaum]], ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Concepts'', Hebrew Publishing Company, 1964, p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; or [[system]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 2767, Alcalay&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Torah&quot; is used in the general sense to include both rabbinic [[Judaism]]'s written law and [[Oral Torah|oral law]], serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative [[Jew]]ish religious teachings throughout history, including the [[Mishnah]], the Talmud, the Midrash and more, and the inaccurate rendering of &quot;Torah&quot; as &quot;Law&quot;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 164–165, Scherman, Exodus 12:49&lt;/ref&gt; may be an obstacle to understanding the ideal that is summed up in the term ''talmud torah'' (תלמוד תורה, &quot;study of Torah&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Concepts 1964, page 630&quot; /&gt;

The earliest name for the first part of the Bible seems to have been &quot;The Torah of Moses&quot;. This title, however, is found neither in the Torah itself, nor in the works of the [[Babylonian Exile|pre-Exilic]] literary prophets. It appears in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] (8:31–32; 23:6) and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (I Kings 2:3; II Kings 14:6; 23:25), but it cannot be said to refer there to the entire corpus. In contrast, there is every likelihood that its use in the post-Exilic works (Mal. 3:22; Dan. 9:11, 13; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh. 8:1; II Chron. 23:18; 30:16) was intended to be comprehensive. Other early titles were &quot;The Book of Moses&quot; (Ezra 6:18; Neh. 13:1; II Chron. 35:12; 25:4; cf. II Kings 14:6) and &quot;The Book of the Torah&quot; (Neh. 8:3), which seems to be a contraction of a fuller name, &quot;The Book of the Torah of God&quot; (Neh. 8:8, 18; 10:29–30; cf. 9:3).&lt;ref name=&quot;sarna&quot;&gt;Sarna, Nahum M. ''et al.'' &quot;Bible&quot;. ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 3. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. pp 576–577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars usually refer to the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the ''Pentateuch'', a term first used in the [[Hellenistic Judaism]] of [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;''The World and the Word: An Introduction to the Old Testament'' p. 163 ed. Eugene H. Merrill, Mark Rooker, Michael A. Grisanti. 2011 &quot;Part 4 The Pentateuch Michael A. Grisanti The Term &quot;Pentateuch&quot; derives from the Greek pentateuchos, literally, ... 1 The Greek term was apparently popularized by the Hellenized Jews of Alexandria, Egypt, in the first century AD &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; meaning five books, or as the Law, or Law of Moses. Muslims refer to the Torah as ''[[Tawrat]]'' ({{lang|ar|توراة}}, &quot;Law&quot;), an Arabic word for the revelations given to the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] ''[[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]]'' ({{lang|ar|موسى}}, Moses in Arabic).

[[File:Torah and jad.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sefer Torah]] opened for liturgical use in a [[synagogue]] service]]

According to Jewish tradition (later adopted by Christianity) the Torah was dictated to [[Moses]] by God, with the exception of the last eight verses of [[Deuteronomy]], which describe the death and burial of Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Jacobs|title=The Jewish religion: a companion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l1u-_VMDM80C |accessdate=27 February 2012 v|year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-826463-7 |page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Bava Basra 14b&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is based on the [[Mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, Sanhedrin 11:1&lt;/ref&gt; (100 BCE – 100 CE), the Mishnah being the first time that traditions that were transmitted orally from the time of Moses were put in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Introduction to [[Mishnah Torah]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also based on the Hebrew Torah&lt;ref name=&quot;Torah p. 87&quot;&gt;Christian bibles translate Torah, inaccurately, as &quot;the law&quot;, which lead scholars to conclude that the reference was to a particular set of laws, reaching a consensus that the reference was only to several chapters in Deuteronomy. Miller, ''A Nation is Born'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; that states in Deuteronomy 31:24–26; after Moses finished writing the words of this Torah in a book from beginning to end. He gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord: &quot;Take this Book of the Torah and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. There it will remain as a witness upon you&quot;. The Torah refers to this book of the Torah that was entrusted to the Levites in regard to rules pertaining to a king. Deuteronomy 17:18 states; When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this Torah, taken from that of the Levitical priests.&lt;ref&gt;Avigdor Miller, ''A Nation is Born'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the majority of academic scholars accept that the Torah does not have a single author, and that its composition took place over centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/id=Dkr7rVd3hAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Reading+the+Pentateuch:+a+historical+introduction#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=McDermott |first=John J., |title=Reading the Pentateuch: a historical introduction |publisher=Pauline Press |year=2002 |page=21 |accessdate=2010-10-03 |isbn=978-0-8091-4082-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century there was a general consensus around the [[documentary hypothesis]], which suggests that the five books were created c. 450&amp;nbsp;BCE by combining four originally independent sources, known as the [[Jahwist]], or J (c. 900&amp;nbsp;BCE), the [[Elohist]], or E (c. 800&amp;nbsp;BCE), the [[Deuteronomist]], or D, (c. 600&amp;nbsp;BCE), and the [[Priestly source]], or P (c. 500&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Wenham]], &quot;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html Pentateuchal Studies Today]&quot;, in ''[[Themelios]]'' 22.1 (October 1996): 3–13.&lt;/ref&gt; This general agreement began to break down in the late 1970s, and today there are many theories but no consensus, or even majority viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=T-Vi9eK_vS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Pentateuch+Social+Science+Commentary#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Van Seters |first=John |title=The Pentateuch: a social-science commentary |publisher=T&amp;T Clark |year=2004 |page=74 |accessdate=2010-10-03 |isbn=978-0-567-08088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the [[documentary hypothesis]] remain popular especially in America and Israel, and the identification of distinctive Deuteronomistic and Priestly theologies and vocabularies remains widespread, but they are used to form new approaches suggesting that the books were combined gradually over time by the slow accumulation of &quot;fragments&quot; of text, or that a basic text was &quot;supplemented&quot; by later authors/editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=T-Vi9eK_vS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Pentateuch+Social+Science+Commentary#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Van Seters |first=John |title=The Pentateuch: a social-science commentary |publisher=T&amp;T Clark |year=2004 |pages=74–79 | accessdate=2010-10-03 |isbn=978-0-567-08088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there has been a tendency to bring the origins of the Pentateuch further forward in time, and the most recent proposals place it in 5th century [[Yehud Medinata|Judah under the Persian empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=7cdy67ZvzdkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Introduction+to+reading+the+Pentateuch+Jean+Louis+Ska&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NmEjPoTnT4&amp;sig=TfQu3f9e_Ctke36o7eX1_MNqL8Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s7WlTN-pK8KycPT3jKcH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ska, Jean-Louis, ''Introduction to reading the Pentateuch'' (Eisenbrauns, 2006)] pp. 217 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on the current debates surrounding the promulgation of the Pentateuch see [http://books.google.com/books?id=axcRAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The+Pentateuch+as+Torah&amp;sitesec=reviews ''The Pentateuch as Torah: New Models for Understanding Its Promulgation and Acceptance''] (ed.

Deuteronomy is often treated separately from Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus. The process of its formation probably took several hundred years, from the 8th century to the 6th,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-yoFvN_QOjYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Deuteronomy+Patrick+D.+Miller&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3qO7pbqtP0&amp;sig=jsW4ktCbnQErFXbIm-9L2ry3n5Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rj6oTK-bB87IcbqNlc4N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Miller, Patrick D., ''Deuteronomy'' (John Knox Press, 1990)] pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; and its authors have been variously identified as prophetic circles (because the concerns of Deuteronomy mirror those of the prophets, especially [[Hosea]]), Levitical priestly circles (because it stresses the role of the [[Levites]]), and wisdom and scribal circles (because it esteems wisdom, and because the treaty-form in which it is written would be best known to [[scribes]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-yoFvN_QOjYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Deuteronomy+Patrick+D.+Miller&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3qO7pbqtP0&amp;sig=jsW4ktCbnQErFXbIm-9L2ry3n5Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rj6oTK-bB87IcbqNlc4N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Miller, Patrick D., ''Deuteronomy'' (John Knox Press, 1990)] pp. 5–8&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of the [[Deuteronomistic history]] proposed by [[Martin Noth]] and widely accepted, Deuteronomy was a product of the court of [[Josiah]] (late 7th century) before being used as the introduction to a comprehensive history of Israel written in the early part of the 6th century; later still it was detached from the history and used to round off the Pentateuch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=T-Vi9eK_vS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Pentateuch+Social+Science+Commentary#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Van Seters |first=John |title=The Pentateuch: a social-science commentary |publisher=T&amp;T Clark |year=2004 |page=93 |accessdate=2010-10-03 |isbn=978-0-567-08088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Jews, including a majority of Israeli Jews,&lt;ref name=jcpa&gt;Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Daniel Elazar Papers Index, Israel: Religion and Society [http://jcpa.org/dje/articles2/howrelisr.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the Torah was revealed to Moses by God, implicitly rejecting a theory that holds that the Torah was complied by an unknown editor from multiple sources. Reasons for this belief can be that it is supported by what they view as the historical narrative, that the Hebrew &lt;ref name=&quot;Torah p. 87&quot;/&gt; Torah in Deuteronomy 31:24–26, as well as the Talmud (Gittin 60a, Bava Basra 14b), state that Moses wrote the Torah, and that the [[Mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;Sanhedrin 11:1&lt;/ref&gt; asserts the divine origin of the Torah as one of the essential tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''A Nation is Born'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jews also accept the [[13 Principles of Faith]] that were established by [[Maimonides]], one of which that states; The Torah that we have today is the one dictated to Moses by God.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Commentary on Mishnah, Sanhedrin 11:1, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The five books of the Torah are known in Judaism by their [[incipit]]s, the initial words of the first verse of each book. For example, the Hebrew name of the first book, ''Bereshit'', is the first word of [[Genesis 1:1]]:

# ''Bereshit'' ({{hebrew|בְּרֵאשִׁית}}, literally &quot;In the beginning&quot;)
# ''Shemot'' ({{hebrew|שִׁמוֹת}}, literally &quot;Names&quot;)
# ''Vayikra'' ({{hebrew|ויקרא}}, literally &quot;And He called&quot;)
# ''Bəmidbar'' ({{hebrew|במדבר}}, literally &quot;In the desert [of]&quot;)
# ''Devarim'' ({{hebrew|דברים}}, literally &quot;Things&quot; or &quot;Words&quot;)

The Christian names for the books are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and reflect the essential theme of each book:

# [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]: &quot;creation&quot;
# [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]: &quot;departure&quot;
# [[Leviticus]]: refers to the [[Levites]] and the regulations that apply to their presence and service in the [[Temple]], which form the bulk of the third book.
# [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] (''Arithmoi''): contains a record of the numbering of the Israelites in the wilderness of [[Sinai]] and later on the plain of [[Moab]].
# [[Deuteronomy]]: &quot;second law&quot;, refers to the fifth book's recapitulation of the [[mitzvot|commandments]] reviewed by Moses before his death.

According to the [[Oral tradition]], the prose in the Torah is not always in chronological order. Sometimes it is ordered by concept according to the rule: &quot;There is not 'earlier' and 'later' in the Torah&quot; (אין מוקדם ומאוחר בתורה, ''Ein mukdam u'meuchar baTorah'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] [[Pesachim]] 7a&lt;/ref&gt; This position is accepted by Orthodox Judaism. Non-Orthodox Jews generally understand the same texts as signs that the current text of the Torah was redacted from earlier sources.

===Contents===
Bereshit (Genesis) begins with the so-called &quot;primeval history&quot; (Genesis 1–11), the story of the world's beginnings and the descent of Abraham. This is followed by the story of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] ([[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]), [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] (Genesis 12–50) and the four matriarchs ([[Sarah]], [[Rebecca|Rebekah]], [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]]). God gives to the patriarchs a promise of the land of [[Canaan]], but at the end of Genesis the sons of Jacob end up leaving Canaan for Egypt due to a regional famine. They had heard that there was a grain storage and distribution facility in Egypt.

Shemot (Exodus) begins the story of God's revelation to his people Israel through [[Moses]], who leads them out of Egypt (Exodus 1–18) to [[Mount Sinai]]. There the people accept a covenant with God, agreeing to be his people in return for agreeing to abide by his Law. Moses receives the Torah from God, and mediates His laws and Covenant (Exodus 19–24) to the people of Israel. Exodus also deals with the first violation of the covenant when the [[Golden Calf]] was constructed (Exodus 32–34). Exodus concludes with the instructions on building the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] (Exodus 25–31; 35–40).

Vayikra (Leviticus) begins with instructions to the Israelites on how to use the [[Tabernacle]], which they had just built (Leviticus 1–10). This is followed by rules of [[Tumah and taharah|clean and unclean]] (Leviticus 11–15), which includes the laws of slaughter and animals permissible to eat (see also: [[Kashrut]]), the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] (Leviticus 16), and various moral and ritual laws sometimes called the [[Holiness Code]] (Leviticus 17–26).

Bamidbar (Numbers) tells how Israel consolidated itself as a community at Sinai (Numbers 1–9), set out from Sinai to move towards Canaan and spied out the land (Numbers 10–13). Because of unbelief at various points, but especially at Kadesh Barnea (Numbers 14), the Israelites were condemned to wander for forty years in the desert in the vicinity of Kadesh instead of immediately entering the Promised Land. Even Moses sins and is told he would not live to enter the land (Numbers 20). At the end of Numbers (Numbers 26–35) Israel moves from Kadesh to the plains of Moab opposite [[Jericho]], ready to enter the Promised Land.

Devarim (Deuteronomy) is a series of speeches by [[Moses]] on the plains of Moab opposite Jericho. Moses proclaims the Law (Deuteronomy 12–26), gives instruction concerning covenant renewal at Shechem (Deuteronomy 27–28) and gives Israel new laws (the &quot;[[Deuteronomic Code]])&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the book (Deuteronomy 34) Moses is allowed to see the promised land from a mountain, but it is not known what happened to Moses on the mountain. He was never seen again. Knowing that he is nearing the end of his life, Moses appoints [[Joshua]] his successor, bequeathing to him the mantle of leadership. Soon afterwards Israel begins the conquest of Canaan.

==Torah and Judaism==
{{Judaism}}
[[Rabbi]]nic writings offer various ideas on when the Torah was composed. The revelation to Moses at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] is considered by most to be the revelatory event. According to dating of the text by Orthodox [[rabbi]]s, this occurred in 1312&amp;nbsp;BCE;&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;[http://www.aish.com/jl/h/48944541.html History Crash Course #36: Timeline: From Abraham to Destruction of the Temple], by Rabbi Ken Spiro, Aish.com.

The [[Talmud]] ([[Gittin]] 60a), brings two opinions as to when the Torah was written by Moses. One opinion holds that it was written by Moses gradually over many years as it was dictated to him, and finished close to his death, and the other opinion holds that Moses wrote the complete Torah in one writing close to his death, based on what was dictated to him over the years.

The Talmud ([[Minachot]] 30a) says that the last eight verses of the Torah that discuss the death and burial of Moses could not have been written by Moses, as writing it would have been a lie, and that they were written after his death by Joshua. [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Joseph Bonfils]] observed{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that phrases in those verses present information that people should only have known after the time of Moses. Ibn Ezra hinted,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ezra, Deuteronomy 34:6&lt;/ref&gt; and Bonfils explicitly stated, that Joshua wrote these verses many years after the death of Moses. Other commentators&lt;ref&gt;Ohr Ha'chayim Deuteronomy 34:6&lt;/ref&gt; do not accept this position and maintain that although Moses did not write those eight verses it was nonetheless dictated to him and that Joshua wrote it based on instructions left by Moses, and that the Torah often describes future events, some of which have yet to occur.

The [[Talmud]] (tractate Sabb. 115b) states that a peculiar section in the Book of Numbers (10:35–36, surrounded by [[Inverted nun|inverted]] Hebrew letter nuns) in fact forms a separate book. On this verse a midrash on the book of ''Mishle'' (English [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]) states that &quot;These two verses stem from an independent book which existed, but was suppressed!&quot; Another (possibly earlier) midrash, Ta'ame Haserot Viyterot, states that this section actually comes from the book of prophecy of [[Eldad and Medad]]. The Talmud says that God dictated four books of the Torah, but that Moses wrote Deuteronomy in his own words ([[Babylonian Talmud|Talmud Bavli]], Meg. 31b).

All classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely or almost entirely Mosaic and of divine origin.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on these issues from an Orthodox Jewish perspective, see ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Ed. [[Shalom Carmy]], and ''Handbook of Jewish Thought'', Volume I, by [[Aryeh Kaplan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ritual use===
[[File:Toras in Istanbul Ashkenazi Sinagogue.JPG|160px|left|thumb|Torahs in [[Ashkenazi Synagogue]] ([[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]])]]{{Main|Torah reading}}
Torah reading ({{Hebrew Name 1|קריאת התורה|K'riat HaTorah|&quot;Reading [of] the Torah&quot;}}) is a Jewish religious [[ritual]] that involves the public reading of a set of passages from a [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]]. The term often refers to the entire ceremony of removing the [[Torah scroll]] (or scrolls) from the [[ark (synagogue)|ark]], chanting the appropriate excerpt with special [[cantillation]], and returning the scroll(s) to the ark. It is distinct from academic [[Torah study]].

Regular public reading of the Torah was introduced by [[Ezra]] the Scribe after the return of the Jewish people from the [[Babylonian captivity]] (c. 537&amp;nbsp;BCE), as described in the [[Book of Nehemiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Book of Nehemia, [http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35b08.htm Chapter 8]&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, adherents of Orthodox Judaism practice Torah reading according to a set procedure they believe has remained unchanged in the two thousand years since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] (70&amp;nbsp;CE). In the 19th and 20th centuries CE, new movements such as [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] have made adaptations to the practice of Torah reading, but the basic pattern of Torah reading has usually remained the same:

As a part of the morning or afternoon prayer services on certain days of the week or holidays, a section of the [[Pentateuch]] is read from a Torah scroll. On [[Shabbat]] (Saturday) mornings, a weekly section (&quot;''[[parasha]]''&quot;) is read, selected so that the entire Pentateuch is read consecutively each year.&lt;ref&gt;The division of ''parashot'' found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in [[Mishneh Torah]], ''Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls'', chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the ''parashot'' for the Torah on the [[Aleppo Codex]]. Though initially doubted by [[Umberto Cassuto]], this has become the established position in modern scholarship. (See the [[Aleppo Codex]] article for more information.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] synagogues may read ''parashot'' on a triennial rather than annual schedule, [http://www.uscj.org/The_Authentic_Trienn7085.html ''The Authentic Triennial Cycle: A Better Way to Read Torah?''], [http://urj.org/worship/letuslearn/s7bechol/]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays, the beginning of the following Saturday's portion is read. On [[Jewish holiday]]s, the beginnings of each month, and [[ta'anit|fast days]], special sections connected to the day are read.

Jews observe an annual holiday, [[Simchat Torah]], to celebrate the completion and new start of the year's cycle of readings.

Torah scrolls are often dressed with a sash, a special Torah cover, various ornaments and a Keter (crown), although such customs vary among synagogues. Congregants traditionally stand when the Torah is brought out of the ark to be read, while it is being carried, and lifted, and likewise while it is returned to the ark, although they sit during the reading itself.

===Biblical law===
{{See also|Biblical law}}

The Torah contains narratives, statements of law, and statements of ethics. Collectively these laws, usually called [[biblical law]] or commandments, are sometimes referred to as the Law of Moses (''Torat Moshe'' {{hebrew|תּוֹרַת־מֹשֶׁה}}), Mosaic [[Mosaic law|Law]], or Sinaitic [[Sinaitic covenant|Law]].

==The Torah and Judaism's oral law==
{{See also|Oral Torah}}

Rabbinic tradition holds that Moses learned the whole Torah while he lived on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights and both the oral and the written Torah were transmitted in parallel with each other. Where the Torah leaves words and concepts undefined, and mentions procedures without explanation or instructions, the reader is required to seek out the missing details from supplemental sources known as the oral law or oral Torah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishinspiration.com/tape.php?tape_id=33 Rietti, Rabbi Jonathan. ''The Oral Law: The Heart of The Torah'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Torah's most prominent commandments needing further explanation are:

*[[Tefillin]]: As indicated in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin are to be placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes. However, there are no details provided regarding what tefillin are or how they are to be constructed.
*[[Kashrut]]: As indicated in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a kid may not be boiled in its mother's milk. [A kid being a young goat.] In addition to numerous other problems with understanding the ambiguous nature of this law, there are no vowelization characters in the Torah; they are provided by the oral tradition. This is particularly relevant to this law, as the Hebrew word for ''milk'' (חלב) is identical to the word for ''animal fat'' when vowels are absent. Without the oral tradition, it is not known whether the violation is in mixing meat with milk or with fat.
*[[Shabbat]] laws: With the severity of Sabbath violation, namely the death penalty, one would assume that direction would be provided as to how exactly such a serious and core commandment should be upheld. However, most information regarding the rules and traditions of Shabbat are dictated in the Talmud and other books deriving from Jewish oral law.

According to classical rabbinic texts this parallel set of material was originally transmitted to Moses at Sinai, and then from Moses to Israel. At that time it was forbidden to write and publish the oral law, as any writing would be incomplete and subject to misinterpretation and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Gittin 60b&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after exile, dispersion and persecution, this tradition was lifted when it became apparent that in writing was the only way to ensure that the Oral Law could be preserved. After many years of effort by a great number of [[tannaim]], the oral tradition was written down around 200&amp;nbsp;CE by Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]], who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law, the [[Mishnah]] ([[Hebrew]]: משנה). Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as &quot;Baraitot&quot; (external teaching), and the [[Tosefta]]. Other traditions were written down as [[Midrashim]].

After continued persecution more of the oral law was committed to writing. A great many more lessons, lectures and traditions only alluded to in the few hundred pages of Mishnah, became the thousands of pages now called the ''[[Gemara]]''. Gemara is written in Aramaic, having been compiled in Babylon. The Mishnah and Gemara together are called the [[Talmud]]. The Rabbis in Israel also collected their traditions and compiled them into the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. Since the greater number of Rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict.

Orthodox and Conservative branches of Judaism accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent halakha and codes of Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism deny that these texts may be used for determining normative law (laws accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text, but does not believe that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct.  Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and to disagree with it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah, should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oradam.org/OAC/FAQ |title=FAQ for Humanistic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Humanists, Humanistic Jews, Congregation, Arizona, AZ |publisher=Oradam.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Maurice Ascalon Torah Crown.jpg|150px|thumb|The ''Sefer Torah'', or Torah scroll, is often adorned with a decorative Torah crown (such as this silver example circa 1950), which signifies its sacred and holy nature.]] --&gt;

==Divine significance of letters, Jewish mysticism==
{{Further|Kabbalah}}
Kabbalists hold that not only are the words giving a divine message, but indicate a far greater message that extends beyond them. Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a ''kotzo shel yod'' (קוצו של יוד), the [[serif]] of the Hebrew letter ''[[Yodh|yod]]'' (י), the smallest letter, or decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase &quot;I am the Lord thy God&quot; ({{hebrew|אָנֹכִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ}}, Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in &quot;And God spoke unto Moses saying&quot; ({{hebrew|וַיְדַבֵּר אֱלֹהִים, אֶל-מֹשֶׁה; וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו, אֲנִי יְהוָה.}} Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, [[Rabbi Akiva]] (c. 50 – c. 135 CE), is said to have learned a new law from every ''et'' (את) in the Torah ([[Talmud]], tractate Pesachim 22b); the word ''et'' is meaningless by itself, and serves only to mark the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]]. In other words, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] belief is that even apparently contextual text &quot;And God spoke unto Moses saying&amp;nbsp;...&quot; is no less important than the actual statement.

One [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] interpretation is that the Torah constitutes one long name of God, and that it was broken up into words so that human minds can understand it. While this is effective since it accords with our human reason, it is not the only way that the text can be broken up.

==Production and use of a Torah scroll==

[[File:Page Pointers for reading of Torah.jpg|thumb|Page pointers for reading of the Torah]]

{{Main|Sefer Torah}}
[[Manuscript]] Torah [[scroll]]s are still used, and still scribed, for ritual purposes (i.e., [[Jewish services|religious services]]); this is called a ''[[Sefer Torah]]'' (&quot;Book [of] Torah&quot;). They are written using a painstakingly careful methodology by highly qualified scribes. This has resulted in modern copies of the text that are unchanged from millennia-old copies. It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning, and that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the 304,805 stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.

According to Jewish law, a ''sefer Torah'' (plural: ''Sifrei Torah'') is a copy of the formal Hebrew text of hand-written on ''[[gevil]]'' or ''[[qlaf]]'' (forms of [[parchment]]) by using a [[quill]] (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink. Written entirely in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a ''sefer Torah'' contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained ''[[sofer (scribe)|sofer]]'' (&quot;scribe&quot;), an effort that may take as long as approximately one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] are observed. See for example the [[Mishna Berura]] on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geniza.net/ritual/mb/letterforms.shtml Mishnat Soferim The forms of the letters] translated by Jen Taylor Friedman (geniza.net)&lt;/ref&gt; Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.

The completion of the sefer Torah is a cause for great celebration, and it is a [[Mitzvah]] for every Jew to either write or have written for him a Sefer Torah. Torah scrolls are stored in the [[holy|holiest]] part of the [[synagogue]] in the [[Ark (synagogue)|Ark]] known as the &quot;Holy Ark&quot; ({{hebrew|אֲרוֹן הקֹדשׁ}} ''aron hakodesh'' in Hebrew.) ''Aron'' in Hebrew means &quot;cupboard&quot; or &quot;closet&quot;, and kodesh is derived from &quot;kadosh&quot;, or &quot;holy&quot;.

==In other religions==
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity|Islam and Judaism|Tawrat}}

While [[Christianity]] includes the five books of Moses (the ''Pentateuch'') among their sacred texts in its [[Old Testament]], [[Islam]] believes that only the original Torah was sent by the One true God. In both religions they lack the religious legal significance that they have in Orthodox Judaism.

Among [[early centers of Christianity]] a [[Koine Greek]] version of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was used by Greek speakers ([[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]] [[Targums]] were used by Aramaic speakers such as the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]). The Greek version's name in Latin is the [[Septuagint]]: L. ''septem'' meaning seven, plus ''-gintā'' meaning &quot;times ten&quot;. It was named ''Septuagint'' from the traditional number of its translators. This Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures dates from the 3rd century &lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;, originally associated with [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. It contains both a translation of the Hebrew and additional and variant material. It was regarded as the standard form of the Old Testament in the early Greek Christian Church and is still considered canonical in the Eastern Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;p. 317, DeSilva&lt;/ref&gt; Though different [[Christian denominations]] have slightly [[Development of the Old Testament canon|different versions]] of the Old Testament in their Bibles, the Torah as the &quot;Five Books of Moses&quot; (or &quot;the [[Mosaic Law]]&quot;) is common among them all.

The [[Quran]] refers heavily to Moses to outline the truth of his existence and the religious guidelines that God had revealed to the Children of Israel. God says in the Qur'an, &quot;It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).&quot; [3:1]

Muslims call the Torah the ''[[Tawrat]]'' and consider it the word of God given to Moses. However, Muslims also believe that this original revelation was corrupted (''[[tahrif]]'') over time by Jewish scribes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahmed-deedat.co.za/bible/07.html Is the Bible God's Word] by Sheikh Ahmed Deedat&lt;/ref&gt; and hence do not revere the present &quot;Jewish version&quot; Torah as much. {{cite quran|7|144|end=144|expand=no|style=ref}} The Torah in the Qur'an is always mentioned with respect in Islam. The Muslims' belief in the Torah, as well as the prophethood of Moses, is one of the [[Six articles of belief|fundamental tenets]] of Islam.
