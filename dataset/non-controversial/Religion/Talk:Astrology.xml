== another Hindu reference sourced to astrologer James Braha ==

Recently MakeSense64 added a sentence to the Hindu astrology sub-section that was sourced to a self-published book by &quot;in-universe&quot; astrologer James Braha.  I raised the concern that this wasn't a reliable source, but no other editor shared this concern, and the addition to the article was allowed to stand.  '''If the editors on this page continue to consider Braha to be a reliable source, that's fine with me.'''  I've added another sentence to the beginning of the Hindu astrology sub-section using a different book by the same author and publisher.  If other editors now decide to revert, based on the logical view that Braha is NOT an acceptable source, then I think it would be consistent to also delete the other sentence that is sourced to Braha.--[[User:Other Choices|Other Choices]] ([[User talk:Other Choices|talk]]) 01:19, 3 August 2012 (UTC)
:I don't remember adding anything like that. I have done some cleanup in that section, but did not add anything. And where did you raise concern about &quot;my addition&quot;? Please do not speculate about who added what in the article. If you are not sure who added what, then just comment on content without mentioning editors. See [[WP:CIVIL]].
:The source you mention was added there last year by Coaster92: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrology&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=467304094]. Of course, there are probably better sources for that piece of information. 
:The sentence you now added appears rather useless to me, and I think you will need a much better source for statements about the &quot;culture&quot;. To use an astrology source for &quot;what astrologers believe or do&quot; would be one thing, to use an astrology source for general statements about Indian culture is quite another thing. Do you see the difference?
:You may also want to read [[WP:POINTY]], because the way you explain your edit here is pointing in that direction.[[User:MakeSense64|MakeSense64]] ([[User talk:MakeSense64|talk]]) 04:38, 3 August 2012 (UTC)

::Yes, I see now, you edited the sentence that cites Braha (which is why I thought you added the source), but you didn't add the source.  I raised my concern earlier [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Astrology&amp;diff=503691864&amp;oldid=503681942 here].
::I see the difference between using an astrology source for astrological practice and using it to illustrate a cultural point, so I removed that part from the sentence.
::Thank you for bringing up [[WP:POINTY]], and for being inclined to give me the benefit of the doubt.  My point here was to establish whether Braha (and by extension, other in-universe sources) is off-limits for the article in all cases, to clarify what I can and cannot reasonably propose for inclusion.  It was my understanding (per the cited diff above) that a self-published source like Braha was unacceptable in all cases, but I don't mind being corrected.
::It looks like Braha was earlier being used to reinforce a point made using a reliable source, but your cleanup eliminated the other source.--[[User:Other Choices|Other Choices]] ([[User talk:Other Choices|talk]]) 09:13, 3 August 2012 (UTC)
:::Can you be a bit more specific, and provide diffs of the source being removed, so we are all singing from the same hymn sheet. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 18:24, 3 August 2012 (UTC)
::::I think I figured out what happened.  In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrology&amp;diff=503033649&amp;oldid=503032485 this diff], you split in half a paragraph referenced to Lewis, moving the second half to another section and leaving the first part without a reference, except for the appearance that it was all cited to Braha.  Then MakeSense64 came along and cleaned up the paragraph with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrology&amp;diff=503409305&amp;oldid=503408444 this diff].  Perhaps a workable solution would be to remove all reference to Braha and restore some of the language drawn from Lewis, adding a citation.--[[User:Other Choices|Other Choices]] ([[User talk:Other Choices|talk]]) 02:52, 4 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::The cleanup I did in those sections was mainly to restore NPOV. We don't need to be describing Western astrology in the Hindu astrology section. It was written too much from the Western astrology point of view. We are just to give basic descriptions of the main traditions here, and further details are to go in the standalone articles about these traditions. We also try to consider due weight, so try to give somewhat similar space to these major astrology traditions.
:::::In answer to OC. Why are you trying to establish which (if any) in-universe sources can be used? The normal way of working is first try to write the article on the basis of the best and most independent sources we can find. Trying to add material on the basis of lower quality and in-universe sources is always the last stop, not the first thing to do. Previous problems with this article have always come with editors who insisted on adding questionable in-universe stuff. For example, if we were to write an article about the US presidential elections, we would also not start by using the publications of the Republican party as a source wherever we can, would we? [[User:MakeSense64|MakeSense64]] ([[User talk:MakeSense64|talk]]) 05:36, 4 August 2012 (UTC)
::::::Haven't got time to edit at the moment, but if you are looking for sources on Indian astrology there are scientific papers by [[David Pingree]]. We are only citing him once at the moment, and that's only a Britannica article he co-wrote. His papers should be a good start. [[User:Itsmejudith|Itsmejudith]] ([[User talk:Itsmejudith|talk]]) 10:04, 4 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::::Here's a [http://horoscopicastrologyblog.com/2008/12/11/the-transmission-of-hellenistic-astrology-to-india/ link] that summarizes Pingree's basic contribution to the study of Hindu astrology.  It's not a reliable source, of course, but its two footnotes tell us exactly where to look in Pingree's own writings, if anyone has the inclination and access to a good university library.
:::::::And [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keyword/vedic-astrology here's] a collection of astrology-related articles from the ''Times of India''.--[[User:Other Choices|Other Choices]] ([[User talk:Other Choices|talk]]) 05:16, 6 August 2012 (UTC)

:Quite a while ago, I added a a couple of lines about the difference between eastern and western astrology to make it more clear. I am not an expert in astrology and I could not make sense of the section, which very likely could be understood by someone more knowledgeable about the topic. I researched to find some explanation that might be helpful to a reader coming to this article with no background in the subject, but hoping to learn about the topic. I found the brief explanation in Braha's book. If there is a better source, so be it. My only concern/recommendation is to retain the brief explanation for newcomers to the topic.[[User:Coaster92|Coaster92]] ([[User talk:Coaster92|talk]]) 05:57, 12 August 2012 (UTC)

'''Let's help those who have joined us in midstream''' and tell them the fuss is about the following statement, which was once the opening of the Vedic section.  It is attributed to Mr. Braha:

''Hindu astrology is oriented toward predicting one's fate or destiny.''

I won't tell you this is generally accepted as true, as Mr. Braha has dressed up the fact that the majority of Indians want to know when they will get married, when they will get a job, when they will get promoted, if they will ever get rich, if their sons will make them rich, if their daughters will be beauties and attract handsome suitors - who will make them rich.  Indians who consult pandits are not spiritual at all.  They're very practical.  They want money.

Without the fancy &quot;fate&quot; and &quot;destiny,&quot; you could get pretty much the same statement from virtually any Indian astrologer.  Here is K.N. Rao, generally regarded as the leading, living Vedic astrologer, taken from the back of '''Risks and Tricks in Astrological Predictions''', published by Vani Publications, Delhi, second edition, 2007:

''The essence of Hindu astrology is its predictive brilliance with manifold techniques.  Eighteen ''rishis'' who gave us ''jyotisha'' and many more, whose name is less known, have contributed to the richest repertoire of predictive techniques of Hindu astrology.''

You could use that, but, oh, wait.  Neutral point of view and all that.  By contrast, the current opening statement, ''Hindu astrology originated with western astrology'', is David Pingree's private opinion.  Careful examination of the Yavana Jataka (it's properly two words, not one), the source of Pingree's claim, does not support his premise.  Pingree was an expert in ancient Greek and Middle Eastern texts.  A casual comparison of Vettius Valens' '''Anthologies''' - Greek astrology - with Vedic astrology, shows Indian astrology to be internally consistent.  Greek astrology was not (ref: '''Greek Horoscopes''' by Neugebauer and Van Hoesen, 1959).   This is largely due to the fact that equal house horoscopes only work in tropical climes, such as that of India.  Take them out of the tropics and with every degree past 30 N, they break down, but that's what the Greeks had because they did not have an effective counting system.  (Starting around 300 AD, the Indians did.)  Alexandria is at 31 N.  The latitude problem, combined with the number problem, explains both Chinese astrology, as well as the delayed arrival of astrology in medieval Europe.  So how, exactly, could the Indians profit from a faulty Greek system? 

The western assertion, there are no earlier Indian texts, ignores oral transmission.  Which Shri Rao has found to still be in existence, throughout modern India.  Here is the concluding paragraph from the back of '''Risks and Tricks''':

''From time to time, all over India I came across astrologers who used some of these techniques which are hinted at only in some books but not elaborated.  I tried them, modified or added to them sometimes from my own experience.''

Rao makes the same claim in some of his other books.  Given that I have a library of approximately 500 Vedic titles, Rao is in fact the only source for what he claims is unique.  If, after the Mongol invasion, the English colonization and the partition of the late 1940's, Rao can still find oral transmission, it is presumably deeply entrenched.  Indian astrology in fact goes far, far beyond anything the Greeks ever imagined.  Again, I have the books in my library.  

I've had a glimpse at Tibetan astrology.  Much of it was organized around the human hand, as in, counting on your fingers.  The Chinese were never that crude.

This is a lot of effort to expend on an opening sentence.  The current Wiki editors have, I presume, seen only one or two Vedic astrology books and are clearly out of their league.  For all Wiki editors know, James Braha is the [[Linda_Goodman]] of Vedic astrology - which, so far as what Mr. Braha has actually published, is very nearly true.  To his credit, Braha has nearly 30 years experience in the field.  He was trained by the late R. Santhanam, one of the leading pandits of his day.  Santhanam had numerous Sanskrit to English translations to his credit.  If I had to pick an American for a reference, I'd pass by Braha and go for Hart de Fouw and Robert Svoboda, but aside from them, Braha is very nearly at the top of living American Vedic astrologers.  If he won't do, you've got real problems.  And don't tell me about the &quot;in-universe&quot; thing.  You're simply inventing excuses.  If you want authoritative work, you will need to consult genuine authorities.  Not carping scientists.

== Merge in [[Astrologer]] ==

[[Astrologer]] appears to largely overlap with what is covered in the article already and seems ideal for a merger. Any opinions? [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 19:33, 25 August 2012 (UTC)
:As far as I remember from earlier discussion, the idea is to have an article similar to [[Astronomer]]. It is intended to describe their profession, practices, history... I did a lot of cleanup in that article last year, and it has been quite stable since (it used to be a kind of waste dump full of astrologer names). Just like we have articles like [[Mathematician]] and [[Biologist]], it makes sense to have [[Astrologer]] as a standalone article. And it appears to be properly sourced. [[User:MakeSense64|MakeSense64]] ([[User talk:MakeSense64|talk]]) 05:55, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
::I think a more meaningful comparison is not to a scientist but to other pseudoscientists like [[dowser]], which is a redirect. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 12:36, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
:::I would say astrologer is somewhere in between because it was considered a science for the larger part of its history (until it was split in astronomy and astrology). Dowsing never was a proper science, so that comparison is also not very useful. I would say that [[Astrologer]] mainly needs a good rewrite, because right now the article seems to be used mainly to describe &quot;astrology&quot;, rather than &quot;astrologer&quot;. [[User:MakeSense64|MakeSense64]] ([[User talk:MakeSense64|talk]]) 05:08, 27 August 2012 (UTC)
::::See [[Alchemist]] also, which was considered a respectable subject as well in past history. It could be merged and spun out if it ever got worked on. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]])

::::There was a point raised a few weeks ago that this article is focused on the cultural importance of astrology, not on what astrologers think and do.  If we merge in &quot;astrologer,&quot; then it seems that we'll have to expand the scope of this article, which is fine with me if that is where other editors want to go.--[[User:Other Choices|Other Choices]] ([[User talk:Other Choices|talk]]) 00:29, 28 August 2012 (UTC)

== Geoffrey Dean and Ivan W. Kelly Is Astrology Relevant to Consciousness and Psi? ==

I read the PDF but I am still not clear what test criteria they have used for their tests.

I have developed an application that can find whether you are a Man or Woman just by taking your birth time and place, and that is with 70 % accuracy. The accuracy is gained with the 35 people I have used for my test so far. 

But if I tried to predict, say, something like, when you gonna die or something, then I am bound to fail there. Astrological theories says that is not possible to predict. Then again if I tried to predict, when you going to get marry or something, I will definitely have a very low accuracy rate there too. You can use such test criteria only if you want to disprove it. 

I don't see GOD, so I conclude that god does not exist. Can I come to that conclusion too.. and prove that the Christianity is wrong.

So what I am trying to say here is that, this 'Geoffrey' may have used a set of wrong test criteria to prove astrology is wrong. unless he open his test criteria how we can trust his test and in what basis wiki uses his test results to disprove astrology.

:: --@IRWolfie, Thanks for your comment. '''But''' I cannot find the paper that claimed to have more details. The one I read is [http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/Dean.pdf &quot;Is Astrology Relevant to Consciousness and Psi?&quot;] and that virtually have no evidence what so ever on actual test criteria used. However it does have some test results. The results clearly indicated the inaccuracy of astrological conclusions. But my question is, have these tests conducted in right manner. It at least does not have the details of those astrologers participated in those controlled test. We need not just their names but their competencies as well in the paper. Unless you expose the details and link them from the wiki page, I don't think it is fair to use those so called controlled test to disprove astrology. — by [[User:C nirosh|L.W.C.

Regardless, the references gives enough information to obtain the article by usual scholarly methods.

== To me 'Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya' is an absolute dunce at Astrology ==

* What is his education on astrology? Nothing 
* Do you have any record of his formal education? I cannot find any.

But this guy's argument on astrology is quoted here with great respect. but have you guys quoted his understanding of the milky way galaxy too? He had said that 'Milky Way galaxy is a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the '''fixed stars'''' Is this accurate? What are those fixed stars that he had noted there?? Can anybody explain please?.

I have taken the part below from the wiki page itself..

:''&quot;And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and al-Dhanab, which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?&quot; —Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya''

Listen... What matter in astrology is not the gravitational force of a distance planet but their reflection of sun light and their positions in respect to earth. I don't think this guy knows at least the basics of astrology. You eat food, and that need for the growth of your body, but do you need the same amount of poisons to kill you too. In astrology Sun and Moon act like the food. You eat food every day, don't you? Other planets and two shadowy planets (Rahu and Ketu) act as medicines or poisons for you. Do you take medicine every day? How many kilos of paracetamol did you take to cure yourself from a regular fever? or cyanide to kill yourself? Now with this understanding think how good this 'Qayyim' argument is..... It seems to me that you guys have teamed-up just to disprove astrology. You find sources that help your course. I think you guys are burying the great goals Wikipedia initially had..

I can talk about Mercury and how influential it is, but does it matter here?

:I think the quote has just been in the article for years and noone has bothered to look at it. Bear in mind the guy has been dead for around 700 years. I'll have a look at it later and see what can be done. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 09:40, 4 September 2012 (UTC)
:: Yes, I researched a bit about the guy, I know he is dead now (the title is changed too). Wiki is all about constant reviews and corrections, so for how long the quote was their in the page does not really matter, if found wrong then shall be removed. In my mind, I don't think that he is educated/ respected enough in this field to quote his comment in this wiki page. — by [[User:C nirosh|L.W.C.

== Merge? ==

The principles and practice section is fairly bad, with citations and sourcing certainly lacking. We could selectively merge in [[Western astrology]], [[Hindu astrology]] and [[Chinese astrology]]. Does anyone have any thoughts? [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 22:27, 15 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
