{{Original research|date=December 2009}}
The intended meaning of the term '''''civil religion''''' often varies according to whether one is a sociologist of religion or a professional political commentator. The following discussion includes both perspectives followed by a brief history of the concept.

Within the contexts of the [[monotheism|monotheistic]], [[prophet]]ic, [[revelation|revealed]] faiths, civil religion can be problematic from a [[theology|theological]] perspective.  Being identified with a political culture and a leadership hierarchy of an existing society, civil religion's priestly role, can interfere with the [[prophet]]ic mission of a religious faith.  This has been the challenge religion faces upon entering the public sphere throughout all ages and cultures.  At times of national crisis civil religion commonly renews itself by becoming a platform for rebuking the sins of a people or its institutions, and by calling on citizens to be true to the nation's deeper values.

==Origin of term==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society.  For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the state by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, [[Rousseau]] outlines the simple dogmas of the civil religion:
# Deity
# life to come,
# the reward of virtue and the punishment of vice, and
# the exclusion of religious intolerance.&lt;ref name = &quot;RB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Italian Historian [[Emilio Gentile]] has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a [[Political religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Emilio: ''Politics as Religion'' (2006) Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of religion==
[[File:National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is often used for state [[funeral]]s for political leaders.]]
In the [[sociology of religion]], '''civil religion''' is the [[folk religion]] of a [[nation]] or a [[politics|political]] [[culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{cn|date=October 2012}}

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by [[leadership|leader]]s within that society.  On the other hand, it is somewhat less than an [[establishment of religion]], since established churches have official [[clergy]] and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:
*the invocation of [[God]] in political speeches and public [[monument]]s;
*the quotation of [[religious text]]s on public occasions by political leaders;
*the [[veneration]] of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach [[moral]] ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation's [[war]]s;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious [[symbol]]s on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for [[worship]];
*[[founding myth]]s and other [[national myth]]s
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
[[File:Arc De Triomphe 2004.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in [[Paris]] commemorates those who died in [[France]]'s wars.]]

Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term '''''civil religion''''' or '''''civic religion''''' to refer to [[ritual]] expressions of [[patriotism]] of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Although &quot;God&quot; is not mentioned in the Constitution of the United States of America, mention is specifically made of &quot;Nature's God&quot; in the opening sentence of the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;Christiano, Kevin. &quot;Sociology of Religion&quot; 2008, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among such practices are the following:

===Examples===

*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain [[National Day|patriotic holidays]];
*[[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]], such as the use of &quot;Under God&quot; in [[Pledge of Allegiance]] of the United States;
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a king;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified [[mythology|mythologized]] tales of [[Founding Fathers]] and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also [[romantic nationalism]]);
*[[monument]]s commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of [[reverence]] for the country or the Constitution or the King;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of '''civil religion''' substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch's coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States of America, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying [[oath of office|&quot;I do solemnly swear...&quot;]] (customarily followed by &quot;so help me God&quot;, although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying &quot;I do solemnly affirm...&quot; (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==
===Prehistory &amp; Classical antiquity===
{{Disputed-section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], his [[capite velato|head ritually covered]], conducts a public sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter]]
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the [[Pharaoh]] or the [[Chinese Emperor]] were considered manifestations of a [[Divinity]]. Tribal world-view was often [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]], the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian [[polis]] was a secular polytheism focused on the [[Olympian Gods]] and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian [[Ecclesia]] deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. [[Socrates]] was charged, tried, found guilty and condemned to death by drinking [[Conium|hemlock]] by the Athenian ecclesia. The charge was that he worshipped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor [[Augustus]] officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of Classical [[paganism]]. [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] were essentially local in character; the Roman Empire attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman [[Greek mythology|pantheon]].  In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'', the Altar of Peace, showing the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and his family worshiping the gods.  He also encouraged the publication of works such as [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid|Æneid]]'', which depicted &quot;pious [[Aeneas|Æneas]]&quot;, the [[legend]]ary ancestor of [[Rome]], as a role model for Roman religiosity.  Roman historians such as [[Livy]] told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue.  The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], the worship of the [[genius (mythology)|genius]] of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;O´Donovan, Oliver: ''The Desire of the Nations'' (1996) Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
The phrase &quot;civil religion&quot; was first discussed extensively by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his 1762 treatise ''The Social Contract'' (although this is a translation since Rousseau wrote in French).  As typically interpreted, Rousseau defined &quot;civil religion&quot; as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an [[afterlife]] in which [[virtue]] is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in [[freedom of religion|religious tolerance]].  Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments.

===Historiography===
In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as [[Robert N. Bellah]] and [[Martin E. Marty]] studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States of America, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of [[cultural anthropology]].  Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of &quot;religion in general&quot; without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish &quot;priestly&quot; and &quot;prophetic&quot; roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the ''public theology''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, ''Religion and Republic: The American Circumstance'' (1989) p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Civil Religion in America,&quot; a 1967 essay, Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is &quot;an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation.&quot;  Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging &quot;national self-worship&quot; and calling for &quot;the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert N. Bellah]], &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050306124338/http://www.robertbellah.com/articles_5.htm Civil Religion in America]&quot;, originally in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Dædalus, Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'', Winter 1967, Vol. 96, No. 1, pp. 1&amp;ndash;21.&lt;/ref&gt; Bellah identified the [[American Revolution]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist [[Robert Bellah]]. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America's unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil Religion in the U.S. was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, Civil religion was been used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God's will on earth. [[George Washington]] was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the [[Founding Fathers]] have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through [[Memorial Day]] rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Bellah, &quot;Civil Religion in America,&quot; ''Daedalus,'' Winter 1967, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The United States was settled in part by religious [[dissenter]]s from the established [[Church of England]], who desired a civil society founded on a different religious vision. Catholic and other Protestant religious traditions were strongly represented by some settlers and by later immigrants. 

The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader (George Washington), prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine) and martyrs (Boston Massacre, Nathan Hale), as well as devils (Benedict Arnold), sacred places (Valley Forge), rituals (raising the Liberty Tree), flags (the Betsey Ross flag), sacred holidays (July 4) and a holy scripture (The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine L. Albanese, ''Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England was disestablished (i.e. lost tax moneys) in Virginia and several other states during the Revolution. The 1787 Constitution forbids a national church and state taxation for churches disappeared after 1830. Religious denominations compete with one another for allegiance in the public sphere.  Secularism and agnosticism are also publicly legitimated and widespread.  These facts have made public displays of religious piety by political leaders important to a large sector of the population; lacking an established church, they may seek public assurance of those leaders' religious beliefs or general sense of moral conviction.

===Current issues===
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the U.S. and its friends in Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of &quot;[[Judeo-Christian]] tradition&quot;, a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all worship the same God and share the same values. 

Some scholars have argued that the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] can be seen as a main [[totem]] of a national cult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc.upenn.edu/USR/fcm/jaar.htm Marvin and Ingle (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the ‘political religion’ of each American.&lt;ref&gt;Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois January 27, 1838 [http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
