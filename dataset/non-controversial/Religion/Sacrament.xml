A '''sacrament''' is a sacred [[rite]] recognized as of particular importance and significance. There are various views on the existence and meaning of such rites.

==General definitions and terms==

Hexam's ''Concise Dictionary of Religion'' calls a sacrament &quot;a Rite in which GOD (or Gods) is (are) uniquely active&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hexam's ''Concise Dictionary of Religion'' &quot;Sacrament&quot; obtained at http://www.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/concise/WORDS-S.html&lt;/ref&gt; But within Christianity the word is used in a more restricted sense.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defines the sacraments as &quot;efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the [[divine grace|graces]] proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P35.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1131]&lt;/ref&gt; The catechism included in the [[Anglican]] [[Book of Common Prayer]] defines a sacrament as &quot;an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.&quot;

Some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions avoid the word &quot;sacrament&quot;. Reaction against the 19th-century [[Oxford Movement]] led Baptists to prefer instead the word &quot;[[ordinance (Christian)|ordinance]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=anImr8a1MVQC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=sacrament+ordinance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qa-iTfK6Gs6BhQfWxpCHBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sacrament%20ordinance&amp;f=false Jeffrey Gros, Thomas F. Best, Lorelei F. Fuchs (editors), ''Growth in Agreement III: International Dialogue Texts and Agreed Statements, 1998-2005'' (Eerdmans 2008 ISBN 978-0-8028-6229-7), p. 352]&lt;/ref&gt; practices ordained by Christ to be permanently observed by the church. &quot;Sacrament&quot; stresses mainly, but not solely, what God does, &quot;ordinance&quot; what the Christians do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gQ99dH6WLi0C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=sacrament+ordinance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qa-iTfK6Gs6BhQfWxpCHBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sacrament%20ordinance&amp;f=false James V. Brownson, ''The Promise of Baptism'' (Eerdmans 2006 ISBN 978-0-8028-3307-5), p. 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1113]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/index.html Sacramental Rites in the Coptic Orthodox Church]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiopianorthodox.org/english/dogma/sacramentintro.html The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Faith and Order]&lt;/ref&gt; teach that the sacraments are seven. The Eastern Orthodox Church also believes that there are seven major sacraments, but applies the corresponding [[Greek language|Greek]] word, μυστήριον (''mysterion'') also to rites that in the Western tradition are called [[sacramentals]] and to other realities, such as the Church itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7105 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, ''The Sacraments'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holy-trinity-church.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=140&amp;Itemid=140 Holy Trinity Orthodox Church, ''Orthodox Worship II: The Sacraments]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Catholic Church understands the word &quot;sacrament&quot; as referring not only to the seven sacraments considered here, but also to Christ and the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P27.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 774-780]&lt;/ref&gt; Anglican teaching is that &quot;there are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord&quot;, and that &quot;those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thirty-Nine Articles]], Article XXV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholic teaching==
{{Main|Sacraments of the Catholic Church}}
[[File:Seven Sacraments Rogier.jpg|thumb|left|360px|''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|The Seven Sacraments]]'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], ca. 1448.]]
The following are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]] of the Roman [[Catholic Church]], here listed in the order given in the Catechism:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1210]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Baptism]] ([[infant baptism|Christening]])
* [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]] (Chrismation)
* [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]]
* [[Penance]] (Confession)
* [[Anointing of the Sick]] (known prior to the [[Second Vatican Council]] as Extreme Unction (or more literally from Latin: Last Anointing), then seen as part of the &quot;[[Last Rites]]&quot;)
* [[Holy Orders]]
* [[Christian views of marriage|Matrimony]] (Marriage)

In the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, &quot;the sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P35.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1131]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church teaches that the effect of the sacraments comes ''[[ex opere operato]]'', by the very fact of being administered, regardless of the personal holiness of the minister administering it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/ncd06116.htm New Catholic Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; However, as indicated in this definition of the sacraments given by the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block a sacrament's effectiveness in that person. The sacraments presuppose faith and through their words and ritual elements, nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]'', 59, quoted in [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P32.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1123]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not every individual has to receive every sacrament, the Church affirms that, for believers as a whole, the sacraments are necessary for salvation, as the modes of grace divinely instituted by [[Christ]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P33.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1129]&lt;/ref&gt; Through each of them, Christ bestows that sacrament's particular grace, such as incorporation into Christ and the Church, forgiveness of sins, or consecration for a particular service.

==Eastern and Oriental Orthodox teaching==
{{Main|Sacred Mysteries}}
{{See also|Eastern Orthodoxy#Mysteries|l1=Eastern Orthodoxy&amp;nbsp;— Mysteries}}

The ''seven'' sacraments are also accepted by [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginmarybrisbane.org/about-us/coptic-church The Coptic Church, &quot;Sacraments&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacopts.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=29 Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate, Archdiocese of North America, &quot;Church Sacraments&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiopianorthodox.org/english/dogma/sacramentintro.html Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, &quot;Introduction to Church Sacraments&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://armenianchurchsydney.org.au/learning/church-sacraments/ Armenian Apostolic Church, &quot;Church Sacraments&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Eastern Orthodox tradition does not limit the number of sacraments to seven, holding that anything the Church does as Church is in some sense [[Sacramentals|sacramental]]. However it recognizes these seven as &quot;the major sacraments&quot;, which are completed by many other blessings and special services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7105 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, &quot;The Sacraments']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/store/books/gialopsos_seven_sacraments.html Orthodox Research Institute, ''The Seven Sacraments of the Greek Orthodox Church'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some lists of the sacraments taken from the Church Fathers include the [[Consecration]] of a Church, [[Monastic]] [[Tonsure]], and the [[Funeral|Burial of the Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyendorff, J. (1979). The Sacraments in the Orthodox Church, in ''Byzantine Theology''. Obtained online at http://www.lasvegasorthodox.com/library/Orthodox_Practices/The_Sacraments.htm&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, for the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Christian the term ''sacrament'' is a term which seeks to classify something that may, according to Orthodox thought, be impossible to classify. The Orthodox communion's preferred term is ''Sacred Mystery''. While the Catholic Church has attempted to dogmatically define the sacraments, and discover the precise moment when the act results in the manifestation of the grace of God, the Orthodox communion has refrained from attempting to determine absolutely the exact form, number and effect of the sacraments, accepting simply that these elements are unknowable to all except God. According to Orthodox thinking God touches mankind through material means such as water, wine, bread, oil, incense, candles, altars, icons, etc. How God does this is a mystery. On a broad level, the mysteries are an affirmation of the goodness of created matter, and are an emphatic declaration of what that matter was originally created to be.

Despite this broad view, Orthodox divines do write about there being seven &quot;principal&quot; mysteries. On a specific level, while not systematically limiting the mysteries to seven, the most profound Mystery is the Eucharist or [[Synaxis]], in which the partakers, by participation in the liturgy and receiving the consecrated bread and wine (understood to have become the body and blood of Christ) directly communicate with God. This differs from the Catholic view of transubstantiation in that the Orthodox don't claim to understand how exactly this happens, but merely state &quot;This appears to in the form of bread and wine, but God has told me it is His Body and Blood. I will take what He says as a 'mystery' and not attempt to rationalize it to my limited mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Holy Eucharist'' obtained online at http://www.orthodoxy.org.au/eng/index.php?p=74&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on mystery is characteristic of Orthodox theology, and is often called [[apophatic]], meaning that any and all positive statements about God and other theological matters must be balanced by negative statements. For example, while it is correct and appropriate to say that &quot;God exists&quot;, or even that &quot;God is the only Being which truly exists&quot;, such statements must be understood to also convey the idea that God transcends what is usually meant by the term &quot;to exist&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Anglican teaching==
{{Main|Anglican sacraments}}

[[Anglican]] sacramental theology reflects its dual roots in the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] tradition and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The Catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance Anglicanism places on the sacraments as a means of [[Divine grace|grace]] and [[sanctification]] while the Protestant tradition has contributed a marked insistent on &quot;lively faith&quot; and &quot;worthy reception&quot;. Anglican and Roman Catholic theologians participating in an Anglican/Roman Catholic Joint Preparatory Commission declared that they had &quot;reached substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_eucharist.html Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine from the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation] and [http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_elucid_euch.html Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement]. Accessed 2007-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thirty-Nine Articles|Article]] XXV&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XXV]&lt;/ref&gt; recognises only two sacraments (Baptism and the Supper of the Lord) since these are the only ones ordained by Christ in the Gospel.  The article continues stating that &quot;Those five commonly called Sacraments ... are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel ....but have not the like nature of Sacraments with Baptism and the Lord's Supper, for they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained by God.&quot;  These phrases have led to a debate as to whether the five are to be called sacraments or not.  A recent author writes that the Anglican Church gives &quot;sacramental value to the other five recognised by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches .... &quot; but these &quot;do not reveal those essential aspects of redemption to which Baptism and Communion point.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Word and Sacrament | encyclopedia=Celebrating the Anglican Way | publisher=Hodder and Stoughton | author=Seddon, Philip | editor=Bunting, Ian | year=1996 | location=London | page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Anglicans maintain that  the use of &quot;commonly&quot; implies that the others can legitimately be called sacraments (perhaps more exactly &quot;Sacraments of the Church&quot; as opposed to &quot;Sacraments of the Gospel&quot;); others object that at the time the Articles were written &quot;commonly&quot; meant &quot;inaccurately&quot; and point out that the [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]] refers to the creeds &quot;commonly called the Apostles' Creed&quot; and the &quot;Athanasian&quot; where both attributions are historically incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Principles of Theology | publisher=Church Book Room Press | author=Griffith Thomas, W.H. | year=1963 | location=London | pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Anglicans are also divided as to the effects of the sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Word and Sacrament | encyclopedia=Celebrating the Anglican Way | publisher=Hodder and Stoughton | author=Seddon, Philip | editor=Bunting, Ian | year=1996 | location=London | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some hold views similar to the Roman Catholic ''[[ex opere operato]]'' theory, that is that when the outward ceremony is duly performed the inward grace is necessarily given unless the recipient puts some obstacle in the way (''non ponere obicem'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Word and Sacrament | encyclopedia=Celebrating the Anglican Way | publisher=Hodder and Stoughton | author=Seddon, Philip | editor=Bunting, Ian | year=1996 | location=London | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XXVI  Article XXVI ] (entitled ''Of the unworthiness of ministers which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament'') states that the &quot;ministration of the Word and Sacraments&quot; is not done in the name of the minister, &quot;neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness,&quot; since the sacraments have their effect &quot;because of Christ's intention and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.&quot; As in Roman Catholic theology, the worthiness or unworthiness of the recipient is of great importance. Article XXV states: &quot;And in such only as worthily receive the [sacraments], they have a wholesome effect and operation: but they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation,...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XXV Article XXV]&lt;/ref&gt; and Article XXVIII on the Lord's Supper affirms &quot;to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XXVIII Article XXVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Exhortations of the Prayer Book rite, the worthy communicant is bidden to &quot;prepare himself by examination of conscience, repentance and amendment of life and above all to ensure that he is in love and charity with his neighbours&quot; and those who are not &quot;are warned to withdraw&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=The Worthy Communicant | encyclopedia=Thomas Cranmer | publisher=Turnstone Ventures | author=Bates, Hugh | editor=Johnson, Margot | year=1990 | location=Durham (UK) | pages=106f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran teaching==

Lutherans hold that sacraments are [[Sacred#Holiness_in_Protestantism|sacred]] acts of divine institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|28:19|50}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23-25|50}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:26-28|50}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|14:22-24|50}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|22:19-20|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=161 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever they are properly administered by the use of the physical component commanded by God&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:27|50}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:5|50}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:23|50}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|10:16|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=162 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the divine words of institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:26|50}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|10:16|50}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:24-25|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=162 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; God is, in a way specific to each sacrament, present with the Word and physical component.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|3:16-17|50}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:5|50}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:19|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=162 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earnestly offers to all who receive the sacrament&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:30|50}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|22:19-20|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=162 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; forgiveness of sins&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|21:16|50}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|2:38|50}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|3:3|50}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:26|50}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|3:21|50}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|3:26-27|50}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:28|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=163 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eternal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Peter|3:21|50}}, {{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=163 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also works in the recipients to get them to accept these blessings and to increase the assurance of their possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|50}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:5|50}}, {{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=163 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] defined a sacrament as an act or rite:
# instituted by God;
# in which God Himself has joined His Word of promise to the visible element;
# and by which He offers, gives and seals the forgiveness of sin earned by Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Small Catechism with Explanation, St. Louis: Concordia, 1991, 236&lt;/ref&gt;

This strict definition narrowed the number of sacraments down to two or three: [[Baptism#Reformation|Holy Baptism]], the [[Eucharist in the Lutheran Church|Eucharist]], and for some, [[Confession in the Lutheran Church|Holy Absolution]], with the other four rites eliminated for not having a visible element or the ability to forgive sin. Lutherans do not dogmatically define the exact number of sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XIII, 2: &quot;We believe we have the duty not to neglect any of the rites and ceremonies instituted in Scripture, whatever their number. We do not think it makes much difference if, for purposes of teaching, the enumeration varies, provided what is handed down in Scripture is preserved&quot; (cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., ''The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 211).&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Luther's initial statement in his Large Catechism some Lutherans speak of only two sacraments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Luther's Large Catechism]] IV, 1: &quot;We have now finished the three chief parts of the common Christian doctrine. Besides these we have yet to speak of '''our two Sacraments''' instituted by Christ, of which also every Christian ought to have at least an ordinary, brief instruction, because without them there can be no Christian; although, alas! hitherto no instruction concerning them has been given&quot; (emphasis added; cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., ''The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 733).&lt;/ref&gt; Baptism and the Eucharist, although later in the same work he calls Confession and Absolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:23;&amp;version=47; John 20:23], and Engelder, T.E.W., &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics]. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 112-3, Part XXVI &quot;The Ministry&quot;, paragraph 156.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the third sacrament&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luther's Large Catechism]] IV, 74-75: &quot;And here you see that Baptism, both in its power and signification, comprehends also the '''third Sacrament, which has been called repentance''', as it is really nothing else than Baptism&quot; (emphasis added; cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., ''The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 751).&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of sacrament in the [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] lists Absolution as one of them.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XIII, 3, 4: &quot;If we define the sacraments as rites, which have the command of God and to which the promise of grace has been added, it is easy to determine what the sacraments are, properly speaking. For humanly instituted rites are not sacraments, properly speaking, because human beings do not have the authority to promise grace. Therefore signs instituted without the command of God are not sure signs of grace, even though they perhaps serve to teach or admonish the common folk. Therefore, the sacraments are actually baptism, the Lord’s Supper, and absolution (the sacrament of repentance)&quot; (cf. Tappert, 211). [http://www.bookofconcord.com/augsburgdefense/12_sacraments.html Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article 13, Of the Number and Use of the Sacraments]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that although Lutherans do not consider the other four rites as sacraments, they are still retained and used in the Lutheran church. Within Lutheranism, the sacraments are a [[Means of Grace]], and, together with the [[Bible|Word of God]], empower the Church for mission.&lt;ref&gt;Use and Means of Grace, Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1997, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings of other Christian traditions==
[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|left|frame|The [[Eucharist]] (also called Holy Communion or the Lord’s Supper) is considered a sacrament, ordinance, or equivalent in most Christian denominations.]]

The enumeration, naming, understanding, and the adoption of the sacraments formally vary according to [[religious denomination|denomination]], although the finer theological distinctions are not always understood and may not even be known to many of the faithful. Many [[Protestants]] and other post-Reformation traditions affirm Luther's definition and have only Baptism and Eucharist (or Communion or the Lord's Supper) as sacraments, while others see the ritual as merely symbolic, and still others do not have a sacramental dimension at all{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

In addition to the traditional seven sacraments, other rituals have been considered sacraments by some Christian traditions. In particular, [[feet washing|foot washing]] as seen in [[Anabaptist]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[German Baptist]] groups or [[True Jesus Church]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tjc.org/catLanding.aspx?tab=follow&amp;catno=follow06&lt;/ref&gt; and the hearing of the Gospel, as understood by a few Christian groups (such as the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] of America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hierarchy.religare.ru/h-nacion-pncc.html Польская национальная католическая церковь] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;), have been considered sacraments by some churches.

Since some post-Reformation denominations do not regard clergy as having a classically [[sacerdotalism|sacerdotal]] or priestly function, they avoid the term &quot;sacrament&quot;, preferring the terms &quot;sacerdotal function&quot;, &quot;ordinance&quot;, or &quot;tradition&quot;.  This belief invests the efficacy of the ''ordinance'' in the obedience and participation of the believer and the witness of the presiding minister and the congregation. This view stems from a highly developed concept of the [[priesthood of all believers]]. In this sense, the believer himself or herself performs the sacerdotal role {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

[[Baptists]] and [[Pentecostals]], among other [[Christian denominations]], use the word ''ordinance'', rather than ''sacrament'' because of certain [[sacerdotalism|sacerdotal]] ideas connected, in their view, with the word ''sacrament.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/pentecostal_4.shtml |title=BBC: Religion and Ethics: Pentecostalism |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches argue that the word ''ordinance'' points to the ordaining authority of [[Christ]] which lies behind the practice.

===Latter Day Saints===
====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
{{Main|Sacrament (LDS Church)|Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)}}
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] use the word &quot;[[Sacrament (LDS Church)|Sacrament]]&quot; solely for the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], in which participants eat bread and drink wine (or water, since the late 1800s). It is similar to the Eucharist or Holy Communion in other Christian denominations. In LDS congregations, the Sacrament is normally provided every Sunday as part of the [[Sacrament meeting]]. In LDS teachings however, the word ''[[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinance]]'' is used approximately as the word ''sacrament'' is used in Christianity in general.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. In terms of Ordinances which roughly equate to Christian sacraments in terms of conferring an invisible form of grace the LDS have several which are of a saving nature and are required for &quot;[[Exaltation (LDS Church)|exaltation]]&quot;. These are: [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptism]], [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]], [[Ordaination#Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Ordination]] to the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] and [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek]] Priesthoods (in the case of men),
the temple [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]], and [[Celestial Marriage]].

There are other ordinances which are performed, but which are not required for salvation; these are &quot;[[Sacrament (LDS Church)|Sacrament]]&quot; or the Lord's Supper, [[Anointing of the Sick#Latter Day Saints|ministering to the sick]], the naming and blessing of a child, dedication of a grave, [[patriarchal blessing]]s, and various other blessings of comfort and counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Gospel Topics: Ordinances.

====Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints)====
{{Main|Sacrament (Community of Christ)}}
The [[Community of Christ]] holds that the sacraments express the continuing presence of Christ through the Church. They help believers establish and continually renew their relationship with God. Through them believers establish or reaffirm their covenant with God in response to God’s grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Stephen M. Veazey |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/Oct06/sacraments-Veazey.asp |title=Community of Christ: Sacraments in the Community of Christ  |publisher=Cofchrist.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their denomination recognizes [[Sacraments (Community of Christ)|eight sacraments]]:
[[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], The [[Blessing of Children]], [[Eucharist|The Lord's Supper]], [[Marriage]], [[Administration to the sick]], [[Ordination (community of Christ)|Ordination]], and The [[Evangelist's blessing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Communication Services of Community of Christ, Independence Mo. |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/default.asp |title=Community of Christ: The Sacraments |publisher=Cofchrist.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-sacramental churches===
Some denominations do not have a sacramental dimension (or equivalent) at all. The [[Salvation Army]] does not practice formal sacraments for a variety of reasons, including a belief that it is better to concentrate on the reality behind the symbols; however, it does not forbid its members from receiving sacraments in other denominations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-dynamic-arrays/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument The Salvation Army: Why does The Salvation Army not baptise or hold communion?].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] (Religious Society of Friends) also do not practice formal sacraments, believing that all activities should be considered holy. Rather, they are focused on an inward transformation of one's whole life. Some Quakers use the words &quot;Baptism&quot; and &quot;Communion&quot; to describe the experience of Christ's presence and his ministry in worship.&lt;ref&gt;
