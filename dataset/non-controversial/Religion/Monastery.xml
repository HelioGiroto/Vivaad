'''Monastery''' (plural: '''monasteries''') denotes the building, or complex of buildings,  comprising the domestic quarters and workplace(s) of [[Monasticism|monastics]], whether [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s, and whether living in [[Cenobium|community]] or alone ([[hermits]]). The monastery generally includes a place reserved for [[prayer]] which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]].

Monasteries may vary greatly in size, comprising a small dwelling accommodating only a [[hermit]], or in the case of [[Cenobium|communities]] anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, dormitory, [[cloister]], [[refectory]], library, balneary and infirmary. Depending on the location, the  monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community. These may include a hospice, a school and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn, a forge or a brewery. 

In English usage, the term &quot;monastery&quot; is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of  monks. In modern usage &quot;[[convent]]&quot; tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics (nuns), particularly communities of teaching or nursing [[nun|Religious Sisters]]. Historically, a convent denoted a house of [[friar]]s, (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a &quot;friary&quot;. Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways.  

In most religions the life inside monasteries is governed by community rules that stipulate the gender of the inhabitants and require them to remain [[Celibacy|celibate]] and own little or no personal property. The degree to which life inside a particular monastery is socially separate from the surrounding populace can also vary widely; some religious traditions mandate isolation for purposes of contemplation removed from the everyday world, in which case members of the monastic community may spend most of their time isolated even from each other. Others focus on interacting with the local communities to provide services, such as teaching, medical care, or [[evangelism]]. Some monastic communities are only occupied seasonally, depending both on the traditions involved and the local weather, and people may be part of a monastic community for periods ranging from a few days at a time to almost an entire lifetime.

The life within the walls of a monastery may be supported in several ways: by manufacturing and selling goods, often [[agricultural]] products, by donations or [[alms]], by rental or investment incomes, and by funds from other organizations within the religion, which in the past formed the traditional support of monasteries.  There has been a long tradition of [[Christian]] monasteries providing hospitable, charitable and hospital services.  Monasteries have always been associated with the provision of education and the encouragement of scholarship and research, which has led to the establishment of schools and colleges and the association with universities.  [[Christian]] monastic life has adapted to modern society by offering computer services, [[accounting]] services and management as well as modern hospital and educational administration.

== Etymology ==
[[File:St gall plan.jpg|thumb|The [[Plan of Saint Gall]], the [[ground plan]] of an unbuilt abbey, providing for all of the needs of the monks within the confines of the monastery walls.]]
The word ''monastery'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''μοναστήριον'', neut.  of ''μοναστήριος'' - ''monasterios'' from ''μονάζειν'' - ''monazein'' &quot;to live alone&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=monastery&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; from the root ''μόνος'' - ''monos'' &quot;alone&quot; (originally all Christian monks were hermits); the suffix &quot;-terion&quot; denotes a &quot;place for doing something&quot;.  The earliest extant use of the term ''monastērion'' is by the 1st century AD [[Jew]]ish philosopher [[Philo]] in ''On The Contemplative Life,'' ch. III. 

In England the word ''monastery'' was also applied to the habitation of a [[bishop]] and the [[cathedral]] [[clergy]] who lived apart from the lay community. Most cathedrals were not monasteries, and were served by [[Canon (priest)|canons secular]], which were communal but not monastic. However some were run by monastic orders, such as [[York Minster]]. [[Westminster Abbey]] was for a short time a cathedral, and was a [[Benedictine]] monastery until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], and its [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] preserves elements of the Benedictine tradition. See the entry [[cathedral]]. They are also to be distinguished from collegiate churches, such as [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]].

===Terms===
In most of this article, the term ''monastery'' is used generically to refer to any of a number of types of religious community. In the [[Roman Catholic]] religion and to some extent in certain other branches of [[Christianity]], there is a somewhat more specific definition of the term and many related terms.

[[Buddhist]] monasteries are generally called '''[[vihara]]''' ([[Pali]] language). Viharas may be occupied by males or females, and in keeping with common English usage, a vihara populated by females may often be called a nunnery or a convent. However, vihara can also refer to a [[temple]]. In Tibetan Buddhism, monasteries are often called  '''[[gompa]]'''. In [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], a monastery is called a [[wat]].

A monastery may be an abbey (i.e., under the rule of an [[abbot]]), or a '''[[priory]]''' (under the rule of a [[prior]]), or conceivably a '''[[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]''' (the dwelling of a [[hermit]]).  It may be a community of men ([[monk]]s) or of women ([[nun]]s). A '''[[wikt:charterhouse|charterhouse]]''' is any monastery belonging to the [[Carthusian]] order.  In [[Eastern Christianity]] a very small monastic community can be called a '''[[skete]]''', and a very large or important monastery can be given the dignity of a '''[[lavra]]'''.

The great communal life of a Christian monastery is called [[cenobitic]], as opposed to the [[anchorite|anchoretic]] (or anchoritic) life of an [[anchorite]] and the [[eremitical|eremitic]] life of a [[hermit]]. There has also been, mostly under the [[Osmanli]] occupation of Greece and Cyprus, an &quot;idiorrhythmic&quot; lifestyle where monks come together but being able to own things individually and not being obliged to work for the common good.

In [[Hinduism]] monasteries are called [[matha]], [[mandir]], [[koil]], or most commonly an [[ashram]].

[[Jainism|Jains]] use the Buddhist term [[vihara]].

==Buddhism==

Buddhist monasteries, known as [[vihara]], emerged sometime around the 4th century BC, from the practice of [[vassa]], the retreat undertaken by Buddhist monks and nuns during the South Asian [[rainy season]]. To prevent wandering monks from disturbing new plant growth or becoming stranded in inclement weather, Buddhist monks and nuns were instructed to remain in a fixed location for the roughly three month period typically beginning in mid-July. Outside of the ''vassa'' period, monks and nuns both lived a migratory existence, wandering from town to town begging for food. These early fixed ''vassa'' retreats were held in pavilions and parks that had been donated to the ''[[sangha]]'' by wealthy supporters. Over the years, the custom of staying on property held in common by the ''sangha'' as a whole during the ''vassa'' retreat evolved into a more [[cenobite|cenobitic]] lifestyle, in which monks and nuns resided year round in monasteries.

In [[India]], Buddhist monasteries gradually developed into centres of learning where philosophical principles were developed and debated; this tradition is currently preserved by monastic universities of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhists, as well as religious schools and universities founded by religious orders across the Buddhist world. In modern times, living a settled life in a monastery setting has become the most common lifestyle for Buddhist monks and nuns across the globe.

Whereas early monasteries are considered to have been held in common by the entire ''sangha'', in later years this tradition diverged in a number of countries.  Despite ''[[vinaya]]'' prohibitions on possessing wealth, many monasteries became large land owners, much like monasteries in medieval Christian Europe.  In [[China]], peasant families worked monastic-owned land in exchange for paying a portion of their yearly crop to the resident monks in the monastery, just as they would to a [[feudal]] landlord. In [[Sri&amp;nbsp;Lanka]] and [[Tibet]], the ownership of a monastery often became vested in a single monk, who would often keep the property within the family by passing it on to a nephew who ordained as a monk. In [[Japan]], where civil authorities permitted Buddhist monks to marry, being the head of a temple or monastery sometimes became a hereditary position, passed from father to son over many generations.

Forest monasteries – most commonly found in the [[Theravada]] traditions of Southeast Asia and Sri&amp;nbsp;Lanka – are monasteries dedicated primarily to the study of Buddhist [[meditation]], rather than scholarship or ceremonial duties. Forest monasteries often function like early Christian monasteries, with small groups of monks living an essentially hermit-like life gathered loosely around a respected elder teacher. While the wandering lifestyle practised by the Buddha and his disciples continues to be the ideal model for forest tradition monks in [[Thailand]] and elsewhere, practical concerns- including shrinking wilderness areas, lack of access to lay supporters, dangerous wildlife, and dangerous border conflicts- dictate that more and more 'meditation' monks live in monasteries, rather than wandering.

[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] monasteries are sometimes known as '''lamaseries''' and the monks are sometimes (mistakenly) known as [[lama]]s.

Some famous Buddhist monasteries include:
*[[Jetavana]], [[Sravasti]]
*[[Nalanda]], [[India]]
*[[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]], [[China]]
*[[Donglin Temple (Jiangxi)|Donglin Temple]], [[Jiangxi]], [[China]]
*[[Tengboche]], [[Nepal]]

===Trends in Buddhist monasticism===
Some of the largest monasteries in the world are Buddhist. [[Drepung Monastery]] in Tibet housed around 10,000 monks prior to the Chinese invasion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Monks under siege in monasteries as protest ends in a hail of gunfire&quot; by Jane Macartney, March 12, 2008 ''The Sunday Times'', &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3528078.ece]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Today its relocated monastery in India houses around 8,000.

==Christianity==
:''Main article:'' [[Christian monasticism]]
[[File:Mor Hananyo.jpg|thumb|The Mor Hananyo, one of the many monasteries  of [[Mt. Izla]]]] 
[[File:Monasterio de Santa María de Valdediós.JPG|thumb|The Monastery of Santa María de Valdedió, Spain]]
According to tradition, [[Christian]] monasticism began in [[Egypt]] with [[Anthony the Great|St.&amp;nbsp;Anthony]]. Originally, all Christian monks were [[hermit]]s seldom encountering other people. But because of the extreme difficulty of the solitary life, many monks failed, either returning to their previous lives, or becoming spiritually deluded.

A transitional form of monasticism was later created by [[Saint Amun]] in which “solitary” monks lived close enough to one another to offer mutual support as well as gathering together on Sundays for common services.

It was [[Pachomius|St.&amp;nbsp;Pachomios]] who developed the idea of having monks live together and worship together under the same roof (Coenobitic Monasticism). Soon the Egyptian desert blossomed with monasteries, especially around [[Wadi El Natrun|Nitria]], which was called the &quot;Holy City&quot;. Estimates are the upwards of 50,000 monks lived in this area at any one time.

Hermitism never died out though, but was reserved only for those advanced monks who had worked out their problems within a cenobitic monastery.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Monastry1.jpg|thumb|[[St. Antony]] [[Coptic]] monastery, the first built monastery.]] --&gt;
The idea caught on, and other places followed:
*Upon his return from the [[Council of Sardica]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius]] established [[Monastery of Saint Athanasius|the first]] Christian monastery in Europe circa 344 near modern-day [[Chirpan]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liternet.bg/publish10/eshopova/manastiryt.htm|title=Манастирът в с. Златна Ливада - най-старият в Европа|publisher=LiterNet|language=Bulgarian|date=30 April 2004|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mar Awgin|Saint Eugenios]] founded a monastery on [[Mt. Izla]] above [[Nisibis]] in [[Mesopotamia]] (~350), and from this monastery the cenobitic tradition spread in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], [[Armenia]], Georgia and even India and China.
*[[Mar Saba|Saint Saba]] organized the monks of the [[Judean Desert]] in a monastery close to [[Bethlehem]] (483), and this is considered the mother of all monasteries of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches.
*St. [[Benedict of Nursia]] founded the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy (529), which was the seed of [[Roman Catholic]] monasticism in general, and of the order of Benedict in particular.
*The [[Carthusian]] Order was founded by Saint [[Bruno of Cologne]]at [[La Grande Chartreuse]], from which the Order takes its name, in the 11th century as an [[hermit|eremitical]] community, and remains the [[motherhouse]] of the Order.

The life of prayer and communal living was one of rigorous schedules and self-sacrifice.  Prayer was their work, and the Office prayers took up much of a monk's waking hours - [[Matins]], [[Lauds]], [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]], [[Terce]], daily Mass, [[Sext]], [[None (liturgy)|None]], [[Vespers]], and [[Compline]].  In between prayers, monks were allowed to sit in the cloister and work on their projects of writing, copying, or decorating books.  These would have been assigned based on a monk's abilities and interests.  The non-scholastic types were assigned to physical labour of varying degrees.

The main meal of the day took place around noon, often taken at a [[refectory table]], and consisted of the most simple and bland foods i.e.,&amp;nbsp;poached fish, boiled oats. While they ate, scripture would be read from a pulpit above them. Since no other words were allowed to be spoken, monks developed communicative gestures. Abbots and notable guests were honoured with a seat at the high table, while everyone else sat perpendicular to that in the order of seniority. This practice remained when monasteries became universities after the first millennium, and can still be seen at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]].

Monasteries were important contributors to the surrounding community. They were centres of intellectual progression and education. They welcomed aspiring priests to come study and learn, allowing them even to challenge doctrine in dialogue with superiors. The earliest forms of [[musical notation]] are attributed to a monk named [[Notker of St Gall]], and was spread to musicians throughout [[Europe]] by way of the interconnected monasteries. Since monasteries offered respite for weary [[pilgrim]] travellers, monks were obligated also to care for their injuries or emotional needs. Over time, lay people started to make [[pilgrimage]]s ''to'' monasteries instead of just using them as a stop over. By this time, they had sizeable libraries that attracted tourist. Families would donate a son in return for blessings. During the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s, monks helped to till the fields and provide food for the sick.

A Warming House is a common part of a [[medieval]] monastery, where monks went to warm themselves. It was often the only room in the monastery where a fire was lit.

====Catholic religious orders====

A number of distinct [[monastic order]]s developed within Roman Catholicism.

*[[Canons Regular]] (&quot;The Black Canons&quot;), which evolved from the [[secular clergy|secular]] [[Canon (priest)|canons]] who would normally work with the Bishop: now living together with him like monks under the [[Rule of St.&amp;nbsp;Augustine]]
*[[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine monks]] ('The Black Monks'), founded by [[St. Benedict]], stresses manual labour in a self-subsistent monastery. See [[Cluniac Reforms]].
*[[Cistercian|Cistercian monks]] ('The White Monks') (both of the Original Observance and of the [[Trappist]] reform)
*[[Bridgettine]] nuns and monks
*[[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit]]
*[[Carthusian|Carthusian hermits]]
*[[Gilbertine]]s
*[[Passionist]]s
*[[Poor Clares]] of all the observances
*[[Carmelites|Carmelite nuns]] (Calced and [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced]])
*[[Premonstratensian|Premonstratensian canons]] (&quot;The White Canons&quot;)
*[[Tironensian|Tironensian monks]] (&quot;The Grey Monks&quot;)
*[[Valliscaulian|Valliscaulian monks]]

While in English most [[mendicant Order]]s use the monastic terms of monastery or [[priory]], in the [[Romance languages|Latin languages]], the term used by the [[friar]]s for their houses is [[convent]], from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''conventus'', e.g.,&amp;nbsp;({{lang-it|convento}}) or ({{lang-fr|couvent}}), meaning &quot;gathering place&quot;. The [[Franciscans]] rarely use the term &quot;monastery&quot; at present, preferring to call their house a &quot;friary&quot;.

===Orthodox Christianity===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Canonical hours]] --&gt;
{{main|Eastern Christian monasticism|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], both monks and nuns follow a similar [[ascetic]] discipline, and even their [[religious habit]] is the same (though nuns wear an extra veil, called the ''[[apostolnik]]''). Unlike [[Roman Catholic]] monasticism, the Orthodox do not have separate religious orders, but a single monastic form throughout the Orthodox Church. Monastics, male or female, live away from the world, in order to pray for the world. 

Monasteries vary from the very large to the very small. There are three types of monastic houses in the Orthodox Church:
* A [[cenobium]] is a monastic community where monks live together, work together, and pray together, following the directions of an abbot and the elder monks. The concept of the cenobitic life is that when many men (or women) live together in a monastic context, like rocks with sharp edges, their “sharpness” becomes worn away and they become smooth and polished. The largest monasteries can hold many thousands of monks and are called ''[[lavra]]s''. In the cenobium the [[daily office]], work and meals are all done in common.
* A [[skete]] is a small monastic establishment that usually consist of one elder and 2 or 3 disciples. In the skete most prayer and work are done in private, coming together on Sundays and [[feast day]]s. Thus, skete life has elements of both solitude and community, and for this reason is called the &quot;middle way&quot;.
* A [[hermit]] is a monk who practises asceticism but lives in solitude rather than in a monastic community.

One of the great centres of Orthodox monasticism is [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]],  which, like the [[Vatican State]], is self-governing. It is located on an isolated peninsula approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} long and {{convert|5|mi|km}} wide, and is administered by the heads of the 20 monasteries. Today the population of the Holy Mountain is around 2,200 men only and can only be visited by men with special permission granted by both the Greek government and the government of the Holy Mountain itself.

===Oriental Orthodox Churches===
[[Image:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|thumb|[[St. Catherine's, Sinai|St. Catherine's monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]], early 6th century]]
The [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches, distinguished by their [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] beliefs consist of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Coptic Orthodox]] Church of Alexandria (whose Patriarch, is considered first among equals for the following churches), as well as the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], the [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]], the [[Indian Orthodox Church]], and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch. The now extinct [[Caucasian Albania]]n Church also fell under this group.

St. Anthony's (''[[Monastery of Saint Anthony|Deir Mar Antonios]]'') is the oldest monastery in the world and under the patronage of the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

===Other Christian communities===

The last years of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century marked in the Christian Church the beginnings of growth of monasticism among [[Protestant]] denominations. The centrus of this movement was in the United States and Canada beginning with the [[Shaker]] Church, which was founded in England and then moved to the United States. In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century many of these monastic societies were founded as Utopian communities based on the monastic model in many cases. Aside from the Shakers, there were the [[Amanna]], the [[Anabaptist]]s et al. Many did allow marriage but most had a policy of [[celibacy]] and communal life in which  members shared all things communally and disavowed personal ownership.

In the 19th-century monasticism was revived in the [[Church of England]], leading to the foundation of such institutions as the [[House of the Resurrection]], [[Mirfield]] ([[Community of the Resurrection]]), [[Nashdom Abbey]] ([[Benedictine]]), [[Cleeve Priory]] ([[Community of the Glorious Ascension]]) and [[Ewell Monastery]] ([[Cistercian]]), [[Benedictine]] orders, [[Franciscan]] orders and the Orders of the Holy Cross, Order of St.&amp;nbsp;Helena. Other Protestant Christian denominations also engage in monasticism, particularly Lutherans in Europe and North America. For example, the Benedictine order of the Holy Cross at St Augustine's House in Michigan is a Lutheran order of monks and there are Lutheran religious communities in Sweden and Germany.  In the 1960s, experimental monastic groups were formed in which both men and women were members of the same house and also were permitted to be married and have children—these were operated on a communal form. The Jewish [[Kibutz]] is a form of monasticism operating on a communal basis.

=== Trends in Christian monasticism ===
[[File:Buckfast Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 932824.jpg|thumb|[[Buckfast Abbey]], Devon, England, and its surrounding monastery, were rebuilt in the 20th century.]]
The number of dedicated monastics in any religion has waxed and waned due to many factors. There have been Christian monasteries such as &quot;The Cappadocian Caves&quot; that used to shelter upwards of 5,000 monks,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} or [[Rossikon|St&amp;nbsp;Pantelaimon's]] Monastery on the [[Mount Athos]] in Greece, which has held up to 3,000 monks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Today those numbers have dwindled and the entire population of the &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; may be 2,000. 

Some Orthodox monastic leaders that are critical of monasteries that are too large, arguing that they become institutions and lose the intensity of spiritual training that can better be achieved when an elder has only 2 or 3 disciples.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the Mount Athos there are areas such as the Skete of St&amp;nbsp;Anne, which could be considered as monastic entities but are small &quot;Sketes&quot; (monastic houses containing one elder and 2 or 3 disciples) who come together in one church for services.

There is a growing Christian neo-monasticism, particularly among evangelical Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Tenny-Brittian, ''Hitchhiker's Guide to Evangelism'', page 134 (Chalice Press, 2008). ISBN 978-0-8272-1454-5&lt;/ref&gt; Established upon at least some of the customary monastic principles, they have attracted many who seek to live in relationship with other, or who seek to live in an intentionally focused lifestyle, such as a focus upon simplicity or [[pacifism]]. Some include rites, noviciate periods in which a newly interested person can test out living and sharing of resources, while others are more pragmatic, providing a sense of family in addition to a place to live in.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Hinduism==
[[File:Vidyasankara.JPG|thumb|Hindu [[matha]], Vidyasankara Temple]]
From the times of the Vedas people following monastic ways of life have been in existence in the Indian sub-continent. In what is now called Hinduism, monks have existed for a long time, and with them, their respective monasteries, called [[matha]]s. Most famous among them are the chatur-amnaya mathas established by [[Adi Shankara]] which formed the nodal centres of under whose guidance the ancient Order of Vedantic monks were re-organised under ten names [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], [[Ashta matha]] (Eight monasteries) of [[Udupi]] founded by [[Madhvacharya]] (Madhwa acharya) a [[dwaitha]] philosopher.

==Sufism==
Islam prohibits monasticism which is referred to in the Quran as &quot;an invention&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  However, the term &quot;Sufi&quot; is applied to Muslim mystics who, as a means of achieving union with Allah, adopted ascetic practices including wearing a garment made of coarse wool called &quot;sf&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  The term &quot;[[Sufism]]&quot; comes from &quot;sf&quot; meaning the person, who wears &quot;sf&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  But in the course of time, sufi has come to designate all Muslim believers in mystic union.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Neoplatonist Roots of Sufi Philosophy&quot; by Kamuran Godelek,''20th World Congress of Philosophy'', &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/CompGode.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the roots of sufi philosophy there are influences of neoplatonist and other philosophies. Many of the practices of Orthodox Christian hermits and desert-dwellers were imitated in Sufism's growth in the center of the former-Christian lands of the Middle East.  Ascetic practices within the sufi philosophy were also associated with Buddhism. The notion of purification (cleaning one's soul from all evil things and trying to reach Nirvana and to become immortal in Nirvana) plays an important role in Buddhism. The same idea shows itself in the belief of &quot;fanaa&quot; (union with God) in Sufi philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Neoplatonist Roots of Sufi Philosophy&quot; by Kamuran Godelek,''20th World Congress of Philosophy'', &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/CompGode.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
