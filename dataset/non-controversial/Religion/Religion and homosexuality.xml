[[Image:2006 protesters at union square.jpg|thumb|right|Conservative Christian protesters at a 2006 [[gay pride]] event in [[San Francisco]].]]The relationship between '''religion and homosexuality''' can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different [[religion]]s and [[sect]]s, and regarding different forms of [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]]. Present day doctrines of the world's major religions vary vastly generally and by denomination on attitudes toward these [[sexual orientation]]s.

Among those sects that generally are negative towards these orientations, there are many different types of actions they may take: this can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality, to execution. Many argue that it is homosexual actions which are sinful, rather than the state of being homosexual itself. Several organizations exist that assert that [[conversion therapy]] can help diminish same-sex attraction. 

However within many religions there are also people who view the two sexual orientations positively, and many [[religious denomination]]s may bless [[same-sex marriage]]s and support [[LGBT rights]], and the amount of those that do are continuously increasing around the world as much of the developed world enacts laws supporting LGBT rights.

Historically, some cultures and religions accommodated, institutionalized, or revered, same-sex love and sexuality;&lt;ref name = BOSWELL1&gt;{{Cite document | last= Boswell | first= John | publisher= University Of Chicago Press | year= 2005 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; | unused_data= Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ASIA&gt;{{Cite document | last1= Dynes | first1= Wayne | last2= Donaldson first2= Stephen | title= Asian homosexuality | publisher= Routledge | year= 1992 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; such [[LGBT themes in mythology|mythologies and traditions]] can be found around the world.&lt;ref name = CARPENTER1&gt;{{Cite document | last= Carpenter | first= Edward | title= Intermediate Types among Primitive Types: A Study in Social Evolution | publisher= Mitchell Kennerley | city= New York | year= 1914 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Hinduism]] does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm] quote - &quot;''Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, The United Kingdom Hindu Council became one of the first major religious organizations to support LGBT rights when they issued a statement &quot;''Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.rediff.com&quot;&gt;[http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/jul/03/hinduism-does-not-condemn-homosexuality.htm Rediff.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of their position on homosexuality, many people of faith look to both [[sacred text]]s and [[tradition]] for guidance on this issue. However, the authority of various traditions or scriptural passages and the correctness of [[translation]]s and interpretations are continually disputed.

==Views of specific religious groups==
===Abrahamic religions===
The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], have traditionally forbidden [[sodomy]], believing and teaching that such behavior is [[sin]]ful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=29699 Bishop Soto tells NACDLGM: 'Homosexuality is Sinful'] catholic.org, accessed 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oncourse.ag.org/help/index.cfm?targetBay=24b28860-fb44-4e27-92a1-a2fe92076e8b&amp;ModID=2&amp;Process=DisplayArticle&amp;RSS_RSSContentID=9123&amp;RSS_OriginatingChannelID=1202&amp;RSS_OriginatingRSSFeedID=3859&amp;RSS_Source= Help topics] Assemblies of God (USA), accessed 6 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Today some denominations within these religions are accepting of homosexuality and inclusive of homosexual people, such as [[Reform Judaism]], the [[United Church of Christ]] and the [[Metropolitan Community Church]]. Some [[Presbyterian]] and [[Anglican]] churches welcome members regardless of same-sex sexual practices, with some provinces allowing for the ordination and inclusion of gay and lesbian clerics, and affirmation of same-sex unions. Reform Judaism incorporates lesbian and gay rabbis and same-sex marriage liturgies, while [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and Conservative Judaism in the USA allows for lesbian and gay rabbis and same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/06/AR2006120601247.html Conservative Rabbis Allow Ordained Gays, Same-Sex Unions]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{Summarize|from|LGBT topics and Judaism|date=August 2009}}
{{Main|LGBT topics and Judaism }}
The [[Torah]] (first five books of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]) is the primary source for Jewish views on homosexuality. It states that: &quot;[A man] shall not lie with another man as [he would] with a woman, it is a תועבה ''toeba'' (&quot;abomination&quot;)&quot; ([[Leviticus]] 18:22). (Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation is the [[death penalty]], although in practice [[rabbi]]nic Judaism no longer believes it has the authority to implement death penalties.)

[[Orthodox Judaism]] views homosexual acts as sinful. [[Conservative Judaism]] has engaged in an in-depth study of homosexuality since the 1990s with various rabbis presenting a wide array of [[responsa]] (papers with legal arguments) for communal consideration. The official position of the movement is to welcome homosexual Jews into their [[synagogue]]s, and also campaign against any discrimination in [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] and public society, but also to uphold a ban on homosexual sex as a religious requirement.

[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] in [[North America]] and [[Liberal Judaism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] view homosexuality to be acceptable on the same basis as [[heterosexuality]]. Progressive Jewish authorities believe either that traditional laws against homosexuality are no longer binding or that they are subject to changes that reflect a new understanding of human sexuality. Some of these authorities rely on modern biblical scholarship suggesting that the prohibition in the Torah was intended to ban coercive or ritualized homosexual sex, such as those practices ascribed to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Canaan]]ite [[fertility cult]]s and [[sacred prostitution|temple prostitution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/219_liberals_recognise_c.htm Liberals recognize committed same-sex partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jesus affirmed a gay couple - Stierch.jpg|right|thumb|Advertisement promoting religious tolerance of homosexuality in the United States.]]
[[Christian denominations]] hold a variety of views on the issue of [[homosexual]] activity, ranging from outright condemnation to complete acceptance. Most [[Christian denominations]] welcome people attracted to the same sex, but teach that homosexual acts are [[sinful]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC - Sexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1728| title = Human Sexuality|publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; These denominations include the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CCC2357&quot;&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#2357 Catechism of the Catholic Church, § 2357],[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20051104_istruzione_en.html Criteria for the Discernment of Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eastern Orthodox]] church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26 On Marriage, Family, Sexuality, and the Sanctity of Life]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Methodist Church]],&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC - Sexuality&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HRC - Stances of Faiths on LGBT Issues: African Methodist Episcopal Church&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/4957.htm|title=Stances of Faiths on LGBT Issues: African Methodist Episcopal Church|publisher=The Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FMC - Christian Conduct&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemethodistchurch.org/Sections/About%20Us/Beliefs/Christian%20Life/Christian%20Conduct/Christian%20Conduct%203.htm|title=The Christian Life - Christian Conduct|publisher=Free Methodist Church|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC - British Methodists reject blessing of same-sex relationships&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1827285/k.B985/British_Methodists_reject_blessing_of_samesex_relationships.htm|title=British Methodists reject blessing of same-sex relationships|publisher=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some other [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] denominations, such as the [[Reformed Church in America]]&lt;ref name=&quot;RCA - Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rca.org/Page.aspx?pid=501|title=Summaries of General Synod Discussions and Actions on Homosexuality and the Rights of Homosexuals|publisher=Reformed Church in America|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist Church]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC- Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-usa.org/WhoWeAre/Identity/IdentityStatement/tabid/78/Default.aspx|title=We Are American Baptists|publisher=American Baptist Churches USA|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Conservative Evangelical]] organizations and churches, such as the [[Evangelical Alliance]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eauk.org/resources/publications/upload/Homosexuality.pdf Evangelical Alliance (UK): ''Faith, Hope and Homosexuality'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] groups and churches, such as the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].&lt;ref name=southernbaptists&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pssexuality.asp Position Statements/Sexuality]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fellowshipalliance.com/homosexuality.htm Statement on Homosexuality]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epc.org/about-the-epc/position-papers/homosexuality/ Position Paper on Homosexuality]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pentecostal]] churches such as the [[Assemblies of God]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/Position_Papers/pp_downloads/pp_4181_homosexuality.pdf Homosexuality]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Restorationist]] churches, like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], also take the position that homosexual sexual activity is sinful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/200702b/article_01.htm Homosexuality —How Can I Avoid It?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/public-issues/same-gender-attraction Same-Gender Attraction - LDS Newsroom]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anti gay San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|Religious protest of homosexuality in San Francisco]]
Some [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] are supportive of homosexuals. Other [[Christian denominations]] do not view [[monogamous]] same sex relationships as bad or [[evil]]. These include the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/national/05church.html NYTimes.com] &quot;United Church of Christ Backs Same-Sex Marriage&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]]. In particular, the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], a denomination of 40,000 members, was founded specifically to serve the Christian LGBT community, and is devoted to being open and affirming to [[LGBT]] people.  The [[United Church of Christ]] and the [[Alliance of Baptists]] also condone [[gay marriage]], and some parts of the [[Anglican]] and [[Lutheran]] churches allow for the blessing of gay unions.  Within the Anglican communion there are openly gay clergy; for example, [[Gene Robinson]] and [[Mary Glasspool]] are openly homosexual bishops in the US Episcopal Church and [[Eva Brunne]] in Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]].  The Episcopal Church's recent actions vis-a-vis homosexuality have brought about increased ethical debate and tension within the [[Church of England]] and worldwide Anglican churches.

Passages from the [[Old Testament]] have been interpreted to argue that homosexuals should be punished with death, and [[AIDS]] has been portrayed by some fundamentalist sects such as [[Fred Phelps]] and [[Jerry Falwell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/558/000022492/ Jerry Falwell&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a punishment by God against homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Ellen and Kate Kaufman. Free Your Mind: The Book for Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Youth and their Allies. New York: HarperPerennial, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, theologians like [[Karl Barth]], [[Jürgen Moltmann]], [[Hans Küng]], [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]], [[David Edward Jenkins|Bishop David Jenkins]], [[Don Cupitt]], [[John Shelby Spong|Bishop Jack Spong]] challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated, are taken out of context, or that they do not refer to what we understand as &quot;homosexuality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See generally [http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibl.htm Religioustolerance.org] and subpages therein.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrmcc.org/Resources/StudyDocuments/bibleand.htm Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev. Clay Witt, Holy Redeemer M.C.C., 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some [[Protestant]] churches condemn same-sex sexual relations, based on scripture texts such as describing a man lying with another man {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:22|}} as sinful acts. Where the Catholic view is founded on a [[natural law]] argument informed by scripture and proposed by [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church] vatican.va, accessed 13 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional conservative Protestant view is based on an interpretation of scripture alone. Protestant conservatives also see homosexual relationships as an impediment to heterosexual relationships.  They interpret some Biblical passages to be commandments to be heterosexually married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=f318118dd536c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=dc6f8d00422fe010VgnVCM100000176f620a____ It Is Not Good for Man or Woman to Be Alone]&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholics, on the other hand, have accommodated unmarried people as priests, monks, nuns and single lay people for over a thousand years.  A number of self-described gay and [[ex-gay]] Christians have reported satisfaction in [[mixed-orientation marriage]]s.&lt;ref name=Moore07&gt;{{cite news

=====Catholic Church=====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}
The [[Catholic Church]] insists that those who are attracted to people of the same sex as well as anyone who is not married practice [[chastity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;], see the &quot;Chastity and homosexuality&quot; section.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church does not regard homosexual activity as a perfect expression of the marital act which it teaches is only possible within a lifelong commitment of a marriage between a man and a woman. According to the Church's sexual ethics, homosexual activity falls short in the areas complementarity (male and female organs complement each other) and fecundity (openness to new life) of the sexual act. This is not to be seen as a fault of people with homosexual attraction, but rather Catholic church officials puport that this is a statement of fact about reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jameslau88.com/homosexuality_in_the_eyes_of_the_catholic_church.html &quot;Homosexuality in the eyes of the Catholic Church&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mormonism=====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that no one should arouse sexual feelings outside of marriage, including those towards that same sex,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?index=3&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=23e80bbce1d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD Chastity]&lt;/ref&gt; and that these feelings should be overcome through self-control and reliance on the atonement of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b7723f4adab435807398f2f6e44916a0/?vgnextoid=7b2a5f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=bb05c8322e1b3110VgnVCM100000176f620a____ God Loveth His Children] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (1992) [http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/judeochristian/protestantism/mormon/mormon-homosexuality Understanding and Helping Those Who Have Homosexual Problems: Suggestions for Ecclesiastical Leaders] Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church&lt;/ref&gt; The church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman, and is essential to God's eternal plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/family/proclamation?lang=eng]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Islam}}

{{Rquote|left|What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males, and leave the wives your Lord created for you? Nay, but ye are forward folk.|[[Quran]] |26th [[sura]], trans. Pickthal}}
[[Image:Youth and his father.jpg|thumb|'''Youth seeking his father's advice on choosing a lover'''&lt;br /&gt;From the ''Haft Awrang'' of [[Jami]], in the story ''A Father Advises his Son About Love;'' ''See [[Homosexuality and Islam]];'' [[Smithsonian Institution|The Smithsonian]], Washington, DC.]]

All major [[Islam]]ic schools disapprove of homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://thetruereligion.org/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=45 this website]&lt;/ref&gt; Islam views same-sex desires as a natural temptation; but, sexual relations are seen as a transgression of the natural role and aim of sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alinaam.org.za/library/homos.htm &quot;Homosexuality in the Light of Islam&quot;], September 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic teachings (in the ''[[hadith]]'' tradition) presume same-sex attraction, extol abstention and (in the [[Qur'an]]) condemn consummation. 

The discourse on homosexuality in Islam is primarily concerned with activities between men. There are, however, a few hadith mentioning homosexual behavior in women; The fuqaha’ are agreed that there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism, because it is not [[zina]]. Rather a ta’zeer punishment must be imposed, because it is a sin..'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/21058 Islamqa.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between women, if they are regarded as problems, are treated akin to [[adultery]], and [[al-Tabari]] records an execution of a [[Harem (household)|harem]] couple under [[Caliph]] [[al-Hadi]].

Islam allows and promotes filial love between siblings of the same sex. However, sexual activities between them are totally prohibited. [[Ibn Hazm]], [[Ibn Daud]], [[Al-Mutamid]], [[Abu Nuwas]] and many others used this edict to write extensively and openly of brotherly love between men while proclaiming to be [[chastity|chaste]].{{cn|date=October 2012}}

====Bahá'í Faith====
Bahá'í law limits permissible sexual relations to those between a man and a woman in marriage. Believers are expected to abstain from sex outside matrimony.{{cn|date=October 2012}} Bahá'ís do not, however, attempt to impose their moral standards on those who have not accepted the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.{{cn|date=October 2012}} While requiring uprightness in all matters of morality, whether sexual or otherwise, the Bahá’í teachings also take account of human frailty and call for tolerance and understanding in regard to human failings. In this context, to regard homosexuals with prejudice would be contrary to the spirit of the Bahá’í teachings.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

===Indian religions===
Among the [[Indian religions|religions that originated in India]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], teachings regarding homosexuality are less clear than among the Abrahamic traditions, and religious authorities voice diverse opinions. In 2005, an authority figure of Sikhism condemned same-sex marriage and the practice of homosexuality. However many people in Sikhism aren't against gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/03/28/sikhguy-050328.html |title=World Sikh group against gay marriage bill |work=[[CBC News Network|CBC News]] |date=29 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is diverse, with no supreme governing body, but the majority of [[swami]]s opposed same-sex relationships in a 2004 survey, and a minority supported them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726045115/http://www.faithandthecity.org/issues/social/articles/Discussions_on_Dharma%20.shtml |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url=http://www.faithandthecity.org/issues/social/articles/Discussions_on_Dharma%20.shtml |title=Discussions on Dharma |first=Rajiv |last=Malik |work=[[Hinduism Today Magazine]] |date=October/November/December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient religious texts such as the [[Vedas]] often refer to people of a [[third gender]] known as [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]], who are neither female nor male. Some see this third gender as an ancient parallel to modern western [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] and/or [[intersex]] identities. However, this third sex is usually negatively valued as a pariah class in ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Janet (2003). ''One Plus One Makes Three: Buddhist Gender Conceptions and the Law of the Non-Excluded Middle'', History of Religions. 2003, no. 2. University of Chicago press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Hindu law books, from the first century onward, categorize non-vaginal sex (''ayoni'') as impure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=28081 HRC | Page Not Found&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Hinduism}}

[[Hinduism]] has taken various positions, ranging from positive to neutral or discouraging. Homosexuality is regarded as one of the possible expressions of human desire and Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bonvillain| first = Nancy| authorlink = [[Nancy Bonvillain]]| title = Women and men: cultural constructs of gender| publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]| year = 2001| page = 281| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=xiG1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=hinduism+homosexuality+expressions+of+human+desire| isbn = 978-0-13-025973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several Hindu temples which have carvings that depict both men and women indulging in homosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Keene| first = Michael| title = Religion in Life and Society| publisher = Folens Limited| year = 2002| page = 58| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=I4AVbUIIygQC&amp;pg=PA58| isbn = 978-1-84303-295-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rigveda]], one of the four canonical sacred texts of [[Hinduism]] says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti' (diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes homosexuality as natural, if not an approval of homosexuality. Moreover, Rigveda recognizes the cyclical constancy of homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities.&lt;ref&gt;'Expose the Hindu Taliban!' by [[Ashok Row Kavi]] [http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu text [[Kamasutra]] written by Sage [[Vatsyayana]] has a complete chapter on male-male sex. Chapter six, ''Auparishtika'' talks about fellatio (oral sex) between two men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, sexuality is rarely discussed openly in Hindu society today, and homosexuality is largely a [[taboo]] subject&amp;nbsp;— especially among the strongly religious. In a 2004 survey, most [[swami]]s said they opposed the concept of a Hindu-sanctified gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faithandthecity.org/issues/social/articles/Discussions_on_Dharma%20.shtml Discussions on Dharma], by Rajiv Malik, in Hinduism Today. October/November/December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the law codes, such as that of [[Manu Smriti]] assert that a woman ''polluting'' a virgin is a crime.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Manu Smriti]] chapter 8, verse 369, 370. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu08.htm text online].&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments include ritual baths, fines, public humiliation and having fingers cut off. However, the bulk of sexual matters dealt with by the law books are heterosexual in nature.

A &quot;[[third gender]]&quot; has been acknowledged within Hinduism since [[Vedic period|Vedic times]]. Several Hindu texts, such as [[Manu Smriti]]&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti, 3.49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sushruta Samhita]], assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually [[Grammatical gender|neuter]], as a matter of natural biology. They worked as [[hairdressing|hairdressers]], flower-sellers, servants, [[massage|masseurs]] and [[prostitution|prostitutes]]. Today, many people of a &quot;third gender&quot; ([[Hijra (India)|hijras]]) live throughout India, mostly on the margins of society, and many still work in prostitution, or make a livelihood as beggars.

The Indian [[Kama Sutra]], written in the 4th century AD, contains passages describing [[eunuch]]s or &quot;third-sex&quot; males performing [[oral sex]] on men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kama Sutra]], Chapter 9, &quot;Of the Auparishtaka or Mouth Congress&quot;. [http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm Text online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author was &quot;not a fan of homosexual activities&quot; and treated such individuals with disdain, according to historian [[Devdutt Pattanaik]].&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik, Devdutt (2001). ''Homosexuality in Ancient India'', [[Debonair (magazine)|Debonair]] 2000 or 2001. Essay available [http://www.gaybombay.org/reading/art0001.html online] from GayBombay.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, some medieval Hindu temples and artifacts openly depict male homosexuality, lesbianism, and bisexuality within their carvings, such as the temple walls at [[Khajuraho]]. Some infer from these images that Hindu society and religion were previously more open to variations in human sexuality than they are at present.

Hindu scriptures contain several stories that metaphorically have [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], or other kinds of [[queer]] overtones, often involving the most prominent Hindu deities.  There are Hindu deities who are [[intersex]] (both male and female), e.g., [[Ardhanari]], who is the unified form of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]]; who switch from male to female or from female to male, e.g., [[Mohini]], who is the only female [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]; male deities with female moods and female deities with male moods, e.g., [[Krishna]] turning into [[Mohini]] to fulfil [[Iravan]]'s boon; deities born from two males or from two females, e.g., [[Ayyappan]], who is considered to be &quot;Harihara Putra&quot;, the son of [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]], in his [[Mohini]] [[Avatar]], and so on.

====Jainism====
Chastity is one of the five virtues in the fundamental ethical code of [[Jainism]]. For [[laity|laypersons]], the only appropriate avenue for sexuality is within marriage, and homosexuality is believed to lead to negative [[karma]] because the sexual act is outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Website: [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8048_1.html What Jains believe].&lt;/ref&gt; Jain author [[Duli Chandra Jain]] wrote in 2004 that homosexuality and [[transvestism]] &quot;stain one's thoughts and feelings&quot; because they involve sexual passion.&lt;ref&gt;Duli Chandra Jain, ''Answers To Some Frequently Asked Questions'', in 'Religious Ethics: A Sourcebook’, edited by Dr. Arthur B. Dobrin, published by Hindi Granth Karyalaya, Mumbai, 2004. {{PDF|[http://www.jainstudy.org/QAns.pdf. Text online]}} link).&lt;/ref&gt; Some texts in Jainism have depicted of Eunuchs are born with genetic defects or due to social pressure. There is also a mention of correction and lead normal life. It is a mental imbalance which can be cured in few of the cases.
(Brhatkalpa bhasya V, 517374.) 

The liberal humanitarian attitude of the Jaina society in the formulation of rules and their exceptions is evidenced in the case of the enunuch (who is considered to be female) who was raped by unknown man. Such a eunuch was kept in the monastery was well looked after, was fed by nuns and when well advanced in pregnancy was handed over to a devoted physician. All her duties as a person were suspended till her child sucked her; even her child could be initiated. One particularly remarkable aspect was that those who teased or condemned her were compelled to undergo expiatory punishment. (Brh. kalp. Bha., 4129-46).

====Buddhism====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Buddhism}}
The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics are the [[The Five Precepts|Five Precepts]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eightfold Path]], one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure. The third of the Five Precepts is &quot;To refrain from committing sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; is such a broad term, and is subjected to interpretation relative to the social norms of the followers. In fact, Buddhism in its fundamental form does not define what is right and what is wrong in absolute terms for [[Laity|lay followers]]. Therefore the determination of whether or not [[homosexuality]] is acceptable for a [[layperson]] is not a religious matter as far as fundamental Buddhism is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;GLBT in World Religions, Sermon by Rev. Gabriele Parks, along with Phil Manos and Bill Weber. [http://www.tpuuf.org/2008/08/03/glbt-in-world-religions/ Tpuuf.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism is often characterized as distrustful of sensual enjoyment and sexuality in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson 1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Peter Anthony |year=1995 |title=Thai Buddhist accounts of male homosexuality and AIDS in the 1980s |journal=The Australian Journal of Anthropology |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=140–53 |month=December |url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/anth.htm |doi=10.1111/j.1835-9310.1995.tb00276.x |pmid=12291560}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, homosexual conduct and [[gender variance]] are seen as obstacles to spiritual progress in most schools of Buddhism; as such [[monk]]s are expected to refrain from all sexual activity, and the [[Vinaya]] (the first book of the [[Tripitaka]]) specifically prohibits [[sexual intercourse]], then further explain that both anal, oral as well as vaginal intercourse amount to sexual intercourse, which will result in permanent exclusion from Sangha.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Pandakavatthu section of the Mahavagga. 1:61, 68, 69; Vinaya: Mahavagga, 1:71, 76. Additionally, &quot;The Story of the Prohibition of the Ordination of Pandaka&quot; justifies the ban by giving an example of a monk with an insatiable desire to be sexually penetrated by men, thus bringing shame upon the Buddhist community. Vinaya, Vol. 4, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable exception in the history of Buddhism occurred in Japan during the [[Edo period]], in which male homosexuality, or more specifically, love between young novices and older monks, was celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary P. |last=Leupp |year=1995 |title=Male Colors, the Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan |location=Berkeley |publisher=The University of California Press |isbn=0-585-10603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

References to ''pandaka'', a deviant sex/gender category that is usually interpreted to include homosexual males, can be found throughout the [[Pali canon]] as well as other [[Sanskrit]] scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zwilling |first=Leonard |year=1992 |chapter=Homosexuality As Seen In Indian Buddhist Texts |editor=Cabezon, Jose Ignacio (ed.) |title=Buddhism, Sexuality &amp; Gender |publisher=State University of New York |pages=203–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Zwilling refers extensively to [[Buddhaghosa]]'s [[Samantapasadika]], where ''pandaka'' are described as being filled with defiled passions and insatiable lusts, and are dominated by their [[libido]]. The [[Abhidharma]] states that a ''pandaka'' cannot achieve enlightenment in their own lifetime, but must wait for rebirth as a &quot;normal&quot; man or woman. According to one scriptural story, [[Ananda]]—Buddha's cousin and disciple—was a ''pandaka'' in one of his many previous lives.

The third of the [[Buddhism#The Five Precepts|Five Precepts]] of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from [[sexual misconduct]]; this precept has sometimes been interpreted to include homosexuality. The [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] of Tibetan Buddhism interprets sexual misconduct to include lesbian and gay sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation or other sexual activity with the hand; the only time sex is acceptable is when it performed for its natural purpose of procreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dalai Lama Speaks on Gay Sex - He says it's wrong for Buddhists but not for society |first=Don |last=Lattin |date=1997-06-11 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle &lt;!--|url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/1997/6/12_2.html (Dead link)--&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;– {{cite news |title=Dalai Lama urges 'respect, compassion, and full human rights for all,' including gays |first=Dennis |last=Conkin |date=1997-06-19 |url=http://quietmountain.org/links/teachings/gayrites.htm}}&amp;nbsp;– {{cite news |title=Dalai Lama says 'oral and anal sex' not acceptable |first=Jack |last=Nichols |date=1997-05-13 |url=http://badpuppy.com/gaytoday/garchive/events/051397ev.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Dalai Lama supports human rights for all, &quot;regardless of sexual orientation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd.htm |title=The Buddhist religion and homosexuality |publisher=[[Religioustolerance.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]], traditional accounts propose that &quot;homosexuality arises as a [[Karma|karmic]] consequence of violating Buddhist proscriptions against heterosexual misconduct. These karmic accounts describe homosexuality as a congenital condition which cannot be altered, at least in a homosexual person's current lifetime, and have been linked with calls for compassion and understanding from the non-homosexual populace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson 1995&quot;/&gt; However, Buddhist leaders in Thailand have also condemned homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibid]].&lt;/ref&gt; ousted monks accused of homosexual acts, and banned [[kathoey]] from ordination. As per BBC article April 27, 2009, Senior monk Phra Maha Wudhijaya Vajiramedh is very concerned by flamboyant behavior of gay and transgender novices such as the wearing of make-up and tight or revealingly tight robes, carrying pink purses and having effeminately-shaped eyebrows. Phra Vajiramedhi acknowledged that it was difficult to exclude them from the monkhood - so he introduced Thailand's &amp; Buddhism's &quot;good manners&quot; curriculum - the country's first.   

Within [[Japan]]ese traditions, there is a widespread forklore that homosexuality was &quot;invented&quot; by the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjusri]] of wisdom and the sage [[Kūkai]], the founder of Buddhism in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=68 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=AwD3FNUJjXwC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Kukai+homosexuality |quote=According to one legend, homosexuality was introduced into Japan in the ninth century by Shingon Buddhist monk, Kukai |title=Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: Multi-nation Comparison |first=Donald James |last=West |coauthors=Green, Richard |year=1997 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-306-45532-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Buddhist scholar and author of ''[[Wild Azaleas]]'' [[Kitamura Kigin]] said that heterosexuality was to be avoided for priests and homosexuality encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kumagusu |first=Miinakata |coauthors=Ihara Saikaku |editor=Stephen D.

====Sikhism====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Sikhism}}

[[Sikhism]] has no written view on the matter, but in 2005, a Sikh religious authority described homosexuality as &quot;against the Sikh religion and the Sikh code of conduct and totally against the laws of nature,&quot; and called on Sikhs to support laws against gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/03/28/sikhguy-050328.html World Sikh group against gay marriage bill], [[CBC Newsworld|CBC News]], Tuesday, 29 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Sikhs are against this view, however,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarbat.net/2007/10/sikhism-and-same-sex-marriages/|title=Sikhism and same Sex Marriages|first=Admin|publisher=sarbat.net|page=1|accessdate=3 September 2010|archiveurl=http://www.sarbat.net/2007/10/sikhism-and-same-sex-marriages/|archivedate=3rd October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and state that the Sikh Scriptures promote equality and do not condemn homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectnaad.com/wp-content/uploads/leaflets/sikhism_yoga_and_sexuality.pdf|title=Sikhism, Yoga and Sexuality|last=Naad|first=Project|date=2/9/2010|publisher=Project Naad|page=33|accessdate=2 September 2010|archiveurl=www.projectnaad.com/wp-content/uploads/leaflets/sikhism_yoga_and_sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2nd September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===

{{Rquote|left| The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is a man that is a Daeva [demon]; this man is a worshipper of the Daevas, a male paramour of the Daevas|[[Vendidad]]}}

The [[Vendidad]], one of the later [[Zoroastrian]] texts composed in the Artificial Young [[Avestan language]], has not been dated precisely. It is thought that some concepts of law, uncleanliness, [[dualism]], and [[salvation]] were shared between the religions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cais-soas*com/CAIS/Religions/non-iranian/judaism/persian_judaism/book2/pt4.htm|title=How Persia created Judaism:Zoroastrian Influences on Judaism and Christianity (Part II) - Zoroastrianism: Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent interactions between the religions are documented by events such as the release of the Jews from the [[Babylonian captivity]] by Zoroastrian [[Cyrus the Great]] in 537 BC, and the Biblical account of the [[Magi]] visiting the infant [[Jesus]].  The Vendidad generally promotes procreation: &quot;the man who has a wife is far above him who lives in continence; he who keeps a house is far above him who has none; he who has children is far above the childless man; he who has riches is far above him who has none.&quot;  It details the penance for a worshipper who submits to sodomy under force as &quot;Eight hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra, eight hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana.&quot; (equal to the penalty for breaking a contract with the value of an ox),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd4sbe.htm|title=Avesta: Vendidad (English): Fargard 4. Contracts and offenses}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declares that for those participating voluntarily &quot;For that deed there is nothing that can pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from it; it is a trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever and ever&quot;.  However, those not practicing the Religion of Mazda were pardoned for past actions upon conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd8sbe.htm|title=Avesta: Vendidad: Fargard 8. Funerals and purification, unlawful sex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese religions===
Among the [[Taoic religions]] of [[East Asia]], such as [[Taoism]], passionate homosexual expression is usually discouraged because it is believed to not lead to human fulfillment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wawrytko, Sandra 1993&quot;&gt;Wawrytko, Sandra (1993). ''Homosexuality and Chinese and Japanese Religions'' in &quot;Homosexuality and World Religions&quot;, edited by Arlene Swidler. Trinity Press International, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confucianism====
Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. However, the ideology did emphasize male friendships, and Louis Crompton has argued that the &quot;closeness of the master-disciple bond it fostered may have subtly facilitated homosexuality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crompton&quot;&gt;Crompton, Louis. ''Homosexuality and Civilization''. Harvard University Press. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality]] is not mentioned  in the [[Analects of Confucius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Siker encyclopedia&quot;&gt;Jeffrey S.

ISBN 0-313-33088-3&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Biting the bitter peel&quot;, a [[euphemism]] for homosexual relations, generally taken to mean [[anal sex]], is mentioned as having been practiced by several individuals in the [[Classic of History]] as well as the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} both texts belonging to the [[Five Classics]].

====Taoism====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Taoism}}
There is no single official position on homosexuality in Taoism, as the term Taoism is used to describe a number of disparate religious traditions. Homosexuality is not unknown in Taoist history, such as during the Tang dynasty when Taoist nuns exchanged love poems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/china,5.html Homosexuality in China] on [[glbtq.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Attitudes to homosexuality within Taoism often reflect the values and sexual norms of broader Chinese society (see [[Homosexuality in China]].)

===Paganism===
{{Main|LGBT themes in mythology}}

===Neopagan religion===
====Wicca====
The Wiccan ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'', one of the most famous texts in [[Neopaganism]], states in the words of the Goddess, &quot;all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alternative Sexuality |publisher=Tangled Moon Coven |date=2006-08-08 |url=http://www.tangledmoon.org/sexuality.htm |accessdate=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional forms of Wicca, such as [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] and [[Alexandrian Wicca]], magic is often performed between a man and a woman, and the &quot;[[Great Rite]]&quot; is a sex ritual performed between a Priest and Priestess representing the God and Goddess;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sex, Wicca and the Great Rite |journal=The Blade &amp; Chalice |volume=Spring 1993 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this is not generally seen as excluding homosexuals or magic between same-sex couples. Most groups still insist, however, that initiations be conferred from man to woman or woman to man. Any ritual sexual acts, whether actual or symbolic, take place between two consenting adults, normally a couple who are already lovers. See also [[LGBT topics and Wicca]].

===Satanism===
Satanism, in the LaVey tradition, is open to all forms of sexual expression, and does not preclude homosexuality.
Satanism, in Spiritual traditions are also open to all forms of sexual expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Unitarian Universalism===
The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] supports the freedom to marry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/news/freedomtomarry/index.html UUA.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and compares resistance to it to the resistance to abolition of [[slavery]], women's [[suffrage]], and the end of anti-[[miscegenation]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uusm.org/services/021305.php UUSM - Services &amp; Sermons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a &quot;Welcoming Congregation&quot;: a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual &amp; transgender (GLBT) members. UU ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church &quot;to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.&quot; Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—&quot;Standing on the Side of Love.&quot; In 2004 UU Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective.

==Queer religions==
===Radical Faeries===
The [[Radical Faeries]] are a worldwide [[queer]] [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movement, founded in 1979 in the [[United States]].

==Religious groups and public policy==
Opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT rights]] is often associated with conservative religious views. The [[American Family Association]] and other religious groups have promoted boycotts of corporations whose policies support the LGBT community.

In conservative Islamic nations, laws generally prohibit same-sex sexual behaviour, and interpretation of [[Sharia Law]] on male homosexuality carries the death penalty.  This has been condemned as a violation of human rights by human rights organisation [[Amnesty International]] and by the writers of the [[Yogyakarta principles]].  With the signature of the USA in 2009, the proposed [[UN declaration on LGBT rights]] has now been signed by every European secular state and all western nations, as well as other countries—67 members of the UN in total.  An opposing statement put forward by Muslim nations was signed by 57 member states, mostly in Africa and Asia.  68 out of the total 192 countries have not yet signed either statement. In 2011 the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed a landmark resolution initiated by [[South Africa]] supporting LBGT rights (''See [[Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity at the United Nations]]'')
