The terms ''Wahhabi'' and ''[[Salafi]]'' and [[People of hadith|''ahl al-hadith'']] (people of hadith) are often used interchangeably, but Wahhabism has also been called &quot;a particular orientation within Salafism&quot;,&lt;ref name=global&gt;GlobalSecurity.org [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-salafi.htm Salafi Islam]&lt;/ref&gt; an orientation considered ultra-conservative and apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/04/AR2006090401107_2.html Washington Post, For Conservative Muslims, Goal of Isolation a Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L.

The movement gained unchallenged precedence in the [[Arabian peninsula]] through an alliance between [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] and the House of [[Ibn Saud|Muhammad ibn Saud]] who provided political and financial power for the religious revival represented by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. The writer El Khabar Ousbouî suggests the popularity of the Wahhabi movement is in part due to this alliance and the funding of several religious channels.&lt;ref&gt;« Saudi Wahhabism is the most dangerous religious currents », ''El Khabar Ousbouî'', 30 août 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mohammad Hayya Al-Sindhi===
Zain Imran's teacher Abdallah ibn Ibrahim ibn Sayf introduced the relatively young man to [[Mohammad Hayya Al-Sindhi]] in [[Medina]] and recommended him as a student. Mohammad Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab and al-Sindi became very close and Mohammad Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab stayed with him for some time. Scholars have described Muhammad Hayya as having an important influence on Mohammad Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, encouraging him to denounce rigid imitation of classical commentaries and to utilize informed individual analysis ([[ijtihad]]). Muhammad Hayya also taught Mohammad Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab to reject popular religious practices associated with [[wali]]s and their tombs that resembles later Wahhabi teachings. Muhammad Hayya and his milieu are important for understanding the origins of at least the Wahhabi revivalist impulse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/3/1/116 BOOK REVIEWS&amp;nbsp;– Robinson 3 (1): 116&amp;nbsp;– Journal of Islamic Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab===
{{main|Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab}}
{{Further|First Saudi State}}

Mohammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab studied in [[Basra]] (now in southern [[Iraq]]) and is reported to have developed his ideas there.&lt;ref&gt;Tarikh Najd by 'Husain ibn Ghannam, Vol. 1, Pg. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Unwan al-Majd fi Tarikh Najd, by 'Uthman ibn Bishr an-Najdi, Vol. 1, Pg. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have studied in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] while there to perform [[Hajj]]&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, by Judge Ahmad ibn 'Hajar al-Butami, Pg. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab: His Da'wah and Life Story, by [[Abd-al-Aziz ibn Abd-Allah ibn Baaz|Shaikh ibn Baaz]], Pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to his home town of [['Uyayna]] in 1740.

After his return to 'Uyayna, ibn Abd-al-Wahhab began to attract followers, including the ruler of the town, Uthman ibn Mu'ammar. With Ibn Mu'ammar's support, ibn Abd-al-Wahhab began to implement some of his ideas such as leveling the grave of [[Zayd ibn al-Khattab]], one of the [[Sahaba]] (companions) of the [[Prophets of Islam|Muslim Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], and ordering that an adulteress be stoned to death. These actions were disapproved of by Sulaiman ibn Muhammad ibn Ghurayr of the tribe of [[Bani Khalid]], the chief of [[Al-Hasa]] and [[Qatif]], who held substantial influence in [[Nejd]] and ibn Abd-al-Wahhab was expelled from 'Uyayna.&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, by Judge Ahmad ibn 'Hajar al-Butami, Pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab was invited to settle in neighboring [[Diriyah]] by its ruler [[Muhammad ibn Saud]] in 1740 (1157 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]), two of whose brothers had been students of Ibn Abdal-Wahhab. Upon arriving in Diriyya, a pact was made between Ibn Saud and Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, by which Ibn Saud pledged to implement and enforce Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab's teachings, while [[House of Saud|Ibn Saud and his family]] would remain the temporal &quot;leaders&quot; of the movement.

===Alliance with the House of Ibn Saud===
Beginning in the last years of the 18th century Ibn Saud and his heirs would spend the next 140 years mounting various military campaigns to seize control of [[Arabia]] and its outlying regions, before being attacked and defeated by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The second being that once one affirms the oneness of worship to Allah and Allah alone. The third is belief and affirmation of Allah's Names and Attributes.

Wahhabi theology is very precise in its creed or ''[[Aqeedah]]'' where the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] are the only fundamental and authoritative texts taken with the understanding of the [[Salaf]]. Commentaries and &quot;the examples of the early Muslim community ([[Ummah]]) and the four Rightly Guided [[Caliph]]s (AD 632–661)&quot; known as ''Athar'' narrations are used to support these texts, hence the name of the school of theology given as [[Athari]], but are not considered independently authoritative.&lt;ref name=WahhabiIslam&gt;{{cite book

[[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] further explains in his book ''Kitab al-Tawhid'', which draws directly on material from the Quran and the narrations of the Prophet, that worship in Islam includes conventional acts of worship such as the five daily prayers; fasting; [[Dua]] (supplication); Istia'dha (seeking protection or refuge); Ist'ana (seeking help), and Istigatha to Allah (seeking benefits and calling upon Allah alone). Therefore, making ''du'a'' or calling upon anyone or anything other than God, or seeking supernatural help and protection that is only befitting of a ''divine being'' from something other than Allah alone are acts of &quot;shirk&quot; and contradict the tenets of Tawhid. [[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] further explains that Muhammad during his lifetime tried his utmost to identify and repudiate all actions that violated these principles.

The most important of these commentaries are those by [[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] in particular his book ''Kitab al-Tawhid'', and the works of [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]. [[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] was a follower of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]'s school of [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) like most in [[Nejd]] at the time, but &quot;was opposed to any of the schools ([[Madh'hab]]) being taken as an absolute and unquestioned authority&quot;. 

However [[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] did not totally condemn [[taqlid]], or blind adherence, only at scholarly level in the face of a clear evidence or proof from a [[hadeeth]] or Qur'anic text.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Edward, ''Faith and Power: The Politics of Islam'', Vintage Books, 1982, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wahhabis are associated with the [[Hanbali]] school, early disputes did not center on fiqh and the belief that Wahhabism was borne of Hanbali thought has been called a &quot;myth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commins12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Commins|2006|p=12}} According to Commins, ''Kitab al-Tawhid'' &quot;has nothing to say on Islamic law, which guides Muslims’ everyday lives. This is a crucial point. One of the myths about Wahhabism is that its distinctive character stems from its affiliation with the supposedly ‘conservative’ or ‘strict’ Hanbali legal school. If that were the case, how could we explain the fact that the earliest opposition to Ibn Abd al-Wahhab came from other Hanbali scholars? Or that a tradition of anti-Wahhabi Hanbalism persisted into the nineteenth century? As an expert on law in Saudi Arabia notes, [[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] produced no unprecedented opinions and Saudi authorities today regard him not as a mujtahid in fiqh [independent thinker in jurisprudence], but rather in da’wa or religious reawakening… The Wahhabis’ bitter differences with other Muslims were not over fiqh [jurisprudence] rules at all, but over aqida, or theological positions.’&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condemnation of &quot;Priests&quot; and other religious leaders===
Wahhabism denounces the practice of total blind adherence to the interpretations of scholars, at a scholarly level, and of practices passed on within the family or tribe. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was dedicated to champion these principles and combat what was seen as the stagnation of Islamic scholarship which the majority of [[Muslims]] had seemingly fully adhered to without question, through [[taqlid]] of the established [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] clergy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sufi.it/Islam/wahlast.htm |title=The Beginning And Spreading Of Wahhabism |publisher=Sufi.it |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His idea was that what he perceived to be blind deference to religious authority obstructs this direct connection with the Qur'an and Sunnah, leading him to deprecate the importance and full authority of leaders at the time, such as the [[ulama|scholars]] and [[mufti|mufti's]] of the age. When arguing for his positions, [[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] would use translations and interpretation of the verses (known as [[ayah|ayat]] in Arabic) of the Qur'an that were contrary to the consensus amongst the scholars of the age, and positions against which there had been consensus for centuries. This methodology was considered extremely controversial at the time, in opposition to established clergy of the era, and was refuted as being erroneous by a number of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;http://mailofislam.webstarts.com/uploads/fitna-tul-wahhabiyyah.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correctislamicfaith.com/fitanatulwahhabiya.htm |title=Fitanatul Wahhabiya - LET US CORRECT OUR ISLAMIC FAITH |publisher=Correctislamicfaith.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yakhwajagaribnawaz.com/islam/wahhabis.htm |title=wahabi, quran reading, sunni islam, wahhabism, wahhabi, become a muslim, islam followers, followers of islam |publisher=Yakhwajagaribnawaz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Wahhabi movement saw itself as championing the re-opening of [[ijtihad]], being intellectual pursuit of scholarly work clarifying opinions in the face of new evidence being a newly proven sound or [[Hadith terminology|sahih]] [[hadeeth]], a discovered historical early [[ijma]] (scholarly consensus from the early Muslims) or a suitable analogy, [[qiyas]], based on historical records;  in contrast to the witnessed saturation of Islamic jurisprudence that no longer considered [[ijtihad]] to be a viable alternative to total scholarly [[taqlid]], being total submission to previous scholarly opinion regardless of unquestionable proof that contradicts this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/113687 |title=Islam Question and Answer - Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) was a great muhaddith and a mujtahid faqeeh |publisher=Islamqa.info |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiqh===

A popular misconception associated with the movement of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab is the condemnation of the [[Madh'hab|legal schools of jurisprudence]], however documentation of a letter correspondence by [[Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] recorded by his son Abdallah refutes this accusation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;And also we are upon the madhhab of Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal in the matters of jurisprudence, and we do not show rejection to the one who made taqleed of one of the four Imaams as opposed to those besides them...
 ... And we do not deserve the status of absolute ijtihaad and there is none amongst us who lays claim to it, except that in some of the issues (of jurisprudence), when a plain, clear text from the Book, or a Sunnah unabrogated, unspecified and uncontradicted by what is stronger than it, and by which one of the four Imaams have spoken, we take it and we leave our madhhab...
 ... And we do not investigate (scrutinize) anyone in his madhhab, nor do we find fault with him except when we come across a plain, clear text which opposes the madhhab of one of the four Imaams and it is a matter through which an open and apparent symbol
 ... Thus, there is no contradiction between (this and) not making the claim of independent ijtihaad, because a group from the scholars from the four madhhabs are preceded choosing certain preferred opinions in certain matters, who, whilst making taqleed of the founders of the madhhab (in general), opposed the madhhab (in those matters).&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was seen as a revival of the tradition recorded whereby the early students of the scholars of the [[Madh'hab]]s would leave their teacher's position in light of a newly found evidence once the [[hadeeth]] had been collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/282550/ijtihad |title=ijtihad (Islamic law) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;... and this is not contradictory to the lack of the claim to ijtihaad. For it has been that a group of the imaams of the four madhaahib had their own particular views regarding certain matters that were in opposition to their madhhab, whose founder they followed.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;saaid.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web

However some modern day adherents to wahhabism consider themselves to be 'non-imitators' or 'not attached to tradition', and therefore answerable to no school of law at all, observing instead what they would call the practice of early Islam. However, to do so does correspond to the ideal aimed at by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]], and thus they can be said to be of his 'school' however only a scholar would be capable of this level of [[ijtihad]] and most [[Salafi]] scholars warn against this for the uneducated laymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=12:41 AM |url=http://www.ahlalhdeeth.com/vbe/showthread.php?t=11098 |title=Concept of Taqleed - Multaqa Ahl al-Hadeeth |publisher=Ahlalhdeeth.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' Altamira, 2001, p.407&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===

Adherents to the Wahhabi movement take their theological viewpoint with an aspiration to assimilate with the beliefs of the early Muslims, being the first three generations otherwise known as the [[Salaf]]. This theology was taken from exegesis of the Quran and statements of the early Muslims and later codified by a number of scholars, the most well known being the 13th century Syrian scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], into what is now known as the [[Athari]] theological creed. This was upheld by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] in his various works on theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oleh: Luthfi Assyaukanie |url=http://islamlib.com/en/article/muhammad-ibn-abd-al-wahab-1703-1791 |title=Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahab (1703-1791) - JIL English Edition |publisher=Islamlib.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And it is that we accept the aayaat and ahaadeeth of the Attributes upon their apparent meanings, and we leave their true meanings, while believing in their realities, to Allaah ta'aalaa. For Maalik, one of the greatest of the 'ulamaa' of the Salaf, when asked about al-istiwaa' in His Saying (ta'aalaa): &quot;Ar-Rahmaan rose over the Throne.&quot; [Taa-Haa: 5] said: ''&quot;Al-istiwaa' is known, the &quot;how&quot; of it is unknown, believing in it is waajib, and asking about it is bid'ah.&quot;'' &quot;  &lt;ref name=&quot;saaid.net&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forums.islamicawakening.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some criticism accuses this school as being [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] however [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in his monumental work ''[[Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah]]'' refutes the stance of the ''Mushabbihah'' (those who liken the creation with God: anthropomorphism) and those who deny, negate, and resort to allegorical/metaphorical interpretations of the Divine Names and Attributes. He contends that the methodology of the [[Salaf]] is to take the middle path between the extremes of anthropomorphism and negation/distortion. He further states that salaf affirmed all the Names and Attributes of God without ''[[tashbih]]'' (establishing likeness), ''takyeef'' (speculating as to &quot;how&quot; they are manifested in the divine), ''ta'teel'' (negating/denying their apparent meaning) and without ''ta'weel'' (giving it secondary/symbolic meaning which is different from the apparent meaning).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asharis.com/creed/articles/bolnh-ibn-taymiyyah-the-ashari-scholars-and-those-affirming-jism-for-allaah.cfm |title=Jism, Tajseem, and the Mujassimah (Anthropomorphists) in the Ash'arite Textbooks and in the Works of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah: A Brief Comparison |publisher=Asharis.com |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

===Naming controversy: Wahhabism and Salafism===
Ibn Abd-Al-Wahab's aversion to the elevation of scholars and other individuals helps explain the preference of so-called &quot;Wahhabis&quot; for the term &quot;Salafi&quot;. Among those who criticize the use of the term &quot;Wahhabi&quot; is social scientist Quintan Wiktorowicz. In a footnote of his report, ''Anatomy of the Salafi Movement'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiktorowicz, Quintan 2006 p.235&quot;&gt;Wiktorowicz, Quintan. &quot;Anatomy of the Salafi Movement&quot; in ''Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism'', Vol. 29 (2006): p.235.&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Opponents of [[Salafism]] frequently affix the &quot;Wahhabi&quot; designator to denote foreign influence. It is intended to signify followers of Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab and is most frequently used in countries where Salafis are a small minority of the Muslim community, but have made recent inroads in &quot;converting&quot; the local population to the movement ideology. … The Salafi movement itself, however, never uses this term. In fact, one would be hard pressed to find individuals who refer to themselves as Wahhabis or organizations that use &quot;Wahhabi&quot; in their title or refer to their ideology in this manner (unless they are speaking to a Western audience that is unfamiliar with Islamic terminology, and even then usage is limited and often appears as &quot;Salafi/Wahhabi&quot;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other observers describe the term as &quot;originally used derogatorily by opponents&quot;, but now commonplace and used even &quot;by some Najdi scholars of the movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=global/&gt; According to [[Riadh Sidaoui]], habitual use of the term Wahhabism is scientifically false, and  the concept of ''Saudi Wahhabism'' should be substituted{{clarify|reason=Substituted for what? And why?|date=May 2012}}

===Criticism by other Muslims===
;Initial opposition
Allegedly the first people to oppose Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab were his father Abd al-Wahhab and his brother Salman Ibn Abd al-Wahhab who was an Islamic scholar and [[qadi]]. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's brother wrote a book in refutation of his brothers' new teachings, called: &quot;The Final Word from the Qur'an, the Hadith, and the Sayings of the Scholars Concerning the School of Ibn `Abd al-Wahhab&quot;), also known as:
&quot;Al-Sawa`iq al-Ilahiyya fi Madhhab al-Wahhabiyya&quot; (&quot;The Divine Thunderbolts Concerning the Wahhabi School&quot;).

In &quot;The Refutation of Wahhabism in Arabic Sources, 1745–1932&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=UKkWRu6u29gC Kingdom without borders: Saudi political, religious and media frontiers]&lt;/ref&gt; Hamadi Redissi provides original references to the description of Wahhabis as a divisive sect (firqa) and outliers ([[Kharijites]]) in communications between Ottomans and Egyptian Khedive Muhammad Ali. Redissi details refutations of Wahhabis by scholars ([[mufti]]s); among them Ahmed Barakat Tandatawin, who in 1743 describes Wahhabism as ignorance (Jahala).

;Criticism by shi'ites and destruction of venerated graves
In 1801 and 1802, the Saudi Wahhabis under [[Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud]] attacked and captured the holy  [[Shia]] cities of [[Karbala]] and [[Najaf]] in Iraq and destroyed the tombs of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] who is the grandson of Muhammad, and son of [[Ali]] (Ali bin Abu Talib), the son-in-law of Muhammad (see: [[Wahhabism#Saudi sponsorship|Saudi sponsorship]] mentioned previously). In 1803 and 1804 the Saudis captured Makkah and Madinah and demolished various venerated shrines, monuments and removed a number of what was seen as sources or possible gateways to polytheism or [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] - such as the shrine built over the tomb of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Muhammad. In 1998 the Saudis bulldozed and allegedly poured gasoline over the grave of [[Aminah bint Wahb]], the mother of Muhammad, causing resentment throughout the Muslim World.&lt;ref name=&quot;islamicamagazine.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/6999574/Spirit The Destruction of Holy Sites in Mecca and Medina] By Irfan Ahmed in Islamic Magazine, Issue 1, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Paladin Gears Up for War&quot;&gt;Nibras Kazimi, [http://www.nysun.com/article/65662?page_no=3 A Paladin Gears Up for War], [[The New York Sun]], November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saudi's Shi'ites walk tightrope&quot;&gt;John R Bradley, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GC17Ak01.html Saudi's Shi'ites walk tightrope], [[Asia Times]], March 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

;Criticism by sufi organisations
The Syrian professor and scholar Dr. [[Muhammad Sa'id Ramadan al-Buti]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://answeringwhhabismandsalafism.wordpress.com/2008/03/02/why-does-one-have-to-follow-a-madhhab-debate-between-muhammad-said-al-buti/ Bouti debate with Salafi]&lt;/ref&gt; criticises the Salafi movement in a few of his works.

The [[sufi]] [[Islamic Supreme Council of America]] founded by the [[Naqshbandi]] sufi Shaykh [[Hisham Kabbani]] classify Wahhabbism as being extremist and heretical based on Wahhabbism's rejection of sufism and what they believe to be traditional [[sufi]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/bin/site/wrappers/extremism_wahabroots.html &quot;Radicalism: Its Wahhabi Roots and Current Representation&quot;,]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}} [[Islamic Supreme Council of America]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/14/the-islamists-have-it-wrong The Islamists Have it Wrong] By Abdul Hadi Palazzi Middle East Quarterly, Summer 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rissc.jo/docs/1N-WithCovers(lowres).pdf On Islam and 500 most influential Muslims]&lt;/ref&gt; However the ISCA is alleged to have links to the [[neoconservative]] lobby in the [[United States]], hence explaining the groups hatred for the &quot;[[wahhabi]]&quot; movement.  Kabbani allegedly thanked [[UK]] Foreign Secretary [[Jack Straw]] in 2005 for the role the UK played in the Middle East, saying: “We are glad to see changes taking place in the political mechanisms in the Middle East. We hope to see an end to tyranny and we are happy to observe a strong upsurge in freedom of speech, freedom of belief and political openness in the region.”

Wahabbism is intensely opposed by some [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims in [[China]], primarily by the [[Sufi]] [[Khafiya]], some [[Hanafi]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Gedimu]] and a number of [[Jahriyya]]. The [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan) Chinese sect founded by [[Ma Wanfu]] in China was originally inspired by the Wahhabi movement however the group reacted with hostility to Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing, who attempted to introduce Wahhabism as the Orthodox main form of Islam. They were branded as traitors of foreign influence, alien to the native popular cultural practices of Islam in China, and Wahhabi teachings were deemed as heresy by the Yihewani leaders. Ma Debao established a Salafi / Wahhabi order, called the [[Salafi|Sailaifengye]] [[menhuan]] in [[Lanzhou]] and [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia]], separate from other Muslim sects in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Kuomintang]] [[Sufi]] Muslim general [[Ma Bufang]], who backed the [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan) Muslims, persecuted the Salafi / Wahhabi Muslims. The Yihewani forced the Salafis into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and a Chinese nationalist organisation, and they considered the Salafis to be &quot;Heterodox&quot; (''xie jiao''), and &quot;people who followed foreigner's teachings&quot; (''wai dao''). After the Communist revolution the Salafis were allowed to worship openly until a 1958 crackdown on all religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Deobandi]] [[Islamic Scholar|Alim]] Abd al-Hafiz al-Makki has argued that Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab viewed authentic [[sufism]] in a positive light comparing it to the sciences of [[tafseer]], [[hadith]], and [[fiqh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As proof, the Shaykh also cites a letter in which Abd-al-Wahhab writes;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not negate the way of the Sufis and the [[Tazkiah|purification of the inner self]] from the vices of those sins connected to the heart and the limbs as long as the individual firmly adheres to the rules of Shari‘ah and the correct and observed way. However, we will not take it on ourselves to [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|allegorically interpret]] (ta’wil) his speech and his actions. We only place our reliance on, seek help from, beseech aid from and place our confidence in all our dealings in [[Allah]] Most High. He is enough for us, the best trustee, the best [[mawla]] and the best helper. May Allah send peace on our master Muhammad, [[Ahl al-Bayt|his family]] and [[Sahaba|companions]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Wahhabism in the United States===
A study conducted by
the [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Freedom House]] found Wahhabi publications in [[mosque]]s in the United States. These publications included statements that Muslims should not only &quot;always oppose&quot; infidels &quot;in every way&quot;, but &quot;hate them for their religion … for Allah's sake&quot;, that [[democracy]] &quot;is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century&quot;, and that [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and certain Sunni Muslims were [[Apostasy in Islam|infidels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/45.pdf Saudi Publications on Hate Ideology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;quotes from a study &quot;based on a year-long study of over two hundred original documents, all disseminated, published or otherwise generated by the government of Saudi Arabia and collected from more than a dozen mosques in the United States&quot;.

The Saudi government issued a response to this report, stating: &quot;[It has] worked diligently during the last five years to overhaul its education system [but] [o]verhauling an educational system is a massive undertaking&quot;.

A review of the study by [[Institute for Social Policy and Understanding]] (ISPU) complained the study cited documents from only a few mosques, arguing most mosques in the U.S. are not under Wahhabi influence.&lt;ref name=IRC-Freedom-House&gt;{{cite web

===Militant and political Islam===
What connection, if any, there is between Wahhabism and [[Salafism jihadism|Jihadi Salafis]] is disputed.
Natana De Long-Bas, senior [[research assistant]] at the [[Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding]] at [[Georgetown University]], argues:
{{quote|The [[Islamic terrorism|militant Islam]] of [[Osama bin Laden]] did not have its origins in the teachings of Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab and was not representative of Wahhabi Islam as it is practiced in contemporary Saudi Arabia, yet for the media it came to define Wahhabi Islam during the later years of bin Laden's lifetime. However &quot;unrepresentative&quot; bin Laden's global [[jihad]] was of Islam in general and Wahhabi Islam in particular, its prominence in headline news took Wahhabi Islam across the spectrum from revival and reform to global jihad.&lt;ref&gt;Natana J. Delong-Bas, &quot;Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad&quot;, (Oxford University Press: 2004), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Noah Feldman]] distinguishes between what he calls the &quot;deeply conservative&quot; Wahhabis and what he calls the &quot;followers of political Islam in the 1980s and 1990s,&quot; such as [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] and later [[Al-Qaeda]] leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]]. While Saudi Wahhabis were &quot;the largest funders of local [[Muslim Brotherhood]] chapters and other hard-line [[Islamism|Islamists]]&quot; during this time, they opposed jihadi resistance to Muslim governments and assassination of Muslim leaders because of their belief that &quot;the decision to wage jihad lay with the ruler, not the individual believer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''After Jihad: American and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy'' by Noah Feldman, New York : Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction of Islam's early historical sites===
{{Main|Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites}}

==International influence and propagation==
According to observers, such as [[Gilles Kepel]], Wahhabism gained considerable influence in the [[Muslim World|Islamic World]] following a tripling in the price of oil in the mid-1970s and the progressive takeover of [[Saudi Aramco]] in the 1974–1980 period. The Saudi government began to spend tens of billions of dollars throughout the Islamic World to promote Wahhabism, which was sometimes referred to as &quot;petro-Islam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kepel|2002|pp=69–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary called ''The Qur'an'' aired in the UK, presenter Antony Thomas suggested the figure may be &quot;upward of $100 billion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/tv-radio-reviews/last-nights-tv-the-quran-channel-4-banged-up-five-867474.html ''The Qur'an'' review in ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Its largess funded an estimated &quot;90% of the expenses of the entire faith&quot;, throughout the Muslim World, according to journalist Dawood al-Shirian.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Dawood al-Shirian, 'What Is Saudi Arabia Going to Do?' ''Al-Hayat'', May 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It extended to young and old, from children's [[madrasah|madrasas]] to high-level scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Abou al Fadl, Khaled, ''The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2005, p.48-64&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Books, scholarships, fellowships, mosques&quot; (for example,  &quot;more than 1,500 mosques were built from Saudi public funds over the last 50 years&quot;) were paid for.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; It rewarded journalists and academics, who followed it and built satellite campuses around [[Egypt]] for [[Al-Azhar University|Al Azhar]], the oldest and most influential Islamic university.&lt;ref&gt;(Murphy, Caryle, ''Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience'', Simon and Schuster, 2002 p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

This financial power has done much to overwhelm less strict local interpretations of Islam,  according to observers like Dawood al-Shirian and [[Lee Kuan Yew]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; and has caused the Saudi interpretation to be perceived as the correct interpretation in many Muslims' minds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25472708_ITM An interview with Minister Mentor of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudis have spent at least $87 billion propagating Wahhabism abroad during the past two decades, and the scale of financing is believed to have increased in the past two years. The bulk of this funding goes towards the construction and operating expenses of mosques, madrasas, and other religious institutions that preach Wahhabism. It also supports imam training; mass media and publishing outlets; distribution of textbooks and other literature; and endowments to universities (in exchange for influence over the appointment of Islamic scholars). Some of the hundreds of thousands of non-Saudis who live in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf have been influenced by Wahhabism and preach Wahhabism in their home country upon their return. Agencies controlled by the Kingdom's Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, [[Dawah|Da'wah]] and Guidance are responsible for outreach to non-Muslim residents and are converting hundreds of non-Muslims into Islam every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolitician.com/23661-saudi Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism and the Spread of Sunni Theofascism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wahhabism-a-deadly-scripture-398516.html Wahhabism: A deadly scripture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sullivan-county.com/x/fox_imm.htm Saudi Arabia's Export of Radical Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/43999.pdf Islam in South and Southeast Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kashmirherald.com/featuredarticle/radicalislam.html Radical Islam in Central Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanation for influence===
[[Khaled Abou El Fadl]] attributed the appeal of Wahhabism to some Muslims as stemming from
* [[Arab nationalism]], which followed the Wahhabi attack on the Ottoman Empire;
* Reformism, which followed a return to [[Salaf]] ({{unicode|as-Salaf aṣ-Ṣāliḥ}};)
* Destruction of the Hejaaz [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Khilafa]] in 1925;
* Control of Mecca and Medina, which gave Wahhabis great influence on Muslim culture and thinking;
* Oil, which after 1975 allowed Wahhabis to promote their interpretations of Islam using billions from oil export revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Abou El Fadl, Khaled, ''The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists'', Harper San Francisco, 2005, p.70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;
