{{Other uses|Sunna (disambiguation)}}
{{Muhammad}}
The word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|'''Sunnah'''}}'' ({{lang|ar|سنة}} {{IPA-ar|ˈsunna|}}, plural {{lang|ar|سنن}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sunan}}'' {{IPA-ar|ˈsunan|}}, [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is derived from the root ({{lang|ar|سن}} {{IPA-ar|sa-n-na|}} [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) meaning smooth and easy flow [of water] or direct flow path. The word literally means a clear and well trodden path. In the discussion of the sources of religion, Sunnah denotes the practice of [[Prophet Muhammad]] that he taught and practically instituted as a teacher of the [[sharī‘ah]] and the best exemplar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Islahi|first=Amin Ahsan|title=Mabadi Tadabbur i Hadith (translated as: Fundamentals of Hadith Intrepretation)|year=1989 (tr:2009)|publisher=Al-Mawrid|location=Lahore|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/DownloadContainer.aspx?id=71|author=Amin Ahsan Islahi|authorlink=Amin Ahsan Islahi|accessdate=1 June 2011|language=Urdu|chapter=Difference between Hadith and Sunnah}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muslim belief, this practice is to be adhered to in fulfilling the divine injunctions, carrying out religious rites and moulding life in accord with the will of God. To institute these practices was, the [[Qur’ān]] states, a part of the Prophet’s responsibility as a [[Messenger of Allah|Messenger of God]]{{Quran-usc|3|164}}{{Quran-usc|33|21}}

The sunnah of Muhammad includes his specific words, habits, practices, and silent approvals:&lt;ref name=&quot;nasr&quot;&gt;Nasr, Seyyed H. &quot;Sunnah and Hadith&quot;. World Spirituality: An Encyclopedia History of the Religious Quest. 19 vols. New York: Crossroad. 97–109.&lt;/ref&gt; it is significant because it addresses ways of life dealing with friends, family and government.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasr&quot; /&gt; Recording ''sunnah'' was an [[Arabia]]n tradition and, once people converted to [[Islam]], they brought this custom to their [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldziher |first=Ignác |title=Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law |page=231 |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton UP |year=1981 |isbn=0691072574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sunnah'' is consulted after referring to the [[Qur'an]], if the issue is not addressed there. The term &quot;''[[Sunni]]''&quot; denotes those who claim to practice these usages, as part of the ''[[Ummah]]''.

==Etymology==
''{{transl|ar|DIN|'''Sunnah'''}}'' ({{lang|ar|سنة}} {{IPA-ar|ˈsunna|}}, plural {{lang|ar|سنن}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN| sunan}}'' {{IPA-ar|ˈsunan|}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word that means &quot;habit&quot; or &quot;usual practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/reference/glossary/term.SUNNAH.html Sunnah]&lt;/ref&gt; Sunnis are also referred to as [[Ahl as-Sunnah wa'l-Jamā'ah]] (&quot;people of the tradition and the community (of Muhammad)&quot;) or ''Ahl as-Sunnah'' for short.

== Sunnah and hadith ==
In the context of biographical records of Muhammad ''sunnah'' often stands as synonymous with ''[[hadith]]'' since most of the personality traits of [[Muhammad]] are known from descriptions of him, his sayings and his actions after becoming a prophet at the age of forty. ''Sunnah'', which consists of what Muhammad believed, implied, or tacitly approved, was noted down by his companions in ''ahadith''. Allegiance to the tribal ''sunnah'' had been partially replaced by submission to a new universal authority and the sense of brotherhood among Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nasr |first=S. |title=Islamic Studies |location=Beirut |publisher=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |year=1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Sunni scholars often considered ''sunnah'' equivalent to the biography of Mohammed (''[[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]]'') as the ''hadith'' was then poorly validated while contemporary accounts of Muhammad's life were better known. As the ''hadith'' came to be better documented and the scholars who validated them gained prestige, the ''sunnah'' came often to be known mostly through the ''hadith'', especially as variant or fictional biographies of Muhammad spread.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

How far ''[[hadith]]'' contributes to ''sunnah'' is disputed and highly dependent on context.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Classical Islam often equates the ''sunnah'' with the ''hadith''. Scholars who studied the narrations according to their context (''matn'') as well as their transmission (''[[isnad]]'') in order to discriminate between them were influential in the development of [[early Muslim philosophy]]. In the context of [[Islamic Law]] [[Imam Malik]] and the [[Hanafi]] scholars are assumed to have differentiated between the two: for example Imam Malik is said to have rejected some traditions that reached him because, according to him, they were against the &quot;established practice of the people of Medina&quot;.

== Sunnah and Islam ==
{{Islam}}
Passages in the [[Qur'an]] command that the prophet be followed, such as 3:32 &quot;Obey God and His messenger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Okumus, Fatih. &quot;The Prophet As Example&quot;. Studies in Inter religious Dialogue 18 (2008): 82-95. Religion Index. Ebsco. Thomas Tredway Library, Rock Island, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; For Muslims the imitation of Muhammad helps one to know and be loved by God: one lives in constant remembrance of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasr&quot;/&gt;

Shi'a Muslims do not use the six major ''hadith'' collections followed by the Sunni. Instead, their primary collections were written by three authors known as the 'Three Muhammads'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Momen, Moojan 1985, p.174&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Momen |first=Moojan |title=Introduction to Shi'i Islam |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=1985 |page=174 |isbn=0300034997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are: ''[[Kitab al-Kafi]]'' by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]] al-Razi (329 [[Hijri year|AH]]), ''[[Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih]]'' by [[Al-Shaykh al-Saduq|Muhammad ibn Babuya]] and ''[[Tahdhib al-Ahkam|Al-Tahdhib]]'' and ''[[Al-Istibsar]]'' both by [[Shaykh Tusi|Shaykh Muhammad Tusi]]. Unlike [[Akhbari]] [[Twelver]] Shi'a, [[Usuli]] Twelver Shi'a scholars do not believe that everything in the four major books is authentic. In Shia ''hadith'' one often finds sermons attributed to [[Ali]] in [[The Four Books]] or in the [[Nahj al-Balagha]].

Traditional Muslims believe that the ''sunnah'' is justified by verses such as &quot;A similar (favour have ye already received) in that We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our Signs, and sanctifying you, and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in new knowledge.(2:151) {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The verse &quot;Verily in the messenger of God you have a good example for him who looks unto God and the Last Day and remembers God much&quot;. (33:21), further emphasizes that Muhammad's mission is to teach and exemplify The Qur'an, not just to relate its verses and leave. Muhammad was not to be worshipped or deified but his role was to deliver The Qur'an with comprehensive explanations of how to live according to the Qur'anic guidelines preserved in Sunnah. The teachings of &quot;wisdom&quot; have been declared to be a function of Muhammad along with the teachings of the scripture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manzur Nu'mani|Muhammad Manzoor Nomani]] &quot;Marif al-Hadith&quot;, introductory chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

For a better understanding of &quot;wisdom&quot; (''hikmah''), one can refer to The [[Quran]] itself. For example, verse 4:113 states; &quot;God reveals the Book (i.e. the books of revealed religion, especially The Qur'an) to you, and wisdom, and teaches you that which you did not know. The grace of God towards you has been very great&quot;. Verse 2:231 states; &quot;And remember God's grace upon you, and that which He has revealed unto you of Scripture and wisdom whereby He exhorts you&quot;. Verse 33:34 states, &quot;And bear in mind which is recited in your houses of the revelations of God and of wisdom&quot;.

Some have said that &quot;wisdom&quot; here is simply another name for ''sunnah''. Therefore, along with divine revelation the ''sunnah'' was directly taught by God. Modern Sunni scholars are beginning to examine both the ''sira'' and the ''hadith'' in order to justify modifications to jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]''). The ''sunna'', in one form or another, would retain its central role in providing a moral example and ethical guidance.

==Alternative views on Sunnah==
According to the view of some Sufi Muslims who incorporate both the outer and inner reality of Prophet Muhammad, hold the view that the deeper and true Sunnah are the noble characteristics and inner state of Prophet Muhammad. To them the Prophet's attitude, his piety, the quality of his character constitute the truer and deeper aspect of what it means by Sunnah in Islam, rather than the external aspects alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysticsaint.info/2012/01/message-rabiul-awwal-milad-nabi.html Recognizing the True and Deeper Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the external customs of the Prophet loses its meaning without the inner attitude and also many Sunnah are simply custom of the Arabs, not something that is unique to Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;http://quran.com/33/21 The Quran 33:21 &lt;/ref&gt; and ''Khuluqin Azim'' or 'Exalted Character'&lt;ref&gt; http://quran.com/68/4 The Quran 68:4&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Quran]], real Sunnah cannot be upheld.

According to some scholars, Sunnah predates both the Quran as well as Muhammad, and is actually the tradition of the Prophets of God, specifically the tradition of [[Abraham]]. A broad form of Sunnah was already being practised by the [[Christians]], [[Jews]] and the Arab descendants of [[Ishmael|Ismail]], when Muhammad reinstituted this practice as an integral part of Islam. Sunnah and Quran both are equally authentic and the former includes worship rituals like [[Salah]], [[Zakah]], [[Hajj]], fasting in [[Ramadan]] as well as customs like [[circumcision]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghamidi|first=Javed Ahmad|title=Mizan (translated as: Islam - A Comprehensive Introduction)|year=1990 (tr:2009)|publisher=Al-Mawrid|location=Lahore|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/DownloadContainer.aspx?id=84|author=Javed Ahmad Ghamidi|authorlink=Javed Ahmad Ghamidi|accessdate=1 June 2011|language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
