== Section on the &quot;Four Noble Truths&quot; ==

I am planning on replacing the current text on the Four Noble Truths with the text at this link: [[User:Dorje108/FNT overview new]]

The reasons for this change are explained below:

Considering this presentation of the FNT:
:# Life as we know it ultimately is or leads to suffering/uneasiness ([[dukkha]]) in one way or another.
:# Suffering is caused by [[tanha|craving]]. This is often expressed as a deluded clinging to a certain sense of existence, to selfhood, or to the things or phenomena that we consider the cause of happiness or unhappiness. Craving also has its negative aspect, i.e. one craves that a certain state of affairs not exist.
:# Suffering ends when craving ends. This is achieved by eliminating delusion, thereby reaching a [[Nirvana (concept)|liberated state]] of Enlightenment ([[bodhi]]);
:# Reaching this liberated state is achieved by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path|path]] laid out by the Buddha.

:This method is described by early Western scholars, and taught as an introduction to Buddhism by some contemporary Mahayana teachers (for example, the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]).&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html ''The Four Noble Truths'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
Regarding the presentation above:
* The above summary of the Four Noble Truths does not cite any reliable secondary sources, and I have not seen these truths presented in this manner in any of the sources that I have researched.
* This is not the way the Dalai Lama teaches the four noble truths. See [[Four_Noble_Truths#CITEREFDalai_Lama1998]]
* The reference cited, for &quot;The Big View&quot; website, does not meet the criteria for a Reliable Secondary source. There is no indication that the writer/editor[http://www.thebigview.com/about/editor.html] for the site has published any writing. 
* For summaries of the four noble truths from Reliable Secondary Sources, see [[Four_Noble_Truths#cite_note-40]]
** Note that the summary from Macmillan within the current section is also consistent with other Reliable Secondary Sources.

Considering the following paragraph:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;The traditional Theravada understanding is that the Four Noble Truths are an advanced teaching for those who are ready for them.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=penguin&gt;{{Cite book| title = The New Penguin Handbook of Living Religions |author = Hinnels, John R. | pages = 393f | publisher = Penguin Books | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-14-051480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Asian Mahayana position is that they are a preliminary teaching for people not yet ready for the higher and more expansive Mahayana teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhism'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Regarding the above paragraph:
* The sources are reliable, but the paragraph presents inaccurate assumptions based on these sources. For example:
** Harvey is the only source I have encountered that presents the FNT as advanced from the Theravada POV. Most Theravada sources do not present it this way. See Ajahn Sumedho here: [[Four_Noble_Truths#cite_note-8]], and Bhikkhu Bodhi and Thanisaro Bhikkhu here: [[Four_Noble_Truths#cite_ref-11]]
** There are multiple Mahayana sources (including the Dalai Lama and Thich Naht Hahn) that state that the FNT are the central teachings of Buddhism. See [[Four_Noble_Truths#cite_note-8]]
* This is a tricky topic, and it's best dealt with in the main article on the [[Four Noble Truths]]. (We have begun addressing this topic within the main article, and I hope to clarify it further.)

I am planning to make these changes later today. If anyone has comments or objections, please cite Reliable Secondary Sources where appropriate. - Regards, [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 20:18, 3 June 2012 (UTC)

I think this change makes the definitions less useful for a beginner. Is it necessary to begin each sentence with &quot;The truth of...&quot;? This might be a useful style for, say,  chanting monks but it doesn't, to me, read well for a general encyclopaedia. Also, there isn't much informational content there. Take away &quot;The truth of...&quot; and all you have for the first Noble Truth is &quot;Dukkha&quot;! Useful in a streamlined checklist for arahants, perhaps, but what about the poor layman?

Combining your succinctness, the original, reducing the formulaic aspect, and we get something like:

:# Life is suffering ([[dukkha]]).
:# Suffering is caused by [[tanha|craving]].
:# Suffering ends when craving ends.
:# Craving is brought to an end by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path|path]].

[[User:Mal|Mal]] ([[User talk:Mal|talk]]) 17:08, 19 July 2012 (UTC)

Hi Mal, Thanks for including a reference in your comment. If you refer to the text that you cited (by Damien Keown), you'll notice that Keown does actually identify the four noble truths in the traditional manner when he is quoting the suttas: that is, The Truth of Suffering, etc.

In the passage that you are citing (on page 45), he is giving an ''interpretation'' of these truths. He states: &quot;These [truths] '''assert''' that 1) Life is suffering&quot;, etc. And most contemporary scholars and translators do not agree with this interpretation of &quot;Life is suffering...&quot; Please refer to the Summary section of the main article ([[Four_Noble_Truths#Summary]]) and look at the footnotes; I've given a good sampling of summaries from a number of Reliable Secondary Sources.

To reiterate: the first noble truth of Buddhism is rendered in Buddhist texts as &quot;The Truth of Dukkha&quot; (or you can translate it &quot;The Truth of Suffering&quot;). It's ''Dukkha ariya sacca'' in Pali. There is no debate about this among an Reliable Secondary Source, including the source that you cited. If your read further in the text you cited, Keown writes:
:&quot;This truth, known in Buddhism as the ‘Truth of Suffering’, is the cornerstone of the Buddha’s teaching. The Truth of Suffering states that suffering (dukkha, Sanskrit: duhkḥa) is an intrinsic part of life, and it diagnoses the human condition as fundamentally one of ‘dis-ease’.&quot; -- Keown, Damien (2000-02-24). Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction (Kindle Locations 918-920). Oxford University Press. Kindle Edition. 

What you are suggesting is to substitute a minority interpretation of this universally agreed on &quot;title&quot; for the first noble truth.  There is room for presenting different interpretations within the main article on this topic, but please don't confuse an interpretation with the formal names used to identify these truths.

Also, for a topic like this where people (such as myself) have done a lot of research, please wait for a response to your comments before making changes. I am going to respectfully revert your edits for the reasons stated above. Regards [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 02:04, 20 July 2012 (UTC)

Buddhism is not a religion. the definition of religion is the belief in a god or a supernatural being combined with worship of that being. none of these precepts are present in the Buddhist philosophy. Buddha is not worshiped, he is not considered a god or deity.in no way can Buddhism be considered a religion. It is a philosophy and a way of life that is devoid of the worship of any God. Only ignorant people consider it a religion. I ask anyone to prove me wrong. I have been studying Buddhism for 30 years and I am an atheist.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/64.203.29.39|64.203.29.39]] ([[User talk:64.203.29.39|talk]]) 05:27, 17 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Hi,

In the rebirth section of this article &quot;Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life, each running from conception[30] to death. Buddhism rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in --[[User:Sandeep1415|Sandeep1415]] ([[User talk:Sandeep1415|talk]]) 17:23, 19 June 2012 (UTC)Hinduism--[[User:Sandeep1415|Sandeep1415]] ([[User talk:Sandeep1415|talk]]) 17:23, 19 June 2012 (UTC) and Christianity.&quot;

But Hinduism is the first religion to support rebirth. I think it would be Islam instead of Hinduism here.

There seems to be a misunderstanding here. The sentence in question does not state that Hinduism rejects rebirth. It states that Buddhism rejects the concept of a permanent, unchanging &quot;soul&quot; (in chritianity, which survives death to live on in heaven or hell) or the similar concept of &quot;atman&quot; (in Hinduism, which stays unchanged from one rebirth to the next). This is illustrated further down in the same paragraph: &quot;Rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation of a dynamic, ever-changing process of &quot;dependent arising&quot; (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;) determined by the laws of cause and effect (karma) rather than that of one being, transmigrating or incarnating from one existence to the next.&quot; [[User:Andi 3ö|Andi 3ö]] ([[User talk:Andi 3ö|talk]]) 14:50, 29 September 2012 (UTC)
&lt;br&gt;Yes i got it. But when you put christianity and Hinduism in the same sentence under rebirth it confused me. Any way as you said ,yes! the soul is unchanging in hindusim but the characteristics that the soul carriers from one life to another depends on karma. That results in various forms and characteristic in each birth. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sandeep1415|Sandeep1415]] ([[User talk:Sandeep1415|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sandeep1415|contribs]]) 8 October 2012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Eliminating Hatred?? ==

The end of the openinig paragraph states ''&quot;He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end suffering (dukkha) through eliminating ignorance (avidyā), craving (taṇhā), and hatred, by way of understanding and seeing dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) and non-self (anātman), and thus attain the highest happiness, nirvāņa (nirvana).&quot;''

Where does this special focus on hatred, as opposed to other merely human emotions, come from? And why is it preseted at the outset of the article on Buddhist thought? I suspect it is making Buddhism out to have a subtle political or 'ethical' bent, which it simply does not. In Buddhism, such a focus on reducing hatred, as opposed to happiness or love, would be a reflection of 'Tanha', which as another wikipedia article states &quot;...is the craving or desire to hold onto pleasurable experiences, to be separated from painful or unpleasant experiences, and for neutral experiences or feelings not to decline&quot;. The elimination of hatred is not one of the main tenents of buddhism, any more than eliminating it's opposite all-too-human emotion is. Buddhism is only concerned with human emotions insofar as they represent participation in samsaric existence, the world of becoming. Thus it is only concerned with human emotions in so far as they are to be a target of detachment. It is not concerned with human emotions insofar as one or another particular emotion is to be promoted above the others. Therefore it is arbitrary to write in the introduction of the article on Buddhism that one of its main properties, as a cultural phenomenon and religious, spirital and philosophical movement, is the 'elimination of hatred'.  I propose this be deleted, or added to in order to include the contrasting human emotions that also reflect an attachment to samsaric existence.

:That's more or less correct.  The problem is that we have many editors contributing to this article and there is nobody maintaining a stable version.  For example, the last time I was able to verify that paragraph, it read, &quot;He is recognized by adherents as an awakened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end suffering, achieve nirvana, and escape what is seen as a cycle of suffering and rebirth.&quot;  I will restore it now.

:::Actually, the statement was sort of referring to the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]] (or the ''three unwholesome roots''), which are generally referred to as the root cause of suffering in the Mahayana tradition and the Theravada Abhidharma tradition. So the statement wasn't incorrect, but it was awkwardly worded. I think the edit is fine, though, since it reads more clearly in this case. (The aspect of aversion/hatred is implied within tanha--it is one of the &quot;three channels&quot; of tanha. So referring to avidya and tanha or the &quot;three poisons&quot; are just different ways of expressing the same concept.) - [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 11:59, 22 August 2012 (UTC)
::::Right, we should include the third channel, but call it not something as loaded as 'hatred' but rather 'aversion'. Because if your using 'hatred' as a synonym for the 'aversion' channel then you've no choice but to use 'love' as a synonym for the 'attachment' or 'craving' channel, surely. This is getting very semantic I know. David.

Isn't it more correct to say that Buddhism is a philosophy instead of a religion, because a religion is where a distinct God entity exists (e.g. Vishnu in Hinduism, Allah in Islam etc.) whereas Buddhism is monotheistic, in terms that there is no God character whom Buddhists worship (knowing Buddha isn't God himself)?

I think that

should be replaced with

&quot;Mahayana is found throughout East Asia and includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism, Shingon, and Tiantai (Tendai).&quot;

because Shinnyo-en is not a big enough sect of Buddhism to be listed as a tradition within Buddhism the same way that the others are. Shinnyo-en declares itself to be a part of the Shingon tradition as well.

:I disagree. If &quot;traditions&quot; is replaced with &quot;sects&quot; than other more sizable sects will have to be added into the sentence. Namely Soka Gakkai, but other sects as well, which are as big or bigger than Shinnyo-en, would have to be included in the sentence. Without Shinnyo-en in the sentence it retains the original meaning without excessive cuts. I agree Shinnyo-en is not insignificant in general but it should be included in a section on sects along with all the others. ~[[User:Etbwikier|Etbwikier]] ([[User talk:Etbwikier|talk]]) 12:45, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

=== Is Buddhism a Religion? - part 2 ===

Buddism is commonly referred to as a religeon, yet a Buddist does not really pray to a thing or being, if anything they pray to, or meditate to themselves. 

Nor do they have anything to appease but themselves. Some may argue that a religeon is simply something that contains a sereis of beleifs but I personly would disagree highly on that.

--[[User:LPG32|LPG32]] ([[User talk:LPG32|talk]]) 12:59, 20 October 2012 (UTC)

::Not really sure why we see this question so much.  Buddhism is a religion. The important distinction is that a religion requires faith, not that it requires belief in a deity. Until there is universally acclaimed scientific proof for the existence of karma and rebirth Buddhism will remain a religion. Except for some very modern scholarly interpretations, Buddhism depends upon rebirth/karma to establish the 12 interdependant links, which in turn underlie the entire thesis of the four noble truths. Without karma, there is no basis for refuge. Likewise, without the four noble truths, there is no purpose to the three higher trainings.  Within traditions such as Zen (Tengu may be better qualified to explain this) the Wisdom tradition (the third of the three higher trainings) is prevalent - and the motivation is that of Mahayana. Without continuity of consciousness (ie, rebirth) the very meaning of Mahayana is uprooted.

::I find it hard to imagine what it would feel like to be truly a Buddhist without faith in Karma/Rebirth. How could one begin to derive meaning from Lord Buddha's teachings? Without rebirth there is a personal escape from the consequences of one's actions. Moreover, the easiest way to rid ones-self from Samsara would be to merely take one's own life!  This is a very dangerous road to follow. How could one distinguish Buddhism from Nihilism? 

::There is only one way in which Buddhism is not a religion - and that is that most Buddhists disbelieve in an omnipotent Judge God. Buddhists often believe in omniscience, and certainly many Buddhists believe in Devas - Gods - But the important distinction is that Buddhism identifies Karma with the role of determining one's future (rather than God the Judge) and declares that there is no-one that we can call upon to forgive us for our misdeeds. Instead we must take responsibility for our actions. ([[User:20040302|20040302]] ([[User talk:20040302|talk]]) 10:52, 21 October 2012 (UTC))

:::: FROM Dorje108: No one is denying the Faith plays an important part in Buddhism, or the Buddhism has many aspects of religion. But the following points should be considered.
::::# There is not clear consensus on what a religion is. For many people, religion implies belief in a creator god and some kind of creed. For example, here is a statement from the Wikipedia article on [[religion]]:
::::#: &quot;A global 2012 poll reports that 59% of the world's population is religious, 23% are [[irreligion|not religious]], and 13% are [[atheism|atheists]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |title=Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism |publisher=WIN-Gallup International |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::::#: So where does Buddhism fit into this poll? Are they among the religious or atheists?
::::# There are aspects of Buddhism that differentiate it from other religions: the emphasis on logic and analysis, understanding the true nature of reality, a &quot;science of mind&quot;, and the belief that eventually one must go beyond all concepts and beliefs.
::::# There is no clear consensus among scholars or Buddhists that Buddhism should categorically be considered a religion. How could there be, since there is no consensus on what a religion is? Scholars clearly disagree on this point. For example:
::::#* Rupert Gethin states: &quot;I am not concerned here to pronounce on a question that is sometimes asked of Buddhism: is it a religion? Obviously it depends on how one defines ‘a religion’. What is certain, however, is that Buddhism does not involve belief in a creator God who has control over human destiny, nor does it seek to define itself by reference to a creed...{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=65-66}}
::::#* Damien Keown states: &quot;Problems [...] confront us as soon as we try to define what Buddhism is. Is it a religion? A philosophy? A way of life? A code of ethics? It is not easy to classify Buddhism as any of these things, and it challenges us to rethink some of these categories. What, for example, do we mean by ‘religion’? Most people would say that religion has something to do with belief in God. [...] If belief in God in this sense is the essence of religion, then Buddhism cannot be a religion. [...] Some have suggested that a new category – that of the ‘non-theistic’ religion – is needed to encompass Buddhism. Another possibility is that our original definition is simply too narrow.{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 361-372}}
:::: I've provided multiple sources that show ambiguity and differences of opinion on this subject: [[User:Dorje108/Buddhism and religion sources]]. These sources are not &quot;minority&quot; points of view. They are from mainstream scholars (e.g. Rupert Gethin, Damien Keown) and mainstream Budhdists (e.g. the Dalai Lama, Walpola Rahula). &quot;Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha.&quot; This is all that needs to be said. This article does not need to state that Buddhism &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot; a religion. This is an open question, and the article should reflect this ambiguity.

::::::: Hi Tengu800, thanks for your comments. But I'm basing my comments based on many prominent main stream sources that are stating it is either inaccurate, or not entirely accurate to categorize Buddhism as &quot;a religion&quot;: [[User:Dorje108/Buddhism and religion sources]] How can this be original research if I am citing over a dozen sources? And how many sources do you need before you agree that this is not an &quot;alternative&quot; view. I have yet to see anyone else in this discussion cite a single source. Where are your sources that state Buddhism must be categorized as a religion? Buddhism is commonly &quot;referred to&quot; as a religion, but it is also commonly referred to as a philosophy, a science of mind, a spiritual path, or a way of life. There is a deeper point here, and that is expressed very well in this quote from Thomas Merton:
:::::::: When we look a little closer however, we find very serious and responsible practitioners of Zen first denying that it is &quot;a religion,&quot; then denying that it is a sect or school, and finally denying that it is confined to Buddhism and its &quot;structure.&quot; For instance, one of the great Japanese Zen Masters, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, said categorically: &quot;Anybody who would regard Zen as a school or sect of Buddhism and call it Zen-shu, Zen school, is a devil.&quot; To define Zen in terms of a religous system or structure is in fact to destroy it--or rather to miss it completely... --- Thomas Merton, Zen and the Birds of Appetite, A New Directions Paperbook, p. 3 
::::::: Barbara O'Brien makes a similar point:[http://buddhism.about.com/od/basicbuddhistteachings/a/philosophy.htm]
::::::::  In many ways, the &quot;religion versus philosophy&quot; argument is an artificial one. The neat separation between religion and philosophy we insist on today didn't exist in western civilization until the 18th century or so, and there never was such a separation in eastern civilization. To insist that Buddhism must be one thing and not the other amounts to forcing an ancient product into modern packaging.
:::::::: In Buddhism, this sort of conceptual packaging is considered to be a barrier to enlightenment. Without realizing it we use prefabricated concepts about ourselves and the world around us to organize and interpret what we learn and experience. One of the functions of Buddhist practice is to sweep away all the artificial filing cabinets in our heads so that we see the world as-it-is.
::::::: I'm really surprised that other editors are so set upon that idea the Buddhism must be categorized as a religion. Does this have to do with coming from an academic background, where subjects are supposed to fit into the &quot;Religion department&quot; or the &quot;Philosophy department.&quot; I really don't get it. ---- [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 17:38, 21 October 2012 (UTC)

:::::::: Just to add to this I think both arguments are valid, personally I think Buddhism isn't a religion and based on the books I've read I think it's backed up that it isn't. However! Based on the discussion above it's fair to say it's not entirely certain which it is. So based on this argument I don't think the opening sentence should say it's a religion. There should be a a section with essentially this argument in it but nowhere in the article should it say that it is a religion. Does anyone else agree with me here? It's too much of a debate for anywhere in this article to say it's definitely a religion. [[User:Sephers|Sephers]] ([[User talk:Sephers|talk]]) 22:17, 10 November 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::Without clarifying what books you're referring to, and the context the sentence is written in, that doesn't hold a lot of weight.

::::::::::Hi SudoGhost, Just to be clear, I am not stating that &quot;Buddhism is not a religion&quot;. What I am pointing out is that many well-respected reliable secondary sources have asserted that it is a matter of opinion as to whether you consider Buddhism is a religion or not. It depends upon your definition of religion. Many dictionary definitions for &quot;religion&quot; define the term as belief in a god. I am well aware that some scholars provide a much broader definition of religion, but you can't expect everyone who reads this article to have the same understanding of the term &quot;religion&quot;. Therefore, the term should be clarified as soon as it is introduced (not several paragraphs later, or several sections later).

:::::::::::: Hi SudoGhost, To try and clarify one more time. I am not claiming that the sources that I've cited say that &quot;Buddhism is not a religion&quot;. What multiple sources state very clearly is that &quot;it depends on your definition of religion.&quot; And the dictionary definitions support the proposition that there are in fact different definitions for the term religion. It seems to me that to say that &quot;Buddhism is a religion&quot; is equally incorrect as saying &quot;Buddhism is not a religion.&quot; To put it another way, which of the following three statements is correct: a) Buddhism is a religion; b) Buddhism is not a religion; c) It depends on your definition of religion. The correct answer is &quot;c&quot;. Statements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both making assertions that are only true roughly half the time.

'''Response by Joshua Jonathan'''. That's three dictionary-definitions, and a link to a Wikipedia article. The article gives definitions by various respected ''western'' scholars. I find Clifford Geertz interesting:
{{quote|[A] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic. Geertz, 1993, &quot;Religion as a cultural system&quot;.}}
Moojan Momen (not in the Wiki-article) gives an apparently dimilar, but slightly less neutral &quot;definition&quot;:
{{quote|Religion, as a human phenomenon, is founded on the basis of what is described as being the experience of the 'holy' or the 'sacred'. Momen, &quot;Understanding religion&quot;, 2009, p. 21}}
Note that this reminds of [[Rudolf Otto]]'s ''Das Heilig'', who in turn was inspired by [[William James]], who in his turn was inspired by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] ({{Citation | last =Sharf | first =Robert H. | year =1995-B | title =Buddhist Modernism and the Rhetoric of Meditative Experience | journal =NUMEN, vol.42 (1995) | url =http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/sharf/documents/Sharf1995,%20Buddhist%20Modernism.pdf}}).
So, I still think that &quot;religion&quot; is about more than gods and supernatural beings, but that the connection with &quot;the sacred&quot; is also a biased western understanding, saveguarding religion from western science.(Sharf 1995-B). Following Geertz, Buddhism could also be called a &quot;religion&quot;. Which, by the way, does not preclude the possibility of defining Buddhism as a set of rules &amp; insight, or another definition without connotations to gods and supernatural realities.

===Suggestion for revised lead===
Here's a suggestion for revising the lead, based on the discussions above. (This is obviously not perfect, but it hits the main points.)
: &quot;Buddhism is a collection of traditions, beliefs, and practices based on teachings attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, who is commonly known as the Buddha (meaning &quot;the awakened one&quot; in Sanskrit and Pāli). The Buddha is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who presented a system of training in conduct, meditation, and understanding that constitutes a path leading to the cessation of suffering (''[[dukkha]]''). The Buddha is believed to have lived and taught on the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE. In modern times, Buddhism has been variously described as a religion, a &quot;nontheistic religion&quot;, a philosophy, a science of mind, or a way of life.&quot;

According to the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha taught that the cause suffering (''dukkha'') is ignorance ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]) of the true nature of the self and phenomena, and that this ignorance leads to ''[[taṇhā]]'' (an unquenchable thirst, craving, or desire) to hold onto pleasurable experiences and to be separated from painful or unpleasant experiences.  The Buddha also taught that the causes of suffering can be overcome by following a path that eliminates ignorance (''avidya'') through developing a correct insight into the true nature of the self and phenomena--this insight is based on understanding and seeing the interdependent nature of all things (dependent origination; Sanskrit: [[pratītyasamutpāda]]). Thus, according to tradition, it is possible for anyone to completely eliminate suffering and thereby attain the highest happiness, nirvāņa ([[nirvana]]).
: 3. In modern times, Buddhism has been variously described as a religion, a philosophy, a science of mind, or a way of life. While Buddhism is commonly referred to as a religion, modern scholars and Buddhist teachers point out that while Buddhism has key similarities with the other major world religions, it also has key differences. Similarities include the importance of faith and devotion, and the use of prayer and rituals. However, Buddhism differs from the other major religions in that: Buddhism does not involve belief in a creator God who has control over human destiny, nor does it seek to define itself by reference to a creed. The Buddhist tradition emphasizes a path leading to the cessation of suffering (''dukkha''), and the Buddhist teachings suggest that preoccupation with certain beliefs—such as belief in a &quot;creator god&quot;, &quot;an eternal soul&quot;, or theories about the origin of the universe—in fact hinder our progress along the path rather than helping it. --- [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 15:03, 21 October 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - The lede is supposed to reflect what the majority of reliable sources use, and Buddhism is most commonly referred to as a religion.  That some people do not believe it fits into their definition of religion is an interesting aside that is appropriate for its own section, but doesn't belong in the lede. - [[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]][[User_talk:SudoGhost#top|Ghost]] 20:55, 21 October 2012 (UTC)
*:I think, at the very least, that all the work Dorje108 has presented here shows that there is certainly a degree of controversy about the matter in the relevant citable literature. With that in mind, I don't see how, with regard to [[WP:NPOV]], we can begin the article by, in Wikipedia's own voice, coming down unequivocally on one side of such a debate within the first few words. That is completely unsupportable in any matter that can be and has been debated in the academic and other serious literature. On the other hand, I do agree that the main place for presenting the debate is in the body of the article, not the lede. For example, I would suggest that something like Dorje's paragraph 3 above could be worked into [[Buddhism#Is Buddhism a religion?|the existing section]] with full references, and then summarised briefly somewhere within the lede. The first clause of the first sentence is not the place, but then neither is a subsection of the last section in the article. I suggest coverage of the debate be expanded, and moved up the article a bit. --[[User:Nigelj|Nigelj]] ([[User talk:Nigelj|talk]]) 21:11, 21 October 2012 (UTC)
:: '''Comment''' Hi SudhoGhost and Nigelj. Thanks for taking a look at this. 
::* SudoGhost, can you cite any sources from the past 10 or 20 years to support your position? Keep in mind that 10 or 15 years ago, it was very common to refer to the Dalai Lama as the &quot;god-king&quot; of Tibet. The point is that older sources may be more like to refer to Buddhism as a religion, but the sources that I am looking at, which tend to be from the past 10 or 20 years, are ambivalent on the matter.
::* The majority of definitions of religion still assert that the primary definition entails &quot;belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power.&quot; (See my comments on this above.) I think this is why some Buddhists have difficulty with the assertion that Buddhism is a religion.
::* Nigelj, thanks for your comments. Do you think paragraphs 1 and 2 above are a good start for the article? --- [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 22:02, 21 October 2012 (UTC)
:::*Absolutely.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83184/Buddhism][http://www.pbs.org/edens/thailand/buddhism.htm][http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/buddhism/brlife.htm][http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/japan/japanworkbook/religion/origins.html][http://books.google.com/books?id=IyMX0qS2hX4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhism+religion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z1FTP6g6ys&amp;sig=z-CwU28uBV5iWG2TSUuFVu_pT3Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l3iEUIPJMYf28gSB6IDwCA&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCDgK].  As per the criteria of [[WP:LEDE]], Buddhism is defined as a religion in mainstream reliable sources.  That some sources question this by giving ever-narrower definitions of what a &quot;religion&quot; does not change this, especially when many of them phrase it as a question in order to stimulate discussion about the importance of certain aspects of Buddhism, not to claim that it is not one.  Is it [[WP:UNDUE]] to assume that we should give equal consideration to a speculative minority description.  There are reliable sources that claim Christianity is not a religion at all, or that is it a cult instead, that does not mean the relevant article's lede should give equal consideration to this viewpoint. - [[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]][[User_talk:SudoGhost#top|Ghost]] 22:45, 21 October 2012 (UTC)
::::* '''Comment:''' Thank you SudoGhost. But with the exception of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which actually describes Buddhism as a &quot;religion and philosophy&quot;, these sources don't seem to be the most reliable of sources. Aren't we supposed to take into account things like the ''author'' and ''publisher'' of sources, and opportunity for peer review. Regarding your sources:
::::** [http://www.pbs.org/edens/thailand/buddhism.htm PBS] - I like PBS, but who is the author of this article? Aren't Buddhists like the Dalai Lama, and scholars like Rupert Gethin better sources according to the WP guidelines? (Because they are known experts in their field, and they are published by major publishers.)
::::** [http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/buddhism/brlife.htm University of Wyoming website] - another anonymously written web article. Same points as above.
::::**  [http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/japan/japanworkbook/religion/origins.html Columbia University, East Asian Curriculum Project] This article contains the following acknowledgement: ''Acknowledgment: The author of this article is Lise F. Vail. The article is adapted from FOCUS, issue on Asian Religions, fall 1982, published by The Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10021. Reprinted by permission.'' It's a recycled article from 30 years ago.
::::**   [http://books.google.com/books?id=IyMX0qS2hX4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhism+religion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z1FTP6g6ys&amp;sig=z-CwU28uBV5iWG2TSUuFVu_pT3Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l3iEUIPJMYf28gSB6IDwCA&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCDgK Japanese Temple Buddhism: Worldliness in a Religion of Renunciation (Topics in Contemporary Buddhism)] - this is a book by an assistant professor in the Department of Comparative Religion at Western Michigan University. It's a legitimate source, but why give this more weight than the sources that I have cited?
::::::*Because that source reflects scholarly consensus.  Even when we go by your arbritary &quot;only sources from the last 10 years of a ~2500 year old subject count&quot; method, it is still overwhelmingly referred to as a religion by most reliable sources.  Yes, there are sources that, for various reasons, question the religious label, but the fact that a dictionary defines something in a way that makes an editor question is no basis for rewriting the lede of the article.  Buddhists teachers raising the question of &quot;Is Buddhism a religion?&quot; in order to encourage discussion and contemplation on the meaning of certain things is no basis for rewriting the lede of the article.  That sources can be quoted saying Buddhism &quot;isn't just a religion&quot; or that it is &quot;nontheistic&quot; is no basis for rewriting the lede of the article.  None of the sources presented, when taken into the context of the surrounding work, say that Buddhism is not a religion. - [[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]][[User_talk:SudoGhost#top|Ghost]] 01:26, 22 October 2012 (UTC)
:::::::* Hi SudoGhost, thanks again for your comments. A few more questions:
:::::::** How do you decide what the scholarly consensus is? In my references, I've included Rupert Gethin, Paul Williams, Damien Keown, B. Allan Wallace, and Thomas Merton. Don't these folks count?
:::::::** I think its safe to say that Western &quot;scholarship&quot; on Buddhism is roughly 100 years old. I think most people would agree that much of the earlier scholarship contained misunderstandings of Buddhism. I've asked for more recent sources because I believe the scholarly understanding of Buddhism has improved dramatically over the last 20 or 30 years, since actual Buddhist teachers began teaching in the West, so more recent writing would reflect more the current consensus.
:::::::** You've mentioned twice now that Buddhist teachers are raising these questions &quot;in order to encourage discussion and contemplation on the meaning of certain things.&quot; That's clearly a matter of ''opinion''. I think these points are actually fundamental to the whole Buddhist path. 
:::::::* Best regards, [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 02:18, 22 October 2012 (UTC)
::::::::*I must have missed the &quot;Paul Williams says Buddhism isn't a religion&quot; part, because I'm not seeing it.  More importantly, while it may be true that Western works on Buddhism are around 100 years old, only focusing on modern Western ideas about an Eastern concept is a [[WP:BIAS|systemic bias]].  When you look at the context in which your quotes are taken, it paints a different picture.  Take for example what you quoted concerning Thomas Merton on Zen.  That does not come anywhere close to supporting a claim that Buddhism is not a religion, but (quoting the book) rather that &quot;to regard Zen as ''merely'' and ''exclusively'' as Zen Buddhism is to falsify it and, no doubt, to betray the fact that one has no understanding of it whatever.&quot;  The passage you quoted was saying that &quot;Zen&quot; is not &quot;Zen Buddhism&quot; and that the concept of &quot;Zen&quot; is not ''merely'' a religious one, not that Buddhism is not a religion.  If there is a source you've presented that says Buddhism is not a religion, then please by all means highlight it because the closest I'm seeing is &quot;it may not be a religion, depending on who you ask and what you're asking&quot;, and as the Thomas Merton book you quoted points out, that's nothing unique to Buddhism.  - [[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]][[User_talk:SudoGhost#top|Ghost]] 02:36, 22 October 2012 (UTC)
::::::::: '''Comment:''' Hi SudoGhost. A few points:
:::::::::* I am not denying that Buddhism is a religion, nor am I asserting that it is a religion. I am suggesting that this article will be better served if we formulate an opening sentence that does not categorically state that &quot;Buddhism is a religion.&quot; I make this suggestion for the following reasons: 1) Many people associate the term &quot;religion&quot; with some sort of supernatural power. I am not agreeing with this point of view, nor am I trying to define what a religion is. I am simply saying that this is a common perception. Do you at least concede that this is a common perception? 2) Many people view &quot;religion&quot; in general with suspicion and distrust, associating it with superstition, etc., no matter how you define it. Again, this is not my point of view, but it is a common perception. 3) As several scholars have shown, it is perfectly possible to describe Buddhism without defining it as a religion. 4) Therefore, why not formulate an opening sentence that will not confuse, offend, or turn off a large number of people. (Roughly 10,000 people per day are visiting this page; if 20% of those people have a different concept of what religion is than you do, that's a lot of confusion.)
:::::::::* Regarding Paul Williams - I think he offered a good description of Buddhism without defining it as a religion: &quot; the system of practices, understandings ('beliefs'), experiences, visions, and so on undergone and expressed at any one time and down the ages which derive from, or claim to derive from, a Buddha&quot;. He also went on to refer to Buddhism as a religion, but he provided the ''above description first'', and he was careful to explain what he meant by a religion.
:::::::::* Rupert Gethin and Damian Keown are both quite clear that it depends how you define religion. They both demonstrated that you can describe Buddhism very will without insisting that &quot;Buddhism is a religion.&quot;
:::::::::* Regarding you point on bias: I am being told that the reason we must define Buddhism as a religion is because of &quot;scholarly consensus and common usage.&quot; But when I point out that there is no such scholarly consensus, that contemporary scholars have different points of view on the matter, that some really good scholars are clearly stating that it &quot;depends on your definition of religion&quot;, then I am accused of bias! I've tried to point out that the whole concept of categorizing beliefs into religion vs. philosophy vs. science is purely a Western hangup. So from my point of view, the ''bias'' is when you insist on applying this wholly Western concept to an Eastern belief system. From the Buddhist point of view, the dharma is the truth; it doesn't need a label. So why apply to it a Western label that has negative connotations for many Westerners?
::::::::: I hope these points are clear. I'll try to respond to Joshua's points tomorrow or the next day. I don't have much time to focus on this during the week. Best regards, [[User:Dorje108|Dorje108]] ([[User talk:Dorje108|talk]]) 01:24, 23 October 2012 (UTC)
::::::::::*The claim that there is no such scholarly consensus isn't reflected by the sources you gave or the sources in circulation.  Again, one of the sources you yourself provides answers your own comment.  There are sources that can be provided that question the &quot;religion&quot; descriptor of Buddhism, and ''none'' of them contest this descriptor wholesale, but rather say &quot;it depends&quot;.  As one of the sources you provided explains, this is not unique to this religion, each religion has this questioning of what religion is and how their religion fits into that definition.  That does not mean it is not a religion, and does not mean the lede needs to be reworded.  Yes, you can describe ''any'' religion without using that word, but that's what the article proper is for, not the [[WP:LEDE|lede]] sentence, which is supposed to be as concise a descriptor of the article's subject as reasonbly possible.  The article proper then expands and explains.  It seems the &quot;negative conntations&quot; issue is why you're seeking to remove the &quot;religion&quot; descriptor, but per [[WP:RNPOV|Wikipedia policy]] &quot;editors should not avoid using terminology that has been established by the majority of the current reliable and notable sources on a topic out of sympathy for a particular point of view, or concern that readers may confuse the formal and informal meanings.&quot;  This is especially true considering that none of the sources provided come anywhere close to claiming that &quot;religion&quot; isn't a valid descriptor. - [[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]][[User_talk:SudoGhost#top|Ghost]] 02:28, 23 October 2012 (UTC)

:I'm still not really sure why we are having this debate here. How many readers, really, are going to read the first sentence and then take away from this article that Buddhism believes in and worships an omnipotent judge? I don't see any need to modify the lede. Buddhism is a religion. ([[User:20040302|20040302]] ([[User talk:20040302|talk]]) 08:47, 22 October 2012 (UTC))
