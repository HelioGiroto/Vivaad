== Other pages with evolution ==

{{hat|1=It is beyond the scope of this talk page to vaguely worry about the content of other unspecified pages. Additionally, OP should read [[Evolution as fact and theory]].}}
This page was fair about reminding us evolution is a theory but other pages (such as just about any animal pages,) talk about evolution as scientifically proven fact can someone make sure that it is stated as theory in those pages please?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.107.69.133|74.107.69.133]] ([[User talk:74.107.69.133|talk]]) 15:20, 24 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Evolution is a scientifically proven fact. [[User:Ndteegarden|thx1138]] ([[User talk:Ndteegarden|talk]]) 16:06, 24 September 2012 (UTC)

:Evolution is a repeatedly-observed fact.  The Theory of Evolution is a theory.  The clue is in the name. [[User:JohnArmagh|JohnArmagh]] ([[User talk:JohnArmagh|talk]]) 18:32, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
::You have the Phenomenon of (Biological) Evolution, which is the (repeatedly) observed accumulation of (genetic) changes inherited by a daughter generation from its parent generation in a population or group of related populations.  You have the Fact of (Biological) Evolution, which states that the Phenomenon of (Biological) Evolution occurs (due to repeated observations of both ongoing and past occurrences).  And you have the (Scientific) Theory of (Biological) Evolution, which explains the mechanics of (Biological) Evolution.--[[User:Apokryltaros|Mr Fink]] ([[User talk:Apokryltaros|talk]]) 19:34, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
:::I think the word theory gets misunderstood because it means different things in differnt contexts. in modern science a theory can literally be something we would stake our lives on. Would you rather fly in a plane built based on theories from physics or based on positions held to be unquestionable by one or another culture?--[[User:Andrew Lancaster|Andrew Lancaster]] ([[User talk:Andrew Lancaster|talk]]) 21:05, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
::::The word &quot;theory&quot; is grasped in desperation by those who fail to understand evolution, and the scientific process in general, and can't bear the thought that their Christian creationist brainwashing might be wrong. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 01:05, 25 September 2012 (UTC)

&quot;can't bear the thought that their Christian creationist brainwashing might be wrong.&quot; incorrect,im an athiest its a theory not a law. it does not occur 100% of the time,various studies and experiments show various results.--[[Special:Contributions/178.167.194.15|178.167.194.15]] ([[User talk:178.167.194.15|talk]]) 17:13, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
:Ah, so you're a Christian creationist brainwashed atheist? Biological evolution is of course a fact and a constant pressure, as shown by the theory of evolution. Less significantly it can be said to incorporate various [[scientific law]]s, but you seem to have been misled about the relationship of law to theory. Possibly by creationists who have long had a malign effect on education in some countries, perhaps you came to your views some other way. What you lack is any reliably sourced proposal for improving the article as required by [[WP:TALK]], so it may be time to hat or archive this thread. . .

== ''Sex and recombination'' section ==

Doesn't recombination includes, in addition to croosing over, the pairing of homologous chromosomes (and the independent assortment)[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ge.16.120182.002201]? By the definition in Griffiths' Introduction to Genetic Analysis, chapter 3, recombination is production of new combinations of aleles (which is made by homologous pairing, too).  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/200.158.32.64|200.158.32.64]] ([[User talk:200.158.32.64|talk]]) 23:02, 17 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== [[Survival of the fittest]] article falling into disrepair, needs help ==

[[Survival_of_the_fittest#Is_.22survival_of_the_fittest.22_a_tautology.3F|This section]] in particular is of concern. Can we make a concerted effort to bring the article back to health? [[User talk:Samsara|Samsara]]&amp;nbsp;([[User:Samsara/Animal FA requirements|FA]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;â€¢&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Samsara/Photo rationale|FP]]) 00:10, 24 October 2012 (UTC)

== Making evolution comprehensible for the layperson ==

The first section of an article is, or should be, an abstract that summarizes the whole subject AND a brief explanation for non-experts.  The first sentences should answer the reader's question--is this what I'm looking for?&lt;br /&gt;
Because it's evident that a significant percentage of people don't understand evolution an article in WP ought to clarify it--and I think this can be done successfully.&lt;br /&gt; 

The first and most obvious place we see evolution is in comparative anatomy.&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of years ago any hunter, however ignorant, could tell the difference between the skeleton of a deer, an elk, a cow or a horse--and a picture is worth a thousand words.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Vertabrates such as fish have a head, spine and ribs--land animals and birds usually add four appendages for locomotion--a comparison between the skeletons of a rearing horse and a human is available (if you want I'll it look up) in one of the museums in New York City--a side view comparison between chimpanzees and humans--D'Arcy Thompson's excellent comparisons of fish in his book ''On Growth and Form''--and skeletons of dinosaurs, which are land animals.  You have some of these images farther on in the article following long and complicated explanations. But put pictures of those similarities first and you might get sudden insight in others.--[[User:Margaret9mary|Margaret9mary]] ([[User talk:Margaret9mary|talk]]) 21:04, 25 October 2012 (UTC)[[User:Margaret9mary|Margaret9mary]] ([[User talk:Margaret9mary|talk]]) 21:22, 25 October 2012 (UTC)
:The answer to your entire post can be found [[Introduction to evolution|here]] and it is linked at the top of the main evolution article. Apparently you never noticed that. That article is designed for laypeople who wish to have a basic understanding of evolution. This particular article is meant to be comprehensive and thus detailed like a good encyclopedia article would be. It not meant to give simplified explanations. Also, there is already an image of homologous structures in the adaptation section, which should bring light to the relatedness of those animals.
