The '''United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism''' ('''USCJ''') is the primary organization of synagogues practicing [[Conservative Judaism]] in North America. It closely works with the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], the international body of Conservative [[rabbi]]s, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]],  and the [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajula.edu/ziegler/ Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at American Jewish University]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The United Synagogue was founded in 1913 by Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Schechter]] on the principle that through cooperation they could both develop and perpetuate Conservative Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscj.org/Aboutus/OurStructure/History.aspx USCJ History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and description==

The USCJ has over 675 congregations {{as of|2009|lc=y}} (down from 850 in 1985).{{cn|date=September 2012}} The USCJ works in the fields of Jewish education, youth activities, congregational standards and  action and Israel affairs, and published the magazine ''United Synagogue Review''.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

Historically, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary]] has taken the leadership role in the Conservative movement (unlike the Reform movement, whose congregational organization has dominated its rabbinical school).{{cn|date=September 2012}}

The diminished number of affiliated congregations noted above raised serious concern in the first decade of the century as new congregational forms, often populated by people who were educated in the Conservative movement, have become popular.{{cn|date=September 2012}}  The Conservative movement is perceived to have lost its uniqueness as its once-path-finding ideology of tradition and change has spread to and become a bedrock assumption of the Reform, Reconstructionist and &quot;Renewal&quot; groups, where services use Hebrew and traditional prayers, (often in updated versions) where study of traditional texts is considered important, where halacha (Jewish law) is treated with both respect and flexibility, and where egalitarian gender practices prevail.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

The diminished population of USCJ and its congregations is seen by many{{whom|date=September 2012}} as a symptom of a weak organizational culture in the USCJ itself.{{cn|date=September 2012}}  A strategic plan undertaken in the 1990s was squelched when the report challenged many of the USCJ's practices.{{cn|date=September 2012}}  In 2010, dissension reached the point at which a coalition known as Hayom (&quot;Today&quot;) was formed and threatened to break away from USCJ if significant changes were not undertaken.{{cn|date=September 2012}}  The creation of this coalition was in part a response to a restructuring announced by the new executive director, Rabbi Steven Wernick, without input from the field.{{cn|date=September 2012}}  A new strategic planning committee was formed, co-opting the Hayom group,{{cn|date=September 2012}} and in March 2011 a draft of a new plan was announced{{cn|date=September 2012}} and posted on the USCJ website.

==Projects==
The United Synagogue sponsors the following projects: 
[[United Synagogue Youth]] (USY), a youth group with chapters all over the United States and Canada.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

The [[Solomon Schechter Day School Association]], which provides leadership and services to approximately 50 Jewish day schools affiliated with the Conservative movement.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

[[KOACH]], the organization for Conservative Judaism on college campuses.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

Project Reconnect. Project Reconnect seeks to reconnect alumni of USY, Atid, Koach, [[Nativ College Leadership Program in Israel|Nativ]], the Conservative Yeshiva, Camp Ramah, the Solomon Schechter schools, the Leadership Training Fellowship, and other Conservative movement programs.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

Project Reconnect's mission is to reinvolve, reinvigorate, and reconnect the very many Jewish adults who were touched by the Conservative movement's programs for teenagers, college students and young adults.{{cn|date=September 2012}}
