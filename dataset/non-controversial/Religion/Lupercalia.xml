'''Lupercalia''' was a very ancient, possibly pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--this supports &quot;possibly pre-Roman&quot;, which has been suppressed--&gt;The Romans themselves attributed the instigation of the Lupercalia to [[Evander]], a culture hero from Arcadia who was credited with bringing the Olympic pantheon, Greek laws and alphabet to Italy, where he founded the city of Pallantium on the future site of Rome, sixty years before the [[Trojan War]].&lt;/ref&gt; pastoral festival, observed on February 13 through 15 to avert evil spirits and purify the city, releasing health and fertility. Lupercalia subsumed [[Februa]], an earlier-origin spring cleansing ritual held on the same date, which gives the month of February its name.

The name ''Lupercalia'' was believed in antiquity to evince some connection with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] festival of the [[Arcadian]] [[Lykaia]] (from [[Ancient Greek]]:  ''λύκος'' &amp;mdash; ''lukos'', &quot;wolf&quot;, [[Latin]] ''lupus'') and the worship of ''Lycaean [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]'', assumed to be a Greek equivalent to [[Faunus]], as instituted by [[Evander]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' 1.32.3&amp;ndash;5, 1.80; [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' 43.6ff; [[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.5; [[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 2.423&amp;ndash;42; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Romulus'' 21.3, ''Life of Julius Caesar'', ''Roman Questions'' 68; [[Virgil]], ''Aeneid'' 8.342&amp;ndash;344; [[Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Roman mythology, ''Lupercus'' is a [[God (male deity)|god]] sometimes identified with the Roman god [[Faunus]], who is the Roman equivalent of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', s.v. &quot;Lupercus&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Lupercus is the god of [[shepherd]]s.  His festival, celebrated on the anniversary of the founding of his [[Roman temple|temple]] on February 15, was called the Lupercalia.  His [[priest]]s wore [[Goatskin (material)|goatskins]].  The historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] mentions an image of &quot;the Lycaean god, whom the Greeks call Pan and the Romans Lupercus,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' 43.1.7.&lt;/ref&gt; nude save for the girdle of goatskin, which stood in the [[Lupercal]], the cave where [[Romulus and Remus]] were suckled by a she-[[wolf]].  There, on the [[ides (calendar)|Ides]] of February (in February the ides is the 13th), a goat and a dog were sacrificed, and salt mealcakes prepared by the [[Vestal Virgin]]s were burnt.

==The celebration during the late Republic and Empire==
[[Plutarch]] described Lupercalia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lupercalia, of which many write that it was anciently celebrated by shepherds, and has also some connection with the Arcadian Lycaea. At this time many of the noble youths and of the magistrates run up and down through the city naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy thongs. And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that the [[pregnant]] will thus be helped in [[Childbirth|delivery]], and the barren to [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#61 Plutarch • Life of Caesar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lupercalia festival was partly in honor of [[Lupa Capitolina|Lupa]], the she-wolf who suckled the infant orphans, [[Romulus and Remus]], the founders of Rome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkTwo.htm#_Toc69367692 Ovid, ''Fasti'': Lupercalia]&lt;/ref&gt;  explaining the name of the festival, Lupercalia, or &quot;Wolf Festival.&quot; The festival was celebrated near the cave of [[Lupercal]] on the [[Palatine Hill]] (the central hill where Rome was traditionally founded&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;), to expiate and purify new life in the [[Spring (season)|Spring]]. A known Lupercalia festival of 44 BC attests to the continuity of the festival but the Lupercal cave may have fallen into disrepair, and was later rebuilt by [[Augustus]]. It has been tentatively identified with a cavern discovered in 2007, {{convert|50|ft|m}} below the remains of Augustus' palace.

The rites were directed by the ''Luperci'', the &quot;brothers of the wolf (''lupus'')&quot;, a corporation of ''sacerdotes'' (priests) of [[Faunus]], dressed only in a goatskin, whose institution is attributed either to the Arcadian Evander, or to Romulus and Remus. The Luperci were divided into two collegia, called ''Quinctiliani'' (or ''Quinctiale''s) and ''Fabiani'', from the [[gens]] Quinctilia (or Quinctia) and gens [[Fabius|Fabia]]; at the head of each of these colleges was a ''magister''. In 44 BC, a third college, the ''Julii'', was instituted in honor of [[Julius Caesar]], the first magister of which was [[Mark Antony]]. In imperial times the members were usually of [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] standing.

The festival began with the [[sacrifice]] by the Luperci (or the [[flamen dialis]]) of two male goats and a dog.&lt;ref&gt;One of Plutarch's ''[[Roman Questions]]'' was &quot;68. Why do the Luperci sacrifice a dog?&quot; His best response was &quot;Nearly all the Greeks used a dog as the sacrificial victim for ceremonies of purification; and some, at least, make use of it even to this day. They bring forth for [[Hecate]] puppies along with the other materials for purification.&quot; ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/C.html#68 on-line text in English]).&lt;/ref&gt; Next two young patrician Luperci were led to the altar, to be anointed on their foreheads with the sacrificial blood, which was wiped off the bloody knife with [[wool]] soaked in [[milk]], after which they were expected to smile and laugh.

The sacrificial feast followed, after which the Luperci cut thongs from the skins of the victims, which were called '''februa''', dressed themselves in the skins of the sacrificed goats, in imitation of Lupercus, and ran round  the walls of the old Palatine city, the line of which was marked with stones, with the thongs in their hands in two bands, striking the people who crowded near. Girls and young women would line up on their route to receive lashes from these whips. This was supposed to ensure fertility, prevent sterility in women and ease the pains of childbirth.

==The Lupercalia in the 5th century==
By the 5th century, when the public performance of pagan rites had been outlawed, a nominally Christian Roman populace still clung to the Lupercalia in the time of Pope Gelasius I (494&amp;ndash;96).  It had been literally degraded since the 1st century, when in 44 BC the consul [[Mark Antony]] did not scruple to run with the Luperci;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Antony'', [[Cicero]], ''[[Philippicae|Philippics]]'' II.85.&lt;/ref&gt; now the upper classes left the festivities to the rabble.&lt;ref&gt;''ad viles trivialesque personas, abiectos et infimos''. (Gelasius)&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the fortunes of the rites in the meantime, in the last decade of the 5th century they prompted [[Pope Gelasius I]]'s taunt to the senators who were intent on preserving them: &quot;If you assert that this rite has salutary force, celebrate it yourselves in the ancestral fashion; run nude yourselves that you may properly carry out the mockery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gelasius, ''Epistle to Andromachus'', quoted in Green 1931:65.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remark was addressed to the senator Andromachus by Gelasius in an extended literary epistle that was virtually a diatribe against the Lupercalia.  Gelasius finally abolished the Lupercalia after a long dispute.

Some authors claim that Gelasius replaced Lupercalia with the &quot;Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;, but this is based in incorrect assumptions, and there is no written record of Gelasius intending any such thing.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly, in &quot;Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine&quot; (Leiden: Brill) 1986, pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors, like Oruch,&lt;ref name=&quot;oruch&quot;&gt;Jack B. Oruch, &quot;St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February&quot; ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981:534–565)&lt;/ref&gt; have also claimed that the modern customs of [[Saint Valentine's Day]] originate from Lupercalia customs, again without proof.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly, in &quot;Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine&quot; (Leiden: Brill) 1986, pp. 58-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde |author= Michael Matthew Kaylor |publisher= [[Masaryk University]] (re-published in electronic format) |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-80-210-4126-4 |edition= electronic |isbn= 80-210-4126-9 |page= footnote 2 in page 235 |url= http://books.google.es/books?id=-Wa7SIsAQgAC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=saint+valentine's+day+lupercalia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dFo4T8LQHamQ0AWeicGjDA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20valentine's%20day%20lupercalia&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in art==
[[Horace]]'s Ode III, 18 describes Lupercalia.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s play [[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']] begins during the Lupercalia, with the tradition described above.  [[Mark Antony]] is instructed by Caesar to strike his wife [[Calpurnia Pisonis|Calpurnia]], in the hope that she will be able to conceive:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CAESAR (to Calpurnia)
    {{quote|Stand you directly in Antonius' way,&lt;br&gt;When he doth run his course. Antonius!}}
ANTONY
    {{quote|Caesar, my lord?}}
CAESAR
    {{quote|Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,&lt;br&gt; To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,&lt;br&gt;The barren touched in this holy chase,&lt;br&gt;Shake off their sterile curse.}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
