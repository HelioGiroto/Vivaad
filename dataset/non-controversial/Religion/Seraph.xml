[[Image:Giotto - Legend of St Francis - -19- - Stigmatization of St Francis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis']] vision of a seraph (fresco attributed to [[Giotto]])]]

A '''seraph''' (pl. '''seraphim''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|ɛr|.|ə|.|f|ɪ|m}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: &quot;Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide&quot;] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «sĕr´a-fĭm»&lt;/ref&gt;); [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: שְׂרָפִים ''śərāfîm'', singular שָׂרָף ''śārāf''; [[Latin]]: ''seraphi[m]'', singular ''seraph[us]''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: σεραφείμ) is a type of celestial or [[heaven]]ly being in the [[Abrahamic religions]].

Literally &quot;burning ones&quot;, the word ''seraph'' is normally a synonym for [[Serpent (Bible)|serpents]] when used in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. A seminal passage in the [[Book of Isaiah]] (6.1-8) used the term to describe fiery six-winged beings that fly around [[Throne of God|God's throne]] singing &quot;holy, holy, holy&quot;. This throne scene, with its triple invocation of holiness (a formula that came to be known as the ''trisagion''), profoundly influenced subsequent [[theology]], [[literature]] and [[art]]. Its influence is frequently seen in works depicting [[angel]]s, [[heaven]] and [[apotheosis]]. Seraphs are mentioned as celestial beings in an influential [[Hellenistic]] work, the [[Book of Enoch]], and the [[Book of Revelation]]. Tradition places seraphs in the fifth rank of ten in the [[Jewish angelic hierarchy]] and the highest rank in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy]].

==Origins and development==
The word ''seraphim'', literally &quot;burning ones&quot;, transliterates a Hebrew plural noun; translation yields ''seraphs''. The singular, &quot;seraph&quot;, is more properly rendered ''sarap''. The word ''sarap/seraphim'' appears three times in the [[Torah]] (Numbers 21:6-8, Deuteronomy 8:15) and four times in the [[Book of Isaiah]] (6:2-6, 14:29, 30:6). In Numbers and Deuteronomy the &quot;seraphim&quot; are serpents – the association of serpents as &quot;burning ones&quot; is possibly due to the burning sensation of the poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8314&amp;t=KJV |title=Strong's H8314 - Saraph |publisher=Blue Letter Bible |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah also uses the word in close association with words to describe snakes (''nahash,'' the generic word for snakes, in 14:29, and ''efeh,'' viper, in 30:6).

The Isaiah vision of seraphs in an idealised Jerusalem [[First Temple]] represents the sole instance in the [[Hebrew Bible]] of this word being used to describe celestial beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dictionary+of+Deities+and+Demons+in+the+Bible&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFsweXp22u&amp;sig=dztd0T9lrsBte41nWVfAQhwNjkk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hf4GTIrpK9CHcdfghLYO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=seraphim&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible |publisher=Brill |year=1999 |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=742}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;... I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and His train filled the [[Hekhal]] (sanctuary). Above him stood the Seraphim; each had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.&quot; (Isaiah 6:1–3) The seraphim cry continually to each other, [[Sanctus|&quot;Holy, holy, holy]], is YHWH of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory.&quot; (verses 2-3) One seraph then carries out an act of [[purification]] for the prophet by touching his lips with a live [[coal]] from the [[altar]] (verses 6-7). The text uses the word &quot;seraphim&quot; but adds no adjectives or modifiers emphasising snakes (&quot;nahash,&quot; etc.). At the same time the description gives the creatures both human and avian attributes. A strong association with fire, though, is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dictionary+of+Deities+and+Demons+in+the+Bible&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFsweXp22u&amp;sig=dztd0T9lrsBte41nWVfAQhwNjkk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hf4GTIrpK9CHcdfghLYO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=seraphim&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible |publisher=Brill |year=1999 |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seraphs appear in the 2nd century B.C. [[Book of Enoch]]&lt;ref&gt;Enoch, xx. 7, lxi. 10, lxxi. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; where they are designated as ''drakones'' (δράκονες &quot;serpents&quot;), and are mentioned, in conjunction with [[cherubim|cherubs]] as the heavenly creatures standing nearest to the [[throne of God]]. In the late 1st century A.D. Book of Revelation (iv. 4-8) they are described as being forever in God's presence and praising him: &quot;Day and night with out ceasing they sing: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.'&quot; They appear also in the Christian Gnostic text ''[[On the Origin of the World (Nag Hammadi)|On the Origin of the World]]'', described as &quot;dragon-shaped angels&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NagHammadi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nag Hammadi Library in English |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1977 |isbn=0-06-066929-2 |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Judaism==
The 12th century scholar [[Maimonides]] placed the seraphs in the fifth of ten ranks of angels in his exposition of the [[Jewish angelic hierarchy]]. They are part of the angelarchy of modern [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Isaiah's vision is repeated several times in daily [[Jewish services]], including at [[Kedushah]] prayer as part of the repetition of the [[Amidah]], and in several other prayers as well. [[Conservative Judaism]] retains the traditional doctrines regarding angels and includes references to them in the liturgy, although a literal belief in angels is by no means universal among adherents. Adherents of [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] generally take images of angels as symbolic. Some adherents view them as part of the [[Merkabah]].

== In Christianity ==
[[Image:Seraphim - Petites Heures de Jean de Berry.jpg|thumb|250px|Seraphs surround the divine throne in this illustration from the ''[[Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry|Petites Heures de Jean de Berry]]'', a 14th-century [[illuminated manuscript]], commissioned by [[John, Duke of Berry]].]]

[[Medieval]] Christian [[theology]] places seraphs in the highest choir of the angelic hierarchy. They are the caretakers of [[God]]'s throne, continuously singing &quot;holy, holy, holy&quot;. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] in his ''Celestial Hierarchy'' (vii), drew upon the [[Book of Isaiah]] in fixing the fiery nature of seraphim in the medieval imagination. Seraphim in his view helped the Deity maintain perfect order and are not limited to chanting the ''trisagion''. Taking his cue as well from writings in the Rabbinic tradition, the author gave an etymology for the ''Seraphim'' as &quot;those who kindle or make hot&quot;:
:&quot;The name seraphim clearly indicates their ceaseless and eternal revolution about Divine Principles, their heat and keenness, the exuberance of their intense, perpetual, tireless activity, and their elevative and energetic assimilation of those below, kindling them and firing them to their own heat, and wholly purifying them by a burning and all-consuming flame; and by the unhidden, unquenchable, changeless, radiant and enlightening power, dispelling and destroying the shadows of darkness&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeII/CelestialHierarchy.html |title=Celestial Hierarchy |chapter=VII |author=Dionysius the Areopagite |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' offers a description of the nature of seraphs:
:&quot;The name 'Seraphim' does not come from charity only, but from the excess of charity, expressed by the word '''ardor''' or '''fire'''. Hence Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii) expounds the name 'Seraphim' according to the properties of fire, containing an excess of heat. Now in fire we may consider three things.

:&quot;First, the movement which is upwards and continuous. This signifies that they are borne inflexibly towards God.

:&quot;Secondly, the active force which is 'heat,' which is not found in fire simply, but exists with a certain sharpness, as being of most penetrating action, and reaching even to the smallest things, and as it were, with superabundant fervor; whereby is signified the action of these angels, exercised powerfully upon those who are subject to them, rousing them to a like fervor, and cleansing them wholly by their heat.

:&quot;Thirdly we consider in fire the quality of clarity, or brightness; which signifies that these angels have in themselves an inextinguishable light, and that they also perfectly enlighten others.&quot;

The seraphim took on a mystic role in [[Pico della Mirandola]]'s ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'' (1487), the epitome of [[Renaissance humanism]]. Pico took the fiery Seraphim—&quot;they burn with the fire of charity&quot;—as the highest models of human aspiration: &quot;impatient of any second place, let us emulate dignity and glory. And, if we will it, we shall be inferior to them in nothing&quot;, the young Pico announced, in the first flush of optimistic confidence in the human capacity that is the coinage of the Renaissance. &quot;In the light of intelligence, meditating upon the Creator in His work, and the work in its Creator, we shall be resplendent with the light of the Cherubim. If we burn with love for the Creator only, his consuming fire will quickly transform us into the flaming likeness of the Seraphim.&quot;

[[St. Bonaventure]], a [[Franciscan]] theologian who was a contemporary of Aquinas, uses the six wings of the seraph as an important analogical construct in his mystical work ''The Journey of the Mind to God''.

Christian theology developed an idea of seraphs as beings of pure light who enjoy direct communication with God.{{Cn|date=October 2012}}
