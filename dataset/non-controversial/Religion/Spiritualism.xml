[[Image:Spirit rappings coverpage to sheet music 1853.jpg|thumb|250px|By 1853, when the popular song ''Spirit Rappings'' was published, Spiritualism was an object of intense curiosity.]]

'''Spiritualism''' is a belief system or [[religion]], postulating the belief that [[spirit]]s of the dead residing in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living. Anyone may receive spirit messages, but formal communication sessions ([[séance]]s) are held by &quot;[[Mediumship|medium]]s&quot;, who can then provide information about the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in [[Anglosphere|English-language countries]].&lt;ref name=Braude&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly drawn from the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]]es, while the corresponding movement in continental Europe and Latin America is known as  [[Spiritism]].

The religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining  cohesion through periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums.  Many prominent Spiritualists were women, and like most Spiritualists, supported causes such as the [[abolition of slavery]] and [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt; By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud being perpetrated by mediums, and formal Spiritualist organizations began to appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt; Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational [[Spiritualist Church]]es in the United States, Canada and [[United Kingdom]].

==Beliefs==
Although various Spiritualist traditions have their own beliefs, known as ''Principles'', there are some shared concepts:
* A belief in spirit communication.
* A belief that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] continues to exist after the death of the physical body.
* Personal responsibility for life circumstances.
* Even after death it is possible for the soul to learn and improve
* A belief in a [[God]], often referred to as &quot;Infinite Intelligence&quot;.
* The natural world considered as an expression of said intelligence.

===Mediumship and spirits===
Spiritualists believe in communicating with the spirits of discarnate humans.  They believe that [[mediumship|spirit mediums]] are humans gifted to do this, often through [[seances]].  Anyone may become a medium through study and practice. They believe that spirits are capable of growth and perfection, progressing through higher spheres or planes. The [[afterlife]] is not a static place, but one in which spirits evolve. The two beliefs—that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits may lie on a higher plane—lead to a third belief, that spirits can provide knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about [[God]] and the [[afterlife]]. Thus many members speak of ''[[spirit guides]]''—specific spirits, often contacted, relied upon for worldly and spiritual guidance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

===Compared with other religions===
[[Image:Broadsheet equating spiritualism with witchcraft.jpg|thumb|Spiritualism was equated by some [[Christian]]s with [[witchcraft]]. This [[United States]] 1865 [[broadsheet]] also blamed Spiritualism for causing the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].]]
;Christianity
As Spiritualism emerged in a Christian environment, it has features in common with [[Christianity]], ranging from an essentially Christian moral system to practices such as Sunday services and the singing of hymns.  Nevertheless, on significant points Christianity and Spiritualism are different.  Spiritualists do not believe that the works or faith of a mortal during a brief lifetime can serve as a basis for assigning a soul to an eternity of [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]]; they view the afterlife as containing hierarchical &quot;spheres&quot;, through which each spirit can progress.  Spiritualists differ from Protestant Christians in that the Judeo-Christian [[Bible]] is not the primary source from which they derive knowledge of God and the afterlife: for them, their personal contacts with spirits provide that.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

Christians, generally speaking, accept and believe that [[Jesus Christ]] died on the cross to pay for all the sins of all humanity from the dawn of time to eternity. The great majority of Spiritualists do not accept that the death of Jesus Christ on the cross was to pay for all of humanity's sins.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Instead, they believe that each individual is personally responsible and may have to answer for all of their own thoughts, words, and deeds after death upon their return to the spirit realms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Most dramatically, Christianity, following the Council of Nicaea and the teachings of Paul (&quot;And though worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God&quot;), has traditionally asserted that there will be a bodily resurrection of the dead, and a physical, not merely spiritual, afterlife. This view is self-evidently incompatible with Spiritualism, where the merely spiritual existence is superior to the embodied one.

In the same way that Christians have the guidance of the [[Ten Commandments]], Spiritualists follow a number of principles, which are different depending on the tradition followed.

There are quite a number of Spiritualist churches which are explicitly Christian in theology, forms of worship and praise, and liturgical orientation. Among these Christian Spiritualist groups are the historically African American denominations collectively known as the [[Spiritual Church Movement]], a group which includes multi-church organizations such as the Metropolitan Spiritual Churches of Christ,&lt;ref name=&quot;metropolitan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Metropolitan Spiritual Churches of Christ|url=http://www.metrospiritualchurch.com|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and Pentecostal Spiritual Assemblies of Christ International.&lt;ref name=&quot;pentecostal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Pentecostal Spiritual Assemblies of Christ  International|url=http://www.psac-intl.org/|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Judaism
It is held by some adherents of the Jewish religion that Spiritualism is strictly forbidden by the Bible ([[Old Testament]]). In [[Leviticus]], one of the books concerning God's laws to [[Moses]], it is written that God says: &quot;I will set my face against the person who turns to [[Mediumship|mediums]] and spiritists to prostitute himself by following them, and I will cut him off from his people.&quot; (Leviticus 20:6).

On the other hand, among Jews who are inclined toward Spiritualism it is common to refer to trance mediumship as &quot;prophecy,&quot; a &quot;vision,&quot; or a &quot;dream,&quot; and to cite as a counter-text the verse from Numbers 12:6 in which God says, &quot;Hear my words: If there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;prophecy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= House of Prophecy Spiritual Church|url=http://www.houseofprophecy.org/main/?page_id=7|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Islam
Within [[Islam]], certain traditions, notably [[Sufism]], consider communication with spirits possible.&lt;ref&gt;Noor Muhammad Kalachvi 1999: Irfan&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the concept of [[Tawassul]] recognises the existence of  [[Angel#Islam|Good Spirits]] on a [[Seven Heavens#Islam|Higher Plane]] of existence closer to God, and thus able to intercede on behalf of humanity.

;Hinduism
[[Hinduism]], though heterogeneous, shares with Spiritualism a belief in the existence of the soul after death and also the belief of ghosts or spirits. Hinduism teaches both [[reincarnation]] and [[ghosts]], as Hindus believe that if a person were to die at an early age, such as by suicide or unnatural death, the spirit then roams the earth until their natural date of death. The spirit is only then reincarnated into its next physical form.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

;Spiritism
[[Spiritism]], the branch of Spiritualism developed by [[Allan Kardec]] and today found mostly in [[Brazil]], has emphasised reincarnation.  According to [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], most British Spiritualists of the early 20th century were indifferent to the doctrine of reincarnation, few supported it, while a significant minority were opposed, since it had never been mentioned by spirits contacted in [[séances]]. Thus, according to Doyle, it is the empirical bent of [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] Spiritualism—its effort to develop religious views from observation of [[phenomena]], that kept Spiritualists of this period from embracing reincarnation.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoyleVol2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Doyle| first = Arthur Conan| authorlink = Arthur Conan Doyle | title = The History of Spiritualism, volume 2 |location=New York| publisher = G.H. Doran | year = 1926 | url= http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-ii |isbn=1-4101-0243-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Occult
Spiritualism also differs from [[occult]] movements, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] or the contemporary [[Wicca]]n covens, in that spirits are not contacted to obtain magical powers (with the exception of power for healing).  For example, [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831–91), the founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], only practiced mediumship to contact powerful spirits capable of conferring [[esoteric knowledge]]. [[Blavatsky]] did not believe these spirits were deceased humans, and held beliefs in reincarnation different from the views of most Spiritualists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt; Spiritualists at that time viewed [[Theosophy]] as unscientific and both occultist and cult-like. Theosophists viewed Spiritualism as unsophisticated and uncosmopolitan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess_p20&quot; /&gt;

==Origins==
Spiritualism first appeared in the 1840s in the &quot;[[Burned-over District]]&quot; of [[upstate New York]], where earlier religious movements such as [[Millerism]], and [[Mormonism]] had emerged during the [[Second Great Awakening]].

This region of New York State was an environment in which many thought direct communication with [[God]] or [[angel]]s was possible, and that God would not behave harshly—for example, that God would not condemn [[baptism|unbaptised]] infants to an eternity in [[Hell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;

===Swedenborg and Mesmer===
[[Image:Hypnotisk seans av Richard Bergh 1887.jpg|thumb|''Hypnotic séance''. Painting by Swedish artist [[Richard Bergh]], 1887.]]
In this environment, the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) and the teachings of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815) provided an example for those seeking direct personal knowledge of the [[afterlife]]. Swedenborg, who claimed to communicate with spirits while awake, described the structure of the spirit world. Two features of his view particularly resonated with the early spiritualists: first, that there is not a single hell and a single [[heaven]], but rather a series of higher and lower heavens and hells; second, that spirits are intermediates between God and humans, so that the Divine sometimes uses them as a means of communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;  Although Swedenborg warned against seeking out spirit contact, his works seem to have inspired in others the desire to do so.

Mesmer did not contribute religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as [[hypnotism]], that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings. There was a great deal of professional showmanship inherent to demonstrations of [[Animal magnetism|Mesmerism]], and the practitioners who lectured in mid-19th-century North America sought to entertain their audiences as well as to demonstrate methods for personal contact with the Divine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;

Perhaps the best known of those who combined Swedenborg and Mesmer in a peculiarly North American synthesis was [[Andrew Jackson Davis]], who called his system the ''Harmonial Philosophy''. Davis was a practicing [[Mesmerist]], [[faith healing|faith healer]] and [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] from [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]]. His 1847 book, ''The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa&amp;idno=ACA6166.0001.001&amp;view=toc ''The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind''], Andrew Jackson Davis, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt; dictated to a friend while in a trance state, eventually became the nearest thing to a canonical work in a Spiritualist movement whose extreme [[individualism]] precluded the development of a single coherent worldview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Fox sisters.jpeg|upright||thumb|left|The [[Fox sisters]].]]

===Reform-movement links===
Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848, as the beginning of their movement. On that date, [[Fox sisters|Kate and Margaret Fox]], of [[Arcadia, New York|Hydesville, New York]], reported that they had made contact with the spirit of a murdered peddler. What made this an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through rapping noises, audible to onlookers. The evidence of the senses appealed to practically minded Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. However, the Fox Sisters later admitted that this &quot;contact&quot; with the spirit was a hoax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

[[Amy and Isaac Post]], [[Elias Hicks|Hicksite Quakers]] from [[Rochester, New York]], had long been acquainted with the Fox family, and took the two girls into their home in the late spring of 1848. Immediately convinced of the genuineness of the sisters' communications, they became early converts and introduced the young mediums to their circle of radical [[Quaker]] friends.

It therefore came about that many of the early participants in Spiritualism were radical Quakers and others involved in the [[Reform movement|reforming movement]] of the mid-nineteenth century. These reformers were uncomfortable with established churches, because they did little to fight [[slavery]] and even less to advance the cause of [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:CoraLVHatch.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Cora L. V. Scott]].]]
[[Image:Randolph-1.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Paschal Beverly Randolph]].]]

Women were particularly attracted to the movement, because it gave them important roles as [[Mediumship|mediums]] and [[trance]] [[lecturer]]s. In fact, Spiritualism provided one of the first forums in which American women could address mixed public audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

The most popular trance lecturer prior to the [[American Civil War]] was [[Cora L. V. Scott]] (1840–1923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were speaking through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

Another famous woman spiritualist was [[Achsa W. Sprague]], who was born November 17, 1827, in [[Plymouth Notch|Plymouth Notch, Vermont]]. At the age of 20, she became ill with [[rheumatic fever]] and credited her eventual recovery to intercession by spirits. An extremely popular trance lecturer, she traveled about the United States until her death in 1861. Sprague was an [[abolitionist]] and an advocate of [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

Yet another prominent spiritualist and trance medium prior to the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]] was [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] (1825–1875), of mixed race, who also played a part in the [[abolitionism|Abolition]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deveney&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Believers and skeptics===
[[Image:Houdini as ghostbuster (performance poster).jpg|upright|thumb|right|Audiences paid to see Houdini expose the tricks of fraudulent mediums.]]
In the years following the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship ([[séance]]s and [[automatic writing]], for example) proved to be a profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis.  The invention of the [[telegraph]] in 1844 led spiritualists to claim that an unseen &quot;spiritual telegraph&quot; to the dead also existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/books/about/The_British_spiritual_telegraph.html?id=hfQDAAAAQAAJ | title = The British spiritual telegraph | year = 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foxes were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt; Showmanship became an increasingly important part of Spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the [[Seybert Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11950 ''Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania''], The Seybert Commission, 1887. 2004-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montagu Williams|Williams, Montagu Stephen]]. 1891. ''Later Leaves: Being the Further Reminiscences of Montagu Williams.'' Macmillan.  [http://books.google.com/books?id=xTILAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA91,M1 See chapter 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite numerous instances of chicanery, the appeal of Spiritualism was strong. Prominent in the ranks of its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families during the time of the [[American Civil War]] had seen their men go off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of [[photography]], demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well.  One well known case is that of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] who, grieving the loss of her son, organized séances in the [[White House]] which were attended by her husband, President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt;  The surge of spiritualism during this time, and later during [[World War I]] was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoyleVol1&quot;&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle, [http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ ''The History of Spiritualism Vol I''], Arthur Conan Doyle, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the movement appealed to reformers, who fortuitously found that the spirits favored such ''causes du jour'' as equal rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt; It also appealed to some who had a [[materialism|materialist]] orientation and rejected organized religion. The influential [[socialism|socialist]] and [[atheism|atheist]] [[Robert Owen]] embraced religion following his experiences in Spiritualist circles.

Many scientists who investigated the phenomenon also became converts.  They included  [[chemistry|chemist]] and [[physics|physicist]] [[William Crookes#Spiritualism|William Crookes]] (1832–1919), [[evolution]]ary [[biology|biologist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace#Spiritualism|Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823–1913)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S118A.htm ''The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural'', Alfred Russel Wallace, 1866.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nobel Prize|Nobel-laureate]] [[physiologist]] [[Charles Richet]].  Other prominent adherents included journalist and pacifist [[William T. Stead#Spiritualism|William T. Stead]] (1849–1912)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/spiritualism/index.php ''Stead on Spiritualism'' at The William T. Stead Resource Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[medical doctor|physician]] and author [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] (1859–1930).&lt;ref name=&quot;DoyleVol1&quot; /&gt;

Conan Doyle, who lost his son as a result of the war, was also a member of The [[Ghost Club (paranormal investigators)|Ghost Club]].  Founded in [[London]] in 1862, its focus was the scientific study of alleged paranormal activities in order to prove (or refute) the existence of paranormal phenomena.  Famous members of the club have included [[Charles Dickens]], Sir William Crookes, [[Sir William Fletcher Barrett]] and [[Harry Price]].&lt;ref name=underwood1&gt;Underwood, Peter (1978) &quot;Dictionary of the Supernatural&quot;, Harrap Ltd., ISBN 0-245-52784-2, Page 144&lt;/ref&gt;
Pioneering American [[psychologist]] [[William James#Study of spiritualism|William James]] studied spiritualism, publishing supportive conclusions.  The [[séance]]s of [[Eusapia Palladino]] were attended by investigators including [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Marie Curie]].  The celebrated New York City physician, [[John Franklin Gray]], was also a well-known and prominent Spiritualist in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=vPkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA524&amp;lpg=PA524&amp;dq=john+f.+gray+and+spiritualism | title = The spiritual magazine | year = 1871}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.survivalafterdeath.org.uk/mediums/davenport.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims of spiritualists and others as to the reality of ghosts were investigated by the [[Society for Psychical Research]], founded in London in 1882. The Society set up a Committee on Haunted Houses and a Literary Committee which looked at the literature on the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairley &amp; Welfare&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Prominent investigators who exposed cases of fraud came from a variety of backgrounds, including professional researchers such as [[Frank Podmore]] of the Society for Psychical Research or [[Harry Price]] of the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]], and professional [[magic (illusion)|conjurers]] such as [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. Maskelyne exposed the [[Davenport Brothers]] by appearing in the audience during their shows and explaining how the trick was done. During the 1920s, professional magician [[Harry Houdini]] undertook a well-publicised campaign to expose fraudulent mediums. He was adamant that &quot;Up to the present time everything that I have investigated has been the result of deluded brains.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;houdini&quot;&gt;''A Magician Among the Spirits'', [[Harry Houdini]], Arno Press (June 1987), ISBN 0-405-02801-6&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Unorganized movement===
The movement quickly spread throughout the world; though only in the [[United Kingdom]] did it become as widespread as in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britten&quot; /&gt;
Spiritualist organizations were formed in America and Europe, such as the London Spiritualist Alliance, which published a newspaper called ''The Light'', featuring articles such as “Evenings at Home in Spiritual Séance”, “Ghosts in Africa” and “Chronicles of Spirit Photography”, advertisements for [[mesmerism|&quot;mesmerists”]] and [[patent medicine]]s, and letters from readers about personal contact with ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Light: A Journal Devoted to the Highest Interests of Humanity, both Here and Hereafter, Vol I, January to December 1881'', London Spiritualist Alliance, Eclectic Publishing Company: London, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Britain, by 1853, invitations to tea among the prosperous and fashionable often included [[table-turning]], a type of séance in which spirits would communicate with people seated around a table by tilting and rotating the table. A particularly important convert was the French pedagogist [[Allan Kardec]] (1804–1869), who made the first attempt to systematise the movement's practices and ideas into a consistent philosophical system. Kardec's books, written in the last 15 years of his life, became the textual basis of [[Spiritism]], which became widespread in Latin countries. In [[Brazil]], Kardec's ideas are embraced by many followers today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hess, David |title=Spiritism and Science in Brazil |version= |publisher=Ph.D thesis, Dept. of Anthropology, Cornell University |year=1987 |url= |format= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico, Kardec's books were widely read by the upper classes, and eventually gave birth to a movement known as [[Espiritismo|Mesa Blanca]] (White Table).
[[Image:Seven spiritualists 1906.jpg|thumb|left|[[Middle-class]] [[Chicago]] women discuss Spiritualism (1906).]]
Spiritualism was mainly a [[middle class|middle-]] and [[upper class|upper-class]] movement, and especially popular with women. U.S. spiritualists would meet in private homes for séances, at lecture halls for trance lectures, at state or national conventions, and at summer camps attended by thousands. Among the most significant of the camp meetings were Camp Etna, in [[Etna, Maine]]; Onset Bay Grove, in [[Onset, Massachusetts]]; [[Lily Dale]], in western [[New York State]]; [[Camp Chesterfield]], in [[Indiana]]; the [[Wonewoc Spiritualist Camp]], in [[Wonewoc, Wisconsin]]; and [[Lake Pleasant, Massachusetts|Lake Pleasant]], in [[Montague, Massachusetts]]. In founding [[camp meeting]]s, the spiritualists appropriated a form developed by U.S. Protestant denominations in the early nineteenth century. Spiritualist camp meetings were located most densely in New England and California, but were also established across the upper Midwest. [[Cassadaga, Florida]], is the most notable spiritualist camp meeting in the southern states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassadaga&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Guthrie| first = John J. Jr.| coauthors=Phillip Charles Lucas; Gary Monroe| authorlink = | title = Cassadaga: the South’s Oldest Spiritualist Community |location=Gainesville, FL |publisher =[[University Press of Florida]]| year = 2000 | isbn =0-8130-1743-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of spiritualist periodicals appeared in the nineteenth century, and these did much to hold the movement together. Among the most important were the weeklies ''The Banner of Light'' (Boston), ''The Religio-Philosophical Journal'' (Chicago), ''Mind and Matter'' (Philadelphia), ''The Spiritualist'' (London), and ''The Medium'' (London). Other influential periodicals were the ''Revue Spirite'' (France), ''Le Messager'' (Belgium), ''Annali dello Spiritismo'' (Italy), ''El Criterio Espiritista'' (Spain), and ''The Harbinger of Light'' (Australia). By 1880, there were about three dozen monthly spiritualist periodicals published around the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Harrison 1880: 6)&lt;/ref&gt; These periodicals differed a great deal from each other, reflecting the great differences among Spiritualists. Some, such as the British ''Spiritual Magazine'' were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within Spiritualism. Others, such as ''Human Nature'', were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as ''The Spiritualist'', attempted to view spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.&lt;ref&gt;(Alvarado, Biondi, and Kramer 2006: 61–63)&lt;/ref&gt;

Books on the supernatural were published for the growing middle class, such as 1852’s  ''Mysteries'', by Charles Elliott, which contains “sketches of spirits and spiritual things”, including accounts of the [[Salem witch trials]], the [[Cock Lane ghost|Cock Lane Ghost]], and the [[Fox sisters|Rochester Rappings]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wyllys Elliott, ''Mysteries, or Glimpses of the Supernatural'', Harper &amp; Bros: New York, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Night Side of Nature'', by Catherine Crowe, published in 1853, provided definitions and accounts of wraiths, doppelgangers, apparitions and haunted houses.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Crowe, ''The Night Side of Nature, or Ghosts and Ghost-seers'', Redfield: New York, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream newspapers treated stories of ghosts and haunting as they would any other news story.  An account in the [[Chicago Tribune|''Chicago Daily Tribune'']] in 1891, &quot;sufficiently bloody to suit the most fastidious taste&quot;, tells of a house believed to be haunted by the ghosts of three murder victims seeking revenge against their killer’s son, who was eventually driven insane.
Many families, “having no faith in ghosts”, thereafter moved into the house, but all soon moved out again.&lt;ref&gt;“Dreadful Tale of a Haunted Man in Newton County, Missouri”, ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'', January 4, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1920s many &quot;psychic&quot; books were published of varied quality. Such books were often based on excursions initiated by the use of [[Ouija|Ouija boards]]. A few of these popular books displayed unorganized Spiritualism, though most were less insightful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The movement was extremely individualistic, with each person relying on her own experiences and reading to discern the nature of the [[afterlife]]. Organisation was therefore slow to appear, and when it did it was resisted by mediums and trance lecturers. Most members were content to attend [[Christian]] churches, and particularly [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist]] churches harbored many Spiritualists.

As the Spiritualism movement began to fade, partly through the bad publicity of fraud accusations and partly through the appeal of religious movements such as [[Christian Science]], the [[Spiritualist Church]] was organised.  This church can claim to be the main vestige of the movement left today in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt;

===Other mediums===

[[William Stainton Moses]] (1839–92) was an [[Anglican]] clergyman who, in the period from 1872 to 1883, filled 24 notebooks with [[automatic writing]], much of which was said to describe conditions in the spirit world.  In his sessions he was able to channel a spirit who called himself Imperator.  Imperator described himself as a leader of forty-nine other spirits.  He conveyed information to Moses about the spirit world, its workings, and how information is passed along to people.  In sessions, he was allegedly levitated several times, and was able (through spirits who channeled energy to his hands) to levitate a large table just by touching it.  Similar incidents were reported during his automatic writing sessions.  His pen was said to write of its own accord without his direction.&lt;ref&gt;Tymn, Michael E. &quot;An &quot;Interview&quot; with The Rev. William Stainton Moses.&quot; Journal of Spirituality &amp; Paranormal Studies 32.2 (2009): 89–100. Religion and Philosophy Collection. EBSCO. Web. 30 Apr. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

London-born [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] (1823–99) moved to the United States in 1855 and was active in spiritualist circles as a trance lecturer and organiser. She is best known as a chronicler of the movement's spread, especially in her 1884 ''Nineteenth Century Miracles: Spirits and their Work in Every Country of the Earth'', and her 1870 ''Modern American Spiritualism'', a detailed account of claims and investigations of mediumship beginning with the earliest days of the movement.

[[Eusapia Palladino]] (1854–1918) was an [[Italy|Italian]] Spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]] from the slums of [[Naples]] who made a career touring [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Russia]] and [[Poland]].  Her stratagems were unmasked on several occasions, though some investigators, including [[Nobel laureate]] scientists, credited her mediumistic abilities.

One believer was the [[Poland|Polish]] psychologist [[Julian Ochorowicz]], who in 1893 brought her from [[St. Petersburg, Russia]], to [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. He introduced her to the novelist [[Bolesław Prus]], who participated in her [[séance]]s and incorporated Spiritualist elements into his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tokarzówna&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Tokarzówna| first = Krystyna| coauthors=Stanisław Fita| authorlink = | title = [[Bolesław Prus]], 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości ([[Bolesław Prus]], 1847–1912:  a Calendar of [His] Life and Work)|location=Warsaw |publisher =Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy| year = 1969 | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ochorowicz studied as well, 15 years later, a home-grown Polish medium, [[Stanisława Tomczyk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fodor&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Fodor| first = Nandor| authorlink = | title = An Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science |location= |publisher =  | year = 1934 | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adelma Vay]] (1840–1925), [[Hungary|Hungarian]] (by origin) [[spiritism|spiritistic]] medium, [[homeopath]] and [[clairvoyant]], authored many books about spiritism, written in [[German language|German]] and translated into [[English language|English]].

==Evolution==

Spiritualists reacted with an uncertainy to the theories of [[evolution]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking the concept of evolution fitted the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time however, the belief in the animal origins of man threatened the foundation of the immortality of the [[spirit]], for if man had not been created, it was scarely plausible that he would be specially endowed with a spirit. This led to spiritualists embracing [[spiritual evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914, 1988, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritualists' view of evolution did not stop at death. Spiritualism taught that after death spirits progressed to spiritual states in new spheres of existence. According to spiritualists evolution occurred in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] “at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favourable to growth” then encountered on earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270&quot;&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914, 1988, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

In a talk at the London Spiritualist Alliance, Rev. John Page Hopps (1834–1911) supported both evolution and spiritualism. Hopps claimed man had started off imperfect “out of the animals darkness” but will rise into the “angel’s marvellous light”, Hopps claimed man was not a fallen but a rising creature and that after death man would evolve on a number of spheres of existence to perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270&quot;/&gt;

[[Theosophy]] is in opposition to the spiritualist interpretation of evolution, theosophy teaches a metaphysical theory of evolution mixed with [[human devolution]], spiritualists do not accept the devolution of the theosophists.  To theosophy man starts in a state of perfection (see [[Golden age]]) and falls into a process of progressive materialization (devolution), developing the mind and losing the spiritual consciousness. After the gathering of experience and growth through repeated [[reincarnations]] humanity will regain the original spiritual state, which is now one of self-conscious perfection.
Theosophists and Spiritualists were both very popular metaphysical schools of thought especially in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. [[Madame Blavatsky]] was critical of spiritualism, she distanced theosophy from spiritualism as far as she could and allied herself with eastern occultism.&lt;ref&gt;G. Baseden Butt, Madame Blavatsky, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gerald Massey 1856.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Gerald Massey]].]]

The spiritualist [[Gerald Massey]], claimed that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution was incomplete:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory contains only one half the explanation of man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myraids of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine as well as a human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey, Concerning evolution, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote/&gt;

Spiritualists believed that without spiritualism &quot;the doctrine of Darwin is a broken link&quot;. The spiritualist [[Gerald Massey]] said &quot;Spiritualism will accept evolution, and carry it out and make both ends meet in the perfect circle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey, Concerning evolution, pp. 60 - 61&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous [[Mediumship|medium]] who rejected evolution was [[Cora L. V. Scott]], she dismissed evolution in her lectures and instead supported a type of [[pantheistic]] spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Podmore, Bob Gilbert, Modern spiritualism: a history and a criticism: Volume 2, 2001, pp. 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alfred Russel Wallace.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Alfred Russel Wallace]].]]

[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] believed qualitative novelties could arise through the process of [[spiritual evolution]], in particular the phenomena of life and mind, Wallace attributed these novelties to a [[supernatural]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;Debora Hammond, The Science of Synthesis: Exploring the Social Implications of General Systems Theory, 2003, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, Wallace was advocate of spiritualism and believed in an [[immaterial]] origin for the higher mental faculties of humans, he believed that evolution suggested that the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled ''The World of Life'', which he later expanded into a book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace argued in his 1911 book ''World of life'' for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as “creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose”. Wallace believed [[natural selection]] could not explain [[intelligence]] or [[morality]] in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of man could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate “in the unseen universe of spirit”.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace, 2004, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Clodd, Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Lodge]] also promoted a version of spiritual evolution in his books ''Man and the Universe'' (1908), ''Making of Man'' (1924) and ''Evolution and Creation'' (1926). The spiritualist element in the synthesis was most prominent in Lodge’s 1916 book ''Raymond, or Life and Death'' which revived a large interest for public in the paranormal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler, Science for all: the popularization of science in early twentieth-century, 2009, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the 1920s==
{{Main|Spiritualist Church|Spiritualists' National Union|Survivalism (life after death)|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain}}

After the 1920s, Spiritualism evolved in three different directions, all of which exist today.

===Syncretism===
The first of these continued the tradition of individual practitioners, organised in circles centered on a medium and clients, without any hierarchy or dogma. Already by the late 19th century Spiritualism had become increasingly [[syncretism|syncretic]], a natural development in a movement without central authority or dogma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Braude&quot; /&gt; Today, among these unorganised circles, Spiritualism is  similar to the New Age movement. However, [[Theosophy]] with its inclusion of Eastern religion, astrology, ritual magic and reincarnation is an example of a closer precursor of the 20th century New Age movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess_p20&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 20
  | isbn = 0-299-13820-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Today's syncretic Spiritualists are quite heterogeneous in their beliefs regarding issues such as reincarnation or the existence of God. Some appropriate New Age and Neo-Pagan beliefs, whilst others call themselves 'Christian Spiritualists', continuing with the tradition of cautiously incorporating Spiritualist experiences into their Christian faith.

===Spiritualist church===
{{Main|Spiritualist church|Spiritualists' National Union|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain|Spiritual church movement}}

[[Image:Conan doyle.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Arthur Conan Doyle]], creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]].]]

The second direction taken has been to adopt formal organization, patterned after Christian denominations, with established liturgies and a set of Seven Principles, and training requirements for mediums. In the United States the Spiritualist churches are primarily affiliated either with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] or the loosely allied group of denominations known as the spiritual church movement; in the U.K. the predominant organization is the Spiritualists' National Union, founded in 1890.

Formal education in Spiritualist practice emerged in 1920s, with organizations like the William T. Stead Center in Chicago, Illinois, and continue today with the [[Arthur Findlay]] College at Stansted Hall in England, and the [[Morris Pratt Institute]] in [[Wisconsin, USA]].

Diversity of belief among organized Spiritualists has led to a few schisms, the most notable occurring in the U.K. in 1957 between those who held the movement to be a religion ''sui generis'' (of its own with unique characteristics), and a minority who held it to be a denomination within Christianity. In the United States, this distinction can be seen between the less Christian National Spiritualist Association of Churches and the more Christian spiritual church movement.

The practice of organized Spiritualism today resembles that of any other religion, having discarded most showmanship, particularly those elements resembling the conjurer's art. There is thus a much greater emphasis on &quot;mental&quot; mediumship and an almost complete avoidance of the apparently miraculous &quot;materializing&quot; mediumship that so fascinated early believers such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassadaga&quot; /&gt; The first Spiritualist Church in Australia was the United Stanmore &amp; [http://www.enmorespiritualistchurch.com Enmore Spiritualist Church] established in 1913. In 1921 Arthur Conan Doyle gave a farewell to Australia speech there.

===Survivalism===
{{Main|Survivalism (life after death)}}
The third direction taken has been a continuation of its empirical orientation to religious phenomena. Already as early as 1882, with the founding of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], secular organisations emerged to investigate spiritualist claims. Today many persons with this empirical approach avoid the label of &quot;Spiritualism&quot;, preferring the term &quot;[[survivalism (life after death)|survivalism]]&quot;. Survivalists eschew religion, and base their belief in the afterlife on phenomena susceptible to at least rudimentary scientific investigation, such as mediumship, [[near-death experience]]s, [[out-of-body experience]]s, [[electronic voice phenomena]], and [[reincarnation research]]. Many Survivalists see themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Spiritualist movement. An example of the modern approach is the work of the Professor of Psychology, [[David Fontana]], who has written about the subject from a number of points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Life Beyond Death, David Fontana (Watkins Publishing) 2009, pp.1–195&lt;/ref&gt;
