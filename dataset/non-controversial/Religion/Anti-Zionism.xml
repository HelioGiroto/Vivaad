'''Anti-Zionism''' is opposition to [[Zionism|Zionistic views]] or opposition to the state of [[Israel]]. The term is used to describe various religious, moral and political points of view in opposition to these, but their diversity of motivation and expression is sufficiently different that &quot;anti-Zionism&quot; cannot be seen as having a single ideology or source.

==Definition==
{{Weasel|date=July 2011}}
Zionism may be defined as, &quot;An international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in [[Palestine]] and later for the support of modern [[Israel]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary, (&quot;Zionism&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Zionism is also &quot;a [[Jewish political movement|political movement among Jews]] which holds that the [[Jews]] are a [[nation]], and as such need to establish a [[homeland for the Jewish People|national homeland]]&quot;, and as a religious movement within [[Orthodox Judaism]] which encourages Jews to establish a sovereign commonwealth in the [[Land of Israel]] that is governed by [[Halakha]] (Jewish law), and as &quot;a movement to support the development and defense of the State of Israel, and to [[Aliyah|encourage Jews to settle there]].&quot; Therefore, a possible definition for anti-Zionism is opposition to these objectives; and people, organizations or governments that oppose these objectives can in some sense be described as anti-Zionist.{{or|date=October 2012}} &quot;[[Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism]],&quot; an essay published by the [[American Jewish Committee]], concludes that, with the maturing of Israel since its founding in 1948, the term anti-Zionism in scholarly work is often used to mean advocating the elimination of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenfeld|first=Alvin H.|title='Progressive' Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism|publisher=American Jewish Committee|year=2006|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/PROGRESSIVE_JEWISH_THOUGHT.PDF|accessdate=11 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100312025251/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/PROGRESSIVE_JEWISH_THOUGHT.PDF| archivedate= 12 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- all this concluded from one source? --&gt; Opposition to Israel as a [[Jewish state#Jewish state or a state of Jews?|Jewish state]] is anti-Zionism or what can be called Post-Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meforum.org/185/post-zionism-and-israeli-politics |title=Post-Zionism and Israeli Politics: A briefing by Limor Livnat |month=August |year=2000 |Address to the Middle East Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity of anti-Zionism==
Opposition to Zionism has changed over time and has taken on a spectrum of religious, ethical, political or military forms.  Some include, opposition to the creation of a [[Jewish state]] prior to the appearance of the [[messiah]], objection to the idea of a state based on [[Demographics of Israel|maintenance of a Jewish majority]], differing democratic values and differing [[Israeli-occupied territories|levels of geographical extension]].&lt;ref&gt;Raffaella A. Del Sarto, [http://ies.berkeley.edu/research/DelSartoIsraelMed.pdf Israel’s Contested Identity and the Mediterranean, The territorial-political axis: Eretz Israel versus Medinat Israel, p.8]&lt;blockquote&gt;Reflecting the traditional divisions within the Zionist movement, this axis invokes two concepts, namely Eretz Israel, i.e. the biblical ‘Land of Israel’, and Medinat Israel, i.e. the Jewish and democratic State of Israel. While the concept of Medinat Israel dominated the first decades of statehood in accordance with the aspirations of Labour Zionism, the 1967 conquest of land that was part of ‘biblical Israel’ provided a material basis for the ascent of the concept of Eretz Israel. Expressing the perception of rightful Jewish claims on ‘biblical land’, the construction of Jewish settlements in the conquered territories intensified after the 1977 elections, which ended the dominance of the Labour Party. Yet as the first Intifada made disturbingly visible, Israel’s de facto rule over the Palestinian population created a dilemma of democracy versus Jewish majority in the long run. With the beginning of Oslo and the option of territorial compromise, the rift between supporters of Eretz Israel and Medinat Israel deepened to an unprecedented degree, the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin in November 1995 being the most dramatic evidence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Klug]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' has argued that anti-Zionism represents fair opposition to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Klug |first=Brian |title=No, anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/dec/03/comment |work=The Guardian  |date=3 December 2003.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimacy of anti-Zionist views has been disputed to the present day, including the more recent and disputed relationship between anti-Zionism and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wist1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

==Anti-Zionism and antisemitism==

&quot;Anti-Zionist discourse that has become polluted by antisemitic themes or content is also difficult to identify because it is often based on at least partial truths which have become inflated or exaggerated to the point that they are held to be typical of all Jews or demonstrative of an antisemitic Jewish stereotype.... An example of this would be remarks about the Israel lobby....

Professor [[Robert S. Wistrich]], head of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], is the originator of Marcus's second view of anti-Zionism (that anti-Zionism and antisemitism merged post-1948) argues that much contemporary anti-Zionism, particularly forms that compare Zionism and Jews with [[Hitler]] and the [[Third Reich]], has become a form of antisemitism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anti-Zionism has become the most dangerous and effective form of anti-Semitism in our time, through its systematic delegitimization, defamation, and demonization of Israel. Although not ''[[wiktionary:a priori|a priori]]'' anti-Semitic, the calls to dismantle the Jewish state, whether they come from Muslims, [[Left-wing|the Left]], or the radical [[Right-wing|Right]], increasingly rely on an anti-Semitic stereotypization of classic themes, such as the manipulative &quot;Jewish lobby,&quot; the Jewish/Zionist &quot;world conspiracy,&quot; and Jewish/Israeli &quot;warmongers.&quot;

}}&lt;br &gt;
Nevertheless, I believe that the more radical forms of anti-Zionism that have emerged with renewed force in recent years do display unmistakable analogies to European anti-Semitism immediately preceding the [[Holocaust]]....For example, &quot;anti-Zionists&quot; who insist on comparing Zionism and the Jews with Hitler and the Third Reich appear unmistakably to be de facto anti-Semites, even if they vehemently deny the fact! This is largely because they knowingly exploit the reality that Nazism in the postwar world has become the defining metaphor of absolute evil. For if Zionists are &quot;Nazis&quot; and if [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] really is Hitler, then it becomes a moral obligation to wage war against Israel. That is the bottom line of much contemporary anti-Zionism. In practice, this has become the most potent form of contemporary anti-Semitism....Anti-Zionism is not only the historic heir of earlier forms of anti-Semitism. Today, it is also the lowest common denominator and the bridge between the Left, the Right, and the militant Muslims; between the elites (including the media) and the masses; between the churches and the mosques; between an increasingly anti-American Europe and an endemically [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] Arab-Muslim Middle East; a point of convergence between conservatives and radicals and a connecting link between fathers and sons.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dina Porat (head of the [[Stephen Roth Institute|Institute for Study of Anti-semitism and Racism]] at [[Tel-Aviv University]]) contends that anti-Zionism is anti-semitic because it is discriminatory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...antisemitism is involved when the belief is articulated that of all the peoples on the globe (including the [[Palestinians]]), only the Jews should not have the right to self-determination in a land of their own. Or, to quote noted human rights lawyer [[David Matas]]:
One form of antisemitism denies access of Jews to goods and services because they are Jewish. Another form of antisemitism denies the right of the Jewish people to exist as a people because they are Jewish. Antizionists distinguish between the two, claiming the first is antisemitism, but the second is not. To the antizionist, the Jew can exist as an individual as long as Jews do not exist as a people.&lt;ref&gt;Dina Porat, ''Defining Anti-Semitism'', http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm#_edn23 Retrieved 15 November 2008  See also [[Emanuele Ottolenghi]] http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/nov/29/comment&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Israel]]i journalist [[Ben-Dror Yemini]] maintains that anti-Zionism is &quot;[[politically correct]] [[antisemitism]]&quot; and argues that the same way Jews were demonized, Israel is demonized, the same way the right of Jews to exist was denied, the right for [[Self-determination]] is denied from Israel, the same way Jews were presented as a menace to the world, Israel is presented as a menace to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben-Dror Yemini]], [http://www.nrg.co.il/app/index.php?do=blog&amp;encr_id=f2b4c1b55be76d1e6d7b777256ea0370&amp;id=1173 בן-דרור, תרגיע], [[Nrg Maariv|nrg]] [[Maariv]], 28.4.2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] reported that during a visit there, German Foreign Minister [[Joschka Fischer]] stated that &quot;anti-Zionism inevitably leads to antisemitism.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/s/content.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4442915&amp;ct=5850509 |title=accessed Nov 2008 |publisher=Wiesenthal.com |date=17 July 2001 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Klug]] has argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are distinct but not mutually exclusive concepts:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a long and ignoble history of &quot;Zionist&quot; being used as a code word for &quot;Jew,&quot; as when [[Communist Poland]] carried out &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; purges in 1968, expelling thousands of Jews from the country, or when the extreme right today uses the acronym [[Zionist Occupation Government|ZOG]] (Zionist Occupied Government) to refer to the [[US government]]. Moreover, the Zionist movement arose as a reaction to the persecution of Jews. Since anti-Zionism is the opposite of Zionism, and since Zionism is a form of opposition to anti-Semitism, it seems to follow that an anti-Zionist must be an anti-Semite.

Nonetheless, the inference is invalid. To argue that hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews are one and the same thing is to conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people. In fact, Israel is one thing, Jewry another. Accordingly, anti-Zionism is one thing, anti-Semitism another. They are separate. To say they are separate is not to say that they are never connected. But they are independent variables that can be connected in different ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics of Israeli policy argue that Israeli propagandists and supporters often try to equate anti-Zionism and sometimes even [[criticism of Israel]]i policy, with antisemitism, to silence opposition to Israeli policies. [[Noam Chomsky]] for example argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;There have long been efforts to identify anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism in an effort to exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends; &quot;one of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all,&quot; Israeli diplomat Abba Eban argued, in a typical expression of this intellectually and morally disreputable position (Eban, Congress Bi-Weekly, March 30, 1973). But that no longer suffices. It is now necessary to identify [[criticism of Israel]]i policies as anti-Semitism – or in the case of Jews, as &quot;self-hatred,&quot; so that all possible cases are covered.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, 1989 &quot;Necessary Illusions&quot;,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to philosopher [[Michael Neumann]], Zionism as an &quot;expansionist threat&quot; has caused Arab hostility toward Israel and even antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Neumann, [http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann0604.html What is antisemitism?], [[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]], 4 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Zionist sentiment has increased with ongoing Arab Israeli conflicts: after the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]] where Israel gained control of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[West Bank]], [[East Jerusalem]], and the [[Golan Heights]]; during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] where [[Israel Defense Forces]] invaded [[southern Lebanon]], attacking the [[PLO]], as well as [[Syria]], leftist and Muslim [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] forces, leading to Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon; the 2002 [[Operation Defensive Shield]] in the [[West Bank]], including the attack on the [[Battle of Jenin|Jenin refugee camp]]; the [[2006 Lebanon War]]; and the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]].

[[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabist]] narratives in the 1960s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era emphasized the idea of Palestine as a part of the [[Arab world]] taken by others. In this narrative, the natural means of combating Zionism is Arab nations uniting and attacking Israel militarily.  [[Pan-Syrianism|Pan-Syrian]] narratives, promoted mainly by [[Syria]], are essentially parallel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In contrast, a poll of 507 [[Arab-Israeli]]s conducted by the [[Israeli Democracy Institute]] in 2007 found that 75 percent profess support for Israel's status as a [[Jewish and democratic state]] which guarantees equal rights for minorities.  Israeli Arab support for a constitution in general was 88 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853564.html Poll of Arab-Israelis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim anti-Zionism considers the State of Israel an intrusion into what many Muslims consider to be [[Dar al-islam|Dar al-Islam]], a domain rightfully, and permanently, ruled only by Muslims due the fact it was historically conquered in the name of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Neusner |first=Jacob |title=Comparing Religions Through Law: Judaism and Islam  |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-19487-3 }} p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Merkley |first=Paul Charles |title=Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel |year=2001 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |isbn=0-7735-2188-7 }} p.122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Akbarzadeh |first=Shahram  |title=Islam And the West: Reflections from Australia |year=2005 |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=0-86840-679-1 }} p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian and other Muslim groups, as well as the [[government of Iran]] (since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]]), insist that the State of Israel is illegitimate and refuse to refer to it as &quot;Israel,&quot; instead using the locution &quot;the [[Zionist entity]]&quot; (see [[Iran–Israel relations]]). Islamic maps of the Middle East frequently do not show the State of Israel. In an interview with ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in December 2006, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] said &quot;Everyone knows that the Zionist regime is a tool in the hands of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom|British governments]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570714,00.html | work=Time | title=People Who Mattered: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad | date=16 December 2006 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Mohammed Amin al Husseini]] opposed the Jewish immigration to Palestine before the creation of the [[State of Israel]], and in several documented cases expressed his hostility toward Jews in general and Zionists in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/local_news/nazis-planned-holocaust-in-palestine-historians-29259.html |title=Nazis planned Holocaust in Palestine: historians &lt; German news &amp;#124; Expatica Germany |publisher=Expatica.com |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positions of the World Council of Churches====
The [[World Council of Churches]] has been described by some{{Who|date=February 2009}} as taking anti-Zionist positions in connection with its criticisms of Israeli policy. They believe the council has focused disproportionately on activities and publications criticizing Israel in comparison with other human rights issues{{Who|date=February 2009}}.&lt;ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{Main|Soviet Union and the Arab-Israeli conflict|History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union}}

From 1928–1934, during the so-called &quot;[[Third Period]]&quot; in the [[Soviet Union]], Zionism was outlawed. But by the late 1930s, the official position of Zionism began to change to a more favourable one. In the Soviet encyclopedia of this time, it was stated that Jewish migration to Palestine had become a &quot;progressive factor&quot; because many of the workers stood on the left. At the beginning of 1947, the Soviet Union supported the [[partition of Palestine]]. [[Joseph Stalin]] wanted to use the Jews in Palestine against [[British imperialism]], and to establish a point of support for the USSR in the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

During the last years of Stalin's rule, official support for the creation of Israel in 1948 was replaced by strong anti-zionism. The level of confrontation with those deemed as anti-Soviet &quot;Jewish nationalists&quot; was toned down after Stalin's death in 1953, but the official position of opposition to Zionism remained in force: the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]], as well as numerous other initiatives, were state-sponsored.

As outlined in the third edition of the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (1969–1978), the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]'s position during the [[Cold War]] became: &quot;the main posits of modern Zionism are militant [[chauvinism]], racism, [[anti-Communism]] and [[anti-Sovietism]],... overt and covert fight against freedom movements and the USSR.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://encycl.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00071/37300.htm&amp;encpage=bse&amp;mrkp=http%3A//hghltd.yandex.com/yandbtm%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//encycl.yandex.ru/texts/bse/00071/37300.htm%26text%3D%25F1%25E8%25EE%25ED%25E8%25E7%25EC%26reqtext%3D%25F1%25E8%25EE%25ED%25E8%25E7%25EC%253A%253A781659%26%26isu%3D2 Сионизм], Большая советская энциклопедия (Zionism. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition. 1969–1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the spectre of Jewish allegiance to Israel amid the tensions of the Arab-Israeli conflict raised fears of internal dissent and opposition. The Soviet government liquidated almost all remaining Jewish organizations. It placed synagogues under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of [[informant|informers]]. At the same time, the general restriction on the right of [[refuseniks]], or [[Soviet Jews]] seeking to emigrate for Israel, emerged as a major human rights issue in the West. (See [[Jackson-Vanik amendment]].)

===International===
Anti-Zionist sentiments were also manifested in organisations such as the [[Organization for African Unity]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which passed resolutions condemning Zionism and equating it with racism and [[apartheid]] during the early 1970s. This culminated in the passing by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] of [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]] in November 1975, which declared that &quot;Zionism is a form of racism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 320&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 320|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was revoked on 16 December 1991, when the General Assembly passed [[UN General Assembly Resolution 4686|Resolution 4686]], repealing resolution 3379, by a vote of 111 to 25, with 13 abstentions and 17 delegations absent. Thirteen out of the 19 Arab countries, including those engaged in negotiations with Israel, voted against the repeal, another six were absent. No Arab country voted for repeal. The [[Palestine Liberation Organisation]] denounced the vote. All of the ex-communist countries and most of the African countries who had supported Resolution 3379 voted to repeal it. Only three non-Muslim countries voted against the resolution: [[Cuba]], North Korea and [[Vietnam]]. The rest abstained (including [[Turkey]]) or absented themselves.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===African-American===
After [[Israel]] occupied [[Palestine|Palestinian]] territory following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], some African-Americans supported the Palestinians and criticized Israel's actions, for example by publicly supporting Palestinian leader [[Yassir Arafat]] and calling  for the destruction of the Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Mark, &quot;African American-Jewish Relations&quot; in ''Antisemitism: a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution, Vol 1'', 2005. p 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately after the war, the [[black power]] organization [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] published a newsletter criticizing Israel, and asserting that the war was an effort to regain Palestinian land and that during the 1948 war, &quot;[[Zionism|Zionists]] conquered the Arab homes and land through terror, force, and massacres&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Clayborne,  (1984) &quot;Blacks and Jews in the Civil Rights movement: the Case of SNCC&quot;,  in  ''Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States'', (Adams, Maurianne, Ed.), 2000., p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, philosopher [[Cornel West]] wrote:  &quot;Jews will not comprehend what the symbolic predicament and literal plight of Palestinans in Israel means to blacks.... Blacks often perceive the Jewish defense of the state of Israel as a second instance of naked group interest, and, again, an abandonment of substantive moral deliberation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West|West, Cornel]], ''Race Matters'', 1993, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;  African-American support of Palestinians is frequently due to the consideration of Palestinians as people of color – political scientist [[Andrew Hacker]] writes:  &quot;The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as  thwarting the rightful status of people of color.  Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Hacker|Hacker, Andrew]] (1999) &quot;Jewish Racism, Black anti-Semitism&quot;, in ''Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States'', Maurianne Adams (Ed.). Univ of Massachusetts Press, 1999, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish anti-Zionism==

===Interpretations of ''Aliyah''===
Hope for return to the land of Israel is embodied in the content of the Jewish religion (see [[Kibbutz Galuyot]].) ''[[Aliyah]]'', the Hebrew word meaning &quot;ascending&quot; or &quot;going up&quot; is the word used to describe religious Jewish return to Israel, and has been used since ancient times. From the [[Middle Ages]] and onwards, many famous rabbis and often their followers, returned to the land of Israel. These have included [[Nahmanides]], [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Isaac Luria]], [[Yosef Karo]], [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]] among others.  For [[Jewish diaspora|Jews in the Diaspora]] ''[[Eretz Israel]]'' was revered in a religious sense. They prayed, and thought of the return, as being fulfilled in a messianic age.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.R., 1971, 'Vision and intent in Zionist Thought', p. 10,11&lt;/ref&gt; Return remained a recurring theme for generations, particularly in [[Passover]] and [[Yom Kippur]] prayers which traditionally concluded with, &quot;Next year in Jerusalem&quot;, as well as the thrice-daily ''[[Amidah]]'' (Standing prayer).

Following [[Jewish Enlightenment]] however, [[Reform Judaism]] dropped many traditional beliefs, including ''aliyah'', as incompatible with modern life within the Diaspora. Later, Zionism re-kindled the concept of ''aliyah'' in an ideological and political sense, parallel with traditional religious belief; it was used to increase Jewish population in the Holy Land by immigration and it remains a basic tenet of Zionist ideology. Support for aliyah does not always equal immigration however, as a majority of the world Jewish population remains within the Diaspora. Support for the modern Zionist movement is not universal and as a result, some religious Jews as well as some secular Jews, do not support Zionism. [[Non-Zionism|non-Zionist]] Jews are not necessarily anti-Zionists, although some are. Generally however, Zionism does have the support of the majority of the Jewish religious organizations, with support from segments of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] movement, and all of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and more recently, the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/LandIsrael/modern_landisrael/ReligiousZionism.htm] Rachael Gelfman, ''Religious Zionists believe that the Jewish return to Israel hastens the Messiah''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscj.org/Zionism7161.html] Ehud Bandel – President, the Masorti Movement, ''Zionism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccarnet.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=42&amp;pge_prg_id=4687&amp;pge_id=1656 ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Hasidic]] rabbis oppose the creation of a Jewish state. The leader of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidic group, Rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]]'s book, ''VaYoel Moshe'', published in 1958, expounds one &lt;!-- opposing? --&gt; Orthodox position on Zionism, based on a literal form of ''[[midrash]]'' (biblical interpretation). Citing to Tractate Kesubos 111a of the [[Talmud]] Teitelbaum states that God and the Jewish people exchanged [[the Three Oaths|three oaths]] at the time of the Jews' exile from ancient Israel, forbidding the Jewish people from massively immigrating to the Land of Israel, and from rebelling against the nations of the world.

===Jewish Orthodox religious groups===

{{Main|Haredim and Zionism}}

In the early history of Zionism many traditional religious Jews opposed ideas of nationalism (Jewish or otherwise) which they regarded as a secular ideology, which some viewed as a violation of the [[Three Oaths]]. Key traditionalist opponents of Zionism included [[Isaac Breuer]], [[Hillel Zeitlin]], [[Aaron Shmuel Tamares]], [[Elazar Shapiro]] (Muncatz), and [[Joel Teitelbaum]], all waged ideological religious, as well as political, battles with Zionism each in their own way.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Shaul Magid, “In Search of a Critical Voice in the Jewish Diaspora: Homelessness and Home in Edward Said and Shalom Noah Barzofsky’s Netivot Shalom,” Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society n.s. 12, no. 3 (Spring/Summer 2006), p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Orthodox religious groups have accepted and actively support the State of Israel, even if they have not adopted &quot;Zionist&quot; ideology. The [[World Agudath Israel]] party (founded in Poland) has at times participated in Israeli government coalitions. Most religious Zionists hold pro-Israel views from a right-wing viewpoint. The main exceptions are Hasidic groups such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidim, which have about 100,000 adherents world wide, as well as numerous different, smaller Hasidic groups, unified in America in the [[Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada]] and in Israel in the [[Edah HaChareidis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com Jews Against Zionism website] Retrieved on 2008-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular===
The Jewish community is not a single united group and responses vary both between and within Jewish groups. One of the principal divisions is that between [[secular Jews]] and [[religious Jews]]. The reasons for secular opposition to the Zionist movement are very different from those of religious Jews.

Prior to the Second World War many Jews regarded Zionism as a fanciful and unrealistic movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=NMjh319vnwAC A History of Zionism]'', (Schocken Books, New York 1978, ISBN 0-8052-0523-3), pp385-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had argued that Jews should enjoy full equality only on the condition that they pledge their singular loyalty to their nation-state and entirely assimilate to the local national culture; they called for the &quot;regeneration&quot; of the Jewish people in exchange for rights. Those liberal Jews who accepted integration and/or assimilation principles saw Zionism as a threat to efforts to facilitate Jewish citizenship and equality within the European nation-state context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=NMjh319vnwAC A History of Zionism]'', p399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Anti-Zionist League]], in Egypt, was a Communist-influenced anti-Zionist league in the years 1946–1947. In [[Israel]], there are several Jewish anti-Zionist organisations and politicians, many of these are related to [[Matzpen]].

[[Noam Chomsky]] has reported a change in the boundaries of what are considered Zionist and anti-Zionist views.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, James (ed.) (1987). Chomsky Reader.

ISBN 0-394-75173-6. p.7 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; &quot;I was interested in socialist, binationalist options for Palestine, and in the kibbutzim and the whole cooperative labor system that had developed in the Jewish settlement there (the Yishuv)...The vague ideas I had at the time [1947] were to go to Palestine, perhaps to a kibbutz, to try to become involved in efforts at Arab-Jewish cooperation within a socialist framework, opposed to the deeply antidemocratic concept of a Jewish state.&quot;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern American groups such as [[J Street]] are taken as evidence of an &quot;anomalous pattern of internal defection&quot; created as a result of anti-Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wisse|first=Ruth R.|authorlink=Ruth Wisse|title=Forgetting Zion|journal=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]|volume=126|issue=3|pages=30–35|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#“At a time when the de-legitimization and, ultimately, the eradication of Israel is a goal being voiced with mounting fervor by the enemies of the Jewish state, it is more than disheartening to see Jews themselves adding to the vilification. That some do so in the name of Judaism itself makes the nature of their assault all the more grotesque.”
#&quot;Their contributions to what’s becoming normative discourse are toxic. They’re helping to make [anti-Semitic] views about the Jewish state respectable – for example, that it’s a Nazi-like state, comparable to South African apartheid; that it engages in ethnic cleansing and genocide. These charges are not true and can have the effect of delegitimizing Israel.&quot;

Some Jewish organizations oppose Zionism as an integral part of their [[anti-imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First National Jewish Anti-Zionist Gathering|url=http://www.jewsconfrontapartheid.org/|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not In Our Name . .

===World War II and the creation of Israel===
Attitudes changed during and following the war.  In May, 1942, before the full revelation of the [[Holocaust]], the [[Biltmore Conference|Biltmore Program]] proclaimed a fundamental departure from traditional Zionist policy of a “homeland”&lt;ref&gt;American Jewish Year Book Vol. 45 (1943–1944) [http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1943_1944_5_USCivicPolitical.pdf Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities, pp 206–214]&lt;/ref&gt; with its demand ''&quot;that [[Palestine]] be established as a Jewish Commonwealth.&quot;'' Opposition to official Zionism’s firm, unequivocal stand caused some prominent Zionists to establish their own party, [[Ichud]] (Unification), which advocated an Arab – Jewish Federation in Palestine.  Opposition to the Biltmore Program also led to the founding of the anti-Zionist [[American Council for Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;American Jewish Year Book Vol. 45 (1943–1944), [http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1943_1944_5_USCivicPolitical.pdf Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities, pp 206–214]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full knowledge of the [[Holocaust]] altered the views of many who critiqued Zionism before 1948, including the British journalist [[Isaac Deutscher]], a socialist and lifelong [[atheist]] who nevertheless emphasised the importance of his Jewish heritage. Before [[World War II]], Deutscher opposed Zionism as economically retrograde and harmful to the cause of [[international socialism]], but in the aftermath of the Holocaust he regretted his pre-war views, arguing for Israel's establishment as a &quot;historic necessity&quot; to provide a refuge for the surviving [[Jews of Europe]]. In the 1960s, Deutscher renewed his criticism of Zionism, scrutinizing Israel for its failure to recognise the dispossession of the [[Palestinians]].

{{See also|Zionist Occupation Government|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Andinia Plan|Jewish lobby|Holocaust denial|Blood libel against Jews|Well poisoning|Jewish deicide|Judaeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jewish Bolshevism|Antisemitic canard}}

Claims that the Zionist movement controls world history or seeks to achieve [[Hegemony|world domination]] are roughly as old as the Zionist movement.  The most influential of these claims is the [[Tsarist]] forgery, [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], which remains popular.

In 1939, the Nazi German paper [[Volkischer Beobachter]], justified the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]
with the headline: &quot;In Prague Jewry is in power&quot;.  In 1968, the East German communist paper [[Neues Deutschland]] justified the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] with the headline &quot;In Prague Zionism is in power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wiesenthal, Justice not Vengeance, Mandarin 1989 page 207&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Simon Wiesenthal]] subsequently found 39 formerly influential [[Nazi party]] members working in the East German press and now directing their campaigns at Zionists.

From the 1960s, the [[Soviet Union]] promoted the allegation of secret ties between the Nazis and the Zionist leadership. This included claims that the Zionist movement inflated or faked the impact of the [[Holocaust]]. The thesis of 1982 doctoral dissertation of [[Mahmoud Abbas]] (a co-founder of [[Fatah]] and president of the [[Palestinian Authority]] who earned his PhD in history at the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies]], with [[Yevgeny Primakov]] as thesis advisor) was ''The Secret Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1414.html Was Abu Mazen a Holocaust Denier?] By Brynn Malone (History News Network)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Area=sr&amp;ID=SR01503 Abu Mazen: A Political Profile. Zionism and Holocaust Denial] by Yael Yehoshua ([[MEMRI]]) 29 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1983 book ''The Other Face: The Secret Connection Between the Nazis and the Zionist Movement'', based on the dissertation, Abbas wrote:

A different version of this conspiracy theory claims that Nazis and Zionists had a shared interest or even cooperated in the extermination of Europe's Jewry, as persecution would force them to flee to [[Palestine]], then under [[British Mandate of Palestine|British administration]]. Similar claims are occasionally made by [[Hezbollah]] or [[Hamas]] sources.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1995, William Korey released a work entitled ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism''.  Korey's central argument is that the [[Soviet Union]] promoted an &quot;official Judeophobic propaganda campaign&quot; under the guise of anti-Zionism from 1967 to 1986; after this program was shut down by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a populist and chauvinist group called [[Pamyat]] emerged in the more open climate of [[Glasnost]] to promote an openly anti-Semitic message.&lt;ref&gt;William Korey, ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism'', Routledge, 1995, pp. ix–x.&lt;/ref&gt;  Korey also argues that much official late-period Soviet anti-Semitism may be traced back to the influence of ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion''.  He notes, for instance, that a 1977 Soviet work entitled ''International Zionism: History and Politics'' contains the allegation that most major Wall Street financial institutions are &quot;large financial-industrial Jewish monopolies&quot; exercising control over many countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;William Korey, ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism'', Routledge, 1995, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Russian antisemitism'' was reviewed by Robert O. Freedman in the ''Slavic Review''; while he concurs with the book's central thesis, Freedman nevertheless writes that the actual extent of Soviet anti-Semitism may have been less than Korey suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Freedman, review of William Korey, ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism'', ''Slavic Review'', Vol. 59 no. 2 (Summer 2000), pp. 470–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Second World War]] many prominent Britons maintained that the tension between Germany and Britain was the result of Jewish warmongering.  In 1935 the [[British Union of Fascists]] mounted a &quot;peace campaign&quot; against war, claiming an alliance of international financiers and Jews were leading Britain to war with Germany.  However by 1938 the public mood had changed and [[Admiral Domville]] wrote &quot;it is interesting to see how permeated these people are with the war germ. Israel has done its work well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hurrah for the Blackshirts by [[Martin Pugh]] page 284, Pimlico 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accusations have been made regarding Zionism and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zionism-israel.com/iraq_war_jews.htm  http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/sep/03/worlddispatch.iraq&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceye.org/rightwoo/rwooz9-01.html |title=The Website of Political Research Associates |publisher=PublicEye.org |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sudanese government]] has alleged that the [[War in Darfur|Darfur uprising]] (in which some 500,000 have been killed) is part of a wider Zionist conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article26012 |title=Iran Supports Khartoum policies in Darfur – Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Egyptian media]] have alleged that the Zionist movement deliberately spreads HIV in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/egyptian_media/old_egyptian_conspiracy.asp |title=Anti-Semitism in the Egyptian Media – Conspiracy Theories |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Anti-Defamation League, Neo-Nazi and radical Muslim groups allege the [[US government]] is controlled by Jews, describing it as the &quot;[[Zionist Occupation Government]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/NOI.html |title=The Nation of Islam in 1996 |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=16 June 1996 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 22 of the 1988 [[Hamas#Hamas Charter (1988)|Hamas charter]] claims that the [[French Revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], [[colonialism]] and both world wars were created by the Zionists or forces supportive of Zionism.&lt;ref name=&quot;yale1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |title=Hamas Covenant 1988 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 32 alleges that the Zionist movement seeks to create an Empire stretching from the Nile in Egypt to the Euphrates river in Iraq.

In April 2010, Abd Al-Azim Al-Maghrabi, the Deputy Head of Egyptian Arab Lawyers Union, stated in an interview with Al-Manar TV (as translated by [[MEMRI]]) that the [[Hepatitis C]] virus was produced by &quot;the Zionists&quot; and that &quot;this virus is now spreading in Egypt like wildfire.&quot; He also called for it to be &quot;classified as one of the war crimes perpetrated by the Zionist enemy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2506.htm Deputy Head of Egyptian Arab Lawyers Union Abd Al-Azim Al-Maghrabi: The Zionists Produced the Hepatitis C Virus and Injected 400 Prisoners with It], MEMRITV, Clip No. 2506, 21 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Egyptian cleric Mus’id Anwar gave a speech which aired on Al-Rahma TV (as translated by [[MEMRI]]) in which he alleged that the game of soccer (as well as swimming, [[bullfighting]] and tennis) was in fact a Zionist conspiracy, stating that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As you know, the Jews, or the Zionists, have [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]. Over 100 years ago, they formulated a plan to rule the world, and they are implementing this plan. One of the protocols says: “Keep the [non-Jews] preoccupied with songs, soccer, and movies.” Is it or isn’t it happening? It is...The Zionists manage to generate animosity among Muslims, and even between Muslim countries, by means of soccer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2503.htm Against the Backdrop of Soccer World Cup in South Africa, Egyptian Cleric Mus'id Anwar Blasts Soccer, Other &quot;Harmful Sports&quot;, as a Means Prescribed by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in Order to Rule the World], MEMRITV, Clip No. 2503, 6 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
