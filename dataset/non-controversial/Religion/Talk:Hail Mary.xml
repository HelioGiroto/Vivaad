==Japanese heresy==
What's with the &quot;Japanese heresy&quot; item? Not only is an explanation not given, but the link is grammatically incorrect.

:The basic information that might go here can be found, ''e.g.'' in the on-line ''Catholic Encyclopedia.'' The '''Ave Maria''' is not as old as you might think... [[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 20:41, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)
Actually, the hail mary is very very old, as it comes from the Gospel of St. Luke itself. The ending was added at the Council of Trent. --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 00:04, 14 August 2010 (UTC)

----

The basic description listed for the Hail Mary is inaccurate (the rosary is base up of 20 decades, not 5) and very incomplete. 

I'd like to see the main blurb on the page updated to describe the prayer as based upon scripture (Luke 1:28 and Luke 1:42) and that it reinforces basic Christian belief that Jesus is both fully God and fully man when it calls Mary &quot;Mother of God&quot;. --[[User:Jasonclifford|Jasonclifford]] 08:45, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Is it really necessary to have all those translations? And where will it end? How about cut it back to just the English - this is, after all the English Wikipedia. Maybe replace them with links to the same article in other languages. --[[User:StoatBringer|StoatBringer]] 19:40, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

== Money or nothing. ==

Maybe he just meant you need money. This paragraph is confusing to me. I don't think the quote represents the concept. 

The phrase &quot;Hail Marys&quot; is also used as an anti-pietist pejorative for &quot;prayer&quot; without &quot;good works&quot; as in the following quote atrributed to Msgr. Paul Marcinkus, former president of the Vatican Bank, now living in Sun City, Arizona: &quot;You can't run the Church on Hail Marys&quot; (quoted in the May 25, 1986, Observer, London).

== Latin prayer ==

Is it really wise to remove the Latin version of the prayer Hail Mary? It is not a translation since the Latin is the original, so it should be place back in the text. 05 June 2006

:I agree that the Latin has a place here.  Not so with the other three dozen languages that were removed, but the Latin has a special significance and removing it goes too far in the other direction. --[[User:Kbh3rd|Kbh3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;]][[User_talk:Kbh3rd|&lt;font style='font-size:.7em;'&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:50, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have restored the Latin version back to the text as I gather from your opinions. 7 June 2006

:Strictly speaking, the Greek is the original. Will add that shortly... [[User:InfernoXV|InfernoXV]] 19:10, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

The version in Greek translation to English, given, is based on the Latin translation, being a Latin Rite Catholic, I don't object much but a better translation might be:
Virgin God-bearer, rejoice, Mary, being engraced, the Lord makes use of thee, having been praised art thou amongst women and having been praised also is thy womb's fruit, because thou hast brought our lives' Savior into the world.

:No, that's not at all better, and a far too literal interpretation of the participles in use. It's a thoroughly awful translation, in fact. [[User:InfernoXV|InfernoXV]] ([[User talk:InfernoXV|talk]]) 04:27, 21 April 2008 (UTC)
Perhaps, but you're a shmuck wikipedia editor with no job so I find your appraisal of his translation highly dubious.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.119.35.93|98.119.35.93]] ([[User talk:98.119.35.93|talk]]) 15:32, 9 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Why is the latin V prounouced incorrectly?  Do catholics speak latin different then what is accepted as correct?   [[Special:Contributions/72.66.248.206|72.66.248.206]] ([[User talk:72.66.248.206|talk]]) 18:30, 4 December 2008 (UTC)
:I noticed this as well, overall, the audio file attached is actually really... lame sounding XD, but I can't answer your question about the 'V' not being pronounced as the traditional 'W'. It IS entirely possible that modern Roman Catholics pronounce it with a 'V' though. [[User:Pyrotics|Pyrotics]] ([[User talk:Pyrotics|talk]]) 16:06, 15 December 2008 (UTC)
:: It is in fact, more or less the case. See [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. [[User:Ronyu02|Ronyu02]] ([[User talk:Ronyu02|talk]]) 17:45, 28 December 2008 (UTC)
::There is good reason to believe that the pronunciation of V in Latin changed from a 'w' to a 'v' sound in the 1st century AD. It is virtually certain that it was never pronounced as w in any Latin version of the Ave until modern times, and even then not in any living Catholic tradition. I would expect that Catholics adhere to the Church Latin pronunciation, which, as far as I can tell, pronounces Latin according Italian rules. I have certainly heard English-speaking Irish Catholics pronounce it that way. The restored pronunciation of Latin, which is pretty universal in schools in English-speaking countries, would be incorrect for the Ave. [[User:Koro Neil|Koro Neil]] ([[User talk:Koro Neil|talk]]) 02:52, 7 May 2012 (UTC)

Is the Maria in the restored Latin section with macrons supposed to be accusative? If it is an ablative of respect or something, should the a's have macrons too, or is there an exception?[[User:DearthOfMateriel|DearthOfMateriel]] ([[User talk:DearthOfMateriel|talk]]) 05:44, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

== Translation of Josquin poem ==

Hey, I'm wondering if there should be a translation of the Josquin poem somewhere on here.  Since I'm a classics major, I thought I'd write up a rough one.  This is a very rough translation, and Josquin's latin isn't that great (I'm used to Roman latin rather than medieval latin):

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you, serene Virgin.&lt;br&gt;
Hail to [her] whose pregancy,&lt;br&gt;
full of sacred joy,&lt;br&gt;
celestial, terrestrial,&lt;br&gt;
full of new death (??).&lt;br&gt;
Hail to [her] whose birth,&lt;br&gt;
was our solemn observance,&lt;br&gt;
that the rising light of the morning star&lt;br&gt;
preceded the true sun.&lt;br&gt;
Hail the holy humility,&lt;br&gt;
fruitful without a man,&lt;br&gt;
whose notification&lt;br&gt;
was our salvation.&lt;br&gt;
Hail the true virginity,&lt;br&gt;
the immaculate chastity,&lt;br&gt;
whose purity,&lt;br&gt;
was our purification.&lt;br&gt;
Hail to all those illustrious,&lt;br&gt;
the angelic host,&lt;br&gt;
whose assumption was,&lt;br&gt;
our glory.&lt;br&gt;
O Mother of God, remember me.  Amen.

NOTE: Feel free to make corrections or to delete it entirely- I thought it might be useful to have a translation on the talk page.  Oh, and I couldn't figure out what the heck he was tring to say with letitia, since it means &quot;destruction&quot; or &quot;annihilation&quot; in latin.  And poems about the Virgin Mary rarely have to do with annihilation... -[[User:Elizabennet|Elizabennet]] 15:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
:It's the medieval spelling of ''laetitia'', which means &quot;joy&quot;. [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

I am surprised that there is no mention at all (unless I have missed it somehow) of the earliest source of the Ave Maria in Pseudo Matthew.  Thinks with canonical texts were only made made centuries later.  Can we add something about this?

==Latin==
The section where the prayer is given in latin was incorrect in how it put latin &quot;Jesus&quot;. Firstly, it has an I instead of a J, and you wrote the nominative instead the accusative (Jesus=NOM Jesum=ACC) Just thought I'd mention that (I fixed it).[[User:Thelordsavenger|Thelordsavenger]] 23:36, 24 October 2007 (UTC)
:In Latin, the 'J' does NOT exist, it is usually replaced with an 'I' (for example, Iupiter instead of Jupiter). [[User:Pyrotics|Pyrotics]] ([[User talk:Pyrotics|talk]]) 16:04, 15 December 2008 (UTC)

== Ecclesiastical Latin Pronunciation  ==

Can we get a better audio for the Latin pronuciation? It is terribly inaccurate. [[User:InFairness|InFairness]] ([[User talk:InFairness|talk]]) 19:51, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

== Syriac Hail Mary ==

I have edited the Syriac version of Hail Mary to what the words are really saying. The translation of 'Margoneetho' isn't a Syriac translation, but is the official English version. The real words of the Syriac Hail Mary are:
:Shlom leg '''bthulto''' Maryam malyath taybutho
:Hail '''Virgin''' Mary, full of Grace

:Moran 'ameg mbaragto at bneshe
:Our Lord is with thee, Blessed art Thou amongst women

:Wambaragu firo dabkarseg Moran '''Yeshu'''
:And blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, Our Lord '''Jesus''' (there is no Christ written!)

:O qadishto Maryam yoldath Aloho
:O Saint Mary, Mother of God (There is no Bthulto/Virgin in this phrase)

:Saloy hlofayn hatoye, hosho wabsho'at mawtan amin
:pray for us sinners, now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

Please keep this in mind. I pray this every day in Syriac, so I know what the words really say in Syriac. Thank you. [[Special:Contributions/80.56.5.133|80.56.5.133]] ([[User talk:80.56.5.133|talk]]) 14:13, 12 June 2010 (UTC)

: The article gives the official English version, of course, because this is the English Wikipedia.  [[User:Tb|Tb]] ([[User talk:Tb|talk]]) 16:41, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

:::I'm sorry, I think you both don't understand me. When we talk about Hail Mary in the '''Syriac orthodox tradition''', we need an English translation that '''equals the Syriac version'''. We do not need another traditional English version, because it would not be accurate, plus it would not make the Syriac version unique. Please view [http://www.kolesuryoye.nl/shlomlegmaryam.html this website] for a correct translation. It is in Dutch, but with a translator you will see that I am right.

::::::Why do we not need a Syriac text all the sudden? We have a Syriac version for a long time, why didn't anyone say before that the Syriac version could be deleted? With all due the respect, but I find it quite strange to delete the text now, ''after'' I tried my very best to make my point. I want the text to stay, with the correct version ofcourse. If someone wants to put the Dutch site as a reference, that is no problem by me. I am looking forward to your reply. (sorry for my poor English mr.

:::::::::This is the English Wikipedia.  There is a reason (a small one) to have the English version the Syriac Orthodox church actually uses. There is not a reason to have a new translation of the Syriac words, which are neither the Syriac words, nor the English version the Syriac Orthodox church uses.

:::::::::::Dear Tb, I hope I can explain my point clearly. I don't want phonetic Syriac words to be in the article, if that is what you mean. What I want is to change to current English translation of the &quot;Syriac tradition&quot; on the article to what the words literal are saying. Because basicly, the current English translation of the Syriac text is equal to the Catholic church, although the words slighty differ in the real Syriac orthodox text. The current English text of the Syriac section is the official English (catholic) Hail Mary text. It is not the real en good translation of the Syriac orthodox prayer. All I want is to add 'Virgin' in the beginning en to delete 'Christ' because only then it will be equal to the Syriac original text. Please I hope that you understand what I am trying to say.

I understand perfectly well what you say, and I disagree.  What is printed there is what the Syriac Orthodox Church recommends for use in English.  If you disagree with them, we aren't the place to complain about it.  We are not saying it is a &quot;good translation of the Syriac ... prayer&quot;; we are saying that it is used by the Syriac Orthodox Church--or at least, they say it is on their website.  It is not there to be a translation of the Syriac text; it is there as an example of a prayer in use by the Syriac Orthodox Church.  But it's not clear at all why it should be on the page at all. [[User:Tb|Tb]] ([[User talk:Tb|talk]]) 21:42, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
:Okay, you know what? Never mind. Wikipedia is claiming to provide truthful information. If you want the current text to stay, then Wikipedia, at least the English Wikipedia, does not reflect correct information. All I wanted to do is to help. I know what the Syriac orthodox Church teaches. I know their doctrines, their prayers etc. because I am Syriac orthodox. The website that is being referred to in the article (sor.cua.edu) isn't even the official Syr. orth. Church website. Because one website shows an official Catholic version as a translation you presume that the Syriac church recommends this for use in English. I showed you another Syriac website that shows you exactly the opposite, yet you claim that the current text should not be edited. I don't care anymore. If you want that Wikipedia provides incorrect information, then it is fine by me. [[Special:Contributions/80.56.5.133|80.56.5.133]] ([[User talk:80.56.5.133|talk]]) 21:56, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

:It doesn't show it &quot;as a translation&quot;, but in any case, you seem to be saying that we have no actual text available (in English) with adequate sources.  That's a shame, but it's what is, so I deleted the section.  We certainly don't want to suggest that that version is official if it isn't.  I thought above you said it was official, when you said it ''is the official English version''.  If it isn't we should certainly remove it.

== Musical settings ==

The &quot;Musical Settings&quot; section doesn't specify what it means by that phrase, and so offers no help on the question of whether the cited settings use unique melodies or are just different vocal and instrumental arrangements of one or more melodies. I'm familiar only with the Schubert and Gounod settings and the version commonly sung by U.S. Catholics, and the Gounod uses a different melody. It would help if someone who knows more could clarify in the article the various melodies in use for the Ave Maria, and which of these melodies is used for each of the settings listed.

== Catholic Church and Hail Mary ==

The reference of the Roman Catholic Church using the Hail Mary needs to stay at &quot;Catholic Church&quot; to indicate that all the Catholic rites say the Hail Mary instead of just the Roman Rite.  It is inaccurate and biased to say that only the Roman Rite says the Hail Mary and the other rites don't.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/97.91.89.192|97.91.89.192]] ([[User talk:97.91.89.192|talk]]) 22:40, 25 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Church Slavonic transcription ==

Here's a transcription of the Church Slavonic graphic, if it can be displayed with a font that works. I used the tone marks for diacritics, but perhaps those should actually be plain accent marks.
