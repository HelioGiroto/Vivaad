The '''Apostles' Creed''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''Symbolum Apostolorum'' or ''Symbolum Apostolicum''), sometimes titled '''Symbol of the Apostles''', is an early statement of [[Christianity|Christian]] belief, a [[creed]] or &quot;symbol&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Not in the sense that the word &quot;symbol&quot; has in modern English, but in the original meaning of the word, derived from &quot;Latin ''symbolum'', sign, token, from Greek σύμβολον, token for identification (by comparing with its counterpart), from συμβάλλειν, to throw together, compare&quot; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/74/S0957400.html (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language)].&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used by a number of [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechesis|catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]], and [[Western Orthodoxy]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].

The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[Canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old [[Roman Creed]]. Because of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the later [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian Creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[God the Son|Jesus]] or of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. This makes it acceptable to many [[Arianism|Arians]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Nor does it address many other theological questions that became objects of dispute centuries later.

The name of the Creed may come from the probably [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th-century]] tradition that, under the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]] after [[Pentecost]], each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] dictated part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/apostles_creed_orr.html |title=James Orr: ''The Apostles' Creed'', in International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110622082715/http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/apostles_creed_orr.html| archivedate= June 22 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally divided into twelve articles. However, Ambrose refers to the &quot;Creed of the Apostles&quot; in 390.

==Origins==
The title, ''Symbolum Apostolicum'' (Symbol or Creed of the Apostles), appears for the first time in a letter from a Council in [[Early centers of Christianity#Milan|Milan]] (probably written by [[Ambrose]] himself) to [[Pope Siricius]] in about 390: &quot;Let them give credit to the Creed of the Apostles, which the Roman Church has always kept and preserved undefiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Ambrose of Milan |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_05_letters41_50.htm#Letter42 |title=St. Ambrose of Milan, Letter 42:5 |publisher=Tertullian.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110605180149/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_05_letters41_50.htm| archivedate= June 05 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC&gt;''Apostles' Creed'' in Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005, ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; But what existed at that time was not what is now known as the Apostles' Creed but a shorter statement of belief that, for instance, did not include the phrase &quot;maker of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] and earth&quot;, a phrase that may have been inserted only in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=C4I9AAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22inserted+primarily%22&amp;pgis=1 Gardiner Mumford Day,The Apostles' Creed: an interpretation for today] (Scribner, 1963), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the Apostles' Creed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=woD7QYAjV3QC Arthur Cushman McGiffert, The Apostles' Creed: Its Origin, Its Purpose, and Its Historical Interpretation] (2008 ISBN 0-559-85199-5), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; as having been jointly created by the Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt;

The earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on {{bibleverse||Matthew|28:19}},&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt; part of the [[Great Commission]], and it has been argued that it was already in written form by the late [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] (c. 180).&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Documents of the Christian Church,'' 2nd edn, edited by Henry Bettenson (London, 1963), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Lynch, ''The Medieval Church'' (Longman: London and NY, 1992), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the individual statements of belief that are included in the Apostles' Creed – even those not found in the [[Old Roman Symbol]] – are found in various writings by [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Novatian]], [[Marcellus of Ancyra|Marcellus]], [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], [[Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Nicetus]], and [[Eusebius Gallus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.iv.i.i.v.html |title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume II. The History of Creeds. &amp;#124; Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest appearance of what we know as the Apostles' Creed was in the ''De singulis libris canonicis scarapsus'' (&quot;''Excerpt from Individual Canonical Books''&quot;) of [[Saint Pirmin|St. Pirminius]] ([[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' 89, 1029 ff.), written between 710 and 714.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Creeds'', third edition, (London: Longman, Green &amp; Co, 1972), 398–434&lt;/ref&gt; Bettenson and Maunder state that is first from ''Dicta Abbatis Pirminii de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus'' (''idem quod excarpsus'', excerpt), c.750.&lt;ref&gt;Bettenson, Henry, and Chris Maunder. Documents of the Christian Church. 3 ed. New York: Oxford University Press, USA, 1999. p. 26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This longer Creed seems to have arisen in what is now France and Spain. [[Charlemagne]] imposed it throughout his dominions, and it was finally accepted in Rome, where the old [[Roman Creed]] or similar formulas had survived for centuries.&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt; It has been argued nonetheless that it dates from the second half of the 5th century, though no earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newadvent&quot;&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, Origin of the Creed. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01629a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the Apostles' Creed was spliced together with phrases from the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Trillhaas, &quot;Creeds, Lutheran Attitude Toward&quot; in '''The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church''' edited by Julius Bodensieck (Minneapolis: Augsburg, Vol. A-E, p. 629)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the phrase &quot;descendit ad inferos&quot; ([[Harrowing of Hell|&quot;he descended into hell&quot;]]) echoes {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:9|NIV}}, &quot;κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς&quot; (&quot;he descended into the lower, earthly regions&quot;).

This phrase and that on the [[communion of saints]] are articles found in the Apostles' Creed, but not in the old Roman Creed nor in the Nicene Creed.

==Musical settings==
Musical settings of the Symbolum Apostolorum as a [[motet]] are rare. The French composer Le Brung published one Latin setting in 1540, the Spanish composer [[Fernando de las Infantas]] published two in 1578.

More recently, in 1979 [[John Michael Talbot]], a [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order Franciscan]], composed and recorded &quot;Creed&quot; on his album, ''The Lord's Supper''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G., &quot;Troubador of the Kingdom&quot;, ''[[Christianity Today]]'' 1 Feb 1985 p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rich Mullins]] and [[Beaker (musician)|Beaker]] also composed a musical setting titled &quot;Creed&quot;, released on Mullins' 1993 album ''[[A Liturgy, a Legacy, &amp; a Ragamuffin Band]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Mark Allan (2002). ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'', Hendrickson Publishers. p.615. ISBN 1-56563-679-1&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;Creed&quot; on [[Petra]]'s 1990 album ''Beyond Belief'' is loosely based on the Apostles' Creed.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Mark Allan (2002). p.696.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of England===
In the [[Church of England]] there are currently two authorized forms of the creed: that of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (1662) and that of ''[[Common Worship]]'' (2000).

:(The phrase &quot;he descended to the dead&quot; is footnoted to indicate the alternative reading: &quot;or 'he descended into hell,' another translation of this text in widespread use&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Statements-of-Belief/The-Apostles-Creed.aspx Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: The Apostles' Creed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This ecumenical version of the [[English Language Liturgical Consultation]] (ELLC) and its predecessor. the International Consultation on English Texts (ICET) is included in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the primary worship resource for the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Col-end}}

The [[Church of Denmark]] still uses the phrase &quot;We renounce the devil and all his works and all his ways&quot; as the beginning of this creed, before the line &quot;We believe in God etc.&quot;. This is mostly due to the influence of [[Grundtvig]]. See [[:da:Den apostolske trosbekendelse|Den apostolske trosbekendelse]].

===Unity of the Brethren===
In the version recited by Unity churches, the only variation from the Lutheran Creed is &quot;I believe in the holy Christian Church,&quot; instead of the &quot;catholic Church.&quot;

===United Methodist Church===
The [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at #881 in the ''[[United Methodist Hymnal]]'', one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to [[John Wesley]], founder of [[Methodism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |title=Catalyst: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher=Catalystresources.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110518093223/http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html| archivedate= May 18 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |title=Catalyst: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher=Catalystresources.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110518093227/http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html| archivedate= May 18 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable for omitting the line &quot;he descended into hell&quot;, but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version (see below), which includes &quot;he descended to the dead.&quot;

:I believe in God the Father Almighty,
:maker of heaven and earth;

:And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord:
:who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
:born of the Virgin Mary,
:suffered under Pontius Pilate,
:was crucified, dead, and buried;
:the third day he rose from the dead;
:he ascended into heaven,
:and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;
:from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

:I believe in the Holy Spirit,
:the holy catholic church,&lt;ref&gt;Understood by Methodists as referring to the [[Christian Church]] in general&lt;/ref&gt;
:the communion of saints,
:the forgiveness of sins,
:the resurrection of the body,
:and the life everlasting. Amen.

The ''United Methodist Hymnal'' also contains (at #882) what it terms the &quot;Ecumenical Version&quot; of this creed—a version which is identical to that found in the Episcopal Church's current ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use.

===Ecumenical version of the English Language Liturgical Consultation===
The [[English Language Liturgical Consultation]] (ELLC) is an international ecumenical group whose primary purpose is to provide ecumenically accepted texts for those who use English in their liturgy. In 1988 it produced a translation of the Apostles' Creed, distinguished among other things by its avoidance of the word &quot;his&quot; in relation to God. The text is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewingworship.org/resources/ELLC/texts/apostles_creed.html |title=Worship - Evangelical Lutheran Church in America |publisher=Renewingworship.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgical use in Western Christianity==
The liturgical communities in western Christianity that derive their rituals from the [[Roman Missal]], including those particular communities which use the Roman Missal itself (Roman Catholics), the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' ([[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] / Episcopalians), the ''Lutheran Book of Worship'' ([[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]] [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]), ''Lutheran Service Book'' ([[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod|Missouri-Synod Lutherans]]), use the Apostles' Creed and interrogative forms of it in their rites of [[Baptism]], which they consider to be the first [[sacrament]] of initiation into the Church.

===Roman Catholic Church===
====Rite of Baptism====
An interrogative form of the Apostles' Creed is used in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). The minister of baptism asks the following questions ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974):
:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?
:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?
:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?

To each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers &quot;I do.&quot; Then the celebrant says:
:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And all respond: Amen.

====Profession of faith at Mass====
Since the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the [[Roman Missal]] with the indication, &quot;Instead of the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]], especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’ Creed, may be used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/en/emy.htm#b5k |title=Order of Mass, 19 |publisher=Clerus.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles' Creed was already permitted.

===Church of England===
The Apostles' Creed is used in the non-Eucharistic services of [[Matins]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] ([[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]]). It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the [[Canticles#Anglican|Canticles]], and it is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]].

===Episcopal Church (United States)===
The [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. Regardless of age, candidates are to be sponsored by parents and/or godparents. Youths able to understand the significance of the Rite may go through the ritual speaking for themselves. Younger children and infants rely on their sponsors to act upon their behalf.

1. The celebrant calls for the candidates for Baptism to be presented.

2. The catechumen or sponsors state their request for Baptism.

3a. If the catechumen is of age, the celebrant will ask him or her if he or she desires Baptism, to which the catechumen will respond: &quot;I do.&quot;

3b. If the candidate relies on sponsors, the celebrant asks them if they will raise the child in &quot;the Christian faith and life&quot; (ECUSA BCP), and will raise the child through &quot;prayers and witness to grow into the full stature of Christ&quot; to which the parents will state to each, &quot;I will, with God's help.&quot;

4. A series of questions is then asked, to which the reply is always &quot;I renounce them&quot;:

:''Do you renounce [[Satan]] and all the spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against God?''
:''Do you renounce the evil powers of this world which corrupt and destroy the creatures of God?''
:''Do you renounce all [[sin]]ful desires that draw you from the love of God?''

5. The second half of the query is asked, to which the reply is always &quot;I do&quot;:

:''Do you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your [[salvation|Savior]]?''
:''Do you put your whole trust in his [[divinity|grace]] and [[love]]?''
:''Do you promise to follow and obey him as your Lord?''

6. The Apostles' Creed is then recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, 'Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?'

===Lutheran Church===
[[Lutheran]]s, like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:

:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth?
:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead?
:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting?

Following each question, the candidate answers by saying &quot;Yes, I believe&quot;. If the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions.&lt;ref&gt;''Lutheran Service Book'', &quot;Rite of Baptism&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
