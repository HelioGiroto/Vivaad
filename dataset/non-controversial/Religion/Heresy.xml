'''Heresy''' is any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs or customs. Heresy is distinct from both [[apostasy]], which is the explicit renunciation of one's religion, principles or cause,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reference.com/browse/Apostasy]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blasphemy]], which is irreverence toward religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blasphemy Definitions of &quot;blasphemy&quot; at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Heresy is usually used to discuss violations of [[religious law|religious]] or [[Tradition|traditional]] laws or [[legal code]]s, although it is used by some political extremists to refer to their opponents. It carries the connotation of behaviors or beliefs likely to undermine accepted [[morality]] and cause tangible evils, [[damnation]], or other punishment. In some religions, it also implies that the heretic is in alliance with the religion's symbol of [[evil]], such as [[Satan]] or [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/heresy Definition of &quot;heresy&quot; at Free Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; In certain historical Christian, Jewish, and some modern cultures, espousing ideas deemed heretical was punishable by law.

==Etymology==
Heresy is any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs or customs.{{cn|date=November 2012}} The term ''[[wiktionary:heresy|heresy]]'' is from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἵρεσις}} originally meant &quot;choice&quot;, but also referred to that process whereby a young person would examine various philosophies to determine how to live one's life. The word &quot;heresy&quot; is usually used within a Christian, Jewish, or Islamic context, and implies slightly different meanings in each. The founder or leader of a heretical movement is called a [[heresiarch]], while individuals who espouse heresy or commit heresy are known as heretics. [[Heresiology]] is the study of heresy.

==Christianity==
{{Main|Heresy in Christianity}}
The use of the word &quot;heresy&quot; was given wide currency by [[Irenaeus]] in his tract ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Contra Haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies'') to describe and discredit his opponents during the early centuries of the Christian community.{{cn|date=November 2012}} He described the community's beliefs and doctrines as [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] (from {{lang|grc|ὀρθός}}, ''orthos'' &quot;straight&quot; + {{lang|grc|δόξα}}, ''doxa'' &quot;belief&quot;) and the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]' teachings as heretical.{{cn|date=November 2012}} He also pointed out the concept of [[apostolic succession]] to support his arguments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frend&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |isbn=978-0-8006-1931-2 
|title= The Rise of Christianity 
|author=W.H.C. Frend |location=Chapter 7, The Emergence of Orthodoxy 135-93 
|year=1984}} Appendices provide a timeline of Councils, Schisms, Heresies and Persecutions in the years 193-604. They are described in the text.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constantine the Great]], who along with [[Licinius]] had [[decree]]d toleration of Christianity in the Roman Empire with the [[Edict of Milan]], and the first [[baptism|baptized]] Roman Emperor, set precedent for later policy. By Roman law the Emperor was [[Pontifex Maximus]], the high priest of the [[College of Pontiffs]] (''Collegium Pontificum)'' of all recognized religions in [[ancient Rome]]. Constantine established Christian orthodoxy by [[ecumenical council]]s and enforced orthodoxy by Imperial authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenson&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |isbn=978-1-59020-324-8 
|title= Constantine: Roman Emperor, Christian Victor 
|author=Paul Stephenson 
|location=Chapter 11 |year=2009}} The Emperor established and enforced orthodoxy for domestic tranquility and the efficacy of prayers in support of the empire.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known usage of the term in a legal context was in 380 AD by the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] of [[Theodosius I]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |isbn=978-1-59020-171-8 
|title= A.D. 381 -  Heretics, Pagans, and the Dawn of the Monotheistic State 
|author=Charles Freeman |year=2008}} As Christianity placed its stamp upon the Empire, the Emperor shaped the Church for political purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; which made Christianity the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as &quot;heresy&quot;. By this edict the State's authority and that of the catholic Church became somewhat overlapping. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and State was the sharing of State powers of legal enforcement with Church authorities. This reinforcement of the Church's authority gave Church leaders the power to, in effect, pronounce the [[capital punishment|death sentence]] upon those whom the Church considered heretical.

Within five years of the official criminalization of heresy by the Emperor, the first Christian heretic to be prosecuted, [[Priscillian]], was executed in 385 by Roman officials. For some years after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Protestant churches were also known to execute those whom they considered as heretics, including Catholics. The last known heretic executed by sentence of the Roman Catholic Church was [[Cayetano Ripoll]] in 1826. The number of people executed as heretics under the authority of the various &quot;ecclesiastical authorities&quot;{{#tag:ref|An &quot;ecclesiastical authority&quot; was initially an assembly of bishops, later the Pope, then an inquisitor (a delegate of the Pope) and later yet the leadership of a Protestant church (which would itself be regarded as heretical by the Pope). The definitions of &quot;state&quot;, &quot;cooperation&quot;, &quot;suppress&quot;  and &quot;heresy&quot; were all subject to change during the past 16 centuries.|group=&quot;note&quot;}} is not known.
{{#tag:ref|The records to estimate the number of executions resulting from first millennium heresy convictions do not exist. The absence of records does not prove the absence of prosecutions. Priscillian is the only ''known'' case of capital punishment for heresy in the first millennium.&lt;ref name=&quot;DurantF1&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |title= The Age of Faith
|author= Will &amp; Ariel Durant |year=1950 |location= page 778}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge of heresy is a weapon that fits many hands. A century and a half after heresy was made a state crime, the [[Vandals]] (a heretical Christian Germanic tribe), used the law to prosecute thousands of (orthodox) Catholics with penalties of torture, mutilation, slavery and banishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon1&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |title= History of the Decline and Fall 
of the Roman Empire |author= Edward Gibbon |location= Chapter 37, 
Part III}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vandals were overthrown; orthodoxy was restored; &quot;No toleration whatsoever was to be granted to heretics or schismatics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frend2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-8006-1931-2 
|title= The Rise of Christianity 
|author=W.H.C. Frend |location=page 833 |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heretics were not the only casualties. 4000 Roman soldiers were killed by heretical peasants in one campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= History of the Decline and 
Fall of the Roman Empire |author= Edward Gibbon |location= Chapter 21, Part VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better records are available in the second millennium. To estimate the fatalities associated with Christian heresies requires careful definitions and careful accounting. Lists of 
[[List of people burned as heretics|heretics]] and [[List of heresies in Catholicism|heresies]] are available. Thousands were burned at the stake by the [[Inquisition]] - a search for heresy that lasted centuries.&lt;ref 
name=&quot;Carroll&quot;&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-618-21908-0 
|title= Constantine's Sword |author=James Carroll |location=page 357 
|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heretics were burned at the stake by an enraged populace without the
official participation of Church or State.&lt;ref name=&quot;DurantF1&quot;/&gt; [[Religious Wars]] slaughtered millions. The degree to which heresy was a motivation for these wars (as opposed to other religious charges or politics) is subject to debate. The application of the term heresy to [[witch hunt|witchcraft]] trials and [[antisemitism]] is more controversial.

===Catholicism===
[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|170px|Massacre of the [[Waldensians]] of [[Massacre of Mérindol|Mérindol]] in 1545.]]
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] had always dealt harshly with strands of Christianity that it considered heretical, but before the 11th century these tended to centre around individual preachers or small localised sects, like [[Arianism]], [[Pelagianism]], [[Donatism]], [[Marcionism]] and [[Montanism]]. The diffusion of the almost [[Manichean]] sect of [[Paulician]]s westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] in modern day [[Bosnia]], a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianities. By the 11th century, more organised groups such as the [[Pataria|Patarini]], the [[Dulcinian]]s, the [[Waldensians]] and the [[Cathars]] were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of Northern Italy, Southern France and Flanders.

In [[France]] the Cathars grew to represent a popular mass movement and the belief was spreading to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897752-1,00.html Massacre of the Pure].&quot; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. April 28, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cathar Crusade]] was initiated by the Roman Catholic Church to eliminate the Cathar heresy in [[Languedoc]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Reese Strayer (1992). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=lskGFVtySXsC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Albigensian Crusades]''. [[University of Michigan Press]]. p. 143. ISBN 0-472-06476-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Durand&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |title= The Age of Faith
|author= Will &amp; Ariel Durant |year=1950 |location= Chapter XXVIII, The
Early Inquisition: 1000-1300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heresy was a major justification for the [[Inquisition]] (''Inquisitio Haereticae Pravitatis'', Inquiry on Heretical Perversity) and for the [[European wars of religion]] associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]].

[[File:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cristiano Banti's 1857 painting ''Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition'']]
A few early modern scientists were accused of heresy by the Catholic Church. [[Giordano Bruno]], who believed that the universe contained numerous suns, planets, and worlds similar to Earth, and that other such worlds could contain [[sentience|sentient]] beings, was condemned as a heretic by the Church and [[Auto-da-fé|burned at the stake]]. Some sources claim that Bruno's scientific views motivated his prosecution, but other sources say that only his theological views motivated it, in particular, &quot;that Christ was not God but merely an unusually skillful magician, that the Holy Ghost is the soul of the world, that the Devil will be saved, etc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Giordano Bruno}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Rabin, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/ &quot;Nicolaus Copernicus&quot;] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (online, accessed 19 November 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galileo Galilei]] was also [[Galileo affair|brought before the Inquisition]] for heresy, but [[Recantation|recanted]] and was condemned to [[house arrest]] (where he spent the rest of his life) instead of being burnt at the stake.

===Eastern Christianity===
In [[Eastern Christianity]] heresy most commonly refers to those beliefs declared to be heretical by the [[first seven Ecumenical Councils]].{{cn|date=October 2012}} Since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]], various Christian churches have also used the concept in proceedings against individuals and groups deemed to be heretical by those churches.

===Protestantism===

===Christian heresy in the modern era===
{{See also|Christian heresy in the modern era}}
Although less common than in the medieval period, formal charges of heresy within Christian churches still occur. Key issues in the Protestant churches have included modern biblical criticism, the nature of God, and the acceptability of gay clergy.  The Catholic Church, through the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], appears to be particularly concerned with academic theology.

Perhaps due to the many modern negative connotations associated with the term heretic, such as the [[Spanish inquisition]], the term is used less often today. There are however, some notable exceptions: see for example [[Rudolf Bultmann]] and the character of debates over [[ordination of women]] and [[ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|gay priests]]. The subject of Christian heresy opens up broader questions as to who has a monopoly on spiritual truth, as explored by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in the short story &quot;[[The Theologians]]&quot; within the compilation ''[[Labyrinths]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Labyrinths |first=Jorge Luis |last=Borges |year=1962 |pages=119–126 |isbn=978-0-8112-0012-7 |publisher=New Directions Publishing Corporation |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Heresy in Islam|Bid‘ah}}
Many in the two main bodies of  [[Islam]]—[[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] and the  [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'as]]—have regarded the other as heretical. Groups like the [[Ismaili]]s, the [[Hurufi]]ya, the [[Alawi]]s, the [[Bektashi]] and the [[Sufi]]s have  been regarded as heretical by many, such as the ultra-conservative [[Salafi]]. Although Sufism is often though not completely accepted as valid by Shi'a and many Sunnis, the relatively recent movement of [[Wahhabism]] view it as heretical.

Starting in medieval times, Muslims began to refer to heretics and those who antagonized Islam as ''[[zindiq]]s'', the charge being punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker. &quot;Zindiq.&quot; The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Muslim scholars and philosophers such as [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]] were condemned as heretics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_averroes.html |title=Averroës (Ibn Rushd) &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy |publisher=Philosophybasics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main|Heresy in Judaism}}

===Orthodox Judaism===
{{Main|Heresy in Orthodox Judaism}}
[[Orthodox Judaism]] considers views on the part of Jews which depart from the traditional [[Jewish principles of faith]] to be heretical. In addition, the more right-wing groups within Orthodox Judaism hold that all Jews who reject the simple meaning of [[Maimonides]]'s 13 principles of Jewish faith are heretics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised'', by Marc B. Shapiro, ISBN 1-874774-90-0, A book written as a contentious rebuttal to an article written in the ''[[Torah u'Maddah Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, most of Orthodox Judaism considers [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] to be heretical movements, and regards most of [[Conservative Judaism]] as heretical. The liberal wing of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]] is more tolerant of Conservative Judaism, particularly its right wing, as there is some theological and practical overlap between these groups.

==Other religions==
[[Hinduism]] ignored or absorbed its heretics. In chapter XVI, the [[Bhagavad-Gita]] makes passing reference to heretics (as the Unheavenly).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Buddhist literature mentions a wrathful conquest of Buddhist heretics (see [[Padmasambhava]]) and a [[Theocracy#Buddhism|Buddhist theocracy]] once existed, but Buddhism doesn't accept the use of violence.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/pancasila.html Buddhism Five precepts])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neo-Confucian]] heresy has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The construction of orthodoxy and heresy: Neo-Confucian, Islamic, Jewish, and early Christian patterns |author= John B. Henderson|year= 1998 |isbn= 978-0-7914-3760-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The act of using [[Church of Scientology]] techniques in a form different than originally described by [[L. Ron Hubbard|Hubbard]] is referred to within Scientology as &quot;[[Scientology_beliefs_and_practices#Squirreling|squirreling]]&quot; and is said by Scientologists to be &quot;high treason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert W. | last = Welkos | coauthors = Sappell, Joel | title = When the Doctrine Leaves the Church | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062990b,0,4204659.story | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 29 June 1990 | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Technology Center]] has prosecuted breakaway groups that have practiced Scientology [[Free Zone (Scientology)|outside the official Church]] without authorization.

==Non-religious usage==
In a [[secularity|secular]], multi-polar world, the term heresy has lost utility outside of a well-defined (usually religious) context. While heresy is [[pejorative]] in a religious context and in some political contexts, it may be complimentary in other contexts where innovation is more welcome.

Today, heresy can be without a religious context as the holding of ideas that are in fundamental disagreement with the ''[[status quo]]'' in any practice and branch of knowledge. 
Scientist/author [[Isaac Asimov]] considered heresy as an abstraction,&lt;ref 
name=&quot;Goldsmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book 
|title=Scientists Confront Velikovsky
|author=Donald Goldsmith |year=1977
|isbn=0-8014-0961-6}}  Asimov's views
are in Forward: The Role of the Heretic.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning religious, political, socioeconomic and scientific heresies. He divided scientific heretics into [[Scientist#Endoheretics|endoheretics]] (those from within the [[scientific community]]) and [[Scientist#Exoheretics|exoheretics]] (those from without). Characteristics were ascribed to both and [[Scientists#Heretics|examples]] of both kinds were offered. Asimov concluded that science orthodoxy defends itself well against endoheretics (by control of science education, grants and publication as examples), but is nearly powerless against exoheretics. He acknowledged by examples that heresy has repeatedly become orthodoxy.

The revisionist [[paleontologist]] [[Robert T. Bakker]], who published his findings as ''[[The Dinosaur Heresies]]'', treated the mainstream view of dinosaurs as [[dogma]].&lt;ref 
name=&quot;Bakker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dinosaur Heresies
|author=Robert T. Bakker |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-8065-2260-9}}
&quot;I have enormous respect for dinosaur paleontologists past and present. But on average, for the last fifty years, the field hasn't tested dinosaur orthodoxy severely enough.&quot; page 27  &quot;Most taxonomists, however, have viewed such new terminology as dangerously destabilizing to the traditional and well-known scheme...&quot; page 462. This book apparently influenced [[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]. The illustrations by the author show dinosaurs in very active poses, in contrast to the traditional perception of lethargy.&lt;/ref&gt; He is an example of a recent scientific endoheretic.

[[Immanuel Velikovsky]] is an example of a recent scientific exoheretic; He did not have appropriate [[Credential#Academic_and_professional_credentials|scientific credentials]] or publish in [[scientific journal]]s. While the details of his work are in scientific disrepute, the concept of [[Catastrophism|catastrophic change]] ([[extinction event]] and [[punctuated equilibrium]]) has gained acceptance in recent decades. 

The term heresy is also used as an ideological [[Pigeonholing|pigeonhole]] for contemporary writers because, by definition, heresy depends on contrasts with an established [[orthodoxy]]. For example, the tongue-in-cheek contemporary usage of heresy, such as to categorize a &quot;[[Wall Street]] heresy&quot; a &quot;[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] heresy&quot; or a &quot;[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] heresy&quot;, are [[metaphor]]s which invariably retain a [[subtext]] that links orthodoxies in [[geology]] or [[biology]] or any other field to religion. These expanded metaphoric senses allude to both the difference between the person's views and the mainstream and the boldness of such a person in propounding these views.
