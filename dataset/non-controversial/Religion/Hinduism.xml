==Etymology==
[[Image:Valmiki Ramayana.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Valmiki]], a contemporary of [[Rama]], composes the [[Ramayana]].]]
The word ''Hindu'' is derived (through [[Persian language|Persian]]) from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Sindhu'', the historic local appellation for the [[Indus River]] in the northwestern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]], which is first mentioned in the [[Rig Veda]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;India&quot;, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edition, 2100a.d. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10075.htm Rig Veda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Subramuniyaswami|first=Satguru Sivaya|title=Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism|year=2003|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|isbn=0-945497-96-2, 9780945497967|pages=1008|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EWlHPAkjBKUC&amp;pg=PA782&amp;dq=from+the+Sanskrit+word+Sindhu+radhakrishnan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3zhWT8PBOJCurAf_8-CyBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=from%20the%20Sanskrit%20word%20Sindhu%20radhakrishnan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Hindu'' was borrowed into European languages from the [[Arabic]] term ''al-Hind'', referring to the land of the people who live across the River Indus,&lt;ref&gt;Thapar, R. 1993. ''Interpreting Early India.'' Delhi: Oxford University Press. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; itself from the Persian term ''Hindū'', which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, ''[[Hindustan|Hindustān]]'' emerged as a popular alternative [[Names of India|name of India]], meaning the &quot;land of ''Hindus''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Thompson Platts |first = John |title = A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindī, and English| publisher = W.H. Allen &amp; Co., Oxford University 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Hinduism also occurs sporadically in Sanskrit texts such as the later [[Rajatarangini]]s of Kashmir (Hinduka, c. 1450), some 16th-18th century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] texts, including ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' and ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]'', usually to contrast Hindus with [[Yavana#Later meanings|Yavanas]] or [[Mlecchas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=The Word 'Hindu' in Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Texts| author = O'Conell, Joseph T.| journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society| volume= 93| number =3 | year =1973|  pages=340–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only towards the end of the 18th century that the European merchants and colonists referred collectively to the followers of [[Indian religions]] as ''Hindus''. The term ''Hinduism'' was introduced into the [[English language]] in the 19th century to denote the religious, philosophical, and cultural traditions native to India.

The later Puranas recount tales about [[deva (Hinduism)|devas and devis]], their interactions with humans and their battles against [[rakshasa]].

Increasing urbanization of India in 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or shramana movements which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;pg=PA82|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of [[Jainism]], and  [[Buddha]] (c. 563-483), founder of [[Buddhism]] were the most prominent icons of this movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Religions&quot;/&gt;{{rp|184}} Shramana gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of [[samsara]], and the concept of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin.

Malden: Blackwell. pg. 273-4. &quot;The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history....Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara - the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana - the goal of human existence.....&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]], [[Hermann Oldenberg|Oldenberg]] and [[Karl Eugen Neumann|Neumann]] believed that the Buddhist canon had been influenced by Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pratt|first=James Bissett|title=The Pilgrimage of Buddhism and a Buddhist Pilgrimage|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cLXwU9e6D4sC&amp;pg=PA90|year=1996|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1196-2|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanskritic culture went into decline after the end of the [[Gupta period]]. The early medieval [[Purana]]s  helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing [[acculturation]]. The tenets of Brahmanic Hinduism and of the [[Dharmashastras]] underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream &quot;Hinduism&quot; that overshadowed all earlier traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Nath, ''From 'Brahmanism' to 'Hinduism': Negotiating the Myth of the Great Tradition'', Social Scientist  2001, pp. 19-50.&lt;/ref&gt; In eighth century royal circles, the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas.&lt;ref&gt;Inden, Ronald. &quot;Ritual, Authority, And Cycle Time in Hindu Kingship.&quot; In JF Richards, ed., ''Kingship and Authority in South Asia''. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998, p.67, 55&quot;before the eighth century, the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies by which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa....This pattern changed in the eighth century. The Buddha was replaced as the supreme, imperial deity by one of the Hindu gods (except under the Palas of eastern India, the Buddha's homeland)...Previously the Buddha had been accorded imperial-style worship (puja). Now as one of the Hindu gods replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system, the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''The Buddhist Visnu''. Columbia University Press, 2004, p.12,15 &quot;The replacement of the Buddha as the &quot;cosmic person&quot; within the mythic ideology of Indian kingship, as we shall see shortly, occurred at about the same time the Buddha was incorporated and subordinated within the Brahmanical cult of Visnu.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indology]] as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as [[Max Müller]] and [[John Woodroffe]]. They brought [[Vedas|Vedic]], [[Puranic]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] literature and philosophy to Europe and the [[United States]]. At the same time, societies such as the [[Brahmo Samaj]] and the [[Theosophical Society]] attempted to reconcile and fuse [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] and Dharmic philosophies, endeavouring to institute societal reform. This period saw the emergence of movements which, while highly innovative, were rooted in indigenous tradition. They were based on the personalities and teachings of individuals, as with [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Ramana Maharshi]]. Prominent Hindu philosophers, including [[Aurobindo]] and [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Prabhupada]] (founder of [[ISKCON]]), translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism's foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, attracting followers and attention in India and abroad. Others such as [[Vivekananda]], [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], [[Sri Chinmoy]], [[B.K.S. Iyengar]] and [[Swami Rama]] have also been instrumental in raising the profiles of Yoga and [[Vedanta]] in the West.

Hinduism as it is commonly known can be subdivided into a number of major currents. Of the historical division into six [[darsanas]], only two schools, [[Vedanta]] and [[Raja Yoga|Yoga]], survive. The main divisions of Hinduism today are [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Smartism]] and [[Shaktism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_659.html Adherents.com], which itself references many sources; ''The World Almanac &amp; Book of Facts 1998'' being especially relevant.&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism also recognizes numerous divine beings subordinate to the Supreme Being or regards them as lower manifestations of it.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. D. 1996. An introduction to Hinduism. 1996. P.14&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable characteristics include a belief in [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]], as well as in personal duty, or [[dharma]].

McDaniel (2007) distinguishes six generic &quot;types&quot; of Hinduism, in an attempt to accommodate a variety of views on a rather complex subject:&lt;ref&gt;J. McDaniel ''Hinduism'', in John Corrigan, ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion'', (2007) Oxford University Press, 544 pages, pp. 52-53 ISBN 0-19-517021-0&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Folk Hinduism]], as based on local traditions and cults of local [[deities]] at a communal level and spanning back to prehistoric times or at least prior to written [[Vedas]].
*[[Śrauta]] or &quot;Vedic&quot; Hinduism as practiced by traditionalist [[brahmin]]s ([[Śrauta|Śrautin]]s).
*Vedantic Hinduism, for example [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[Smartism]]), as based on the philosophical approach of the [[Upanishads]].
*[[Yoga|Yogic]] Hinduism, especially that based on the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].
*&quot;Dharmic&quot; Hinduism or &quot;daily morality&quot;, based on [[Karma]], and upon societal norms such as [[Vivāha]] (Hindu marriage customs).
*[[Bhakti]] or devotionalist practices

Hinduism does not have a &quot;unified system of belief encoded in declaration of faith or a [[creed]]&quot;,&lt;ref name = flood01/&gt; but is rather an umbrella term comprising the  plurality of religious phenomena originating and based on the [[Vedas|Vedic traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.C.

Most [[Hindu denominations|Hindu traditions]] revere a body of religious or [[sastra|sacred literature]], the [[Veda]]s, although there are exceptions. Some  Hindu religious traditions regard particular rituals as essential for salvation, but a variety of views on this co-exist. Some [[Hindu philosophies]] postulate a [[theism|theistic]] [[ontology]] of creation, of sustenance, and of destruction of the universe, yet [[Atheism in Hinduism|some Hindus are atheists]]. Hinduism is sometimes characterized by the belief in reincarnation (''[[samsara]]''), determined by  the law  of [[karma]], and the idea that salvation is freedom from this cycle of repeated birth and death. However, other religions of the region, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], also believe in karma, outside the scope of Hinduism.&lt;ref name = flood01/&gt; Hinduism is therefore viewed as the most complex of all of the living, historical world religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Joel Beversluis |title=Sourcebook of the World's Religions: An Interfaith Guide to Religion and Spirituality (Sourcebook of the World's Religions, 3rd ed) |publisher=New World Library |location=Novato, Calif |year=2000 |pages=50 |isbn=1-57731-121-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its complexity, Hinduism is not only one of the numerically largest faiths, but is also the oldest living major tradition on earth, with roots reaching back into prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weightman|Klostermaier|1994|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A definition of Hinduism, given by the first Vice President of India, who was also a prominent theologian, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, states that Hinduism is not &quot;just a faith&quot;, but in itself is related to the union of reason and [[Intuition (knowledge)#Intuition and spirituality|intuition]]. Radhakrishnan explicitly states that Hinduism cannot be defined, but is only to be experienced.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita'', [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]: &quot;Hinduism is not just a faith. It is the union of reason and intuition that can not be defined but is only to be experienced.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly some academics suggest that Hinduism can be seen as a category with &quot;fuzzy edges&quot;, rather than as a well-defined and rigid entity. Some forms of religious expression are central to Hinduism, while others are not as central but still remain within the category. Based on this, Ferro-Luzzi has developed a 'Prototype Theory approach' to the definition of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Ferro-Luzzi, (1991)''The Polythetic-Prototype Approach to Hinduism'' in G.D. Sontheimer and H. Kulke (ed.) ''Hinduism Reconsidered''. Delhi: Manohar. pp. 187-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with the single definition of what is actually meant by the term 'Hinduism' are often attributed to the fact that Hinduism does not have a single or common historical founder. Hinduism, or as some say 'Hinduisms,' does not have a single system of salvation and has different goals according to each sect or denomination. The forms of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] are seen not as an alternative to Hinduism, but as its earliest form, and there is little justification for the divisions found in much western scholarly writing between [[Vedism]], [[Brahminical Hinduism|Brahmanism]], and Hinduism. According to Supreme court of India &quot;unlike other religions in the World, the Hindu religion does not claim any one Prophet, it does not worship any one God, it does not believe in any one philosophic concept, it does not follow any one act of religious rites or performances, in fact, it does not satisfy the traditional features of a religion or creed. It is a way of life and nothing more&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klostermaier 1994 p=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hinduism refers to a religious mainstream which evolved organically and spread over a large territory marked by significant ethnic and cultural diversity. This mainstream evolved both by innovation from within, and by assimilation of  external traditions or cults into the Hindu fold. The result is an enormous variety of religious traditions, ranging from innumerable small, unsophisticated cults to major religious movements with millions of adherents spread over the entire subcontinent. The identification of Hinduism  as an independent religion separate from Buddhism or Jainism consequently hinges on the affirmation of its adherents that it is such.&lt;ref name=weightman&gt;{{Harvnb|Weightman|1998|pp=262–264}} &quot;It is Hindu self-awareness and self-identity that affirm Hinduism to be one single religious universe, no matter how richly varied its contents, and make it a significant and potent force alongside the other religions of the world.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rig Veda]], the oldest scripture and the mainstay of [[Hindu philosophy]] does not take a restrictive view on the fundamental question of [[God]] and the creation of universe. It rather lets the individual seek and discover answers in the quest of life. [[Nasadiya Sukta]] (''Creation   Hymn'') of the Rig Veda thus says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=World  scriptures: an   introduction to comparative religions| first=Kramer|   last=Kenneth| isbn=978-0-8091-2781-8|year=1986|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&amp;pg=PA34 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite   web|author=Subodh Varma |  url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-16/vintage-wisdom/29802795_1_philosophy-speculation-vedas |title=The gods came afterwards |publisher=  [[Times of India]] |date= May 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dualistic]] schools (see [[Dvaita]] and [[Bhakti]]) understand Brahman as a Supreme Being who possesses personality, and they worship him or her thus, as [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]], [[Shiva]], or [[Shakti]], depending upon the sect.

The Hindu scriptures refer to celestial entities called ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]'' (or ''[[Devi|{{IAST|devī}}]]'' in feminine form; ''{{IAST|devatā}}'' used synonymously for Deva in Hindi), &quot;the shining ones&quot;, which may be translated into English as &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;heavenly beings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''deva'' in singular noun form as &quot;a deity, god&quot;, and in plural form as &quot;the gods&quot; or &quot;the heavenly or shining ones&quot;, see: {{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|2001|p=492}}. In fact, there are different ranks among the devas. The highest are the immortal Mahadevas, such as Shiva, Vishnu, etc. The second-rank devas, such as Ganesha, are described as their offspring: they are &quot;born&quot;, and their &quot;lifespan&quot; is quite limited. In [[ISKCON]] the word is translated as &quot;demigods&quot;, although it can also denote such heavenly denizens as [[gandharva]]s. See: {{cite web|url=http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/planetarium/index.htm|title=Vedic cosmology|accessdate=2007-06-25|work=Vedic Knowledge Online|publisher=VEDA - Bhaktivedanta Book Trust}}. For translation of ''{{IAST|devatā}}'' as &quot;godhead, divinity&quot;, see: {{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|2001|p=495}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''devas'' are an integral part of Hindu culture and are depicted in [[art]], [[architecture]] and through [[icon]]s, and mythological stories about them are related in the scriptures, particularly in [[Indian epic poetry]] and the [[Purana]]s. They are, however, often distinguished from [[Ishvara]], a supreme personal god, with many Hindus worshiping Ishvara in one of its particular manifestations (ostensibly separate deities) as their ''{{IAST|[[iṣṭa devatā]]}}'', or chosen ideal.&lt;ref name=werner80&gt;{{Harvnb|Werner|1994|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Renou|1961|p= 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice is a matter of individual preference,&lt;ref name=harman1&gt;{{Harvnb |Harman |2004|pp=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of regional and family traditions.&lt;ref name=harman1/&gt;

Hindu epics and the Puranas relate several episodes of the descent of God to Earth in corporeal form to restore ''dharma'' to society and to guide humans to ''moksha.'' Such an incarnation is called an ''[[Avatar]].'' The most prominent avatars are of [[Vishnu]] and include [[Rama]] (the protagonist in [[Ramayana]]) and [[Krishna]] (a central figure in the epic [[Mahabharata]]).

===Karma and samsara===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be described as the &quot;moral law of cause and effect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1991|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Upanishads an individual, known as the ''jiva-atma'', develops ''[[sanskara]]s'' (impressions) from actions, whether physical or mental. The ''linga sharira'', a body more subtle than the physical one but less subtle than the soul, retains impressions, carrying them over into the next life, establishing a unique trajectory for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Radhakrishnan|1996|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept of a universal, neutral, and never-failing karma intrinsically relates to [[reincarnation]] as well as to one's personality, characteristics, and family. Karma binds together the notions of [[free will]] and [[destiny]].

This cycle of ''action, reaction, birth, death and rebirth'' is a continuum called ''[[samsara]]''. The notion of reincarnation and karma is a strong premise in Hindu thought. The [[Bhagavad Gita]] states:

{{quote|As a person puts on new clothes and discards old and torn clothes,&lt;br&gt;
similarly an embodied soul enters new material bodies, leaving the old bodies.(B.G. 2:22)&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita 2.22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Samsara'' provides ephemeral pleasures, which lead people to desire rebirth so as to enjoy the pleasures of a perishable body. However, escaping the world of ''samsara'' through ''moksha'' is believed to ensure lasting happiness and peace.&lt;ref&gt;See Bhagavad Gita XVI.8-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation

}} 301-02 (8th Printing 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that after several reincarnations, an ''atman'' eventually seeks unity with the cosmic spirit (Brahman/Paramatman).

The ultimate goal of life, referred to as ''moksha'', ''[[nirvana]]'' or ''[[Samādhi|samadhi]]'', is understood in several different ways: as the realization of one's union with God; as the realization of one's eternal relationship with God; realization of the unity of all existence; perfect unselfishness and knowledge of the Self; as the attainment of perfect mental peace; and as detachment from worldly desires. Such realization liberates one from ''samsara'' and ends the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rinehart|2004|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994|pp=79–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to belief in the indestructibility of the soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Europa Publications Staff | title = The Far East and Australasia, 2003 - Regional surveys of the world| publisher = [[Routledge]]| year = 2003| page = 39| url = http://books.google.com/?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&amp;pg=PA39| isbn = 978-1-85743-133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; death is deemed insignificant with respect to the cosmic self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Hindu spirituality - Volume 25 of Documenta missionalia| publisher = Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana| year = 1999| page = 1| url = http://books.google.com/?id=58UZWWzqglMC| isbn = 978-88-7652-818-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thence, a person who has no desire or ambition left and no responsibilities remaining in life or one affected by a terminal disease may embrace death by ''[[Prayopavesa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/euthanasia.shtml|title= Hinduism - Euthanasia and Suicide|date= 2009-08-25|publisher= [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact conceptualization of ''moksha'' differs among the various Hindu schools of thought. For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining ''moksha'' an ''atman'' no longer identifies itself with an individual but as identical with Brahman in all respects. The followers of [[Dvaita]] (dualistic) schools identify themselves as part of Brahman, and after attaining ''moksha'' expect to spend eternity in a ''[[loka]]'' (heaven),&lt;ref&gt;The Christian concepts of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] do not translate directly into Hinduism. Spiritual realms such as [[Vaikunta]] (the abode of Vishnu) or ''loka'' are the closest analogues to an eternal Kingdom of God.&lt;/ref&gt; in the company of their chosen form of ''Ishvara''. Thus, it is said that the followers of ''dvaita'' wish to &quot;taste sugar&quot;, while the followers of Advaita wish to &quot;become sugar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nikhilananda|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dharma (righteousness, ethikos)====
The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] views dharma as the universal principle of law, order, harmony, all in all truth, that sprang first from [[Brahman]]. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is ''sat'' (truth), a major tenet of Hinduism. This hearkens back to the conception of the [[Rig Veda]] that &quot;Ekam Sat,&quot; (Truth Is One), of the idea that Brahman is &quot;''[[Satchitananda|Sacchidananda]]''&quot; (Truth-Consciousness-Bliss). Dharma is not just law, or harmony, it is pure Reality. In the [[Brihadaranyaka|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'s own words:
{{quote|Verily, that which is Dharma is truth, Therefore they say of a man who speaks truth, &quot;He speaks the Dharma,&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
or of a man who speaks the Dharma, &quot;He speaks the Truth.&quot;, Verily, both these things are the same.|(''Brh. Upanishad'', 1.4.14) ([[#References|2]])}}
In the [[Mahabharata]], [[Krishna]] defines dharma as upholding both this-worldly and other-worldly affairs. (Mbh 12.110.11). The word ''Sanātana'' means 'eternal', 'perennial', or 'forever'; thus, 'Sanātana Dharma' signifies that it is the dharma that has neither beginning nor end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Swami Prabhupādā|first=A.

===Yoga===
{{Main|Yoga}}
[[File:Shiva Bangalore .jpg|thumb|right|x216px| text|A statue of [[Shiva]] in yogic meditation.]]
In whatever way a Hindu defines the goal of life, there are several methods (yogas) that sages have taught for reaching that goal. Texts dedicated to Yoga include the Bhagavad Gita, the [[Yoga Sutras]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Paths that one can follow to achieve the spiritual goal of life (''moksha'', ''samadhi'' or ''[[nirvana]]'') include:

*[[Bhakti Yoga]] (the path of love and devotion)
*[[Karma Yoga]] (the path of right action)
*[[Rāja Yoga]] (the path of meditation)
*[[Jñāna Yoga]] (the path of wisdom)&lt;ref name=bhaskaressentgeneral&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding. Some devotional schools teach that ''bhakti'' is the only practical path to achieve spiritual perfection for most people, based on their belief that the world is currently in the ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' (one of four epochs which are part of the [[Yuga]] cycle).&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the following translation of B-Gita 11.54: &quot;My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.&quot; ({{Harvnb|Bhaktivedanta|1997|loc=ch. [http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/11/54/en1 11.54]}})&lt;/ref&gt; Practice of one yoga does not exclude others. Many schools believe that the different yogas naturally blend into and aid other yogas. For example, the practice of ''jnana yoga'', is thought to inevitably lead to pure love (the goal of ''bhakti yoga''), and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One who knows that the position reached by means of analytical study can also be attained by devotional service, and who therefore sees analytical study and devotional service to be on the same level, sees things as they are.&quot; ({{Harvnb|Bhaktivedanta|1997|loc=ch. [http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/5/5/en1 5.5]}})&lt;/ref&gt; Someone practicing deep meditation (such as in ''raja yoga'') must embody the core principles of ''karma yoga'', ''jnana yoga'' and ''bhakti yoga'', whether directly or indirectly.&lt;ref name=bhaskaressentgeneral/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|1974|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tulasikattesp.jpg|thumb|right|x216px| text|The sacred Tulsi plant in front of the house.]]
Hindu practices generally involve seeking awareness of God and sometimes also seeking blessings from Devas. Therefore, Hinduism has developed numerous practices meant to help one think of divinity in the midst of everyday life. Hindus can engage in {{IAST|pūjā}} (worship or veneration),&lt;ref name=&quot;MW Sanskrit dict.&quot;/&gt; either at home or at a temple. At home, Hindus often create a shrine with icons dedicated to their   chosen form(s) of God. Temples are usually dedicated to a primary deity along with associated subordinate deities though some commemorate multiple deities. Visiting temples is not obligatory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many visit temples only during religious festivals. Hindus perform their worship through icons ([[murti]]s). The icon serves as a tangible link between the worshiper and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image is often considered a manifestation of God, since God is immanent. The [[Padma Purana]] states that the ''{{IAST|mūrti}}'' is not to be thought of as mere stone or wood but as a manifest form of the Divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|arcye viṣṇau śīlā-dhīr. . . narakī saḥ}}.''&lt;/ref&gt; A few Hindu sects, such as the [[Arya Samaj|{{IAST|Ārya Samāj}}]], do not believe in worshiping God through icons.

Hinduism has a developed system of symbolism and iconography to represent the sacred in art, architecture, literature and worship. These symbols gain their meaning from the scriptures, mythology, or cultural traditions. The syllable ''[[Om]]'' (which represents the ''Parabrahman'') and the [[Swastika#Hinduism|Swastika]] sign (which symbolizes auspiciousness) have grown to represent Hinduism itself, while other markings such as ''[[tilaka]]'' identify a follower of the faith. Hinduism associates many symbols, which include the lotus, ''[[chakra]]'' and ''[[veena]]'', with particular deities.

[[Mantra]]s are invocations, praise and prayers that through their meaning, sound, and chanting style help a devotee focus the mind on holy thoughts or express devotion to God/the deities. Many devotees perform morning ablutions at the bank of a sacred river while chanting the ''[[Gayatri Mantra]]'' or ''[[Mahamrityunjaya]]'' mantras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Albertson| first = Todd| title = The gods of business: the intersection of faith and the marketplace| year = 2009| page = 71| url = http://books.google.com/?id=ipTZBagrIu0C&amp;pg=PA71| isbn = 978-0-615-13800-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epic [[Mahabharata]] extols ''[[Japa]]'' (ritualistic chanting) as the greatest duty in the [[Kali Yuga]] (what Hindus believe to be the current age).&lt;ref name=&quot;swami&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Narendranand (Swami)| title = Hindu spirituality: a help to conduct prayer meetings for Hindus| publisher = Jyoti Ashram| year = 2008| page = 51| url = http://books.google.co.in/books?ei=WwIvTNWQKsSFrAehsKDzBQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adopt ''Japa'' as their primary spiritual practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;swami&quot; /&gt; [[Yoga]] is a Hindu discipline which trains the consciousness for tranquility, health and spiritual insight.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but observation of rituals greatly vary among regions, villages, and individuals. Devout Hindus perform daily chores such as worshiping at dawn after bathing (usually at a family shrine, and typically includes lighting a lamp and offering foodstuffs before the images of deities), recitation from religious scripts, singing [[bhajan|devotional hymns]], [[meditation]], chanting mantras, reciting scriptures etc.&lt;ref name=locceremonies/&gt; A notable feature in religious ritual is the division between purity and pollution. Religious acts presuppose some degree of impurity or defilement for the practitioner, which must be overcome or neutralised before or during ritual procedures. Purification, usually with water, is thus a typical feature of most religious action.&lt;ref name=locceremonies/&gt; Other characteristics include a belief in the efficacy of sacrifice and concept of merit, gained through the performance of charity or good works, that will accumulate over time and reduce sufferings in the next world.&lt;ref name=locceremonies/&gt; Vedic rites of fire-oblation (''[[yajna]]'') are now only occasional practices, although they are highly revered in theory. In Hindu wedding and burial ceremonies, however, the ''yajña'' and chanting of Vedic [[mantra]]s are still the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudhirlaw.com/HMA55.htm|title=Hindu Marriage Act, 1955|accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals, ''upacharas'', change with time. For instance, in the past few hundred years some rituals, such as sacred [[dance]] and music offerings in the standard Sodasa Upacharas set prescribed by the Agama Shastra, were replaced by the offerings of rice and sweets.

Occasions like birth, marriage, and death involve what are often elaborate sets of religious customs. In Hinduism, life-cycle rituals include ''[[Annaprashan]]'' (a baby's first intake of solid food), ''[[Upanayanam]]'' (&quot;sacred thread ceremony&quot; undergone by upper-caste children at their initiation into formal education) and ''[[Śrāddha]]'' (ritual of treating people to a meal in return for prayers to 'God' to give peace to the soul of the deceased).&lt;ref name=loclifecycle&gt;{{cite web

{{See also|Hindu_pilgrimage_sites_in_India|l1=Hindu Pilgrimage sites|Pilgrimage#Hinduism|l2=Pilgrimage in Hinduism|Yatra|Tirtha and Kshetra}}
[[File:Kedarnathroute.jpg|x216px|thumb|right| Pilgrimage to [[Kedarnath]]]]

Following pilgrimage sites are most famous amongst Hindu devotees:

'''Char Dham (Famous Four Pilgrimage sites):''' The four holy sites [[Puri]], [[Rameswaram]], [[Dwarka]], and [[Badrinath]] (or alternatively the [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]]) compose the ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. 

'''Kumbh Mela:''' The ''[[Kumbh Mela]]'' (the &quot;pitcher festival&quot;) is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every 12 years; the location is rotated among [[Allahabad]], [[Haridwar]], [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. 

'''Old Holy cities as per Puranic Texts:''' [[Varanasi]] formerly known as Kashi, [[Allahabad]] formerly known as Prayag, [[Haridwar]]-[[Rishikesh]], [[Mathura]]-[[Vrindavan]], and [[Ayodhya]]. 

'''Major Temple cities:''' [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple; Three comparatively recent temples of fame and huge pilgrimage are  [[Shirdi]], home to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]], [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Sabarimala]],where [[Swami Ayyappan]] is worshipped. 

'''Shakti Peethas:''' Another important set of pilgrimages are the ''[[Shakti Peethas]]'', where [[Shakti|the Mother Goddess]] is worshipped, the two principal ones being ''[[Kalighat]]'' and ''[[Kamakhya]]''.

While there are different yet similar pilgrimage routes in different parts of India, all are respected equally well, according to the universality of Hinduism.

[[Pilgrimage]] is not mandatory in Hinduism, though many adherents undertake them.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
{{Main|Hindu festivals}}
[[Image:Deepawali-festival.jpg|thumb|300px|right|text|The festival of lights- [[Diwali]], is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.]]
Hindu festivals ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Utsava''; literally: &quot;to lift higher&quot;) are considered as symbolic rituals that beautifully weave individual and social life to [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?ei=NfLTTerKOcnVrQel9smeCQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=s2dDAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Hindus+observe+sacred+occasions+by+festive+observances&amp;q=Festivals#search_anchor Hindu culture, custom, and ceremony], p195, Brojendra Nath Banerjee, Agam, 1978, 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism has many festivals throughout the year. The [[Hindu calendar]] usually prescribe their dates. 

The festivals typically celebrate events from Hindu mythology, often coinciding with seasonal changes. There are festivals which are primarily celebrated by specific sects or in certain regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==Scriptures==

In post-Vedic and current Hindu belief, most Hindu scriptures are not typically interpreted literally. More importance is attached to the ethics and metaphorical meanings derived from them.&lt;ref name=nikhilupa3to8/&gt; Most sacred texts are in [[Sanskrit]]. The texts are classified into two classes: ''Shruti'' and ''Smriti''.

While many Hindus revere the [[Vedas]] as eternal truths revealed to ancient sages (''[[rishi|{{IAST|Ṛṣi}}]]s''),&lt;ref name=vivekIII118/&gt; some devotees do not associate the creation of the Vedas with a god or person. They are thought of as the laws of the spiritual world, which would still exist even if they were not revealed to the sages.&lt;ref name=vivekI6/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Nyaya-Vaisheshika believe that the Vedas were created by God, not eternal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are four ''Vedas'' (called ''{{IAST|Ṛg}}-, Sāma-, Yajus- ''and ''Atharva-''). The ''[[Rigveda]]'' is the first and most important Veda.&lt;ref&gt;Rigveda is not only the oldest among the vedas, but is one of the earliest [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] texts.&lt;/ref&gt; Each Veda is divided into four parts: the primary one, the ''Veda proper'', being the ''[[Samhitapatha|{{IAST|Saṃhitā}}]]'', which contains sacred ''mantras''. The other three parts form a three-tier ensemble of commentaries, usually in prose and are believed to be slightly later in age than the ''{{IAST|Saṃhitā}}''. These are: the ''[[Brahmana|{{IAST|Brāhmaṇas}}]]'', ''[[Aranyaka|{{IAST|Āraṇyakas}}]]'', and the ''[[Upanishad]]s''. The first two parts were subsequently called the ''{{IAST|Karmakāṇḍa}}'' (ritualistic portion), while the last two form the ''{{IAST|Jñānakāṇḍa}}'' (knowledge portion).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shivananda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlshq.org/religions/vedas.htm|title=Swami Shivananda's mission|accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the ''Vedas'' focus on rituals, the ''Upanishads'' focus on spiritual insight and philosophical teachings, and discuss [[Brahman]] and [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name=nikhilupa3to8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werner|1994|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|1974|pp=25–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known shloka from [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] is:

&lt;poem&gt;::ॐ असतो मा सद्गमय । तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय ।।
::मृत्योर्मामृतं गमय । ॐ शान्ति शान्ति शान्ति ।।
– बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद् 1.3.28.
&lt;/poem&gt;
'''[[IAST]]''':

&lt;poem&gt;:om asato mā sadgamaya | tamaso mā jyotirgamaya ||
:mṛtyor mā amṛtaṁ gamaya | om śānti śānti śānti ||
– bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣada 1.3.28
&lt;/poem&gt;
'''Translation''':
&lt;poem&gt;:Lead Us From the Unreal To the Real | 
:Lead Us From Darkness To Light ||
:Lead Us From Death To Immortality |
:[[OM]] Let There Be Peace Peace Peace.||
– Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.28.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Smritis===
[[Image:Bhagavad Gita, a 19th century manuscript.jpg|x216px|thumb|right|Bhagavad Gita, a 19th-century manuscript]]
Hindu texts other than the ''Shrutis'' are collectively called the ''Smritis'' (memory).  The most notable of the smritis are the [[Indian epic poetry|epics]], which consist of the ''[[Mahabharata|{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana|{{IAST|Rāmāyaṇa}}]]''. The [[Bhagavad Gita|''{{Unicode|Bhagavad Gītā}}'']] is an integral part of the ''Mahabharata'' and one of the most popular sacred texts of Hinduism. It contains philosophical teachings from ''Krishna'', an incarnation of ''Vishnu'', told to the prince [[Arjuna]] on the eve of a great war. The ''{{Unicode|Bhagavad Gītā}}'', spoken by [[Krishna]], is described as the essence of the ''Vedas.''&lt;ref&gt;''{{Unicode|Sarvopaniṣado}} gāvo,'' etc. (''Gītā Māhātmya'' 6). ''Gītā Dhyānam'', ''cited in'' Introduction to [http://www.bhagavadgitaasitis.com/introduction/en Bhagavad-gītā As It Is].&lt;/ref&gt; However Gita, sometimes called ''Gitopanishad'', is more often placed in the [[Shruti]], category, being Upanishadic in content.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Coburn, ''Scripture&quot; in India: Towards a Typology of the Word in Hindu Life'', [[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]], Vol. 52, No. '''3''' (September, 1984), pp. 435-459&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Purana|{{Unicode|Purāṇa}}]]s'', which illustrate Hindu ideas through vivid narratives come under smritis. Other texts include ''[[Devi Mahatmya|{{IAST|Devī Mahātmya}}]]'', the ''[[Tantras]]'', the ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'', ''[[Tirumantiram]]'', ''[[Shiva Sutras]]'' and the ''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Hindu {{Unicode|Āgamas}}]]''. A more controversial text, the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', is a prescriptive lawbook which lays the societal codes of social stratification which later evolved into the [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sawant| first = Ankush| title = Manu-smriti and Republic of Plato: a comparative and critical study| publisher = Himalaya Pub.

A well known [[verse (poetry)|verse]] from [[Bhagavad Gita]] describing a concept in [[Karma Yoga]] is explained as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Radhakrishnan|1993}}, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=a-Oh_-rK5SQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Bhagavadg%C4%ABt%C4%81&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ba8UTrSDIcasrAf0q7GHBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQuwUwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22%28karma-phala%29%3A%22%20you%20have&amp;f=false The Bhagavad Gita], Eknath Easwaran, Edition 2, Nilgiri Press, 2007, ISBN 1-58638-019-2, ISBN 978-1-58638-019-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order of precedence of authority===
The order of precedence regarding authority of Vedic Scriptures is as follows,
* '''Śruti''', literally &quot;hearing, listening&quot;, are the [[sacred text]]s comprising the central canon of Hinduism and is one of the three main sources of [[dharma]] and therefore is also influential within [[Hindu Law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439&quot;&gt;Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Smṛti''', literally &quot;that which is remembered (or recollected)&quot;, refers to a specific body of Hindu [[religion|religious]] [[scripture]], and is a codified component of Hindu [[Custom (law)|customary law]].  Post Vedic scriptures such as [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] and traditions of the rules on dharma such as Manu Smriti and Yaagnyavalkya Smriti. Smrti also denotes tradition in the sense that it portrays the traditions of the rules on dharma, especially those of lawful virtuous persons.)
* '''Purāṇa''', literally &quot;of ancient times&quot;, are post-vedic scriptures notably consisting of narratives of the history of the universe from creation to destruction, genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, and descriptions of Hindu cosmology, philosophy, and geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/index.htm#puranas Puranas at Sacred Texts]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Śiṣṭāchāra''', literally &quot;that which is followed by good (in recent times)&quot;.
* '''Atmatuṣṭi''', literally &quot;that which satisfies oneself (or self validation)&quot;, according to which one has to decide whether or not to do with ''bona fide''. Initially this was not considered in the order of precedence but [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] and [[Yājñavalkya]] considered it as last one.

That means, if anyone of them contradicts the preceding one then it disqualified as an authority. There is a well known Indian saying that ''Smṛti follows Śruti''. So it was considered that in order to establish any theistic philosophical theory (Astika Siddhanta) one ought not contradict Śruti (Vedas).

Adi Sankara has chosen three standards and named as ''Prasthānatrayī'', literally, ''three points of departure (three standards)''. Later these were referred to as the three canonical texts of reference of [[Hindu philosophy]] by other [[Vedanta]] schools. 

They are:
#The '''[[Upanishads]]''', known as ''Upadesha prasthāna'' (injunctive texts), (part of ''Śruti'')
#The '''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''', known as ''Sādhana prasthāna'' (practical text), (part of ''Smṛti'')
#The '''[[Brahma Sutras]]''', known as ''Nyāya prasthāna'' or ''Yukti prasthana'' (part of ''darśana of [[Uttarā Mīmāṃsā]]'')
The Upanishads consist of twelve or thirteen [[mukhya|major]] texts, with many minor texts. The {{IAST|[[Bhagavad Gītā]]}} is part of the {{IAST|[[Mahabhārata]]}}.The {{IAST|[[Brahma Sutra|Brahma Sūtra]]s}} (also known as the ''{{IAST|Vedānta Sūtras}}''), systematise the doctrines taught in the Upanishads and the {{IAST|Gītā}}.

{{Hinduism by country}}
Hinduism is a major religion in India and, according to a 2001 census, Hinduism was followed by around 80.5% of the country's population of 1.21 billion (2012 estimate) (960 million adherents).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html CIA-The world factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Hinduism by country|significant populations]] are found in [[Nepal]] (23 million), [[Bangladesh]] (15 million) and the [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Indonesia]]n island of [[Bali]] (3.3 million).

===Denominations===
{{Main|Hindu denominations}}

Hinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many practising Hindus do not claim to belong to any particular denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werner|1994|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academics categorize contemporary Hinduism into four major denominations: [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Smartism]]. The denominations differ primarily in the god worshipped as the Supreme One and in the traditions that accompany worship of that god.

[[Vaishnavas]] worship ''[[Vishnu]]'' as the supreme God; [[Shaivites]] worship ''[[Shiva]]'' as the supreme; [[Shaktas]] worship ''[[Shakti]]'' (power) personified through a female divinity or [[Mother Goddess]], ''[[Devi]]''; while [[Smartas]] believe in the essential oneness of five ([[panchadeva]]) or six ([[Shanmata]], as [[Tamil people|Tamil]] Hindus add [[Murugan|Skanda]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailerindia.com/god/hindu/index.php?skanda Hindu Way of Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; deities as personifications of the Supreme.

The Western conception of what Hinduism is has been defined by the Smarta view; many Hindus, who may not understand or follow [[Advaita]] philosophy, in contemporary Hinduism, invariably follow the Shanmata belief worshiping many forms of God. One commentator, noting the influence of the Smarta tradition, remarked that although many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to [[Advaita Vedanta]] as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hinduism.iskcon.com/tradition/1204.htm Heart of Hinduism: The Smarta Tradition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mother Temple of Besakih.jpg|thumb|The [[Mother Temple of Besakih]] in [[Bali]], [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Indonesia]].]]
Other denominations like [[Ganapatya]] (the cult of ''[[Ganesha]]'') and [[Saura (Hinduism)|Saura]] ([[Surya|Sun]] worship) are not so widespread.

There are movements that are not easily placed in any of the above categories, such as Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]]'s ''[[Arya Samaj]]'', which rejects image worship and veneration of multiple deities. It focuses on the ''Vedas'' and the Vedic fire sacrifices (''[[yajna|{{IAST|yajña}}]]'').

The [[Tantra|Tantric traditions]] have various sects, as Banerji observes:
{{quote|Tantras are&amp;nbsp;... also divided as ''[[Astika|āstika]]'' or Vedic and ''[[nastika|nāstika]]'' or non-Vedic. In accordance with the predominance of the deity the ''āstika'' works are again divided as Śākta (Shakta), Śaiva (Shaiva), Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava (Vaishnava).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Banerji|1992|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Ashramas===
{{Main|Ashrama}}
[[Image:Balmiki.jpg|thumb|right|x162px| text|A Balmiki Ashram]]
Traditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four ''{{Unicode|Āshrama}}s'' (phases or stages; unrelated meanings include monastery). The first part of one's life, ''[[Brahmacharya]],'' the stage as a student, is spent in celibate, controlled, sober and pure contemplation under the guidance of a [[Guru]], building up the mind for spiritual knowledge. ''[[Grihastha]]'' is the householder's stage, in which one marries and satisfies ''[[Kama (Purusharthas)|{{Unicode|kāma}}]]'' and ''artha'' in one's married and professional life respectively (see the [[Hinduism#Objectives of human life|goals of life]]). The moral obligations of a Hindu householder include supporting one's parents, children, guests and holy figures. ''[[Vanaprastha|{{Unicode|Vānaprastha}}]],'' the retirement stage, is gradual detachment from the material world. This may involve giving over duties to one's children, spending more time in religious practices and embarking on holy pilgrimages. Finally, in ''[[Sannyasa|{{Unicode|Sannyāsa}}]]'', the stage of [[asceticism]], one renounces all worldly attachments to secludedly find the Divine through detachment from worldly life and peacefully shed the body for [[Moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;S.S. Rama Rao Pappu, &quot;Hindu Ethics&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Rinehart|2004|pp=165–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monasticism===
{{Main|Sannyasa}}
[[Image:Indian sadhu performing namaste.jpg|thumb|250px|right text|A sadhu in [[Madurai]], India.]]
Some Hindus choose to live a [[monastic]] life (Sannyāsa) in pursuit of [[moksha|liberation]] or another form of spiritual perfection. Monastics commit themselves to a life of simplicity, [[celibacy]], detachment from worldly pursuits, and the contemplation of God.&lt;ref name=bhaskaranandaessential112&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaskarananda|1994|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Hindu monk is called a ''sanyāsī, [[sadhu|sādhu]]'', or ''[[swami|swāmi]]''. A female renunciate is called a ''sanyāsini''. Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because their outward renunciation of selfishness and worldliness serves as an inspiration to householders who strive for ''mental'' renunciation. Some monastics live in monasteries, while others wander from place to place, trusting in God alone to provide for their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a highly meritorious act for a householder to provide sādhus with food or other necessaries. Sādhus strive to treat all with respect and compassion, whether a person may be poor or rich, good or wicked, and to be indifferent to praise, blame, pleasure, and pain.&lt;ref name=bhaskaranandaessential112/&gt;

===Varnas===
{{Main|Varna in Hinduism}}

Hindu society has traditionally been categorized into four classes, called ''Varnas'' (''Sanskrit'': &quot;colour, form, appearance&quot;):&lt;ref name=&quot;MW Sanskrit dict.&quot;/&gt;

*the ''[[Brahmin]]s'': teachers and priests;
*the ''[[Kshatriya]]s'': warriors, nobles, and kings;
*the ''[[Vaishya]]s'': farmers, merchants, and businessmen; and
*the ''[[Shudra]]s'': servants and labourers.

Hindus and scholars debate whether the so-called ''[[Caste system in India|caste system]]'' is an integral part of Hinduism sanctioned by the scriptures or an outdated social custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|pp=188–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the scriptures, the ''Varna'' system is mentioned sparingly and descriptively (i.e., not [[prescriptive]]); apart from a single mention in the late Rigvedic ''[[Purusha sukta]]'', the rigid division into ''varnas'' appears to be post-Vedic, appearing in classical texts from the [[Maurya period]].
The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' ([http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/4/en1 4.13]) states that the four ''{{IAST|varṇa}}'' divisions are created by God, and the ''[[Manusmriti|{{Unicode|Manusmṛiti}}]]'' categorizes the different castes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergen.edu/phr/121/ManuGC.pdf Manu Smriti Laws of Manu] 1.87-1.91&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, the ''Gītā'' says that one's ''{{Unicode|varṇa}}'' is to be understood from one's personal qualities and one's work, not one's birth.&lt;ref&gt;

This view is supported by records of sages who became Brahmins. For example, the sage ''[[Vishwamitra|{{IAST|Vishvāmitra}}]]'' was a king of the ''[[Kshatriya|{{Unicode|Kṣhatriya}}]]'' caste, and only later became recognized as a great Brahmin sage, indicating that his caste was not determined by birth. Similarly, ''[[Valmiki|{{Unicode|Vālmiki}}]]'', once a low-caste robber, ''became'' a sage.
&lt;/ref&gt; Some mobility and flexibility within the varnas challenge allegations of social discrimination in the caste system, as has been pointed out by several sociologists,&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverberg Paper&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Silverberg|1969|pp=442–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smelser|Lipset|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some other scholars disagree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|name=The Illustrated World's Religions|first=Huston|last=Smith|year=1994|authorlink=Huston Smith|publisher=HarperCollins|location=[[New York, New York]], USA|chapter=Hinduism: The Stations of Life|isbn=0-06-067440-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many social reformers, including [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[B. R. Ambedkar]], criticized caste discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Elenanor Zelliot, &quot;Caste in Contemporary India&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Rinehart|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious teacher [[Sri Ramakrishna]] (1836–1886) taught that
{{quote|Lovers of God do not belong to any caste&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. . A brahmin without this love is no longer a brahmin. And a pariah with the love of God is no longer a pariah. Through [[bhakti]] (devotion to God) an untouchable becomes pure and elevated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nikhilananda|1992|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahimsa, vegetarianism and other food customs===
{{Main|Ahimsa|Vegetarianism and religion|Cattle in Religion}}
Hindus advocate the practice of ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' (non-violence) and respect for all life because divinity is believed to permeate all beings, including plants and non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams, ''Religious Thought and Life in India'' (New Delhi, 1974 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' appears in the [[Upanishad]]s,&lt;ref name= &quot;Radhakrishnan&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Radhakrishnan |first=S |authorlink=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan |title=Indian Philosophy, Volume 1|edition=2nd |series=Muirhead library of philosophy |date= |year=1929 |publisher= George Allen and Unwin Ltd. |location=London|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; the epic Mahabharata&lt;ref&gt;For ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'' as one of the &quot;emerging ethical and religious issues&quot; in the {{IAST|Mahābhārata}} see: Brockington, John, &quot;The Sanskrit Epics&quot;, in Flood (2003), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{IAST|Ahiṃsā}}'' is the first of the five ''Yamas'' (vows of self-restraint) in [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Patanjali's Yoga Sutras]].&lt;ref&gt;For text of Y.S. 2.29 and translation of ''{{IAST|yama}}'' as &quot;vow of self-restraint&quot;, see: {{Citation |series= |last=Taimni |first=I.

In accordance with ''{{IAST|ahiṃsā}}'', many Hindus embrace [[vegetarianism]] to respect higher forms of life.  Estimates of the number of [[lacto vegetarian]]s in India (includes adherents of all religions) vary between 20% and 42%.&lt;ref name = &quot;veg&quot;&gt;Surveys studying food habits of Indians include: [http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6170E/x6170e09.htm#TopOfPage &quot;Diary and poultry sector growth in India&quot;], [http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/highlights/2001/india.pdf &quot;Indian consumer patterns&quot;] and [http://www.ers.usda.gov/amberwaves/February04/Features/ElephantJogs.htm &quot;Agri reform in India&quot;]. Results indicate that Indians who eat meat do so infrequently with less than 30% consuming non-vegetarian foods regularly, although the reasons may be economical.&lt;/ref&gt; The food habits vary with the community and region, for example some castes having fewer vegetarians and coastal populations relying on seafood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from [[beef]]. The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure,&lt;ref&gt;Walker 1968:257&lt;/ref&gt; and Hindu society honours the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving.&lt;ref&gt;Richman 1988:272&lt;/ref&gt; Cow-slaughter is legally banned in almost all states of India.&lt;ref name=beef_without_borders&gt;{{cite news | first = R. | last = Krishnakumar | title = Beef without borders | url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2018/stories/20030912004703100.htm | work = Frontline | publisher = Narasimhan Ram|date = August 30-September 12, 2003 | accessdate = 2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many Hindu groups that have continued to abide by a strict vegetarian diet in modern times. One example is the movement known as [[ISKCON]] (International Society for Krishna Consciousness), whose followers “not only abstain from meat, fish, and fowl, but also avoid certain vegetables that are thought to have negative properties, such as onion and garlic.”&lt;ref name=Vasudha&gt;Narayanan, Vasudha. “The Hindu Tradition”. In A Concise Introduction to World Religions, ed. Willard G. Oxtoby and Alan F. Segal. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A second example is the [[Swaminarayan]] Movement. The followers of this Hindu group also staunchly adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat, eggs, and seafood.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism. 1st. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 159&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rajasthanthali.jpg|thumb|right| 180px|Rajasthani thali.]]
Vegetarianism is propagated by the [[Yajur Veda]] and it is recommended for a ''[[sattva|satvic]]'' (purifying) lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1843032953&quot;&gt;{{Citation | author=Michael Keene | title=Religion in Life and Society | publisher=Folens Limited | location= | year=2002 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=I4AVbUIIygQC&amp;pg=PA122 | isbn=978-1-84303-295-3 | page=122 |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, another reason that dietary purity is so eminent within Hinduism is because “the idea that food reflects the general qualities of nature: purity, energy, inertia” It follows, then, that a healthy diet should be one that promotes purity within an individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasudha&quot;/&gt;

Based on this reasoning, Hindus should avoid or minimize the intake of foods that do not promote purity. These foods include onion and garlic, which are regarded as rajasic (a state which is characterized by “tension and overbearing demeanor”) foods, and meat, which is regarded as tamasic (a state which is characterized by “anger, greed, and jealousy”).&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Steven.
