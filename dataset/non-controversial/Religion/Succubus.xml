[[File:Succubus bracket 02.jpg|thumb|right|A 16th Century sculpture representing a succubus.]]

In folklore traced back to medieval legend, a '''succubus''' (plural '''succubi''') is a female [[demon]] or supernatural being appearing in dreams, who takes the form of a human woman in order to seduce men, usually through [[sexual intercourse]]. The male counterpart is the [[incubus]]. Religious traditions hold that repeated intercourse with a succubus may result in the deterioration of health or even death. 

In modern fictional representations, a succubus may or may not appear in dreams and is often depicted as a highly attractive [[seductress]] or [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]]; whereas, in the past, succubi were generally depicted as frightening and demonic.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''succuba'' &quot;strumpet&quot; (from ''succubare'' &quot;to lie under&quot;, from ''sub-'' &quot;under&quot; and ''cubare'' &quot;to lie&quot;), used to describe the supernatural being as well. The word is first attested from 1387.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=succubus |title= succubus |publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary |first= Douglas |last= Harper |authorlink= Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore==
According to [[Zohar]] and the [[Alphabet of Ben Sira]], [[Lilith]] was [[Adam]]'s first wife who later became a succubus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishchristianlit.com/Topics/Lilith/alphabet.html The Story of Lilith]&lt;/ref&gt; She left Adam and refused to return to the [[Garden of Eden]] after she mated with [[archangel]] [[Samael]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://istina.rin.ru/eng/ufo/text/663.html Samael &amp; Lilith]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zohar]]istic [[Kabbalah]], there were four succubi who mated with [[archangel]] [[Samael]]. They were four original queens of the demons [[Lilith]], [[Agrat Bat Mahlat]], [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]], and [[Eisheth Zenunim]]. Succubi may take a form of a beautiful young girl but closer inspection may reveal deformities such as having bird-like claws or serpentine tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Jane P.|title=Early modern supernatural : the dark side of European culture, 1400-1700|year=2012|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780313393433|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the act of sexually penetrating a succubus is akin to entering a cavern of ice. There are also reports of succubi forcing men to perform [[cunnilingus]] on their vaginas that drip with urine and other fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guiley|first=Rosemary Ellen|title=The encyclopedia of witches, witchcraft and wicca|year=2008|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=9781438126845|pages=95|edition=3rd ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later [[folklore]], a succubus took the form of a [[siren]].

Throughout history, [[priests]] and [[rabbis]] including [[Hanina Ben Dosa]] and [[Abaye]], tried to curb the power of succubi over humans.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Dennis, The encyclopedia of Jewish myth, magic and mysticism. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all succubi were malevolent. According to [[Walter Mapes]] in ''[[De Nugis Curialium]]'' (''Trifles of Courtiers''), [[Pope Sylvester II]] (999–1003) was involved with a succubus named '''Meridiana''', who helped him achieve his high rank in the [[Catholic Church]]. Before his death, he confessed of his sins and died repentant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyodine.com/succubus/History.htm History of the Succubus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ability to reproduce==
According to the [[Kabbalah]] and the school of [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Rashba]], the original three queens of the demons, [[Agrat Bat Mahlat]], [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]], [[Eisheth Zenunim]], and all their cohorts give birth to children, except [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilithgallery.com/library/lilith/Queen-of-the-Demons.html Alan Humm, Kabbala: Lilith, Queen of the Demons]&lt;/ref&gt; According to other [[legend]]s, the children of [[Lilith]] are called [[Lilin]].

According to the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', or &quot;Witches' Hammer&quot;, written by [[Heinrich Kramer]] (Insitoris) in 1486, a succubus collects semen from the men she seduces. The incubi or male demons then use the semen to impregnate human females,&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator&amp;nbsp;– 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum'', Part2, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/mm02b08a.htm Chapter VIII], &quot;Certain Remedies prescribed against those Dark and Horrid Harms with which Devils may Afflict Men,&quot; at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; thus explaining how demons could apparently sire children despite the traditional belief that they were incapable of reproduction. Children so begotten&amp;nbsp;– [[cambion]]s&amp;nbsp;– were supposed to be those that were born deformed, or more susceptible to supernatural influences.&lt;ref name = &quot;AZ&quot;&gt;Lewis, James R., Oliver, Evelyn Dorothy, Sisung Kelle S. (Editor) (1996), ''Angels A to Z'', Entry: '''Incubi and Succubi''', pp. 218, 219, Visible Ink Press, ISBN 0-7876-0652-9,Till date, most Africa belief has it that men that have similar experience with such principality (succubus) in dreams (usually in form of a pretty lady) find themselves exhausted as soon as they wake up, and often ascribing spiritual attack to them. Again, rituals/divination are often resulted to with a view to appeasing the god for divine protection and intervention, while the christian folks direct their intervention to God through either fasting and prayer or going for anointing and deliverance (I.E. Bello)&lt;/ref&gt; The book does not address why a human female impregnated with the [[semen]] of a human male would not produce a regular human offspring. But in some Viking lore the child is born deformed because the conception was unnatural.

==Possible explanation for alleged encounters with succubi==
In the field of [[medicine]], there is some belief that the stories relating to encounters with succubi bear similar resemblance to the contemporary phenomenon of people reporting [[alien abduction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight-Jadczyk|first=Laura|title=The high strangeness of dimensions, densities, and the process of alien abduction|year=2005|location=[S.l.] : Red Pill Press|isbn=9781897244111|pages=92|coauthors=Henri Sy|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been ascribed to the condition known as [[sleep paralysis]]. It is therefore suggested that historical accounts of people experiencing encounters with succubi may rather have been symptoms of sleep paralysis, with the hallucination of the said creatures coming from their contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepdic.com/sleepparalysis.html |title= Sleep Paralysis|publisher = The Skeptics Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trionica.com/asp/phenomena/index.htm |title= Phenomena of Awareness during Sleep Paralysis|publisher = Trionic Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qarinah==
In [[Arab]]ic superstition, the '''qarînah''' ({{lang|ar|قرينه}}) is a spirit similar to the succubus, with origins possibly in ancient Egyptian religion or in the [[animism|animistic]] beliefs of [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] (see [[Arabian mythology]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwemer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.answering-islam.org/Books/Zwemer/Studies/chap5.htm |first= Samuel M. |last= Zwemer |authorlink= Samuel Marinus Zwemer |title= Studies in Popular Islam: Collection of Papers dealing with the Superstitions and Beliefs of the Common People |location= London |publisher= Sheldon Press |year= 1939 |chapter= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A qarînah &quot;sleeps with the person and has relations during sleep as is known by the dreams.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= A. J. N. |last= Tremearne |title= Ban of the Bori: Demons and Demon-Dancing in West and North Africa }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to be invisible, but a person with &quot;[[second sight]]&quot; can see them, often in the form of a cat, dog, or other household pet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwemer&quot; /&gt; &quot;In Omdurman it is a spirit which possesses. ... Only certain people are possessed and such people cannot marry or the qarina will harm them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= J. Spencer |last= Trimingham |authorlink= J. Spencer Trimingham |title= Islam in the Sudan |location= London |publisher= Frank Cass &amp; Co. Ltd. |year= 1965 |page= 172 }}Till date, most Africa belief has it that men that have similar experience with such principality (succubus) in dreams (usually in form of a pretty lady) find themselves exhausted as soon as they wake up, and often ascribing spiritual attack to them.

Bello)&lt;/ref&gt;

In India the Succubus is referred to as the seductress &quot;Mohini&quot;.
Not to be confused with the mythological &quot;Mohini&quot; - who is depicted to be the slayer of Bhasma Asura.
Succubi is described as a lone lady draped in a White Saree (Indian traditional women costume), with untied long hair. She generally is said to haunt lonely paths or roads.
She is said to have died from torment by the male and thus would seek revenge on any male.

==Succubi in fiction==
{{main|Succubi in fiction}}
Throughout history, succubi have been popular characters in music, literature, film, television, and especially as video game and [[anime]] characters.
In the manga/anime ''[[Rosario + Vampire]]'' the character [[Kurumu Kurono]] is a succubus.
In the game ''[[Darkstalkers]]'', [[Morrigan Aensland]] and [[Lilith Aensland]] are succubi.
