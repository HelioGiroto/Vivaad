The term '''involution''' refers to different things depending on the writer. In some instances it refers to a process that occurs prior to evolution and gives rise to the [[cosmos]], in others an aspect of [[evolution]], and still others a process that follows the completion of evolution in the human form.

==Involution according to Esoteric cosmology==
In [[Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]] and [[Rosicrucianism]], involution and evolution are part of a complex sequence of [[Esoteric cosmology|cosmic cycles]], called [[Round (Theosophy)|Round]].  When the universe attains a stage of sufficient density, the individual spirit is able to descend and participate in the evolution.  Involution thus refers to the incarnation of [[spirit]] in an already established [[matter]], the necessary prerequiste of evolution:

:''As an example, the so-called descent of the Monad into matter means an involution or involving or infolding of spiritual potencies into material vehicles which coincidentally and contemporaneously, through the compelling urge of the infolding energies, unfold their own latent capacities, unwrap them, roll them forth; and this is the evolution of matter.'' â€“ [[Gottfried de Purucker]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried de Purucker]], ''Occult Glossary'', TUP, 2nd ed., 1996 [http://davidpratt.info/cyclicevo.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

That period of time devoted to the attainment of [[self (philosophy)|self]]-[[consciousness]] and the building of the [[Subtle body|vehicles]] through which the spirit in man manifests, is called ''involution''. Its purpose is to slowly carry life lower and deeper into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, till the nadir of materiality is reached. From that point, life begins to ascend into [[Plane (cosmology)|higher Worlds]]. This succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops ''[[self-consciousness]]'' into ''[[divinity|divine]] [[omniscience]]'', is called &quot;[[spiritual evolution]].&quot;

In the [[cosmology]] of [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]], involution and [[evolution]] apply to both the [[macrocosm]], the whole of creation, and the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], the constitution of an individual soul.

''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'', a Rosicrucian text written by [[Max Heindel]], advances the concept of [[Spiritual evolution|epigenesis]] as the ''key'' related to the evolution (after an ''involutionary'' period) of human beings.

==Involution according to Sri Aurobindo==
===Introduction===
{{Sri Aurobindo}}
For [[Sri Aurobindo]], involution is the process by which the Omnipresent Reality, i.e. the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[Brahman]] extends Itself to create a universe of separate forms from out of Its own Force/Energy.

''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]'', ''[[Cit (consciousness)|Chit]]-[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'', and [[Delight]]/''[[Ananda]]'' are the three aspects of ''[[Satchitananda]]'', and are mentioned  in terms of Involution . Spirit or consciousness manifests as these three, and then as the intermediate link of Supermind, which is transitional between the higher and lower (matter, life, and mind) nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''The Life Divine'', Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, 10th ed. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for involution is Delight  - the Delight of Being (the Spirit or Absolute) moving to Delight of Becoming (temporal existence, the cosmos). Being throws itself forward into a multiplicity of forms, becoming lost in the inconscience of matter,&lt;ref&gt;''The Life Divine'' Bk I, Ch.11-12&lt;/ref&gt; and then through evolution it partakes in the Delight of rediscovering the Spirit which had been hidden in the interim.

Evolution is thus the movement forward by which the created universe evolves from its initial state of inconscience (i.e. as matter), evolves animated life forms and mental beings (i.e. humans), and continues to evolve spiritual properties, and in that process rediscovers its Source. Such an Evolution of animated forms is only possible because at each stage of development, the developing entity contains within itself the conception of what it may become. Thus, the evolution of animated life out of matter supposes a previous involution of that animated capacity. This is akin to a seed that already has the essence of the tree that will emerge from it.

Each plane emerges from an earlier plane through the evolutionary process, which takes place in chronological time. But in a parallel construction, each of these new planes can be understood as being a descendent of its corresponding higher order plane from the Infinite. Thus, when mentality emerged in the universe, the universal plane of Mind was implanted  to a degree in those beings harboring that mentality.

The evolution is the development of all entities in the [[cosmos]], including [[humans]], in order to attain their fulfillment, including the discovery of spiritual Delight, which was, and always is, the experience of the Source Creator. The evolution is the progressive development from the original inconscience of matter into life (movement, sensation, desire, etc. and living physical beings), and from thence to [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|mind]] (in conscious animals and most especially humans - the self-conscious thinking animal), and from thence to spiritualized mind, culminating in the [[The Supermind]]  or Truth Consciousness (as supramental individuals, and finally the  supramental, i.e. a divine life on earth.) &lt;ref&gt;''The Life Divine'' bk II, ch.27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sat===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}We cannot speak of Sat without Chit Ananda or Being, Consciousness and Bliss.  They represent a totality.  Sat is the vital state of that which is was and always will be.  In a sense it is a beginnining but because it is pregnant with possibility it is inexorably tied to Ananda or the recognition of Being and then the subsequent realization of bliss which is divine inner knowing.  Each flows out of the other and then back again.  It could be said that Sat only exists through Ananda or Consciousness however, these levels of differentiation cannot grasp the true nature of either of these three qualities since they are interdependent.

===''Chit-tapas''===
''Chit-Tapas'' or Consciousness-Force, in [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s philosophy refers to the pure energy of [[Consciousness]] by which creation ultimately comes about; the infinite divine self-awareness which is also the infinite all-effective Will. It is also one of the seven [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]] of existence, according to the [[Vedas|Vedic]] [[cosmology]] and the seven [[loka]]s of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] thought.

In chapter 10 of ''[[The Life Divine]]'', Sri Aurobindo writes at length on the nature of Consciousness-Force as a principle of the Divine.  As he understands it (following the [[Tantra|Tantric]] dichotomy of Shiva and Shakti), ''Chit'' or Consciousness is not an inert and passive principle; but contains the potential spiritual Energy, ''[[Tapas]]'', which in Creation becomes the dynamic and creative principle or Force, called ''[[Shakti]]''. ''Chit-Tapas'' or ''Chit-Shakti'' is therefore the universal Consciousness-Force, the divine Energy; the [[Divine Mother|Mother]].

===Delight===
Delight is [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s term for [[ananda]], and plays a large part in his [[Esoteric cosmology|cosmology]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] teaching. Delight is the reason for creation, by which [[The Absolute]] extends its Delight of Being into multiplicity, losing itself in the [[Inconscient|inconscience]] and then through Delight rediscovering Itself through individuals realising their Divine nature and proceeding to spiritual realisation.

In other words, the universe was created so that the Delight of the Infinite Spirit can manifest in all the forms of creation. When we discover our higher nature, the [[Psychic Being|soul]] and [[spirit]], we experience the delight for which we were came into being and of which we are a part.

In chapters 11 and 12 of ''[[The Life Divine]]'', Sri Aurobindo writes at length on the nature of Delight as a principle of the Divine, and its role in creation.

==Meher Baba==
{{Main|Involution (Meher Baba)}}

[[Meher Baba]] uses &quot;involution&quot; in the opposite meaning; rather than the descent of Spirit into matter, he refers to it as meaning  the [[inner path]] of the human soul to the transcendent Self.

==Other Indian interpretations==

For [[Baba Hari Dass]], Evolution is the ''Cause'' of Involution, and vice versa. (Baba Hari Dass is a Maunisadhu monk who practices continual silence.)

== Integral thought ==

In [[integral thought]], involution is the process by which the Divine manifests the [[cosmos]].  The process by which the creation rises to higher states and states of [[consciousness]] is the [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]].  Involution prepares the [[universe]] for the [[Big Bang]]; evolution continues from that point forward.  The term ''involution'' comes from the idea that the divine ''involves'' itself in creation. After the creation, the Divine (i.e. [[the Absolute]], [[Brahman]], [[God]]) is both the [[singular god|One]] (the Creator) and the [[Many]] (that which was created).

The integral philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] refers to involution in his online chapter of ''Kosmic Karma'', employing concepts from [[Plotinus]], [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and Sri Aurobindo.  According to Wilber, the cosmic evolution described in his previous works is preceded by an involution of Spirit into Matter.  This involution follows the reverse stages to the sequence of evolution - e.g. Spirit to soul to mind to life to matter.  Once the stage of insentient, lifeless  matter is attained, then &quot;something like the Big Bang occurs&quot;, whereupon matter and manifest world come into concrete existence, from which stage evolution follows.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken, ''Introduction: From the Great Chain of Being to Postmodernism in Three Easy Steps'', [[Shambhala Publications]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
