No definition of what Process Theology really is.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.66.207.253|173.66.207.253]] ([[User talk:173.66.207.253|talk]]) 01:06, 21 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
May be must we had something about [[Paul Tillich]] Americano-German Lutheran theologian who is more classical theist than the other?&lt;br&gt;
Bye! Mulot &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:143.126.201.200|143.126.201.200]] ([[User talk:143.126.201.200|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/143.126.201.200|contribs]]) 23:52, August 27, 2002  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;

==Critical analysis needed==
Perhaps at some point someone knowledgeable regarding the subject of process theology could provide a section with prominent criticisms of the position;  it is a critical omission in the current article. Ialdabaoth &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Panserbjorn|Panserbjorn]] ([[User talk:Panserbjorn|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panserbjorn|contribs]]) 00:30, December 30, 2005  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;

Well,one criticism is that by positing a God who is not omnipotent nor all-knowing of the future, many people may have a hard time considering such a God as &quot;God.&quot; Some people need God to be able to violate the laws of physics and to be able to &quot;reach in&quot; and intervene to save us in all circumstances - even if nuclear missiles are launched and on their way, etc.  User: BrotherRog, May 27, 2009

:BrotherRog, go get a secondary source for that, an academic speaking like you just said! We can speculate in disadvantages here as much as we will, but not add it to the article unless we have secondary sources. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit. ([[User talk:Rursus|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; background: #FFFF80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;bork&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]!) 15:41, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

==Determinism and reality==
*My question is: how does this current of philosophy deal with theological fatalism (the article is to be found on wiki), that is God (being omniscient: past-present-future) predicts our future deeds (sins to be exact), yet creates us. Now, does process theology claim that God is not fully omniscient (limited to present time) or that there is not such thing as God's punishment (eternal suffering for deeds God made us do by initiating the act of creation with already predicted results) and the universe is made to help God experience Himself through spiritual evolution (of His creation in which He indwells) as He is unable to actually comprehend His greatness (like if there was no evil we could not know what good is) - a panentheistic conception with a dose of Buddhism (which in my oppinion does not &quot;actively&quot; exclude God from it's teachings, simply doesn't mention Him or replaces &quot;God&quot; with &quot;Karmic Law&quot;).

*Also how am I meant to understand this particular paragraph: &quot;Reality is not made up of material substances that endure through time, but serially-ordered events, which are experiential in nature. These events have both a physical and mental aspect.&quot;?

MaybeNextTime &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:83.27.35.208|83.27.35.208]] ([[User talk:83.27.35.208|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/83.27.35.208|contribs]]) 06:26, June 26, 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;

Process theology rejects the possibility of cyclical time (as in Einstein's theory of relativity). There is not a future because everything is in the process of becoming. In other words, Process God-models assert that God is within time and bound by causality. Since it is the nature of the universe to be in flux, there is nothing which is static, not even God. To be static would be to become cosmically dead. To exist is to change and have no certainty as to the future. Process' God-model reflects this and Process theology encourages letting go, since there is nothing one can cling to in a world of change. That is why it is said that material substances do not endure through time, but are instead dependent on what came before and its modifications of what came before and what came before that, and so on.

I think this might also address the question of theological fatalism. Life is in change and we can push it towards greater fulfillment, or it can descend into entropy. God's influence is not coercive (according to Cobb and Griffin's book). God is behind the human impulse to create and grow but does so in subtle ways. As I think you can see from this brief sketch, predestination is not possible. God does remain omniscient, however, in that God is aware of all that is. 

As to God's power, God does have power over all things. It would not make much sense, however, for a creation with no independent initiative and that has been de facto vetoed by God's predetermined vision of reality. God's intervention in creation is therefore supportive of our individual choices, since one cannot love something and not allow a measure of free choice. Otherwise, whatever free will we have is meaningless and we become the battered wife who insists: &quot;But he really does love me.&quot; Yes, he may, but it is a twisted love which is destructive to the seeking of our own wholeness.

Hope this was helpful.  [[User:MerricMaker|MerricMaker]] 17:23, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

Not being extensively knowledgeable about the topic, I would guess that &quot;Reality is not made up of material substances that endure through time, but serially-ordered events, which are experiential in nature. These events have both a physical and mental aspect.&quot; is a reference to a portion of platonic philosophy which says that substance is unchangeable.  Process theology is generally espoused by those opposed to Calvinism and to my understanding Calvinism is largely dependent on platonic philosophy.  Hopefully this helps frame some of the questions about fatalism as well as explaining the quote.

==Another street preachers sermon!==
Examining history I saw the following:
* Mr self-elected street preacher 216.120.170.5 added a long harangue on why he dislikes Process theology [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Process_theology&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=327728593&amp;oldid=323249032 here], using NIV as the source for his statements (violating [[WP:PRIMARY]]),
* Mr 173.76.89.23 (whom I wish to thank very much for doing '''The Only Right Thing''') [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Process_theology&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=327728593 blanked the edits] of 216.120.170.5.
Let me just say that Wikipedia is not a scribble board for the self-elected preacher &lt;s&gt;whether expert or not&lt;/s&gt;, all changes requires secondary supporting sources per [[WP:CITE]], and a street-preacher sermon that concocts arguments pro or con a certain topic is undue synthesis [[WP:SYNTH]] unless '''the entire discourse''' is citeable by an independent reliable secondary source. Once again: thank you 173.76.89.23! I urge all others to do the same thing. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit. ([[User talk:Rursus|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; background: #FFFF80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;bork&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]!) 15:51, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

:Overstroke &quot;whether expert or not&quot;. Street-preachers begone! [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit. ([[User talk:Rursus|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; background: #FFFF80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;bork&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]!) 18:44, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

==Change Needed:==
This sentence needs to be recast: &quot;Process theology is an internally diverse field and while there are general directions that they all take, there are many ongoing debates such as on the nature of God, the relationship of God and the world, immortality, and interreligious dialogue.&quot; [[User:Directspirit|Directspirit]] ([[User talk:Directspirit|talk]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 09:50, 2 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
