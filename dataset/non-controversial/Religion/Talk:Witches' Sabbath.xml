== Sabbath ==
I believe this needs a very visible disambiguation-pointer-link-thingy that redirects the viewer to a Sabbath (Disambiguation) page. It has been remarked that Sabbath is indeed in the Bible as well, and thus the article (which REALLY needs to cite it's sources by the way) could be considered quite confusing. --[[Special:Contributions/24.107.9.33|24.107.9.33]] ([[User talk:24.107.9.33|talk]]) 03:41, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

== Other Talk ==
&quot;It is true that Satanism was and is practised...&quot; That sentence must be removed. Satanism wasn't practiced when the witch-hunts occurred. Giving porridge to fairies, magic or such isn't Satanism. Satanism is a 20th century and later movement. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanis4.htm]  -[[User:Hapsiainen|Hapsiainen]] 18:53, Nov 5, 2004 (UTC)

...and is actually a (anti)-Christian sect characterized by reversal of traditional Christian beliefs and practices, more made up by paranoid Christians than by current practitioners.
: Don't feel like signing your comment? Satanism is Hedonism of either Realtistic or Materialistic approach. --[[Special:Contributions/24.107.9.33|24.107.9.33]] ([[User talk:24.107.9.33|talk]]) 03:41, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
::[[Church of Satan]] are what you both are discussing.  But they're not the only Satanists- see [[Theistic Satanism]].  No doubt a few people have worshipped Satan over the years- there's no limit to what people choose to worship and it's unlikely they only thought of worshipping Satan this century.  The most likely historical example was at the court of King Louis- see [[Poison affair]]. 

&quot;Also involved in the scandal was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye, the eldest living son of a prominent noble family. De Cavoye was disinherited from by his family when, in an act of utter debauchery he choose to celebrate Good Friday with a black mass. Upon being disinherited he opened a lucrative trade in &quot;inheritance powders&quot; and aphrodisiacs.&quot;

So you see he was into sorcery- inheritance powders and so on, so it is perhaps true that he did a black mass.  Of course in most cases of historical Satanism/witchcraft, we have no way of proving how much was made up and how much true.

A bot


Yes, and speaking of proving, it's ridiculous for us to include the claim that &quot;these allogations [sic] have been proved to be untrue&quot; on the basis of the fact that &quot;Margaret Murray, as well as many other witches of the craft, have witnessed countless Withches' [sic] Sabbaths.&quot; What 20th-century participants in a revivalist/reconstructionist movement have witnessed or not witnessed (and I find it very easy to believe that they haven't witnessed the eating of babies or anything like that) has little bearing on the factuality of 16th- and 17th- century reports. Can we delete that paragraph?

== Witchcraft is not about worshiping the devil. ==

You all people are crazy. Us witches do not worship the devil. I worship God, I have been saved, and babtised. I do not follow the devil. Christians have a sabbath. If you would actually read the bible you will see that God says that you should obey the sabbath. So if Christians have a sabbath and so do witches, does that mean that Christians worship the devil too? Think about it.

Lol, true... --[[User:Stikman|Stikman]] 09:50, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

AH! But the Sabbaths described here are defined by those who think so; consequently, the article is not claiming that witches worship Satan, it is claiming that witches have been -called- Satan-worshipers by the opponents of the Witch-Sabbath. If you'd like to clarify the article a bit, then we can all talk here first, to work out the details.--[[Special:Contributions/24.107.9.33|24.107.9.33]] ([[User talk:24.107.9.33|talk]]) 03:46, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
::It's not even claiming that- it's saying that some people have been accused of taking part in the witches sabbath, and '''called'''/accused of being witches.  They most likely usually weren't.  It says nothing about people today who self-identify as witches.

== Binsfeld ==

:''Commentarius de Maleficius'' (1622), by Peter Binsfeld...
This is not good Latin: it should be ''Commentarius de Malefico'' (or perhaps ''-a'' or ''-is''). However, I didn't want to change the text without checking to see what the actual title of the book was first (maybe the error was deliberate or something). So I checked [http://newfirstsearch.oclc.org Worldcat], which is usually an excellent resource for these questions, but I didn't find this book. Binsfeld DID write a ''Commentarius in titulum iuris canonici De simonia'' (which is not about witchcraft), and a ''Tractatus de confessionibus maleficorum et sagarum'' (which is not called &quot;Commentarius&quot;). Am I missing something? --[[User:Iustinus|Iustinus]] 10:56, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==sources==

I have tracked down a few and will find more in the coming days. [[User:Merkinsmum|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF1493&quot;&gt;Merkin's]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  [[User talk:Merkinsmum|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF1493&quot;&gt;mum]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:55, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

== Expansion ==

''[[Thelema|Do what thou wilt]] shall be the whole of the Law.''
If you think that it's advisable to expand the article, I see several ways how this can be done. Most importantly, I believe that a mention about [[ergotism]] (“St. Anthony's Fire”) would be quite relevant here. It is likely that the ergotism epidemic contributed to the formation of the mediaeval beliefs about Sabbats, and I think that it wouldn't be too hard to find references for this in literature in order to provide a source. Next, it would be nice to write explanations for some Sabbatic customs, such as flying on broomsticks and black goats ([[Transvection (flying)]]), “kissing the Devil's arse”, etc. I'm wondering if it wouldn't be out of place to do something like mentioning [[Black Sabbath]] in  “Depictions of witches' sabbaths in various art forms” or mentioning the metal band [[Mercyful Fate]] has a song called “Come to the Sabbath”. It can be worthwhile to mention the modern [[Wicca]]n understanding of Sabbatic celebration[. P.S. Then again, I suppose that the reference at the top of the article is sufficient]. I added a short description of the etymology of “sabbat”, but it's rather poorly written, so perhaps I or somebody else should rewrite it.

== Sabbathkeeping as a Christian practice ==

Recently in this article was posted a section entitled as this one. What I'm worrying about is whether it's a confusion of the legendary Witches' Sabbath with the [[biblical Sabbath]]. A notice at the top of the page probably wouldn't hurt (along the lines of “For the Judeo-Christian Sabbath, see ''Biblical Sabbath''”).
