The '''Gospel According to Mark''' ({{lang-el|κατὰ Μᾶρκον εὐαγγέλιον}}, {{lang|grc|τὸ εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Μᾶρκον}}, ''to euangelion kata Markon''), commonly shortened to the '''Gospel of Mark''' or simply '''Mark''', is the second book of the  [[New Testament]]. This [[Biblical canon|canonical]] account of the life of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] is one of the three [[synoptic gospels]]. It was thought to be an [[epitome]], which accounts for its place as the second gospel in the [[Bible]]. However, most contemporary scholars now regard it as the earliest of the  [[canonical gospel]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;brown164&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown |first=Raymond E. |authorlink=Raymond E. Brown |title=Introduction to the New Testament |year=1997 |publisher=Anchor Bible |location=New York |isbn=0-385-24767-2 |pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''c'' 70).&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; 

The Gospel of Mark narrates the [[Ministry of Jesus]] from his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] by [[John the Baptist]] to his death and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. It focuses particularly on the last week of his life (chapters 11–16) in [[Jerusalem]]. Its swift narrative portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; an [[Exorcism|exorcist]], healer and miracle worker. An important theme of Mark is the [[Messianic Secret]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Messianic Secret&quot;&gt;&quot;Messianic Secret.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus silences the [[demoniacs]] he heals, tries unsuccessfully to keep his messianic identity secret, and conceals his message with [[parables]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Messianic Secret&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] fail to understand both the implication of the [[miracles of Jesus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; and the meaning of the things he predicts about his arrest, death and resurrection. 

According to tradition and some early church writers, the author is [[Mark the Evangelist]], the companion of the [[apostle Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ygcgn8h-jo4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Blackwell+companion+to+the+New+Testament&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bCwyYJj2XX&amp;sig=LzOcEQtjewwjGNmddEELEfKiRA8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XdK3TN2DF4e8cI7TweIM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jens Schroter, ''Gospel of Mark'', in Aune, David E., (ed) &quot;The Blackwell companion to the New Testament&quot; (Blackwell Publishing, 2010)], p.277-8&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel, however, appears to rely on several underlying sources, varying in form and in theology, and which tells against the tradition that the gospel was based on Peter's preaching.&lt;ref name = &quot;TM1998 Mark&quot;&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Various elements within the gospel, including the importance of the authority of Peter and the breadth of its basic theology, suggest that the author wrote in Syria or Palestine for a non-Jewish Christian community which had earlier absorbed the influence of pre-Pauline beliefs and then developed them further independent of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Schroter, ''Gospel of Mark'', in Aune, p.278&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship and sources===
[[File:Andrea Mantegna 087.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]].]]
[http://www.forerunner.com/churchfathers/X0027_07._PAPIAS_OF_HIERAP.html According to] [[Papias of Hierapolis]], writing in the early 2nd century, this gospel was by [[John Mark]], the companion of [[Saint Paul]] in Rome, who &quot;had one purpose only – to leave out nothing that he had heard, and to make no misstatement about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Papias, quoted in Eusebius ''History of the Church'', trans. G.A. Williamson (London: Penguin Books Ltd., 1965). 3.39.15 / pp. 103–4. Also available [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-08.htm#P2185_1027485 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Other early writers such as [[Irenaeus]] agree with this.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'' III.1.1. Available [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;No early church tradition and no church father ascribes the Gospel to anyone other than Mark.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Edwards, ''The Gospel According to Mark'', (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 2002) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars believe that the gospel was written in Syria by an unknown Christian no earlier than AD 70, using various sources including a passion narrative (probably written), collections of miracles stories (oral or written), apocalyptic traditions (probably written), and disputations and didactic sayings (some possibly written).&lt;ref name = &quot;TM1998 Mark&quot;/&gt; Some of the material in Mark, however, goes back a very long way, representing an important source for historical information about Jesus.&lt;ref name = &quot;TM1998 Mark&quot;/&gt; 

Mark wrote primarily for an audience of gentile Greek-speaking residents of the [[Roman Empire]]: Jewish traditions are explained, clearly for the benefit of non-Jews (e.g., {{bibleverse||Mark|7:1–4}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:12}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|15:42}}), and [[Aramaic]] words and phrases are expanded upon by the author, e.g., ταλιθα κουμ (''talitha koum'', {{bibleverse||Mark|5:41}}); κορβαν (''Corban'', {{bibleverse||Mark|7:11}}); αββα (''abba'', {{bibleverse||Mark|14:36}}). When Mark makes use of the Old Testament he does so in the form in which it had been translated into Greek, the [[Septuagint]], for instance {{bibleverse||Mark|1:2}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:23–28}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|10:48b}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|12:18–27}}; also compare {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:10}} with [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] {{bibleverse-nb||Daniel|7:13–14}}.

=== Genre ===
[[Franz Overbeck]] considered the gospels as the only new Christian genre, whereas other books of the New Testament were modeled on traditional types of religious literature. The influential discipline called [[form criticism]] propagated this view and defined the genre as an account of the “good news” centering on life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, with the evocation of repentance and faith as primary function.&lt;ref&gt;Adela Yarbro Collins: ''Mark: a commentary''. Minneapolis, Fortress Press, 2007, p. 19-22. ISBN 978-0-8006-6078-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, parallels to Greco-Roman literature exist, e.g. to didactic biographies like the life of [[Moses]] by [[Philo of Alexandria]]. Furthermore, Mark is not interested in origins, education and inner development of Jesus, but narrates the history of the fulfillment of the divine promises from his perspective. In this focus Mark resembles a historical biography like [[Suetonius]]'s ''Lives of Caesars''.&lt;ref&gt;Adela Yarbro Collins: ''Mark: a commentary'', p. 21-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in ancient literature historical events were related to divine power by direct interactions, as the splitting of the heavens in Mark 1:10 or the cloud in 9:7. Yet the dominant strategy of Mark is to describe humans as acting independently, but in the context of an underlying divine plan. Hence, he reflects the difference between [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] on the one hand and [[Herodotus]] and the [[Deuteronomist]] on the other. Historiography in antiquity was not predominantly interested in facts, as in modern [[positivism]], but in [[Mimesis|representation]] and [[explanation]]. For this purpose, miracles were included by Herodotus in [[ethnography]]; in Old Testament traditions, Moses, [[Samuel]] or [[Elijah]] appear as mediators between God and the people.&lt;ref&gt;Adela Yarbro Collins: ''Mark: a commentary'', p. 33-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adela Yarbro Collins]] integrates these observations into the characterization of Mark as an “eschatological historical monograph”, a new type of writing enrooted in traditional and contemporary literature.&lt;ref&gt;Adela Yarbro Collins: ''Mark: a commentary'', p. 42f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). Chapter 2.

It provides the general chronology, from Jesus' baptism to the empty tomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActJLuke&quot;/&gt;

==Differing versions==
Mark is the shortest of the canonical gospels. Manuscripts, both scrolls and codices, tend to lose text at the beginning and the end, not unlike a coverless paperback in a backpack.&lt;ref name=&quot;N. Clayton Croy 2003&quot;&gt;N. Clayton Croy, ''The Mutilation of Mark's Gospel'' (Abingdon, 2003) ISBN 0-687-05293-9&lt;/ref&gt; These losses are characteristically unconnected with excisions. For instance, {{bibleverse||Mark|1:1}} has been found in two different forms. Most manuscripts of Mark, including the 4th-century [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], have the text &quot;son of God&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Greek grammar and article use allow an English translation of the Son of God, a son of God, or merely Son of God.&lt;/ref&gt; but three important manuscripts do not. Those three are: [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (01, א; dated 4th century), [[Codex Koridethi]] (038, Θ; 9th century), and the text called [http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Manuscripts1-500.html#m28 Minuscule 28] (11th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]&lt;/ref&gt; Textual support for the term &quot;Son of God&quot; is strong, but the phrase may not have been original.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Since the combination of [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|B]] [[Codex Bezae|D]] [[Codex Washingtonianus|W]] all in support of [Son of God] is extremely strong, it was not thought advisable to omit the words altogether, yet because of the antiquity of the shorter reading and the possibility of scribal expansion, it was decided to enclose the words within square brackets.&quot; [[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpolations may not be editorial, either. It is a common experience that [[gloss]]es written in the margins of manuscripts get incorporated into the text as copies are made. Any particular example is open to dispute, of course, but one may take note of {{bibleverse||Mark|7:16}}, &quot;Let anyone with ears to hear, listen,&quot; which is not found in early manuscripts.

Revision and editorial error may also contribute. Most differences are trivial but {{bibleverse||Mark|1:41}}, where the leper approached Jesus begging to be healed, is significant. An early ([[Western text-type|Western]]) manuscript ([[Codex Bezae]]) reads that Jesus became angry with the leper while [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] and [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] manuscripts indicate that Jesus showed compassion. This is possibly a confusion between the Aramaic words ''ethraham'' (he had pity) and ''ethra'em'' (he was enraged).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/TCG/TC-Mark.pdf | title = A Textual Commentary on the Greek Gospels.

Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Misquoting Jesus]]: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why. HarperCollins, 2005. ISBN 978-0-06-073817-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ending==
{{Main|Mark 16}}
{{bibleverse||Mark|16:9–20}}, describing some disciples' encounters with the resurrected Jesus, appears to be a later addition to the gospel. Mark 16:8 stops at a description of the [[empty tomb]], which is immediately preceded by a statement by a &quot;young man dressed in a white robe&quot; that Jesus is &quot;risen&quot; and is &quot;going ahead of you into Galilee.&quot; The last twelve verses are missing from the oldest manuscripts of Mark's Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Ehrman | first=Bart | title=Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why | publisher=HarperSanFrancisco | year=2005 | isbn=0-06-073817-0 | pages=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of these verses differs from the rest of Mark, suggesting they were a later addition. In a handful of manuscripts, a &quot;short ending&quot; is included after 16:8, but before the &quot;long ending&quot;, and exists by itself in one of the earliest [[Old Latin]] codices, [[Codex Bobiensis]]. By the 5th century, at least four different endings have been attested. (See [[Mark 16]] for a more comprehensive treatment of this topic.) Possibly, the Long Ending (16:9–20) started as a summary of evidence for Jesus' resurrection and the apostles' divine mission, based on other gospels.&lt;ref name = &quot;May Metzger&quot;&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; It was likely composed early in the 2nd century and incorporated into the gospel around the middle of the 2nd century.&lt;ref name = &quot;May Metzger&quot;/&gt;

The 3rd-century theologian [[Origen of Alexandria]] quoted the resurrection stories in Matthew, Luke, and John but failed to quote anything after {{bibleverse||Mark|16:8}}, suggesting that his copy of Mark stopped there. [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]] both mention the majority of texts available to them omitted the longer ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/TCG/TC-Mark-Ends.pdf | title = A Textual Commentary on the Greek Gospels.

B. Stonehouse, ''The Witness of Matthew and Mark to Christ'' (1944) pp. 86–118; also J. B. Tyson, ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 80 (1961) pp. 261–268. A relevant commentary: P. W. van Horst, &quot;Can a book end with {{lang|grc|γάρ}}? A note on Mark 16:8&quot;, in ''[[Journal of Theological Studies]]'', new series 23 (1972) pp. 121–124.&lt;/ref&gt; If the 16:8 ending was intentional, it could indicate a connection to the theme of the &quot;[[Messianic Secret]]&quot;. This abrupt ending is also used to support the identification of this book as an example of [[closet drama]], which characteristically ended without resolution and often with a tragic or shocking event that prevents closure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1995&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Stephen H.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Archaic mark session.jpg|thumb|[[Minuscule 2427]] – &quot;Archaic Mark&quot;]]
The ''Gospel of Mark'' differs from the other gospels in language, detail and content. Its theology is unique. The gospel's vocabulary embraces 1330 distinct words, of which 60 are proper names. Eighty words, (exclusive of proper names), are not found elsewhere in the New Testament. About one quarter of these are non-classical. In addition Mark makes use of the &quot;historic present&quot; as well as the &quot;Messianic secret&quot; to make known his Gospel message.&lt;ref&gt;William Telford, ''Mark'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003 pp.75 – 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
The &quot;Suffering Messiah&quot; is central to Mark's portrayal of Jesus, his theology and the structure of the gospel. This knowledge is hidden and only those with spiritual insight may see. The concept of hidden knowledge may have become the basis of the [[Gnostic Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Lane]], ''The Gospel according to Mark'', Volume 2 of The new international commentary on the New Testament, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1974 pp.300 – 303&lt;/ref&gt; John Killinger, arguing that, in ''Mark'', the resurrection account is hidden throughout the gospel rather than at the end, speculates that the Markan author might himself have been a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christian.&lt;ref&gt;John Killinger, ''Hidden Mark: Exploring Christianity's Heretical Gospel'' (Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Messianic secret===
{{main|Messianic secret}}
In 1901, William Wrede&lt;ref&gt;Wrede, Wilhelm. The Messianic Secret in the Gospels. 1901. ISBN 0-227-67717-X&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the then-current critical view that Mark comprised a straightforward historical account and gave the name “Messianic secret” to this gospel theme. He argued that the Messianic secret was a literary device that Mark used to resolve the tension between early Christians, who hailed Jesus as the Messiah, and the historical Jesus who, he argued, never made any such claim for himself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wrede, William.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Mark, more than in the other synoptics, Jesus hides his messianic identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; When he exorcises demons, they recognize him, but he commands them to be silent. When he heals people, he tells them not to reveal how they were healed.&lt;ref&gt;'Again and again, both Jesus' intimate disciples and those whom he miraculously heals or cleanses or from whom he exorcises demons are charged not to reveal who he is (Mark 1:23–24, 34; 3:11–12; 8:30; 9:2–9).' [[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; When he preaches, he uses parables to conceal his true message from the crowds ({{bibleverse||Mark|4:10–12}}). According to v. 34, Jesus “explained everything in private to his disciples”. However, in sentences like {{bibleverse||Mark|6:52}} also the disciples are obtuse, understanding the true significance of Jesus only after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 287-288.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;Messianic secret&quot; is a central issue in Bible scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Messianic secret.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoptionism===
[[Adoptionism]] is the idea that Jesus was fully human, born of a sexual union between Joseph and Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=yipXIHcteRsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bart D. Ehrman, ''Truth and fiction in The Da Vinci code: a historian reveals what we really know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Constantine'', Oxford University Press US, 2004], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=gL8KJoZin4wC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22Adoptionist++heresy%22+born+joseph+union&amp;ei=vwmmS-3CLo60zATB2Ki6CA&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Adoptionist%20%20heresy%22%20born%20joseph%20union&amp;f=false Charles Landon, &quot;A text-critical study of the Epistle of Jude&quot;, Volume 135 of Journal for the study of the New Testament, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1996], p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus only became [[divinity|divine]], i.e. (adopted as God's son), later at his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=yipXIHcteRsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Adoptionists+teach%22+baptism+%22son+of+god%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Adoptionists%20teach%22%20baptism%20%22son%20of%20god%22&amp;f=false Ed Hindson &amp; Ergun Caner, ''The Popular Encyclopedia of Apologetics: Surveying the Evidence for the Truth of Christianity'', Harvest House Publishers, 2008] P. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was chosen as the firstborn of all creation because of his sinless devotion to the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=yipXIHcteRsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22adoptionist+position%22+%22born+as+a+man%22++%22virtuous+sinless+life%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22adoptionist%20position%22%20%22born%20as%20a%20man%22%20%20%22virtuous%20sinless%20life%22&amp;f=false Ed Hindson &amp; Ergun Caner, ''The Popular Encyclopedia of Apologetics: Surveying the Evidence for the Truth of Christianity'', Harvest House Publishers, 2008] p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;They too accept Matthew's gospel, and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'', for in truth Matthew alone in the New Testament expounded and declared the ''Gospel in Hebrew'' using Hebrew script. After saying many things, this Gospel continues: “After the people were baptized, Jesus also came and was baptized by John. And as Jesus came up from the water, Heaven was opened, and He saw the Holy Spirit descend in the form of a dove and enter into Him. And a voice from Heaven said, ‘You are my beloved Son; with You I am well pleased.’ And again, ‘Today I have begotten You.’ “Immediately a great light shone around the place; and John, seeing it, said to Him, ‘Who are you, Lord? And again a voice from Heaven said, ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.’ Then John, falling down before Him, said, ‘I beseech You, Lord, baptize me!’ But He forbade him saying, ‘Let it be so; for thus it is fitting that all things be fulfilled.’” Epiphanius, ''Panarion'' 30.3.7 &amp; 13.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoptionism probably arose among early [[Jewish Christians]] seeking to reconcile the claims that Jesus was the Son of God with the strict [[monotheism]] of Judaism, in which the concept of a trinity of divine persons in one Godhead was unacceptable. Scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] argues that adoptionist theology may date back almost to the time of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bart D Ehrman 1996. p.74-55&quot;&gt;Bart D Ehrman, ''The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture: The Effect of Early Christological Controversies on the Text of the New Testament'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1996. p.74-55&lt;/ref&gt; The early [[Jewish-Christian Gospels]] make no mention of a supernatural birth. Rather, they state that Jesus was begotten at his [[baptism]].

The theology of Adoptionism fell into disfavor as Christianity left its Jewish roots and Gentile Christianity became dominant. Adoptionism was declared heresy at the end of the 2nd century, and was rejected by the First Council of Nicaea, which proclaimed the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and identifies Jesus as eternally [[begotten]] of God. The Creed of Nicaea now holds Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary. (See [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jesus was either regarded as the man whom God had chosen, in whom the Deity or the Spirit of God dwelt, and who, after being tested, was adopted by God and invested with dominion, (Adoptian Christology); or Jesus was regarded as a heavenly spiritual being (the highest after God) who took flesh, and again returned to heaven after the completion of his work on earth (pneumatic Christology).&quot; [[Adolf von Harnack]], History of Dogma [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoptionism may go back as far as Matthew and the Apostles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bart D Ehrman 1996. p.74-55&quot;/&gt; According to some early church writers,&lt;ref&gt;Origen explains, &quot;The very first account to be written was by Matthew, once a tax collector, but later an apostle of Jesus Christ. Matthew published it for the converts from Judaism and composed it in Hebrew letters.&quot; Eusebius ''Church History,'' 6:25 Eusebius adds insight by explaining that the apostles &quot;were led to write only under the pressure of necessity. Matthew, who had first preached the Gospel in Hebrew, when on the point of going to other nations, committed the gospel to writing in his native language. Therefore he supplied the written word to make up for the lack of his own presence to those from whom he was sent.&quot; Eusebius ''Church History,'' 3:24&lt;/ref&gt; the first gospel was written by the [[Apostle Matthew]], and his account was called the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]] or the ''Gospel of the Apostles''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Pick, ''The Talmud: What It Is and What It Knows of Jesus and His Followers'', Kessinger Publishing, 2006, pp. 122, 125–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius ''Church History'' 3:39 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus gives us further insight into the date and circumstances of this gospel by explaining, &quot;Matthew also issued a written ''Gospel of the Hebrews'' in their own language while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the Church.&quot; Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies,'' 3:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of Matthew has traditionally been said to have been composed near Jerusalem for Hebrew Christians. It was then translated into Greek but the Greek copy was lost. The Hebrew original was preserved at the Library of Caesarea, which Pamphilus diligently gathered. The Nazarenes transcribed a copy for [[Jerome]] which he used in his work.
&quot;Jerome, On Illustrious Men 3&quot;&gt;Jerome, ''On Illustrious Men'' 3 [http://books.google.ca/books?id=uqzY1zBtKg0C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22matthew+surnamed+levi%22+%22composed+a+gospel+of+Christ+at+first+published+in+Judea+in+Hebrew%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22matthew%20surnamed%20levi%22%20%22composed%20a%20gospel%20of%20Christ%20at%20first%20published%20in%20Judea%20in%20Hebrew%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew's gospel was called the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'' or sometimes the ''Gospel of the Apostles'', and was written in the Chaldee and Syriac language but in Hebrew script. It was used by the Nazarene communities. Jerome, ''Against Pelagius'' 3:2 [http://books.google.ca/books?id=Zm1v-c7fGmgC&amp;pg=PA472&amp;dq=hebrews+matthew+apostles%22Chaldee+and+Syrian+language,+but+in+Hebrew+characters%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=hebrews%20matthew%20apostles%22Chaldee%20and%20Syrian%20language%2C%20but%20in%20Hebrew%20characters%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
This, the first written account of the life of Jesus, was adoptionist in nature. The Gospel of the Hebrews has no mention of a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and when Jesus is baptized it states, &quot;Jesus came up from the water, Heaven was opened, and He saw the Holy Spirit descend in the form of a dove and enter into Him. And a voice from Heaven said, ‘You are my beloved Son; with You I am well pleased.’ And again, ‘Today I have begotten You.’ Immediately a great light shone around the place&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'' 30:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Edwards, ''The Hebrew Gospel &amp; the Development of the Synoptic Tradition'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. 2009, pp. 1–376&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierson Parker ''A Basis for the Gospel According to the Hebrews'' Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 59, No. 4 (Dec., 1940), pp. 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars also see adoptionist theology in the Gospel of Mark. Mark names Jesus as the son of God at the strategic points of 1:1 (&quot;The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God&quot;) and 15:39 (&quot;Surely this man was the Son of God!&quot;), but the virgin birth story has not been developed. The phrase &quot;Son of God&quot; is not present in some early manuscripts at 1:1. [[Bart D. Ehrman]] uses this omission to support the notion that the title &quot;Son of God&quot; is not used of Jesus until his baptism, and that ''Mark'' reflects an adoptionist view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrman, Bart D. 1996. p.74-55&quot;&gt;Ehrman, Bart D., ''The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture: The Effect of Early Christological Controversies on the Text of the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996. p.74-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of the omission of &quot;Son of God&quot; and its theological significance has been rejected by [[Bruce Metzger]] and [[Ben Witherington III]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament'' (New York : United Bible Societies, 1994). Mark 1:1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, ''What Have They Done With Jesus?'' (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; but has been affirmed by other contemporary scholars, including the [[Jesus Seminar]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Miller, ed, ''The Complete Gospels'' (San Francisco: Polebridge Press, 1992), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ched Meyers.&lt;ref&gt;Ched Meyers, ''Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus'' (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1991), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By comparison, the gospels of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] portray Jesus as being the Son of God from the time of birth, while the [[Gospel of John]] portrays the Son as existing &quot;in the beginning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrman, Bart D. 1996. p.74-55&quot;/&gt;

===Meaning of Jesus' death===
Mark portrays Jesus' death as an atoning sacrifice for sin.&lt;ref name = &quot;JInt&quot;&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. ISBN 0-06-117393-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple curtain, which served as a barrier between the holy presence of God and the profane world, rips at the moment of Jesus' death, symbolizing an end to the division between humans and God.&lt;ref name = &quot;JInt&quot;/&gt;

The only explicit mention of the meaning of Jesus' death in Mark occurs in {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|10:45}} where Jesus says that the &quot;Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom (''lutron'') for many (''anti pollōn'').&quot; According to Barnabas Lindars, this refers to [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah's]] fourth servant song, with ''lutron'' referring to the &quot;offering for sin&quot; (Isaiah 53:10) and ''anti pollōn'' to the Servant &quot;bearing the sin of many&quot; in Isaiah 52:12.&lt;ref&gt;Lindars, Barnabas. &quot;Salvation Proclaimed, VII: Mark 10:45 – A Ransom for Many&quot; ''Expository Times'' 93 [1982], 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''anti'' means &quot;in the place of&quot;, which indicates a substitutionary death.&lt;ref&gt;Ladd, George Eldon. ''A Theology of the New Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1987), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of this gospel also speaks of Jesus' death through the metaphors of the departing bridegroom in {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:20}}, and of the rejected heir in {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|12:6–8}}. He views it as fulfilling Old Testament prophecy ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|9:12}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|12:10–11}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:21}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:27}}).

Many scholars believe that Mark structured his gospel in order to emphasise Jesus' death. For example, Alan Culpepper sees Mark 15:1–39 as developing in three acts, each containing an event and a response.&lt;ref&gt;Culpepper, R. Alan. &quot;The Passion and Resurrection in Mark,&quot; ''[[Review &amp; Expositor]]'' 75 [1978], 584.&lt;/ref&gt; The first event is Jesus' trial, followed by the soldiers' mocking response; the second event is Jesus' crucifixion, followed by the spectators mocking him; the third and final event in this sequence is Jesus' death, followed by the veil being rent and the centurion confessing, &quot;truly this man was the Son of God.&quot; In weaving these things into a triadic structure, Mark is thereby emphasising the importance of this confession, which provides a dramatic contrast to the two scenes of mocking which precede it. D. R. Bauer suggests that &quot;by bringing his gospel to a climax with this christological confession at the cross, Mark indicates that Jesus is first and foremost Son of God, and that Jesus is Son of God as one who suffers and dies in obedience to God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, D. R. &quot;Son of God&quot; in Joel B. Green, Scot McKnight and I. Howard Marshall (eds.) ''Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels'' (Downers Grove: IVP, 1992), 773.&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Marcus notes that the other Evangelists &quot;attenuate&quot; Mark's emphasis on Jesus' suffering and death, and sees Mark as more strongly influenced than they are by Paul's &quot;theology of the cross&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus |first=Joel |year=2000 |title=Mark – Interpreter of Paul |journal=[[New Testament Studies]] |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=473–487 |doi=10.1017/S0028688500000278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics of Mark's content===
[[File:MarkSt.Matts.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Stained glass depiction of St. Mark at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina.]]
The narrative can be divided into three sections: the ''Galilean ministry'', including the surrounding regions of Phoenicia, Decapolis, and Cæsarea Philippi (1–9); the ''Journey to Jerusalem'' (10); and the ''Events in Jerusalem'' (11–16).
* Unlike both Matthew and Luke, Mark does not offer any information about the life of Jesus before his baptism and ministry, including neither a nativity nor a genealogy. He is simply stated as having come &quot;out of Galilee;&quot; the [[Gospel of John]] similarly refers to Jesus being of Galilean origin.
* Jesus' baptism is understated, with John not identifying Jesus as the Son of God, nor initially declining to baptize him
* [[Son of Man]] is the major title used of Jesus in Mark ({{bibleverse||Mark|2:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:28}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:31}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|9:9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|9:12}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|9:31}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|10:33}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|10:45}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:21}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:41}}). Many people (for instance, [[Morna Hooker]], [[Maurice Casey]], etc.) have seen that this title is a very important one within Mark’s Gospel, and it has important implications for Mark’s Christology. Jesus raises a question that demonstrates the association in Mark between &quot;Son of Man&quot; (cf. Dan 7:13–14) and the [[suffering servant]] in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13–53:12}}—&quot;How then is it written about the Son of Man, that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt?&quot; (9:12b NRSV). Yet this comparison is not explicit; Mark's Gospel creates this link between [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and Isaiah, and applies it to Christ. It is postulated that this is because of the persecution of Christians; thus, Mark's Gospel encourages believers to stand firm ({{bibleverse||Mark|13:13}}) in the face of troubles.
* To the question &quot;Are You the Christ?&quot;, Jesus gives the direct answer, &quot;I am&quot;: {{bibleverse||Mark|14:62}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|15:2|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:63–64|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|27:11|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|22:70|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|23:3|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|23:9|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse||John|18:20|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:33–37|NRSV}}.

* Mark is the only gospel that has Jesus explicitly admit that he does not know when the [[eschatology|end of the world]] will be ({{bibleverse||Mark|13:32}}). The equivalent verse in the [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] [[manuscript]]s of Matthew does not contain the words &quot;nor the Son&quot; ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:36}}) (but it is present in most [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] and [[Western text-type]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce Metzger |title=Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testamanet |year=1994 |publisher=UBS |location=Freiburg, Germany |pages=51–52 |isbn=3-438-06010-8 |edition=Second}}On Matthew 24.36: &quot;The omission of the words [&quot;neither the Son&quot;] because of the doctrinal difficulty they present is more probable than their addition by assimilation to Mk 13.32.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Kenosis]].

* The character of Jesus appears as secretive and capricious, his actions as unpredictable and scandalous. In the narrative of [[Jesus' walk on water]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:45-56}}), e.g., there is a gap: Jesus only says, but is not reported to really dismiss the crowd. It appears to be an excuse to separate from the disciples. V. 48c. has often been an enigma: Jesus wants to pass by the disciples, whereas v. 48a suggests that he intends to help them – 8 hours after having seen their distress. Similarly, {{bibleverse||Mark|5:39}} unsettles and contradicts vv. 23 and 35; {{bibleverse||Mark|7:24ff.}} contrasts with Jesus' mission directed to everyone ({{bibleverse||Mark|1:38}}). George W. Young notes parallels to a Greek “capricious god toying aimlessly with his subjects”.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Young: ''Subversive Symmetry. Exploring the Fantastic in Mark 6:45-56''. Brill, Leiden 1999, p. 160-169. ISBN 90-04-11428-9. [http://books.google.de/books?id=t54DzhncNE4C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Young+Subversive+Symmetry+capricious+character+of+jesus&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qNkIT4WiN8fh4QSm-OyICg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online preview]&lt;/ref&gt;

* &quot;No sign will be given to this generation&quot; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:12|NRSV}}; Matthew and Luke include &quot;except for the sign of Jonah&quot; {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:38–39}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|11:29|NIV}}. See also [[Typology (theology)]]. In John, Jesus provides six signs specifically to demonstrate his divine role.&lt;ref name=&quot;JInt&quot;/&gt;

===Characteristics of Mark's language===
The phrase &quot;and immediately&quot; occurs forty-two times in Mark; while in Luke, which is much longer, it is used only seven times, and in John only four times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.site-berea.com/D/ebd/T0002400.html#T0002421 Easton's Bible Dictionary: Mark, Gospel according to]&lt;/ref&gt; The word from {{lang-el|νομος}}, which roughly translates as ''law,'' ([http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=3551]) is never used, while it appears 8 times in Matthew, 9 times in Luke, 15 times in John, 19 times in Acts, many times in Romans.

Mark makes frequent use of the [[narrative present]]; Luke changes about 150 of these verbs to past tense.&lt;ref&gt;''Complete Gospels'', Miller, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Mark frequently links sentences with {{lang-el|και}} (''and''); Matthew and Luke replace most of these with [[subordinate clauses]].

===Other characteristics unique to ''Mark''===
* The [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] was made for man, not man for the Sabbath ({{bibleverse||Mark|2:27}}).&lt;ref&gt;Similar to a rabbinical saying from the 2nd century BC, &quot;The Sabbath is given over to you [&quot;the son of man&quot;], and not you to the Sabbath.&quot; [http://www.quango.net/brinsmead/JesusandtheSabbath.htm#1%20-%20Human%20Needs%20More%20Important%20Than%20Ceremony] [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&amp;letter=N&amp;search=Gospel#703 Jewish Encyclopedia: New Testament: Misunderstood Passages]&lt;!--This quote doesn't need to be here, does it? Let's just make the point.:
:&quot;In the one case Jesus, referring to David, defended his disciples, who in their hunger plucked the new corn in the field and ate it without waiting for the offering upon the altar; in the other case he himself disregarded the Sabbath law in view of the &quot;pikkuaḥ nefesh&quot; (peril of life), a case in which the Rabbis admitted the suspension of the law, upon the principle, &quot;The Sabbath is given over to you [&quot;the son of man&quot;], and not you to the Sabbath&quot; (see Mek., Wayaḳhel, 1; Chwolson, &quot;Das Letzte Passahmahl,&quot; 1892, pp. 59–67, 91–92).&quot;--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Not present in either {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:1–8}} or {{bibleverse||Luke|6:1–5}}. This is also a so-called &quot;Western non-interpolation&quot;. The passage is not found in the Western text of Mark.
* People were saying, &quot;[Jesus] has gone out of his mind&quot;, see also [[Rejection of Jesus]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|3:21}}).
* Mark is the only gospel with the combination {{bibleverse||Mark|4:24–25}}, the other gospels split them up: Mark 4:24 being found in {{bibleverse||Luke|6:38}} and {{bibleverse||Matthew|7:2}}; Mark 4:25 being found in {{bibleverse||Matthew|13:12}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|25:29}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|8:18}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|19:26}}.
* [[Parable of the Growing Seed]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|4:26–29}}).
* Only Mark counts the [[Legion (demon)|possessed swine]]; there are about two thousand ({{bibleverse||Mark|5:13}}).
* Two consecutive healing stories of women; both make use of the number twelve ({{bibleverse||Mark|5:25}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|5:42}}).
* Only Mark gives healing commands of Jesus in the (presumably original) [[Aramaic]]: ''Talitha koum'' ({{bibleverse||Mark|5:41}}), ''Ephphatha'' ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:34}}). See [[Aramaic of Jesus]].
* Only place in the New Testament Jesus is addressed as &quot;the son of Mary&quot; ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}}).
* Mark is the only gospel where Jesus himself is called a carpenter ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}}). In Matthew he is called a carpenter's son ({{bibleverse||Matthew|13:55}}).
* Only place that both names his brothers and mentions his sisters ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}}; Matthew has a slightly different name for one brother{{bibleverse||Matthew|13:55}}).
* The taking of a staff and sandals is permitted in {{bibleverse||Mark|6:8–10}} but prohibited in {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:10}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|9:3}}.
* The longest version of the story of [[Herodias]]' daughter's dance and the beheading of [[John the Baptist]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:14–29}}).
* Mark's literary cycles:
:*{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|6:30–44}} – '''Feeding''' of the five thousand;
:*{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|6:45–56}} – Crossing of the '''lake''';
:*{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|7:1–13}} – '''Dispute''' with the Pharisees;

:Then:
:*{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:1–9}} – '''Feeding''' of the four thousand;
:*{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:10}} – Crossing of the '''lake''';
:*{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:11–13}} – '''Dispute''' with the Pharisees;
:*{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:14–21}} – Incident of '''no bread''' and discourse about the '''leaven''' of the Pharisees.
* Customs that at that time were unique to Jews are explained (hand, produce, and utensil washing): {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|7:3–4}}.
* &quot;Thus he declared all foods clean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The verb ''katharizo'' means both &quot;to declare to be clean&quot; and &quot;to purify.&quot; The ''Scholars Version'' has: &quot;This is how everything we eat is purified&quot;, Gaus' ''[[Unvarnished New Testament]]'' has: &quot;purging all that is eaten.&quot; See also [http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/words.pl?word=2511 Strong's G2511]&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|7:19|NRSV}} [[NRSV]], not found in the Matthean parallel {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:15–20}}.
* There is no mention of [[Samaritan]]s
* Jesus heals using his fingers and spit at the same time: {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|7:33}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|8:23}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|11:20}}, {{bibleverse||John|9:6}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|8:16}}; see also [[Exorcism#Jesus|Exorcism]].
* Jesus lays his hands on a blind man twice in curing him: {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|8:23–25}}; cf. {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|5:23}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|16:18}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|6:6}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|9:17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|28:8}}, [[laying on of hands]].
* Jesus cites the [[Shema Yisrael]]: &quot;Hear O Israel ...&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|12:29–30}}); in the parallels of {{bibleverse||Matt|22:37–38}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|10:27}} the first part of the Shema ({{bibleverse||Deut|6:4}}) is absent.
* Mark points out that the [[Mount of Olives]] is across from the [[Temple Mount|temple]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|13:3}}).
* When [[Arrest of Jesus|Jesus is arrested]], a young naked man flees: {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:51–52}}. A young man in a robe also appears in {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|16:5–7}}, see also [[Secret Gospel of Mark#The young man in the linen cloth|Secret Gospel of Mark]].
* Mark doesn't name the [[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest]], cf. {{bibleverse||Matt|26:57}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|3:2}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|4:6}}, {{bibleverse||John|18:13}}.
* Witness testimony against Jesus does not agree ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:56}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:59}}).
* The cock crows &quot;twice&quot; as predicted ({{bibleverse||Mark|14:72}}). See also [[Fayyum Fragment]]. The other Gospels simply record, &quot;the cock crew&quot;. Early codices 01, W, and most Western texts have the simpler version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willker, Wieland&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/TCG/TC-Mark.pdf | title = A Textual Commentary on the Greek Gospels.

* Pilate's position (Governor) isn't specified, {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|15:1}}, cf. {{bibleverse||Matt|27:2}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|3:1}}, {{bibleverse||John|18:28–29}}.

* A young man sits on the &quot;right side&quot; ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:5}}), cf. {{bibleverse||Luke|24:4}}, {{bibleverse||John|20:12}}.
* Afraid, the women flee from the [[empty tomb]]. They &quot;tell no one&quot; what they have seen ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:8}}), compare with {{bibleverse||Mark|16:10}}, {{bibleverse||Matt|28:8}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|24:9}}, {{bibleverse||John|20:2}}.
* Mark is the only canonical gospel with significant various alternative endings (see [[Mark 16#Possible Scenarios|Mark 16, Possible Scenarios]]); however, most of the contents of the traditional &quot;Longer Ending&quot; ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:9–20|KJV}}) are found in other New Testament texts and are not unique to Mark, see [[Mark 16#The Longer Ending]]. The one significant exception is 16:18b &quot;and if they drink any deadly thing&quot;, it will not harm those who believe, which is unique to Mark.

==Secret Gospel of Mark==
{{Main|Secret Gospel of Mark}}

The ''Secret Gospel of Mark'' refers to a version of the ''Gospel of Mark'' being circulated in 2nd century Alexandria, which was kept from the Christian community at large. This [[New Testament apocrypha|non-canonical]] [[gospel]] fragment was discovered in 1958, by biblical researcher [[Morton Smith]] at the [[Mar Saba]] monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=TDW0PeFSvGEC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22in+1973%22++%22Mar+Saba+south%22+%22Morton+Smith%22+%22Discovery+of+the+text%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%201973%22%20%20%22Mar%20Saba%20south%22%20%22Morton%20Smith%22%20%22Discovery%20of%20the%20text%22&amp;f=false Wilhelm Schneemelcher, ''New Testament Apocrypha: Gospels and related writings'', Vol 1, Westminster John Knox Press, 2003 pp.106 – 109]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this fragment, Clement of Alexandria explains that Mark, during Peter's stay in Rome wrote an account of the life of Jesus. Mark selected those events that would be the most helpful to the Church. When Peter died a martyr, Mark left Rome and went to Alexandria. He brought both his own writings and those of Peter. It was here that Mark composed a second more spiritual Gospel and when he died, he left his composition to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=bNVpM76FE-EC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22The+secret+gospel+of+mark+is+a+longer+edition%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20secret%20gospel%20of%20mark%20is%20a%20longer%20edition%22&amp;f=false Bart D. Ehrman, ''Lost scriptures: books that did not make it into the New Testament'', Oxford University Press US, 2003 pp.87 – 89]&lt;/ref&gt; The Carpocrates got a copy of this Gospel and they misinterpreted it, which caused problems for the early Church.

Some modern scholars maintain the Secret Gospel is a clumsy forgery, while others accept this text as being authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, ''Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew'', Oxford University Press, 2003 p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:se9XfipOK1cJ:www.earlychristianwritings.com/secretmark.html+early+%22Today,+however,+there+is+almost+unanimous+agreement+among+Clementine+scholars+that+the+letter+is+authentic%22&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca Early Christian Writings]&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the ''Secret Gospel of Mark'' as well as Morton Smith's role in its discovery are still being debated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson 2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Carlson, Stephen C. | title = The Gospel Hoax – Morton Smith's Invention of Secret Mark | publisher = Baylor University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-932792-48-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeffery 2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Jeffery, Peter | title = The Secret Gospel of Mark Unveiled: Imagined Rituals of Sex, Death, and Madness in a Biblical Forgery | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-300-11760-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Jesus and the Victory of God,'' 1996, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, &quot;The 'Secret' Gospel of Mark,&quot; 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical Status==
A related issue is the adoption of the ''Gospel of Mark'' as a [[Canonical Gospel]], given that, like the hypothetical Q, it is largely reproduced in Matthew and Luke, but, unlike Q, it did not become &quot;lost&quot;. Traditionally Mark's authority and survival has derived from its Petrine origins (see above &quot;Authorship&quot;). A recent suggestion is that Mark gained widespread popularity in oral performance, apart from readings from manuscript copies. Its widespread oral popularity ensured it a place in the written canon.&lt;ref&gt;J. Dewey, &quot;The Survival of Mark's Gospel: a Good Story?&quot; ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', 123 (2004) pp. 495–507&lt;/ref&gt;
