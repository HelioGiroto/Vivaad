==Comments==

There's a recent page which was up for wikifying and copyediting on the [[Kumbh Mela]].

Can a domain expert on Hindu pilgrimages take a look at [[Talk::Kumbh Mela]] and add, if appropriate, the reference to that page.

==Lourdes==
In the Christianity section, Loudes is marked on the major pilgrimage sites and other pilgrimage sites. I don't know if this is an error or not, just thought I'd point it out.

==Fatima==
&quot;Fátima in Portugal. Our Lady of Fatima is the title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary. She appeared to three shepherd children at Fátima on the 13th day of six consecutive months in 20 BCE.&quot;

Date on this is incorrect.  This did not occur in 20 BCE.

== Carieam ==

I moved the following text which was unsourced:

[[indians]] The Indian pilgriamge [[Carieam]] is probably the most well know pilgrimage in the world this involves indians having to walk a hundred miles bare footed without any food or drink this is a pilgrimage that has claimed many lives yet many people still take this pilgrame every 10 years.

Someone needs to find a source for this for it to be in the article. Also need to know what religion it's about. --[[User:WikiSlasher|WikiSlasher]] 10:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:The article is believed to be a hoax and is [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|prodded]] so it'll be deleted if all goes to plan. --[[User:WikiSlasher|WikiSlasher]] 07:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Possible spam links? ==
Someone should check them sometime. I wonder if there's a tag for this. --[[User:WikiSlasher|WikiSlasher]] 07:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Pilgrimage/Visitation ==

please see this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahai_pilgrimage
Abdu'l-Baha designated Bahji as a site for visitation (ziarat) not pilgrimage (hajj). Please do not revert simply due to ignorance of facts. The Persian ziarat (visitation or visit) is different from hajj (pilgrimage).  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.224.13.164|99.224.13.164]] ([[User talk:99.224.13.164|talk]]) 06:26, 22 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Wikipedia has a [[WP:V|verifiability]] policy that states that inclusion in Wikipedia needs to be cited by [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], and in the case of religious scripture from [[secondary sources]].

==Grandparents pilgrimage==
I've taken the liberty of removing info about the Grandparents Pilgrimage at Knock Shrine. While with some expansion it seems like it would make a good article of its own (and seems to be in progress) the info needs some serious Wikification, and the subject matter doesn't seem to rise to the Christianity-wide importance of the other entries in this section.  I have transferred the entry in its entirety here (as well as the associated picture) in case anyone wants to take it and expand it into its own Wikipedia article:

[[File:God bless granny Catholic Grandparents Pilgrimage.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Catholic Grandparents Association]] Pilgrimage at [[Knock Shrine]].]]

*[[Grandparents Pilgrimage]] in Knock Shrine. [[Our Lady of Knock]] ''''Many grandparents may feel they are taken for granted, and my pilgrimage sought to put that right, and also to honour grandparents for the part they play in helping to pass the Catholic faith from generation to generation.” [[Catherine Wiley]].'' Following the great success of the first-ever National Grandparents Pilgrimage in September 2007 when over 5,000 people turned up to honour grandmothers and grandfathers at Knock Shrine, a similar pilgrimmage was organised for Sunday, September 14th 2008, and Sunday September 13th 2009 again in Knock Shrine. Over 12,000 people attended the last pilgrimage at Knock where Cardinal Sean Brady gave his blessing of the Pilgrimage and the Launch of the [[Catholic Grandparents Association]].


==Remove Mecca pilgrim (2) pics==

Can someone replace the current pictures uploaded of the 'Mecca pilgrims' with some of the following. The reason being that the individuals that are captured in the picture take away from the concept of pilgrimage, being many individuals as a whole and not a single person standing out.

Here are some better pictures:

== Picture of pilgrim ==

I have removed the picture prominently showing a smiling pilgrim with a small Ka'bah in the background. The image is of low quality, and is entirely inappropriate for an encyclopedia as the focus is clearly upon the individual who is also it's unloader. DO NOT replace this picture with out at least discussing the issues I have raised—Wikipedia is not a depository for tourist pictures.

== Secular Pilgrimages ==

I'm wondering whether the Valley of the Fallen in Madrid should be added here as a continuance of Fascist pilgrimage sites. It is the burial site of Franco and virtually the only people who go there to pay their respects are hardline right-wingers and neo-fascists.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.88.95.128|173.88.95.128]] ([[User talk:173.88.95.128|talk]]) 01:39, 26 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Is the caption on the second picture accurate? Please clarify ==

This seems like a strange caption: &quot;Tibetans on a pilgrimage to Lhasa, doing full-body prostrations, often for the entire length of the journey.&quot;  Does this mean the entire journey is taken fully lying down, dragging oneself along the ground? Or does one just prostrate periodically throughout the journey? I read the other article on [[Prostration (Buddhism)|Prostration in Buddhism]] and didn't see anything, so I really don't know. Definitely needs some clarification. [[User:Scientific29|Scientific29]] ([[User talk:Scientific29|talk]]) 02:51, 18 November 2010 (UTC)</text>
