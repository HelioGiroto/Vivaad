The '''Mishnah''' or '''Mishna''' ([[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|משנה}}, &quot;repetition&quot;, from the verb ''shanah'' {{lang|he|שנה}}, or &quot;to study and review&quot;, also &quot;secondary&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Greek language]], the name '''''Deuterosis''''' means &quot;repetition.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (derived from the adj. ''shani'' {{lang|he|שני}}) is the first major written [[redaction]] of the Jewish [[oral tradition]]s called the &quot;[[Oral Torah]]&quot;.  It is also the first major work of [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;The list of joyful days known as [[Megillat Taanit]] is older, but according to the [[Talmud]] it is no longer in force.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was redacted 220 CE by [[Rabbi]] [[Yehudah haNasi]] when, according to the [[Talmud]], the persecution of the Jews and the passage of time raised the possibility that the details of the oral traditions dating from [[Pharisee|Pharisaic]] times (536 BCE – 70 CE) would be forgotten. It is thus named for being both the one written authority (codex) secondary (only) to the [[Tanakh]] as a basis for the passing of judgment, a source and a tool for creating laws, and the first of many books to complement the Bible in certain aspects. The Mishnah is also called ''Shas'' (an [[acronym]] for ''Shisha Sedarim'' – the &quot;six orders&quot;), in reference to its six main divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The term ''Shas'' is also used to refer to a complete [[Talmud]], which follows the structure of the Mishnah.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbinic commentaries on the Mishnah over the next three centuries&lt;ref&gt;Recorded mostly in [[Aramaic]].&lt;/ref&gt; were redacted as the [[Gemara]], which, coupled with the Mishnah, comprise the [[Talmud]]. Unlike the Gemara, which is written primarily in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the majority of the Mishnah is written in Hebrew. European scholars over the past 1,000 years have termed this variety of the language &quot;[[Mishnaic Hebrew]]&quot;.

The Mishnah reflects debates between 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE by the group of rabbinic sages known as the [[Tannaim]].&lt;ref&gt;The plural term (singular '''tanna''') for the [[Rabbi]]nic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah; the period of the ''Tannaim'' is also referred to as the '''Mishnaic''' period and followed the ''[[Zugot]]'' (&quot;pairs&quot;), preceding the period of the ''[[Amoraim]]''.  The root ''tanna'' (תנא) is the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] equivalent for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root ''shanah'' (שנה), which also is the root-word of ''Mishnah''. The verb ''shanah'' (שנה) literally means &quot;to repeat [what one was taught]&quot; and is used to mean &quot;to learn&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mishnah teaches the oral traditions by example, presenting actual cases being brought to judgment, usually along with the debate on the matter and the judgment that was given by a wise and notable rabbi based on the [[halacha]], ''[[mitzvot]]'', and spirit of the teaching (&quot;Torah&quot;) that guided his sentencing. In this way, it brings to everyday reality the practice of the ''mitzvot'' as presented in the Bible, and aims to cover all aspects of human living, serve as an example for future judgments, and, most important, demonstrate pragmatic exercise of the Biblical laws, which was much needed at the time when the [[Second Temple]] was destroyed (70 C.E). The Mishnah does not claim to be the development of new laws, but rather the collection of existing traditions.

The Mishnah consists of six orders (''{{lang|he-Latn|sedarim}}'', singular ''{{lang|he-Latn|seder}}'' {{lang|he|סדר}}), each containing 7–12 tractates (''{{lang|tmr-Latn|masechtot}}'', singular ''{{lang|tmr-Latn|masechet}}'' {{lang|tmr|מסכת}}; lit. &quot;web&quot;), 63 in total, and further subdivided into chapters and paragraphs or verses. The orders and their subjects are: ''[[Zeraim]]'' (&quot;Seeds&quot;), dealing with prayer and blessings, tithes and agricultural laws (11 tractates), ''[[Moed]]'' (&quot;Festival&quot;), pertaining to the laws of the Sabbath and the Festivals (12 tractates), ''[[Nashim]]'' (&quot;Women&quot;), concerning marriage and divorce, some forms of oaths and the laws of the [[nazirite]] (7 tractates), ''[[Nezikin]]'' (&quot;Damages&quot;), dealing with civil and criminal law, the functioning of the courts and oaths (10 tractates), ''[[Kodashim]]'' (&quot;Holy things&quot;), regarding sacrificial rites, the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], and the [[Kashrut|dietary laws]] (11 tractates) and ''[[Tehorot]]'' (&quot;Purities&quot;), pertaining to the laws of purity and impurity, including the impurity of the dead, the laws of food purity and bodily purity (12 tractates).

The word ''Mishnah'' can also indicate a single paragraph or verse of the work itself, i.e. the smallest unit of structure in the Mishnah.

==Structure==
The Mishnah consists of six orders (''{{lang|he-Latn|sedarim}}'', singular ''{{lang|he-Latn|seder}}'' {{lang|he|סדר}}), each containing 7–12 tractates (''{{lang|tmr-Latn|masechtot}}'', singular ''{{lang|tmr-Latn|masechet}}'' {{lang|tmr|מסכת}}; lit. &quot;web&quot;), 63 in total. Each ''{{lang|tmr-Latn|masechet}}'' is divided into chapters (''{{lang|he-Latn|peraqim}}'', singular ''{{lang|he-Latn|pereq}}'') and then paragraphs or verses (''{{lang|he-Latn|mishnayot}}'', singular ''{{lang|he-Latn|Mishnah}}''). The Mishnah is also called ''Shas'' (an [[acronym]] for ''Shisha Sedarim'' – the &quot;six orders&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; 

A [[mnemonic]] that is used to remember the sequence of the orders was provided by [[Resh Lakish]] (Shab. 31a) that is based on the verse, &quot;And there shall be ''faith'' in your times, ''strength'', ''salvation'', ''wisdom'', and ''knowledge''&quot; (Isa. 33:6).

&quot;Faith&quot; refers to [[Zeraim]] (Seeds), because a farmer sowing the crop must have faith to believe God will provide a bountiful harvest. &quot;Your times&quot; refers to [[Moed]] (Festival). &quot;Strength&quot; refers to order [[Nashim]] (Women). &quot;Salvation&quot; refers to [[Nezikin]] (Damages) because knowledge of civil law &quot;saves&quot; people from each other. &quot;Wisdom&quot; refers to order [[Kodashim]] (Holy Things) and &quot;knowledge&quot; refers to order [[Tehorot]] (Purities) because they are so difficult to understand.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Ronald L. Eisenberg, &quot;Rabbinic Literature,&quot; in ''The JPS Guide to Jewish Traditions&quot;'' (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 2004), pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[acronym]] is often used, which is another popular [[mnemonic]] &quot;Z'MaN NaKaT.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mishnah orders its content by subject matter, instead of by biblical context. Likewise it discusses individual subjects more thoroughly than the [[Midrash]]. It includes a much broader selection of halakhic subjects than the Midrash.

The six orders are: 
*''[[Zeraim]]'' (&quot;Seeds&quot;), dealing with prayer and blessings, tithes and agricultural laws (11 tractates)
*''[[Moed]]'' (&quot;Festival&quot;), pertaining to the laws of the Sabbath and the Festivals (12 tractates)
*''[[Nashim]]'' (&quot;Women&quot;), concerning marriage and divorce, some forms of oaths and the laws of the nazirite (7 tractates)
*''[[Nezikin]]'' (&quot;Damages&quot;), dealing with civil and criminal law, the functioning of the courts and oaths (10 tractates)
*''[[Kodashim]]'' (&quot;Holy things&quot;), regarding sacrificial rites, the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], and the [[Kashrut|dietary laws]] (11 tractates) and
*''[[Tehorot]]'' (&quot;Purities&quot;), pertaining to the laws of purity and impurity, including the impurity of the dead, the laws of food purity and bodily purity (12 tractates).

In each order (with the exception of Zeraim), tractates are arranged from biggest (in number of chapters) to smallest. 

The word ''Mishnah'' can also indicate a single paragraph or verse of the work itself, i.e. the smallest unit of structure in the Mishnah.

{{Mishna}}

The [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] (Hagiga 14a) states that there were either six hundred or seven hundred orders of the Mishnah. [[Hillel the Elder]] organized them into six orders to make it easier to remember. The historical accuracy of this tradition is disputed. There is also a tradition that [[Ezra]] the scribe dictated from memory not only the 24 books of the [[Tanakh]] but 60 esoteric books. It is not known whether this is a reference to the Mishnah, but there is a case for saying that the Mishnah does consist of 60 tractates. (The current total is 63, but Makkot was originally part of Sanhedrin, and Bava Kamma, Bava Metzia and Bava Batra may be regarded as subdivisions of a single tractate Nezikin.)

Interestingly, [[Reuvein Margolies]] (1889–1971) posited that there were originally seven orders of Mishnah, citing a [[Gaon (Hebrew)|Gaon]]ic tradition on the existence of a seventh order containing the laws of ''[[sofer|Sta&quot;m]]'' (scribal practice) and Berachot (blessings).

===Omissions===
A number of important laws are not elaborated upon in the Mishnah. These include the laws of [[tzitzit]], [[tefillin]] (phylacteries), [[mezuzot]], the holiday of [[Hanukkah]], and the laws of [[gerim]] (converts). These were later discussed in the minor tractates.

Rabbi [[Nissim Gaon]] in his ''Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud'' writes that many of these laws were so well known that it was unnecessary for Rabbi Judah to discuss them. [[Reuvein Margolies]] suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the [[Bar Kochba]] revolt, [[Yehudah haNasi|Rabbi Judah]] could not have included discussion of [[Hanukkah]] which commemorates the Jewish revolt against the [[Seleucid Empire|Syrian-Greeks]] (the Romans would not have tolerated this overt nationalism). Similarly, there were then several decrees in place aimed at suppressing outward signs of national identity, including decrees against wearing tefillin and tzitzit; as [[Conversion to Judaism]] was against Roman law, Rabbi Judah would not have discussed this.&lt;ref&gt;''Yesod Hamishna Va'arichatah'' pp. 25–28 ({{PDFLink|1=[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20976&amp;pgnum=24 Hebrew text]}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Zvi Hoffman]] suggests that there existed ancient texts in the form of the present day [[Shulchan Aruch]] that discussed the basic laws of day to day living and it was therefore not necessary to focus on these laws in the Mishnah.

==Authorship==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
{{Main|Tannaim}}
The Mishnah does not claim to be the development of new laws, but merely the collection of existing oral laws, traditions and traditional wisdom. The rabbis who contributed to the Mishnah are known as the ''Tannaim'', of whom approximately 120 are known. The period during which the Mishnah was assembled spanned about 130 years, and five generations.

Most of the Mishnah is related without [[Attribution (copyright)|attribution]] (''{{lang|he-Latn|stam}}''). This usually indicates that many sages taught so, or that [[Judah haNasi]] (often called &quot;Rabbi&quot;) who redacted the Mishnah together with his academy/court ruled so. The ''halakhic'' ruling usually follows that view. Sometimes, however, it appears to be the opinion of a single sage, and the view of the sages collectively ({{lang-he|חכמים}}, ''hachamim'') is given separately.

The Talmud records a tradition that unattributed statements of the law represent the views of [[Rabbi Meir]] (Sanhedrin 86a), which supports the theory (recorded by Rav [[Sherira Gaon]] in his famous ''Iggeret'') that he was the author of an earlier collection. For this reason, the few passages that actually say &quot;this is the view of Rabbi Meir&quot; represent cases where the author intended to present Rabbi Meir's view as a &quot;minority opinion&quot; not representing the accepted law.

Rabbi is credited with publishing the Mishnah, though there have been a few edits since his time (for example, those passages that cite him or his grandson, Rabbi Yehuda Nesi'ah; in addition, the Mishnah at the end of Tractate Sotah refers to the period after Rabbi's death, which could not have been written by Rabbi himself). According to the Epistle of [[Sherira Gaon]], after the tremendous upheaval caused by the destruction of the Temple and the [[Bar Kochba revolt]], the [[Oral Torah]] was in danger of being forgotten. It was for this reason that Rabbi chose to redact the Mishnah.

One must also note that in addition to redacting the Mishnah, Rabbi and his court also ruled on which opinions should be followed, though the rulings do not always appear in the text.

As he went through the tractates, the Mishnah was set forth, but throughout his life some parts were updated as new information came to light. Because of the proliferation of earlier versions, it was deemed too hard to retract anything already released, and therefore a second version of certain laws were released. The [[Talmud]] refers to these differing versions as ''Mishnah Rishonah'' (&quot;First Mishnah&quot;) and ''Mishnah Acharonah'' (&quot;Last Mishnah&quot;). [[David Zvi Hoffman]] suggests that ''Mishnah Rishonah'' actually refers to texts from earlier Sages upon which Rabbi based his Mishnah.

One theory is that the present Mishnah was based on an earlier collection by Rabbi Meir. There are also references to the &quot;Mishnah of Rabbi Akiva&quot;, though this may simply mean his teachings in general.&lt;ref&gt;This theory was held by David Zvi Hoffman, and is repeated in the introduction to [[Herbert Danby]]'s Mishnah translation.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that [[Akiba ben Joseph|Rabbi Akiva]] and Rabbi Meir established the divisions and order of subjects in the Mishnah, but this would make them the authors of a school curriculum rather than of a book.

Authorities are divided on whether Rabbi recorded the Mishnah in writing or established it as an oral text for memorisation. The most important early account of its composition, the Epistle of Sherira Gaon, is ambiguous on the point, though the &quot;Spanish&quot; recension leans to the theory that the Mishnah was written. However, the Talmud records that, in every study session, there was a person called the ''tanna'' appointed to recite the Mishnah passage under discussion. This may indicate that, even if the Mishnah was reduced to writing, it was not available on general distribution.

===Oral law===
{{Main|Oral Torah}}
Before the publication of the Mishnah, Jewish scholarship was predominantly oral. Rabbis expounded on and debated the [[Tanakh]] ([[Hebrew]]: תַּנַ&quot;ךְ), the [[Hebrew Bible]], without the benefit of written works (other than the Biblical books themselves), though some may have made private notes (''{{lang|he-Latn|megillot setarim}}''), for example of court decisions. The oral traditions were far from monolithic, and varied among various schools, the most famous of which were the [[House of Shammai]] and the [[House of Hillel]]. The proprietary Aramaic (one of Judaism's holy languages with Hebrew) word for this type of allowing systematic disagreement in Jewish law, is &quot;Machloket&quot; or argument.

The end of the Jewish commonwealth in the year 70 CE resulted in an upheaval of Jewish social and legal norms. The Rabbis were faced with the new reality of Judaism without a Temple (to serve as the center of teaching and study) and Judea without autonomy, both serving as sources of pride. It is during this period that Rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in writing.&lt;ref&gt;See, Strack, Hermann, ''Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash'', Jewish Publication Society, 1945. pp. 11–12. &quot;[The Oral Law] was handed down by word of mouth during a long period...The first attempts to write down the traditional matter, there is reason to believe, date from the first half of the second post-Christian century.&quot; Strack theorizes that the growth of a Christian canon (the New Testament) was a factor that influenced the Rabbis to record the oral law in writing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theory that the destruction of the Temple and subsequent upheaval led to the committing of Oral Law into writing was first explained in the Epistle of [[Sherira Gaon]] and often repeated. See, for example, Grayzel, ''A History of the Jews'', Penguin Books, 1984, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded oral law may have been of the [[midrash]]ic form, in which [[halakha|halakhic]] discussion is structured as [[exegesis|exegetical]] commentary on the [[Torah]]. But an alternative form, organized by subject matter instead of by biblical verse, became dominant by about the year 220 CE, when Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] redacted the Mishnah. In general, all opinions, even the non-normative ones, were recorded in the Mishnah and subsequently the Talmud.

In modern times, &quot;the law&quot; takes on a different meaning than discussed in the Mishnah and Talmud. &quot;The law&quot; in Judaism refers primarily to [[613 Mitvot|biblical law]], given to the Israelites by God through Moses, as well as interpretations of the meaning and application of those rules. Thus, &quot;[[the Law]]&quot; is understood to be the religious teachings and rules given by God. Yet, since religion was infused in every area of life, rules for governing society, resolution of disputes, and enforcing safety and public order were also governed by the religious law, leading to an overlap of religion and modern conceptions of law.
Jewish Law

===Relationship with the Hebrew Bible===
According to the historic view of the Jewish faith, allegorically the Oral Law (''Torah she-be'al-peh'') was also given to Moses at Sinai, and is the exposition of the Written Law as relayed by the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation. This is to relay the authoritative nature of the Oral Law as authoritative in practical terms, as the traditions of the Oral Law are considered as the necessary basis for the interpretation, and often for the reading, of the [[Written Law]]. Jews refer to this as the 'messorah' roughly translated as tradition. In his introduction to [[Mishneh Torah]] [[Maimonides]] provides a generation by generation account of the direct line of all those who transmitted this tradition beginning with Moses himself up until the Mishnaic era.

[[Halakha|Jewish law and custom]] is based not only on a literal reading of the [[Tanakh]], but on the combined oral and written tradition. Notably, the Mishnah does not cite a written scriptural basis for its laws: since it is said that the Oral Law was given simultaneously with the Written Law, the Oral Law codified in the Mishnah does not derive directly from the Written Law of the Torah. This is in contrast with the ''[[Midrash halakha]]'', works in which the sources of the traditionally received laws are identified in the [[Tanakh]], often by linking a verse to a ''halakha''. These Midrashim often predate the Mishnah.

The Mishnah also quotes the Torah for principles not associated with [[law]], but just as practical advice, even at times for humor or as guidance for understanding historical debates.

By 220 CE, much of the Oral Law was edited together into the Mishnah, and published by Rabbi Judah haNasi. Over the next four centuries this material underwent analysis and debate, known as ''[[Gemara]]'' (&quot;completion&quot;), in what were at that time the world's two major Jewish communities, in the [[land of Israel]] and in the [[Babylonian Empire]]. These debates eventually came to be edited together into compilations known as the [[Talmud]]: the [[Talmud Yerushalmi]] (Jerusalem Talmud) for the compilation in Israel, and [[Talmud Bavli]] (Babylonian Talmud) for the compilation undertaken in Babylon.

==Women==
From certain contexts of the Mishnah and Talmud it can be derived that women should not study Mishnah. There were female Tannaic Torah jurists such as Rabbi Meir's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Medrish on Proverbs 31:10&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Meir's daughter, and the daughter of Haninyah ben Teradyon&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Babylonia Kelim Bava Kamma 4:17 separately in Sifre Deuteronomy 307 in both she is personally left unnamed and referred to as just, 'and we have learned from the daughter of Haninyah ben Terradyon', a sign of the prevailing attitude towards women (as property of their fathers).&lt;/ref&gt; Haninyah's daughter is again mentioned as a sage in the non-Talmud 3rd Century text Tractate Semahot verse 12:13.&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300010695 also search ISBN 9780300010695 for an English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Meir's wife is credited with teaching him how to understand some verses from Isaiah.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Berachot 10a&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mishnah there is also a reference to certain women teaching men the Torah from behind a curtain, so that no man would be offended.

===Beruryah===
Beruryah (her name is a standard Jewish female name meaning 'the clarity of God') is a Tannah mentioned by name in the Talmud, who has a female name, has orally been transmitted as a female, and is referred to in the text using the nekava (feminine Hebrew and Aramaic) adjectives and adverbs. Originally she was believed to be either Rabbi Meir's wife mentioned above, or Rabbi Chaninyah's daughter mentioned above, however over the past 3-4 centuries Rabbinic scholars have realized that these generations do not correspond to Beruryah's law decisions, and life, therefore she today is just 'Beruryah' and of heretofore unknown lineage.

Her law decisions were minor but set a crucial ancient precedent for modern Jewish women. She is mentioned at least four times in the Talmudic discourse regarding her law decrees first Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 10a then in Tosefta Pesahim 62b in Babylonian Talmud Eruvin 53b–54a and Babylonian Talmud Avodah Zarah 18b. In one case she paskinned din on &quot;klaustra&quot; a rare Greek word referring to an object, used in the Talmud, unfortunately Rabbi Yehudah Hanassi did not believe women could be credited with paskining din, as it says 'do not speak too much to women' (Tannah Rabbi Jesse the Galilean), and therefore credited the law to Rabbi Joshua who may have been her father.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Keylim 11:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Beruryah however was actually remembered with great respect in the Talmud where she is lauded to have been reputed as such a genius that she studied “three hundred Halachot from three hundred sages in just one day” (Pesachim 62b). Clearly contradicting the injunction against women studying Torah.

===Rashi's Daughters===
Rashi had no sons and taught the Mishnah and Talmud to his daughters, until they knew it by heart as Jewish tradition teaches,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rashisdaughters.com/&lt;/ref&gt; they then transferred their knowledge of original Mishnah commentary to the Ashkenazi men of the next generation.

===Haim Yosef David Azulai, AKA 'The Hid'aa'===
The [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Hida]], wrote (Tuv Ayin, no. 4) woman should not study Mishnah only if they do not want to.'We cannot force a woman to learn, like we do to boys'. However, if she wants to learn then not only may she do so on her own, but men may originally teach her, and she can then teach other women if they so choose. According to the Hida, the prohibition against teaching women does not apply to a motivated woman or girl. Other Mizrahi Rabbis disputed this with him.

His response to detractors was that indeed, in truth, there is a prohibition against teaching Mishnah to any student—male or female—who one knows is not properly prepared and motivated, referred to a talmid she-eino hagun (Shulhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 246:7). Babylonian Talmud Berakhos 28a relates that Rabban Gamliel would announce that any student who is not pure enough so that 'his outer self is like his inner self' may not enter the study hall. While this approach, requiring absolute purity, was rejected by other ancient Rabbis, for example 'he who is not for the name of God, will become for the name of God', and a middle approach was adopted by Jews as standard. If one has knowledge that a particular Mishnayot student is definitely bad then he may not be taught. He claimed that 'it seems that for women there is a higher standard and she must be motivated in order to have this permission to learn' in his response to the Mizrahi tradition.

===Yisrael Meir Kagan===
{{Main|Yisrael Meir Kagan}}
One of the most important Ashkenazic rabbanim of the past century was Meir Kagan, or the Chofetz Haim. Has made it clear that Jews can no longer get away with sexist teachings after the [[industrial revolution]] and [[feminism]].{{quote|
&quot;It would appear that all [these sexist laws] were intended for earlier generations when everyone dwelt in the place of their familial ancestral home and ancestral tradition was very powerful among all to follow the path of their fathers... under such circumstances we could maintain that a woman not study Mishnayos and, for guidance, rely on her righteous parents, but presently, due to our myriad sins, ancestral tradition has become exceptionally weak and it is common that people do not dwell in proximity to the family home, and especially those women who devote themselves to mastering the vernacular, surely it is a now a great mitzvah to teach them Scripture and the ethical teachings of our sages such as Pirkei Avos, Menoras Ha-Ma'or and the like so that they will internalize our sacred faith because [if we do not do so] they are prone to abandon the path of God and violate all principles of [our] faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Likkutei Halachos, Sotah p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Joseph Solevetchik===
Rabbi Yoseph Solevetchik 'amened' the teachings of The Hafetz Haim. Rabbi Solevetchik taught all religious Ashkenazi Jews with the exception of hardline Hasidim, not should, or if they show motivation, but must teach their female children Gemarah like the boy school children. He among others fully institutionlized the teaching of Mishnah and Talmud to girls, from an autobiography on him by Rabbi Mayor Twersky called &quot;A Glimpse of the Rav&quot; in R. Menachem Genack ed., Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Man of Halacha, Man of Faith, page 113: {{quote|&quot;The halakha prohibiting Torah study for women is not indiscriminate or all-encompassing. There is complete unanimity that women are obligated to study halakhot pertaining to mitsvot which are incumbent upon them... The prohibition of teaching Torah she-Ba'al Pe to women relates to optional study. If ever circumstances dictate that study of Torah sh-Ba'al Pe is necessary to provide a firm foundation for faith, such study becomes obligatory and obviously lies beyond the pale of any prohibition.&quot; Undoubtedly, the Rav's prescription was more far-reaching that that of the Hafets Hayim and others. But the difference in magnitude should not obscure their fundamental agreement [on changing the attitudes Halachically].}}

It is unclear, according to J. Sussman (Mehqerei Talmud III), whether there was any writing connected to the Oral Law, or whether it was entirely oral. Over time, different traditions of the Oral Law came into being, raising debates about what the laws or their rulings were. According to the ''Mevo Hatalmud'' many rulings were given about specific things that could have been taken out of context or where a ruling was revisited but the second ruling was not as popularly known. To correct this, Rabbi Yehuda haNasi took up the redaction of the Mishnah. If something was already there with no conflict, he used it without changes in language, he reordered and ruled on where there was conflict, and clarified where context was not given. The idea was not do this at his own discretion, but rather to examine the tradition as far back as he could, and only supplement as required.

{{Main|Karaite Judaism}}
Some Jews did not accept the written codification of the oral law at all; known as [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]], they comprised a significant portion of the world Jewish population in the 10th and 11th Centuries CE, and remain extant, though they currently number in the thousands.

==Mishnah Study==

===Textual variants===
The earliest printed edition of the Mishnah was published in Naples (&quot;the Napoli edition&quot;). There have been many subsequent editions, including the late nineteenth century Vilna edition, which is the basis of the editions now used by the religious public.

As well as being printed on its own, the Mishnah is included in all editions of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. Each paragraph is printed on its own, and followed by the relevant Gemara discussion. However, that discussion itself often cites the Mishnah line by line. While the text printed in paragraph form has generally been standardized to follow the Vilna edition, the text cited line by line often preserves important variants, which sometimes reflect the readings of older manuscripts.

The nearest approach to a critical edition is that of [[Hanoch Albeck]].  There is also an edition by [[Yosef Qafiḥ]] of the Mishnah together with the commentary of [[Maimonides]], which compares the base text used by Maimonides with the Napoli and [[Vilna]] editions and other sources.

The Mishnah was and still is traditionally studied through ''recitation'' (out loud). Many medieval manuscripts of the Mishnah are vowelized, and some of these contain partial Tiberian [[cantillation]]. Jewish communities around the world preserved local melodies for chanting the Mishnah, and distinctive ways of pronouncing its words.

Most vowelized editions of the Mishnah today reflect standard [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] vowelization, and often contain mistakes. The Albeck edition of the Mishnah was vowelized by Hanokh Yellin, who made careful eclectic use of both medieval manuscripts and current oral traditions of pronunciation from Jewish communities all over the world. The Albeck edition includes an introduction by Yellin detailing his eclectic method.

Two institutes at the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem have collected major oral archives which hold (among other things) extensive recordings of Jews chanting the Mishnah using a variety of melodies and many different kinds of pronunciation. These institutes are the Jewish Oral Traditions Research Center and the National Voice Archives (the ''Phonoteca'' at the Jewish National and University Library). See below for external links.

===Commentaries===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Maimonides]] --&gt;
*The two main commentaries on the Mishnah are the Babylonian Talmud and the Yerushalmi Talmud. Neither work covers the whole Mishnah, but each work is on about 50%-70% of the text. The reason that the Talmud is not usually viewed as a commentary on the Mishnah, is because it also has many other goals, and can get involved in long tangential discussions. However, the main purpose of the Talmud is as a commentary on the Mishna.

*In 1168, [[Maimonides]] published a comprehensive commentary on the Mishnah. It was written in transliterated [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (using [[Hebrew]] letters) and was one of the first commentaries of its kind. In it, &quot;Rambam&quot; condenses the associated [[Gemara|Talmudical debates]], and offers his [[Posek|conclusions]] in a number of undecided issues. Of particular significance are the various introductory sections – as well as the introduction to the work itself&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/hakdama/tohen-m-2.htm Daat.ac.il]&lt;/ref&gt; – these are widely quoted in other works on the Mishnah, and on the [[Oral law]] in general. Perhaps the most famous is his introduction to the tenth chapter of tractate Sanhedrin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/rambam/hakdamat-2.htm Daat.ac.il]&lt;/ref&gt; where he enumerates the [[Maimonides#The 13 principles of faith|thirteen fundamental beliefs]] of [[Judaism]]. The work has been translated a number of times. Rabbi [[Yosef Qafiḥ]]'s translation was popular in the twentieth century, but a recent translation by ''Machon MaOhr'' offers much more comprehensive footnotes.

*Rabbi [[Samson of Sens]] ([[France]]) was, apart from Maimonides, one of the few rabbis of the early medieval era to compose a Mishnah commentary on some tractates. It is printed in many editions of the Mishnah. It is interwoven with his commentary on major parts of the Tosefta.

*The [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]]'s commentary on some tractates

*The [[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]]'s commentary on most of the Mishnah

*Rabbi [[Obadiah ben Abraham]] of [[Bertinoro]] (15th century) wrote one of the most popular Mishnah commentaries. He draws on Maimonides' work but also offers Talmudical material (in effect a summary of the [[gemara|Talmudic discussion]]) largely following the commentary of [[Rashi]]. In addition to its role as a commentary on the Mishnah, this work is often referenced by students of Talmud as a review-text, and is often referred to as &quot;the ''Bartenura''&quot; or &quot;the ''Ra'V''&quot;.

*After the [[Maharal of Prague]] had initiated organised Mishnah study (''Chevrat ha-Mishnayoth''), [[Yomtov Lipman Heller]] (who is often believed to be his pupil but came to Prague already as a mature scholar) wrote a commentary called ''Tosafot Yom Tov.'' In the introduction Heller says that his aim is to make additions ([[tosafoth]]) to Bertinoro’s commentary. The glosses are sometimes quite detailed and analytic. That is why it is sometimes compared to the [[Tosafot]] – discussions of Babylonian gemara by French and German scholars of the 12th–13th centuries. In many compact Mishnah printings, a condensed version of his commentary, titled ''Ikar Tosafot Yom Tov'', is featured.

*Other [[Acharonim]] who have written Mishnah commentaries:
**The Melechet Shlomo (Rav Shelomo Adeni)
**The [[Vilna Gaon]] (''Shenot Eliyahu'' on parts of the Mishnah, and glosses ''Eliyaho Rabba'', ''Chidushei HaGra'', ''Meoros HaGra'')
**Rabbi [[Akiva Eiger]] (glosses, rather than a commentary)
**The ''Mishnah Rishonah'' on ''Zeraim'' and the ''Mishnah Acharonah'' on ''Tehorot'' (Rav Efrayim Yitzchok from Premishla)
**The ''Sidrei Tehorot'' on ''Kelim'' and ''Ohalot'' (the commentary on the rest of ''Tehorot'' and on ''Eduyot'' is lost) by the Grand Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner, the Radziner Rebbe
** The ''Gulot Iliyot'' (Rav Dov Ber Lifshitz) on ''Mikvaot''
**The ''Ahavat Eitan'' by Rav Avrohom Abba Krenitz (the great grandfather of Rav [[Malkiel Kotler]])
**The ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' on ''Zeraim'' and ''Tehorot''

*A prominent commentary from the 19th century is ''Tiferet Yisrael'' by Rabbi [[Israel Lipschitz]]. It is subdivided into two parts, one more general and the other more analytical, titled ''Yachin'' and ''Boaz'' respectively (after two large pillars in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]). Although Rabbi Lipschutz has faced some controversy in certain Hasidic circles, he was greatly respected by such sages as [[Akiva Eiger|Rabbi Akiva Eiger]], whom he frequently cites, and is widely accepted in the [[Yeshiva]] world. The ''Tiferet Yaakov'' is an important gloss on the ''Tiferet Yisrael''.

*A popular commentary was written in Yiddish by Dr. Symcha Petrushka. Its vocalization is supposed to be of high quality.

*The commentary by Rabbi [[Pinhas Kehati]], which is written in [[Hebrew language#Modern Hebrew|Modern Israeli Hebrew]] and based on classical and contemporary works, has become popular in the late Twentieth Century. The commentary is designed to make the Mishnah widely accessible to a wide spectrum of learners of all ages and all levels of experience in Torah study. It is popularly referred to as &quot;Kehati&quot;. Each tractate is introduced with an overview of its contents, including historical and legal background material, and each Mishnah is prefaced by a thematic introduction. The current version of this edition is printed with the Bartenura commentary as well as Kehati's.

*The encyclopedic editions put out by ''Mishnat Rav Aharon'' (''Beis Medrosho Govoah'', Lakewood) on ''Sheviit'', ''Challah'', and ''Yadayim''.

*The above-mentioned edition edited by Hanokh Albeck and vocalized by Hanokh Yellin (1952–59) includes the former's extensive commentary on each Mishnah, as well as introductions to each tractate (Masekhet) and order (Seder).  This commentary tends to focus on the meaning of the mishnayot themselves, without as much reliance on the Gemara's interpretation and is, therefore, considered valuable as a tool for the study of Mishnah as an independent work. It is currently out of print.

*Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Ginsburg]] wrote a commentary looking for the ethical messages found within the text in his &quot;Musar HaMishnah&quot;. The commentary appears for the entire text except for [[Tehorot]] and [[Kodashim]]. Using the text itself and various halachic rulings, Ginsburg finds hidden meaning in the text. It is currently out of print, though it is available for free online.

===As a historical source===
Both the Mishnah and Talmud contain little serious biographical studies of the people discussed therein, and the same tractate will conflate the points of view of many different people. Yet, sketchy biographies of the Mishnaic sages can often be constructed with historical detail from Talmudic and [[Midrash]]ic sources.

Many modern historical scholars have focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah. A vital question is whether it is composed of sources which date from its editor's lifetime, and to what extent is it composed of earlier, or later sources. Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and in what ways do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism? Can these early sources be identified, and if so, how? In response to these questions, modern scholars have adopted a number of different approaches.

*Some scholars hold that there has been extensive editorial reshaping of the stories and statements within the Mishnah (and later, in the Talmud.) Lacking outside confirming texts, they hold that we cannot confirm the origin or date of most statements and laws, and that we can say little for certain about their authorship. In this view, the questions above are impossible to answer. See, for example, the works of [[Louis Jacobs]], Baruch M. Bokser, [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], Steven D. Fraade.

*Some scholars hold that the Mishnah and Talmud have been extensively shaped by later editorial redaction, but that it contains sources which we can identify and describe with some level of reliability. In this view, sources can be identified to some extent because each era of history and each distinct geographical region has its own unique feature, which one can trace and analyze. Thus, the questions above may be analyzed. See, for example, the works of Goodblatt, Lee Levine, David C. Kraemer and Robert Goldenberg.

*Some scholars hold that many or most of the statements and events described in the Mishnah and Talmud usually occurred more or less as described, and that they can be used as serious sources of historical study. In this view, historians do their best to tease out later editorial additions (itself a very difficult task) and skeptically view accounts of miracles, leaving behind a reliable historical text. See, for example, the works of [[Saul Lieberman]], [[David Weiss Halivni]], Avraham Goldberg and Dov Zlotnick.

==Cultural references==
The most notable literary work on the composition of the Mishnah is probably [[Milton Steinberg]]'s novel [[As a Driven Leaf]].
