The '''Sermon on the Mount''' ([[anglicized]] from the Matthean [[Vulgate]] Latin section title: ''Sermo in monte'') is a collection of sayings and teachings of  [[Jesus]], which emphasizes his [[Christian morality|moral teaching]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (chapters [[Matthew 5|5]], [[Matthew 6|6]] and [[Matthew 7|7]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;&quot;Sermon on the Mount.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of The Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first of the [[Five Discourses of Matthew]] and takes place relatively early in the [[Ministry of Jesus]] after he has been [[Baptism of Jesus|baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] and preached in [[Galilee]].

The Sermon is the longest piece of teaching from Jesus in the [[New Testament]], and has been one of the most widely quoted elements of the [[Canonical Gospels]].&lt;ref name=VaughtPref /&gt;
It includes some of the best known teachings of Jesus such as the [[Beatitudes]], and the widely recited [[Lord's Prayer]]. To most believers in Jesus, the Sermon on the Mount contains the central tenets of [[Christian discipleship]].&lt;ref name=VaughtPref /&gt;

The [[Matthew 5:48|last verse of chapter 5]] is considered to be a focal point that summarizes the teaching of the sermon: &quot;be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect&quot;, advising the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] or students to seek the path towards [[Christian perfection|perfection]] and the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref name=Vaught7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Talbert78 /&gt;

==Context and components==

===Background and setting===
[[File:Papyrus 1 - recto.jpg|thumb|upright|A page from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], from [[Papyrus 1]], c. 250]]
{{See also|Ministry of Jesus}}
The Sermon on the Mount is the longest piece of teaching from Jesus in the [[New Testament]], and occupies chapters [[Matthew 5|5]], [[Matthew 6|6]] and [[Matthew 7|7]] of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. The Sermon has been one of the most widely quoted elements of the [[Canonical Gospels]].&lt;ref name=VaughtPref &gt;''The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation'' by Carl G. Vaught 2001 ISBN 978-0-918954-76-3 pages xi-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; To most believers in Jesus, the Sermon contains the central tenets of Christian discipleship.&lt;ref name=VaughtPref /&gt;

This is the first of the ''[[Five Discourses of Matthew]]'', the other four being [[Matthew 10]], [[Matthew 13]] (1-53), [[Matthew 18]] and the [[Olivet discourse]] in Matthew 24.&lt;ref name=Kellum194 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 ISBN 978-0-8054-4365-3 pages 194-196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Craig S. Keener 2009 ISBN 978-0-8028-6498-7 pages 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Preaching Matthew's Gospel'' by Richard A. Jensen 1998 ISBN 978-0-7880-1221-1 pages 25 &amp; 158&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sermon takes place relatively early in the [[Ministry of Jesus]], after he has been [[Baptism of Jesus|baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] in chapter 3 of Matthew and gathered his first disciples in chapter 4.

Before this episode, Jesus had been &quot;all about [[Galilee]]&quot; preaching, as in [[Matthew 4:23]], and &quot;great crowds followed him&quot; from all around the area. The setting for the sermon is given in [[Matthew 5:1]]-[[Matthew 5:2|2]]. Jesus sees the multitudes, goes up into the mountain, is followed by his disciples, and begins to preach.

While the issue of the exact theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount is subject to debate among scholars, specific components within it, each associated with particular teachings, can be identified.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WCarter /&gt;

[[File:Meister des Lehrbuchs Kaiser Maximilians I. 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Lord's Prayer]], in [[Matthew 6:9]], 1500, Vienna]]
[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:3|Matthew 5:3-12]] discusses the [[Beatitudes]]. These describe the character of the people of the [[Kingdom of God]], expressed as &quot;blessings&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In Matthew, there are eight (or nine) blessings, while in Luke there are four, followed by four woes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Beatitudes.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In almost all cases the phrases used in the Beatitudes are familiar from an [[Old Testament]] context, but in the sermon Jesus elevates them to new teachings.&lt;ref name=Haste /&gt; Together, the Beatitudes present a new set of ideals that focus on love and humility rather than force and exaction; they echo the highest ideals of Jesus' teachings on spirituality and compassion.&lt;ref name=Haste &gt;''A Dictionary Of The Bible'' by James Hastings 2004 ISBN 1-4102-1730-2 page 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian teachings, the [[Works of Mercy]], which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy.&lt;ref name=Peace &gt;''Jesus the Peacemaker'' by Carol Frances Jegen 1986 ISBN 0-934134-36-7 pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name=Synop &gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 ISBN 1-931018-31-6, pages 63-68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:13|Matthew 5:13-16]] presents the metaphors of [[Salt and Light]]. This completes the profile of God's people presented in the beatitudes, and acts as the introduction to the next section.

There are two parts in this section, using the terms &quot;salt of the earth&quot; and [[Light of the World]] to refer to the disciples - implying their value. Elsewhere in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#8:12|John 8:12]] Jesus applies Light of the World to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Spear, ''Names and Titles of the Lord Jesus Christ'', 2003 ISBN 0-7661-7467-0 page 226&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest discourse in the Sermon is [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:17|Matthew 5:17-48]], traditionally referred to as ''the [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|Antitheses]]'' or ''Matthew's Antitheses'' though [[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry]] disputes that title.&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on Matthew'', Robert H. Gundry, Baker Academic 2011, ''Matthew 5:21-48'': &quot;The sayings are traditionally called &quot;the Antitheses.&quot; But this designation seems to imply that after stoutly affirming the Law in 5:17-20, Jesus contradicts it. We'll see on the contrary that he escalates it. He takes the Law up to the goal toward which it was already headed, so that we should stop calling these sayings &quot;the Antitheses&quot; and perhaps start calling them &quot;the Culminations.&quot;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The long form could be: &quot;The Six Antitheses of the Sermon on the Mount&quot;, see [http://www.google.com/search?q=six+antitheses+of+the+sermon+on+the+mount Google &quot;six antitheses of the sermon on the mount&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the discourse Jesus fulfills and reinterprets the [[Old Covenant]] and in particular its [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments]], contrasting with what &quot;you have heard&quot; from others, e.g. [[turning the other cheek]] compared to taking [[an eye for an eye]]. According to most interpretations of [[Matthew 5:17]], [[Matthew 5:18|18]], [[Matthew 5:19|19]], and [[Matthew 5:20|20]], and most [[Christian views on the old covenant|Christian views of the Old Covenant]], these new interpretations of the [[Torah|Law]] and [[Neviim|Prophets]] are not [[antinomianism|opposed to the Old Testament]], which was the position of [[Marcion]], but form Jesus' new teachings which bring about [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]], and hence must be adhered to, as emphasized in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#24:27|Matthew 7:24-27]] towards the end of the sermon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by R. T. France 2007 080282501X pages 1118-1119&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Matthew 6]] Jesus condemns doing what would normally be &quot;[[good works]]&quot; simply for recognition and not from the heart, such as those of [[alms]] (6:1-4), [[prayer]] (6:5-15), and [[fasting]] (6:16-18). The discourse goes on to condemn the superficiality of [[economic materialism|materialism]] and call the disciples not to worry about material needs, but to &quot;seek&quot; [[Kingdom of God|God's kingdom]] first. Within the discourse on ostentation, Matthew presents an example of correct prayer. Luke places this in a different context. The [[Lord's prayer]] (6:9-13) contains parallels to {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|29:10-18}}.&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, T.E. and J., &quot;The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Cornerstone Publications, 2008, p. 451, ISBN 978-0-9778737-1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (2004), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of [[Matthew 7]], i.e. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#7:1|Matthew 7:1-6]] deals with judging. Jesus condemns those who judge others before first judging themselves: &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&quot;

In the last part in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#7:7|Matthew 7:7-29]] Jesus concludes the sermon by warning against [[false prophet]]s, and emphasizing that humans are unable to do right (&quot;bear fruit&quot;) apart from God.

==Teachings and theology==
[[File:Saint Cajetan Church, Gustavo A. Madero, Federal District, Mexico11.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque of the 8 ''[[Beatitudes]]'', St. Cajetan Church, [[Lindavista]], Mexico]]{{cquote2|''be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect'' — [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:48|Matthew 5:48]]&lt;ref name=Vaught7 /&gt;}}

The teachings of the Sermon on the Mount have been a key element of [[Christian ethics]], and for centuries the sermon has acted as a fundamental recipe for the conduct of the followers of Jesus.&lt;ref name=v &gt;''The sources of Christian ethics'' by Servais Pinckaers 1995 ISBN 0-8132-0818-1 page 134&lt;/ref&gt; Various religious and moral thinkers (e.g. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]) have admired its message, and it has been one of the main sources of [[Christian pacifism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Tolstoy, see ''My Religion'', 1885. cf. [[s:My Religion|My Religion]] on Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th century, [[Saint Augustine]] began his book ''[[Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount (Augustine)|Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount]]'' by stating:
: If any one will piously and soberly consider the sermon which our Lord Jesus Christ spoke on the mount, as we read it in the Gospel according to Matthew, I think that he will find in it, so far as regards the highest morals, a perfect standard of the Christian life

The last verse of chapter 5 of Matthew, ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:48|5:48]]) is a focal point of the sermon that summarizes its teachings by advising the disciples to seek perfection.&quot;&lt;ref name=Vaught7 &gt;''The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation'' by Carl G. Vaught 2001 ISBN 978-0-918954-76-3 pages 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''telios'' used to refer to perfection also implies an end, or destination, advising the disciples to seek the path towards perfection and the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref name=Vaught7 /&gt; It teaches that God's children are those who act like God.&lt;ref name=Talbert78 &gt;''Matthew'' by Charles H. Talbert 2010 ISBN 0-8010-3192-3 page 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of the sermon are often referred to as the ''Ethics of the Kingdom'': they place a high level of emphasis on &quot;purity of the heart&quot; and embody the basic standard of Christian [[righteousness]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian ethics, issues and insights'' by Eṃ Stephan 2007 ISBN 81-8069-363-5 page&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological structure===
The issue of the theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount remains unresolved.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 &gt;''Reading the Sermon on the mount:'' by Charles H. Talbert 2004 ISBN 1-57003-553-9 pages 21-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WCarter &gt;''What are they saying about Matthew's Sermon on the mount?'' by Warren Carter 1994 ISBN 0-8091-3473-X pages 35-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DAllison &gt;''The Structure of the Sermon on the Mount'' by Dale Allison, ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' Vol. 106, No. 3, Sep., 1987 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3261066]&lt;/ref&gt; One group of theologians ranging from [[Saint Augustine]] in the 5th century to [[Michael Goulder]] in the 20th century, see the [[Beatitudes]] as the central element of the Sermon.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt; Others such as [[Günther Bornkamm|Bornkamm]] see the Sermon arranged around the [[Lord's prayer]], while [[Daniel Patte]], closely followed by [[Ulrich Luz]], see a [[chiastic structure]] in the sermon.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WCarter /&gt; [[Dale Allison]] has proposed a structure based on triads.&lt;ref name=WCarter /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAllison /&gt; [[Jack Kingsbury]] and [[Hans Dieter Betz]] see the sermon as composed of theological themes, e.g. righteousness or way of life.&lt;ref name=Talbert21 /&gt;

==Analysis and interpretation==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] --&gt;

===Debate over literalness===
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity}}
[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|upright|The Sermon of the Mount as depicted by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] in a [[stained glass window]] at [[Arlington Street Church]] in [[Boston]]]]

One of the most common debates over the sermon is how directly it should be applied to everyday life. Many of the rules Jesus calls for are considered by some to be extreme. At [[Matthew 5:29]] Jesus appears to state that if your vision is leading you to adultery, then you should remove your eye. At [[Matthew 5:40]] Jesus seems to say that if you're sued, you should not fight, but rather give up more than was asked for. These are considered by some to be challenging rules to apply to life. Many Christian groups have developed nonliteral ways to interpret and apply the sermon. Denominations like the [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]] believe in a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Craig S. Keener]] has pointed out that at least 65 different interpretations regarding the message of the Sermon exist.&lt;ref name= Keener160 &gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Craig S. Keener 2009 ISBN 978-0-8028-6498-7 page 160&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey King McArthur lists twelve of the basic schools of thought on these issues as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;McArthur, Harvey King 1978&quot;&gt;McArthur, Harvey King. ''Understanding the Sermon on the Mount.'' Westport: Greenwood Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The ''Absolutist View'' rejects all compromise and believes that, if obeying the scripture costs the welfare of the believer, then that is a reasonable sacrifice for [[salvation]]. All the precepts in the sermon must be taken literally and applied universally. Proponents of this view include [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] and in later life [[Leo Tolstoy]]. The [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es fully adopt this position; among Radical Reformation groups, the early [[Anabaptist]]s came close, and modern Anabaptist groups such as the [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]] come closest. More recently, this view is supported by [[Franz Alt]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Franz Alt (Journalist)|Franz Alt]], ''Frieden isr möglich. Die Politik der Bergpredigt.'', 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James W. Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;James W. Douglass, see his [[James W. Douglass#Bibliography|bibliography]].&lt;/ref&gt;
#One method that is common, but not endorsed by any denomination, is to simply ''modify the text'' of the sermon. In ancient times this took the form of actually altering the text of the sermon to make it more palatable. Thus some early copyists changed [[Matthew 5:22]] from &quot;whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment&quot; to the watered-down &quot;whosoever is angry with his brother ''without a cause'' shall be in danger of the judgment.&quot; &quot;[[Love your enemies]]&quot; was changed to &quot;Pray for your enemies&quot; in [[Oxyrhynchus Gospels|pOxy]] 1224 6:1a; [[Didache|''Did.'']] 1:3; [[Polycarp|Pol. ''Phil.'']] 12:3. {{bibleverse||John|13:34-35}} tells the disciples to [[The New Commandment|&quot;Love one another&quot;]]. The exception for divorce at [[Matthew 5:32]] in the case of ''[[porneia]]'' may be a Matthean addition;&lt;ref&gt;Instone-Brewer, David. ''Divorce and Remarriage in the Bible: The Social and Literary Context.'' Grand Rapids: W.B. Eerdmans, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not present in Luke 16:18, Mark 10:11, or 1 Cor 7:10&amp;ndash;11; and in 1 Cor 7:12&amp;ndash;16, [[Pauline privilege|Paul gives his own exceptions to Jesus' teaching]]. Additions were made to the [[Lord's Prayer]] to support other doctrines, and other prayers were developed as substitute. More common in recent centuries is to paraphrase the Sermon and in so doing make it far less radical. A search through the writings of almost every major Christian writer finds them at some point to have made this modification. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}&lt;ref&gt;This claim is presumably from the book by McArthur cited for this entire section, however, a page reference would be nice here, as would examples of this claim.&lt;/ref&gt;
#One of the most common views is the ''Hyperbole View'', which argues that portions of what Jesus states in the Sermon are [[hyperbole]], and that if one is to apply the teaching to the real world, they need to be &quot;toned down.&quot; Most interpreters agree that there is some hyperbole in the sermon, with [[Matthew 5:29]] being the most prominent example, but there is disagreement over exactly which sections should not be taken literally.
#Closely related is the ''general principles view'' that argues that Jesus was not giving specific instructions, but general principles of how one should behave. The specific instances cited in the sermon are simply examples of these general principles.
#The ''double standard view'' is the official position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It divides the teachings of the sermon into general precepts and [[Evangelical counsels|specific counsels]]. Obedience to the general precepts is essential for [[Salvation (Christianity)#Catholic teaching on Salvation|salvation]], but obedience to the counsels is only necessary for [[Christian perfection#Roman Catholic teaching|perfection]]. The great mass of the population need only concern themselves with the precepts; the counsels must be followed by only a pious few such as the [[clergy]] and [[monk]]s. This theory was initiated by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and later fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]], though an early version of it is cited in ''[[Didache|Did.]]'' 6:2, &quot;For if you are able to bear the entire yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able to do this, do what you are able&quot; (Roberts-Donaldson), and reflected in the ''Apostolic Decree'' of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|15:19-21}}). [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] also did much to popularize this view among speakers of English with his [[Canterbury Tales]] (''Wife of Bath's Prologue'', v. 117-118)
#[[Martin Luther]] rejected the Roman Catholic approach and developed a different two-level system McArthur refers to as the ''two realms view''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McArthur, Harvey King 1978&quot;/&gt; Luther divided the world into the religious and secular realms and argued that the Sermon only applied to the spiritual. In the temporal world, obligations to family, employers, and country force believers to compromise. Thus a judge should follow his secular obligations to sentence a criminal, but inwardly, he should mourn for the fate of the criminal.
#At the same time as the [[Protestant Reformation]] was underway, a new era of [[biblical criticism]] began leading to the ''Analogy of Scripture View''. Close reading of the Bible found that several of the most rigid precepts in the sermon were moderated by other parts of the New Testament. For instance, while Jesus seems to forbid all [[oath]]s, Paul is shown using them at least twice; thus the prohibition in the Sermon may seem to have some exceptions; though in fairness to Paul, it should be pointed out that he was not present at the Sermon on the Mount and may not have been aware of all of its teachings. See also [[Pauline Christianity]].
#In the nineteenth century, several more interpretations developed. [[Wilhelm Herrmann]] embraced the notion of ''attitudes not acts'', which can be traced back to Augustine. This view states that Jesus in the Sermon is not saying how a good Christian should behave, only what his attitude is. The spirit lying behind the act is more important than the act itself.
#[[Albert Schweitzer]] popularized the ''interim ethic view''. This view sees Jesus as being convinced that the world was going to end in the very near future. As such, survival in the world did not matter as in the [[end times]] material well-being would be irrelevant.
#In the twentieth century another major German thinker, [[Martin Dibelius]], presented another view also based on [[eschatology]]. His ''unconditional Divine will view'' is that the ethics behind the sermon are absolute and unbending, but the current [[Fall of Man|fallen state of the world]] makes it impossible to live up to them. Humans are bound to attempt to live up to them, but failure is inevitable. This will change when the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] is proclaimed and all will be able to live in a godly manner. A similar view is also described in Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', written in the late nineteenth century.
#Closely linked to this is the ''repentance view'', which is that Jesus intended for the precepts in his Sermon to be unattainable, and through our certain failure to live up to them, we will learn to [[repent]] or that we will be driven to faith in the [[Law and Gospel|Gospel]].
#Another ''eschatological view'' is that of modern dispensationalism. [[Dispensationalism]], first developed by the [[Plymouth Brethren]], divides human history into a series of ages or dispensations. Today we live in the period of [[Divine Grace|grace]] where living up to the teachings of the sermon is impossible, but in the future, the [[Millennium]] will see a period where it is possible to live up to the teachings of the sermon, and where following them will be a prerequisite to salvation.

===Comparison with the Sermon on the Plain===
While Matthew groups Jesus' teachings into sets of similar material, the same material is scattered when found in Luke.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; The Sermon on the Mount may be compared with the similar but more succinct [[Sermon on the Plain]] as recounted by the [[Gospel of Luke]] (6:17–49), which occurs at the same moment in Luke's narrative, and also features Jesus heading up a mountain, but giving the sermon on the way down at a level spot. Some scholars believe that they are the same sermon, while others hold that Jesus frequently preached similar themes in different places.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2004, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with other teachings===
Although modern parallels between the teachings of Jesus such as the Sermon on the Mount and some [[Buddhist]] teachings have been drawn, these comparisons emerged after missionary contacts in the 19th century, and there is no historically reliable evidence of contacts between Buddhism and Jesus during his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: The Complete Guide'' 2006 by Leslie Houlden ISBN 082648011X page 140&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarship has almost unanimously agreed that claims of the travels of Jesus to Tibet, Kashmir or India and the influence of Buddhism on his teachings are without historical basis.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000).
