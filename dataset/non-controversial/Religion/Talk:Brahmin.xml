== Arya is not a tribe. ==

,,,My friend you will never understand because you never try to undenstand.All your knowledge is based on imparial victorian writer who where trying to justify colonisation.Arya is not a tribe it is a word for nobel in india it has nothing to do with complexion.western scholers says that human originated in africa and from there they travel to other parts of the world.They were black due to there natural condition.so white complaxtion has nothing to do with with brahmins or arya.naver trust the book try to explore the truth yourself.After all knowledge is all about keep learning not geting degree only.knowledge and degree is diffrant thing.--[[User:Nkatyan|Nkatyan]] ([[User talk:Nkatyan|talk]]) 10:29, 19 June 2011 (UTC)

:: Arya and the word Mia(n) mean the same thing &quot;Gentleman&quot; in modern day perspective , first one in Indian language and second one in Arabic.Maxmuller the German scholar made the things worse by making it a symbol of purity and transforming it to Aryan , a stupid proposition followed by the worst by his own countryman : whole world knows that.He was  absolutely unaware of Indian social system. And Brahmin is a professional group associated with certain kinds of profession. But the name most probably came from the &quot;Brahman&quot; of Vedas.And the glory of these old writings went to those who studied and used it for their livelihood  and the composers were made rubbish.The most unfortunate incidence was justified with the  introduction of another stupid term &quot;Aupouresheo&quot;. Regarding colour , any one can verify that 70%(minimum) of Brahmin population is black or dark.[[User:Rnibaraj|Rnibaraj]] ([[User talk:Rnibaraj|talk]]) 14:13, 12 January 2012 (UTC)

== Varna discussions ==

This is a continuation of the discussions from the [[Talk:Kamma_(caste)|Kamma (Caste)]] page. As mentioned therein, a discussion is required on how various groups came to be designated dvijas from the historical pov. So to begin with, let each group mentioned in the sections of 'pancha-gauda brahmins' and 'pancha-dravida brahmins' in this article put forth proof of the earliest dates since when they were referred to as brahmins in epigraphies / inscriptions. &lt;br&gt;
Additionally, &lt;br&gt;
1) This article mentions 'brahmins' as &quot;scholars, teachers, fire priests&quot;. Such a generalized representation is incorrect. The article also needs to take into recognition that people were in different occupations first, and upon gaining positions of power and wealth, have claimed brahmin-hood and kshatriya-hood.&lt;br&gt;
2) This article states that &quot;''brahmins, in modern usage of the term, are further divided into various sub-castes''&quot;. This is incorrect. The term 'brahmin' is a varna, not some caste which can be divided into sub-castes. Moreover historically tribal priests elevated into brahminhood in different parts of the country are unrelated to one another, so it would be obfuscation to claim that each of those groups are sub-castes. &lt;br&gt;
3) The section on &quot;Gotras and Pravaras&quot; in this article concentrates only on biological descent. Please add content on spiritual descent also (elaborate on the rishi-shishya parampara), and also add content on the puranic origin of gotras, as well as the effects of Buddhism on the concept of gotras. &lt;br&gt;
4) In the &quot;Practices&quot; section of this articles, vegetarianism has been mentioned. This is incorrect as eastern-indian 'brahmins' consume fish, and communities claiming to be brahmins were consuming non-vegetarian diet even in the colonial period. If a consensus is reached on how to represent the article, i would gladly add the relevant into to this article.&lt;br&gt;
5) The section on &quot;Brahmins in other religions&quot; requires clean-up. because the context of who is a brahmin in Buddhism is different from the hindu version.  &lt;br&gt; Thanks. --[[User:Mayasutra|= No &amp;#124;&amp;#124;&amp;#124; Illusion =]] ([[User talk:Mayasutra|talk]]) 04:55, 29 July 2011 (UTC)Mayasutra

There are a lot of dead links throughout the page. Are all of these really notable and will be made or can some be taken out?

== CHANDALAclarification ==

First of all i'm a chandala not belonging to any of four varnas of hinduism.
so i'm completely impartial.
these are the reasons for my previous edits
1.The person who has written this article did a blunder by using 'the' article before all other groups and neglecting the outcaste(chandala).
2.I have removed 'Only few in number' because there is no mention of any number any any source so words such as 'few' or many cannot be used here.
3. &quot;not by caste but by title / pre-fix accorded to him by the well-read in general in those days&quot;, this has been removed because caste and varnas are not the same thing , varna is a spiritual and religious concept but caste is a social one. The person who added these lines should first understand the social system of vedic india. In the early vedic(rig vedic) period hereditary was not given importance individuals were considered equal irrespective of their birth.The concept of class or caste evolved later.  
4.The word &quot;rural&quot; has been added because in urban india most of the population is educated.
 i.e. the people are aware of constitution of india, which says
Article 19 {Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.}

All citizens shall have the right -
to freedom of speech and expression;
to assemble peaceably and without arms;
to form associations or unions;
to move freely throughout the territory of India;
to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; and
*** (repealed)
to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

Article 17 {Abolition of Untouchability}

&quot;Untouchability&quot; is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of &quot;Untouchability&quot; shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.

the person who are aware of these articles know that every citizen of india is equal irrespective of his birth and gender. The people who don't know this are uneducated , backward and rural because in ruaral india litreacy rate is very low.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Outcasteofindia|Outcasteofindia]] ([[User talk:Outcasteofindia|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Outcasteofindia|contribs]]) 18:26, 4 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:What does rural have to do with it, and do you have a source that shows this?  I'm also not seeing what the constitution of India has to do with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahmin&amp;diff=505773687&amp;oldid=505307252 these changes], because what you've said above about a constitution doesn't mean that previous information about this article's subject is nullified.  Do you have any sources that can verify these changes? - [[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]][[User_talk:SudoGhost#top|Ghost]] 18:41, 4 August 2012 (UTC)


[[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]] my brahmin friend first try to understand that we are living in an independent republic secular country called INDIA, it got independence 65 years ago. It is not the british period that caste based discrimination going to be there, india has got its own constitution which treats all its citizen equal irrespective of there caste, religion,creed and gender.
You will agree that the person who is literate knows India's constitution well and will not follow casteism( regard brahmin superior to all ), I am providing you a link of pdf file from census of india website denoting denoting literacy rates in the rural and urban India.


I expect a bit of brain from you and for gods sake please kindly be impartial while reading this pdf file and forming an opinion. You will find there is a great rural urban literacy gap which has diminished to an extent over the period of time but still a comprehensive gap still exists.

LINK: http://wwww.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov.../data.../india/Rural_Urban_2011.pdf

I am also providing you certain articles from the leading websites that may give you the clear view of feudalistic system(brahmins considered superior in which) that prevailed in rural India and roots of which still exist in minds of people there.

      http://www.promiseofreason.com/increasing-caste-divide-in-rural-india/
      http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/article2913662.ece
and if you want more references and material please google :casteism in rural vs urban india

now you have to apply  bit of your brain, you have to infer that this casteism(superiority of brahmins) is only due to the lack of education i.e. illiteracy i.e  non awarence of indian constitution and still prevailing past thinking.This is mostly in village (rural) india because in urban areas there are no caste and religion specific villages. In urban centres people with the different backgrounds and castes live next to next.  
So after all  this i'm sure that you would be having a clear insight of the reality.

Now a my personal message to you see we all indians are brothers and sisters or you may call a large family called India. Can't you change your mind for the sake of well being of members of your family. The birth into a brahmin family does not signify that the person will always going to be good and Birth into an outcaste family does not mean that that person going to be bad. Why are you creating a divide by writing brahmin superior to other. Are others not human being then?
The thoughts which you are expressing through this article on brahmin article is not going to do any good of Developing country like India. It's going to misguide the people and will retard the development rate of our country. As soon as a person born in a non brahmin caste is aware of the caste beliefs( he is inferior to brahmin) he starts hating is birth , his family, his society and finally India.
The caste system is prominent reason for the drain of brain to the americas and the europe , political instability and backwardness  of India due to the fact that we are still unable to a achieve a true democracy due to improper application of our constitution. And if you are still unmoved on the fact that brahims are superior then your are certainly unethical and unconstitutional.
No one else but god can help you.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Outcasteofindia|Outcasteofindia]] ([[User talk:Outcasteofindia|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Outcasteofindia|contribs]]) 13:05, 6 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Well, for one I'm not &quot;brahmin&quot;, nor am I Indian in any way.  What you're saying on this talk page and what you're editing in the article are not the same.  There is nothing you've edited that has ''anything'' to do with the constitution of India, or &quot;inferiority&quot; of anyone, nor does the article say anything about this, and you cannot retroactively &quot;correct&quot; past views on something.  Here's a bit of advice though: telling someone to &quot;use their brain&quot; isn't going to make people eager to agree with you. - [[User:SudoGhost|Sudo]][[User_talk:SudoGhost#top|Ghost]] 02:03, 7 August 2012 (UTC)</text>
