==Individualism==

It seems to me that the following section is just one interpretation of Amish humility (and individualism for that matter).  (Also, there doesn't seem to be much on Amish theology.)

&quot;The Amish's willingness to submit to the Will of God, expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Amish anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on community. Modern innovations like electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity.&quot; 00:26, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

:I was wondering how they determined what technology is forbidden. After all, even the most primitive farm implement is &quot;labor-saving&quot;. So is using a horse and cart instead of walking.

==Medical Expences==

&quot;In 1997, Mary Kuepfer, a young Amish woman in Milverton, Ontario, Canada, was struck in the face by a beer bottle believed to have been thrown from a passing car;[73] she required thousands of dollars' worth of surgery to her face (which was paid for by an outpouring of donations from the public).&quot;
This doesn't make any sense, if she was canadian then her medical expenses would have been covered there would have been no need for donations from the public??&lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]]comment added by unknown author )&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

==Use of money?==
How would Amish be able to take buses or trains if they don't accept the use/transfer of money?  (Mentioned in the modern technology section.)  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Memprime|Memprime]] ([[User talk:Memprime|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Memprime|contribs]]) 12:24, 27 June 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::David is right, I am a former Amish, and they do not believe in working or exchanging money on Sundays.

==GA Sweeps Review: On Hold==
As part of the [[WP:WGA|WikiProject Good Articles]], we're doing [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps|sweeps]] to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the [[WP:WIAGA|GA criteria]]. I'm specifically going over all of the &quot;Culture and Society&quot; articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a [[WP:GA|Good article]]. However, in reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that need to be addressed. I have made minor corrections and have included several points below that need to be addressed for the article to remain a GA. Please address them within seven days and the article will maintain its GA status. If progress is being made and issues are addressed, the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted. If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at [[WP:GAN]]. If you disagree with any of the issues, leave a comment after the specific issue and I'll be happy to discuss/agree with you. To keep tabs on your progress so far, either strike through the completed tasks or put checks next to them.

#*Reference provided.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amish&amp;diff=223713106&amp;oldid=223572980] That whole paragraph should really be dropped as off-topic and not all that helpful for understanding the topic. &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;✤&lt;/font&gt; [[Special:Contributions/JonHarder|JonHarder]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JonHarder|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:55, 5 July 2008 (UTC)
#&lt;s&gt;&quot;Amman insisted upon this practice, even to the point of expecting a spouse to refuse to eat with the banned member until he/she repented of his/her behaviour.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
#*No source was found that says this directly, but it is a reasonable conclusion and is echoed in current practice. A source providing the background of Anabaptist shunning, including this very argument of spouse shunning, and Ammann's support of the strictest forms is provided.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amish&amp;diff=223541900&amp;oldid=223528991] &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;✤&lt;/font&gt; [[Special:Contributions/JonHarder|JonHarder]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JonHarder|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:11, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
#&lt;s&gt;&quot;Because the Amish are the result of a division with the Mennonites, some consider the Amish a conservative Mennonite group.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
#*This has been addressed by rewording to clarify the relationship between the two groups and providing a source for Amish becoming Mennonites.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amish&amp;diff=223572980&amp;oldid=223541900] &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;✤&lt;/font&gt; [[Special:Contributions/JonHarder|JonHarder]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JonHarder|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:05, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
#&lt;s&gt;&quot;No Old Order movement ever developed in Europe; these communities are all in the Americas.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
#*This statement was dropped. The decline of the Amish in Europe and origination of &quot;Old Order&quot; adequately covered in remainder of the section.

#&lt;s&gt;&quot;It is also the proximate cause for rejecting education beyond the eighth grade, especially speculative study that has little practical use for farm life but may awaken personal and materialistic ambitions.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;
#*This is not an accurate summary of the reason for limiting education.

#&lt;s&gt;&quot;Shunning is also sometimes imposed by bishops on church members guilty of offenses such as using forbidden technology. Church members may also be called to confess before the congregation.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;

#&lt;s&gt;&quot;In the 1970s, for example, a farmer near Milan Center, Indiana, was ordered by his bishop to buy a conventional tractor. He had severe progressive arthritis, and with no sons to harness the horses for him, the tractor was seen as a need, rather than a vanity. The rest of the community continued farming with horses.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;

However, this article has quite a lot of statements of opinion, and implicit statistics, which Wikipedia cannot assert without attributing them to reliable secondary sources.

== Should Heading not be changed to 'Old Order Amish'? ==

Should the heading or title of this Wikipedia article not be changed to 'Old Order Amish' for clarity? A separate entry already exists for 'Amish Mennonite'. In my opinion, this would make this particular article a bit more focused. It should somehow be made clear that all 'Amish' are Amish Mennonites, but not all Amish Mennonites are 'Old Order'. The Old Order Amish are a branch of Amish Mennonites, just as Amish Mennonites are a branch of the Mennonites. Somehow it would be good if this could finally get clarified, with good sources cited. (I hope to work on this.) Names do indeed get confusing, and there is a real need here to get all of this straight. I recognize that many Amish and Mennonites do not even understand these names fully, nor the history of their origins. [[User:Jmichaelx|JMCooper]] ([[User talk:Jmichaelx|talk]]) 18:27, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

I agree, I think it would add to the clarity since the article is about the Old Order Amish and not the Amish in general. I also think a separate section for the Swiss Amish would be helpful as the Swiss Amish not only are more conservative than most Old Order Amish, but they also use a different dialect of German.

== $5? ==

Under education regarding a fine placed upon a Amish family the amount of the fine is said to be $5.

== Religion ==

Not to mention that the whole reason they are there is their religion... it deserves much more emphasis... and I'd definitely agree - more explanation on their theology.

== Popular culture ==

Have removed numerous instances of TV series where individual episodes had storylines including Amish characters; figured that a properly cited article on &quot;Amish in the Media&quot; was enough; these sections become magnets for trivia.

== Beachy Amish are mennonites or Amish? ==

The Beachy Amish can't really be considered Amish for 3 main reasons. 

First, some Beachy do missionary work which the Amish don't. Second, many of their communities have adapted into the surrounding mainstream society and some drive cars and use electric. Third, many among the Beachy Amish are becoming less conservative in their dress and not speaking PA German.

Some Beachy Amish communities are orthodox by Amish standards but increasingly many are unorthodox by Amish standards. So, wouldn't it be better to label the Beachy Amish as conservative Mennonites rather then Amish (not to be confused with old order or old colony Mennonites) as they are increasingly becoming Amish only in name? They even have a website which they themselves make the distinctions between themselves and the Amish. You can go to their website.

== Amish Mennonite ==

In my part of Lancaster County the Amish do not consider themselves to be Mennonite anymore than the Methodists consider themselves to be Anglicans. I feel the article would be improved if the Amish-Mennonite terminology were limited to groups who actually consider themselves to be both Amish and Mennonites. And from the Mennonite Encyclopedia http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/A4574ME.html ''The Old Order Amish are among the most conservative descendants of the 16th-century Anabaptists. The Old Order are usually distinguished from the Amish Mennonites (now largely absorbed into the Mennonite Church [MC] or various conservative Mennonite groups), Beachy Amish and the New Order Amish''  [[User:Nitpyck|Nitpyck]] ([[User talk:Nitpyck|talk]]) 02:48, 26 November 2009 (UTC)

== Amish in the military ==

The Wikipedia article (one of the beginning paragraphs) states that the Amish &quot;practice nonresistance and will not perform any type of military service&quot;, which is not entirely true. 

While it is true that they will not volunteer for military service, they will serve loyally when called upon by their country in times of war, without being shunned by their community. I don't have a written source, as this information was told directly to my father and aunt, both of whom live in rural Eastern Ohio, with many Amish neighbors, including some very strict. Young Amish men who serve in war are NOT excommunicated or shunned... at least not in the Amish communities of Eastern OH/Western PA.

:It is well documented that Amish men will perform service to their country so long as it is administered by a civilian organization and does not directly support any military purpose.

== Television ==

From the television section, the following sentence seems poorly worded to me: &quot;On Wednesday 18 February 2009, BBC2 aired 'Trouble in Amish Paradise', a one-hour documentary on Ephraim and Jesse Stoltzfus and their desire to adhere to Biblical Christianity whilst remaining Amish in culture.&quot; 

In particular I think &quot;their desire to adhere to Biblical Christianity whilst remaining Amish&quot; -- Amish ARE Christians and follow the Bible, so this sentence makes no sense written as such.  &quot;Biblical Christianity&quot; is not a sect that I am aware of as no one group has exclusive claim to the bible, and everybody interprets it differently.  If this said something to the effect of &quot;Evangelical Christianity&quot; or mention of some other denomination, it would make sense.  According to the following article: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4681945/Could-the-Amish-be-the-worlds-politest-rebels.html  it seems that what they want is the ability to use an english bible since (according to the statements made -- although potentially unsourced) 'most' amish can't read the antiquated german (if they speak it, why can't they read it?) and the rules are interpreted by their religious leaders and elders.

:But in Wikipedia, reliable sources are used to eliminate disputes over the meaning of terms.

The fact that there is no WP page on &quot;Biblical Christianity&quot; answers this point.

:Where'd you get that? The core hymnal, the Ausbund, regularly prints texts without notes. There are lots of Amish around here, and I am utterly certain the hymnals they use contain notes. In fact, I'm looking at a photostat of 'S Lobg'sang, which is always the second song in an Amish service, reproduced in Hostetler's &quot;Amish SOciety&quot; p. 230, and those are definitely notes.

:::OK, the photo and caption were technically correct (and more attractive than what I've replaced them with) but if we're to have only one image of a hymnl, it ought to be the one most reasonably regarded as official. This was more a weak example than an inaccuracy, and inaccuracies in the wiki, so far from demonstrating its unreliability, show how it can be repaired.

I have moved the disputed section to a more appropriate part of the article (and I see it has been removed as I write this). It does not belong in the article at all, even is a footnote, in my opinion. This is primarily because:
* this article is mainly about Old Order Amish, which these people do not appear to be
* it gives undo weight to an anomaly
* it adds another novelty angle to this article, which detracts from an encyclopedic, dispassionate presentation
* the main source is the self-published website of an individual, which is not considered a reliable source by Wikipedia's standards
For a topic that has been the subject of so much scholarly work in the fields of sociology and other disciplines, I prefer to set a very high standard for what sources are used here. Certainly a section discussing what becomes of Amish people who leave the community is very approrpriate; specific examples outside of that context are not. &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;✤&lt;/font&gt; [[User:JonHarder|JonHarder]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JonHarder|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:11, 2 August 2010 (UTC)
::''*this article is mainly about Old Order Amish, which these people do not appear to be''&lt;br&gt; Jacob describes himself as Amish Mennonite. This article cannot be only about Old Order Amish, because that would mean that there is no article in en.wikipedia about Amish in general and that would be simply wrong. If that article was called Old Order Amish then it would be only about Old Order Amish, but since it is called Amish it should be about Amish in general.&lt;br&gt;* ''it gives undo weight to an anomaly''&lt;br&gt;So is it better to conceal the truth (because some people may not like what some Amish people do)? &lt;br&gt;* ''it adds another novelty angle to this article, which detracts from an encyclopedic, dispassionate presentation''&lt;br&gt;There are only the facts presented - this is encyclopedic.&lt;br&gt;* ''the main source is the self-published website of an individual, which is not considered a reliable source by Wikipedia's standards''&lt;br&gt;Would you please stop making things up, and read the discussion first? You can't be taken seriously when you are just making things up. &lt;br&gt;It's been already explained in the discussion above that the links in English are written by a researcher of Amish culture Erik Wesner (he wrote and published a book about them) http://amishamerica.com/about-me/. The links in Polish are mostly from the largest mainstream newspapers (like [[Rzeczpospolita_%28newspaper%29|Rzeczpospolita]] and [[Polityka]]) written by professional journalists. When I first published that section it was based solely on the links to the newspapers and magazines, so that is the main source and not Eric Wesner's webpage (which I still consider a reliable source, as he is an expert and researcher of Amish culture)&lt;br&gt; So on what grounds you say that the links are not reliable sources?

Are Amish communities effectively anarchies? Just a question I thought I'd put out there. [[User:Cooltrainer Hugh|Cooltrainer Hugh]] ([[User talk:Cooltrainer Hugh|talk]]) 02:07, 15 December 2010 (UTC)

:I wouldn't say so. The [[anarchy]] article says that one of its definitions is &quot;''No rulership or enforced authority''.&quot; Given that the Amish do have a leadership structure, e.g. the elders and ultimately God. They do also have enforced authority via shunning and the like. So, by reading the [[Amish]] article and the [[anarchy]] article, you should be able to answer your own question. Also, this isn't really the place for such a question. An article's talk page is for discussing the editing of the article.

== Why delete &quot;Abuse in Amish society&quot;? ==

I think every thing has at least two sides. This is a section with neutral point of view and some sources references. May be abuse in Amish communities taking place not often then in others communities but several facts are known. [[User:Alexander Roumega|Alexander Roumega]] ([[User talk:Alexander Roumega|talk]]) 10:25, 24 January 2011 (UTC)

:It's not the 'neutral point of view' that's at issue but the fact that the inclusion of a section on abuse is an example of 'begging the question.' The very first line in the deleted section says that nothing definitive can be proven. If that's the case, then why include it? The section only serves to draw attention to a subject with the clear implication being that abuse is more prevalent in Amish societies. According to the facts, however, that is not the case. It's not a standard section in any other religious or social group's wikipedia page, so why include it here, especially given the fact that there's no study or case (i.e. proof) that abuse of any kind occurs at a higher rate in Amish communities? It's inappropriate and borders on bigotry.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jameswester|Jameswester]] ([[User talk:Jameswester|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jameswester|contribs]]) 23:23, 26 January 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Something should clearly be said about the widespread use of [[corporal punishment]] in the discpline of children.  Calling it abuse is probably POV though, but its certainly a very large area of controversy and is actually part of the religion/culture not just a common practice.  The logic comes from the &quot;spare the rod...&quot; passage in the bible.  There have been many legal cases dealing with it as well [[Special:Contributions/68.188.25.170|68.188.25.170]] ([[User talk:68.188.25.170|talk]]) 16:09, 9 July 2011 (UTC)

I think focus on corporal punishment or abuse unduly singles out a population who share parenting practices similar to many other American subcultures, and others outside the US, in addition to being POV. There are no sections under African Americans or Appalachians that focus on the widespread use of physical modes of discipline.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/140.254.84.103|140.254.84.103]] ([[User talk:140.254.84.103|talk]]) 21:41, 23 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: The second sentence of the Amish article reads: &quot;The Amish are known for simple living, plain dress, and reluctance to adopt many conveniences of modern technology.&quot; Though at one time the term Amish Mennonite included all Mennonite Anabaptists in the tradition of Jacob Amman, today it likely describes a subset of those Amish, most of whom would appear to live less simply, dress less plainly, attend high school &amp; college, &amp; use the Internet, among other conveniences of modern technology. [[User:EdK|EdK]] ([[User talk:EdK|talk]]) 02:31, 22 February 2012 (UTC)

: &quot;Amish Mennonite&quot; is the name sometimes used by the liberal side of the split among the Amish that occurred in the mid 1800s. The Old Order do not use that term for themselves, but groups such as the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference]] and Beachy Amish have used it and some still do, for themselves. You may see a church named, for example, Mountaintop Amish Mennonite Church. The confusion comes from the first sentence of the Amish Mennonite article that refers to the Amman/Reist division of the late 1600s, when it should probably refer to the division of the 1800s between the Old Order and the &quot;progressives&quot;. The liberal side of that split used the Amish Mennonite name, even as referencing Amish people before the split. But the conservative side (Old Order) do not generally use that term. Today, the term &quot;Amish Mennonite&quot; refers to a more liberal person than an Old Order Amish, although there is nothing official about that. If the Amish Mennonite article is to be merged, it should go with [[subgroups of Amish]] or the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference]] articles.[[User:Mikeatnip|Mikeatnip]] ([[User talk:Mikeatnip|talk]]) 02:59, 22 February 2012 (UTC)

::A little further explanation ... The splits went like this: Swiss Brethren began in 1525 in Zurich. In the late 1600s, there was a split in the [[Swiss Brethren]] between the Jacob Amman and the Hans Reist groups. At that time neither side used the name Mennonite, as Mennonite referred to the Dutch Anabaptists. AFTER (caps on purpose) they came to North America, the Reist side came to be called Mennonites (despite the fact that it was the Amman side who helped cause the division by bringing in the Dutch Mennonite ideas of strong shunning and footwashing, which the Swiss Brethren had never practice before!), and the Amman side came to be called Amish. In Switzerland, the Reist side also began to use the name Mennonite, after the split, and today no one uses the name &quot;Swiss Brethren.&quot;
::In the mid 1800s, the Amman side split between the Old Order and the more &quot;progressive&quot; side over issues like having meeting houses. This more progressive side used the name (sometimes) &quot;Amish Mennonites&quot;. Some of these &quot;Amish Mennonites&quot; (unofficial name) later formed into the Conservative Mennonite Conference, and when the &quot;Beachy Amish&quot; division began in the early 1900s, some of those congregations also used that name, again, mostly unofficially.

I know many Amish who would object to being merged with Amish Mennonite. They are a distinct subgroup more akin to Mennonite than Amish. Amish split from Mennonites when Amman and his followers believed Mennonites to be becoming too modern. Amish Mennonite can be a unique contribution to Wiki but does need additional support. In the Wayne-Holmes County Settlement, there are Amish who trace their origins to Sonnenberg, an early 19th Century settlement near Kidron. However, today there are no Amish who label themselves as such since the members of those affiliations are today Conservative Mennonite, Mennonite, or Old or New Order Amish (there are many Swartzentruber, but they moved to the area from southern part of the settlement).  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/140.254.84.103|140.254.84.103]] ([[User talk:140.254.84.103|talk]]) 21:39, 23 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I had created [[Subgroups of Amish]] page to put there information about different Amish and near-Amish groups. If this is a different group but Wikipedia has no information enough for separate article (like [[Beachy Amish Mennonite]]) it's a good idea: make section in [[Subgroups of Amish]] and redirect to section.

::In the early-mid 1800s when cameras were invented, the Amish, the Mennonites, and the German Baptist Brethren would have pretty much all been opposed to having images made of oneself.
