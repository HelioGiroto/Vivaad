'''Yom Kippur''' ({{lang-he-n|יוֹם כִּפּוּר}}, {{IPA-he|ˈjom kiˈpuʁ|IPA}}, or {{Hebrew|יום הכיפורים}}), also known as '''Day of Atonement''', is the holiest day of the year for the [[Jewish people]]. Its central themes are [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] and [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]].  Jewish people traditionally observe this holy day with a 25-hour period of [[Ta'anit|fasting]] and intensive [[Jewish services|prayer]], often spending most of the day in [[synagogue]] services. Yom Kippur completes the annual period known in [[Judaism]] as the [[High Holy Days]] or Yamim Nora'im (&quot;Days of Awe&quot;).

Yom Kippur is the tenth day of the month of [[Tishrei]] and also regarded as the “Sabbath of Sabbaths”. According to Jewish tradition, [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] inscribes each person's fate for the coming year into a book, the [[Book of Life]], on [[Rosh Hashanah]], and waits until Yom Kippur to &quot;seal&quot; the verdict. During the Days of Awe, a Jewish person tries to amend his or her behavior and seek forgiveness for wrongs done against God (''bein adam leMakom'') and against other human beings (''bein adam lechavero''). The evening and day of Yom Kippur are set aside for public and private petitions and confessions of guilt (''[[Vidui]]''). At the end of Yom Kippur, one hopes that they have been forgiven by God.

The Yom Kippur prayer service includes several unique aspects. One is the actual number of prayer services. Unlike a regular day, which has three prayer services (''Ma'ariv'', the evening prayer; ''Shacharit'', the morning prayer; and ''Mincha'', the afternoon prayer), or a [[Shabbat]] or [[Yom Tov]], which have four prayer services (''Ma'ariv''; ''Shacharit''; ''Mussaf'', the additional prayer; and ''Mincha''), Yom Kippur has five prayer services (''Ma'ariv''; ''Shacharit''; ''Musaf''; ''Mincha''; and ''[[Ne'ilah]]'', the closing prayer). The prayer services also include private and public confessions of sins (''[[Confession in Judaism|Vidui]]'') and a unique prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur ''avodah'' (service) of the [[Kohen Gadol]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple in Jerusalem]].

As one of the most culturally significant Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur is observed by many [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]] who may not observe other holidays. Many secular Jews attend synagogue on Yom Kippur—for many secular Jews the High Holy Days are the only recurring times of the year in which they attend synagogue&lt;ref&gt;Cohen‏, S.M., Eisen, A.M.‏: ''The Jew within: self, family, and community in America'', page 169. Indiana University Press, ‏2000. &quot;For completely uninvolved Jews ... the question of synagogue attendance rarely arises. They are unlikely ever to consider the matter, except at Rosh Hashanha and Yom Kippur or to attend a bar or bat mitzvah.&quot; See also Samuel C. Heilman, Synagogue Life, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;—causing synagogue attendance to soar.

==Etymology==

''Yom'' means &quot;day&quot; in [[Hebrew]] and ''Kippur'' comes from a root that means &quot;to atone&quot;. Thus Yom Kippur has come to mean &quot;day of atonement&quot;. Some say there is a link to ''kapporet'', the “mercy seat” or covering of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] states that the word indicates the task and not just the shape of the ark cover; since the blood of the Yom Kippur sacrifice was sprinkled in its direction, it was the symbol of propitiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2008/09/the-name-yom-kippur-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=The name Yom Kippur |publisher=Oztorah.com |date=March 8, 2011 |author= |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observances==
{{Judaism}}

===Preceding day===
''Erev Yom Kippur'' (lit. &quot;eve [of] day [of] atonement&quot;) is the day preceding Yom Kippur, corresponding to the ninth day of the Hebrew month of [[Tishrei]]. This day is commemorated with two festive meals, the giving of [[Tzedakah|charity]], and asking others for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divreinavon.com/pdf/ErevYomKippur.pdf |title=Erev Yom Kippur – The purpose of the day as seen through Talmudic anecdotes (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |author= |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General observances===

{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:29|HE}} mandates establishment of this holy day on the 10th day of the 7th month as the day of atonement for sins. It calls it the Sabbath of Sabbaths and a day upon which one must afflict one's soul.

{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:27|HE}} decrees that Yom Kippur is a strict day of rest.

Five additional prohibitions are traditionally observed, as detailed in the [[Oral Torah|Jewish oral tradition]] (''[[Mishnah]]'' tractate ''[[Yoma]]'' 8:1)

The number five is a set number, relating to:
# In the Yom Kippur section of the Torah, the word ''soul'' appears five times.
# ''Soul,'' in the [[Torah]] is known by five separate names: soul, wind, spirit, living one and unique one.
# Unlike regular days, which have three prayer services, Yom Kippur has five- [[Maariv]], [[Shacharis]], [[Mussaf]], [[Minchah]] and [[Neilah]]
# The [[Kohen Gadol]] rinsed himself in the [[mikveh]] five times on Yom Kippur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scherman, Nosson 1989&quot;&gt;Scherman, Nosson. &quot;Yom Kippur- Its Significance, Laws and Prayers&quot; New York: Mesorah Publications, 1989. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditions are as follows:

# No eating and drinking
# No wearing of leather shoes
# No [[bathing]] or [[washing]]
# No [[anointing]] oneself with perfumes or lotions
# No [[sexual intercourse|marital relations]]
A parallel has been drawn between these activities and the human condition according to the Biblical account of the expulsion from the garden of Eden.&lt;ref name = air1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.nyu.edu/~air1/biblic.htm |title=Why Rabbis wear sneakers on their holiest day}}&quot;Article by Avi Rabinowitz, NYU homepages&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Refraining from these symbolically represents a return to a pristine state, which is the theme of the day. By refraining from these activities, the body is uncomfortable but can still survive. The soul is considered to be the life force in a body. Therefore, by making one’s body uncomfortable, one’s soul is uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt; By feeling pain one can feel how others feel when they are in pain.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Judith. Yom Kippur: A Family Service Minneapolis: KAR-BEN, 1990. Print&lt;/ref&gt; This is the purpose of the prohibitions.  

Total abstention from food and drink usually begins 20 minutes before [[sunset|sundown]] (called ''tosefet Yom Kippur'', lit. &quot;Addition to Yom Kippur&quot;), and ends after [[dusk|nightfall]] the following day. Although the fast is required of all healthy adults over 12 or 13, it is waived in the case of certain medical conditions.

Virtually all Jewish holidays involve a ritual feast, but since Yom Kippur involves fasting, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] requires one to eat a large and festive meal on the afternoon before Yom Kippur, after the ''[[Mincha]]'' (afternoon) prayer.

Wearing white clothing (or a 'kittel' for Ashkenazi Jews), is traditional to symbolize one’s purity on this day. Many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] men immerse themselves in a ''[[mikveh]]'' on the day before Yom Kippur.&lt;ref name = OU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/chagim/yomkippur/ykcustoms.htm |title=OU Customs for Erev Yom Kippur |accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to apologize to God, one must: 
# Pray
# Repent
# Give to charity  &lt;ref name=&quot;Scherman, Nosson 1989&quot;/&gt;

===Eve===
{{Main|Kol Nidre}}

Before sunset on Yom Kippur eve, worshippers gather in the [[synagogue]]. The [[Ark (synagogue)|Ark]] is opened and two people take from it two [[Sefer Torah|Sifrei Torah]] (Torah scrolls). Then they take their places, one on each side of the [[Hazzan]], and the three recite (in Hebrew):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In the tribunal of Heaven and the tribunal of earth, by the permission of God—praised be He—and by the permission of this holy congregation, we hold it lawful to pray with transgressors.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cantor then chants the [[Kol Nidre]] prayer (Hebrew: '''כל נדרי''') in [[Aramaic]], not [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Its name is taken from the opening words, meaning &quot;All vows&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;All personal vows we are likely to make [with God], all personal oaths and pledges we are likely to take between this Yom Kippur and the next Yom Kippur, we publicly renounce. Let them all be relinquished and abandoned, null and void, neither firm nor established. Let our personal vows, pledges and oaths be considered neither vows nor pledges nor oaths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Translation of Philip Birnbaum, from ''High Holyday Prayer Book'', Hebrew Publishing Company, NY, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The leader and the congregation then say together three times &quot;May all the people of Israel be forgiven, including all the strangers who live in their midst, for all the people are in fault.&quot; The Torah scrolls are then replaced, and the Yom Kippur evening service begins.

===Prayer services===

Many married men wear a ''[[kittel]]'', a white robe-like garment for evening prayers on Yom Kippur, otherwise used by males on their wedding day.&lt;ref name=JVL_yk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/holiday4.html |title=Jewish Virtual Library — Yom Kippur |accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also wear a [[tallit]] (prayer shawl), which is typically worn only during morning services.&lt;ref name=MJL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Yom_Kippur/Overview_Yom_Kippur_Community/Prayer_Services.htm |title=My Jewish Learning — Prayer Services |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |author=Rabbi Daniel Kohn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prayer services begin with the [[Kol Nidrei]] prayer, which must be recited before sunset, and continue with the evening prayers (''Ma'ariv'' or ''Arvith''), which includes an extended [[Selichot]] service.

The morning prayer service is preceded by litanies and petitions of forgiveness called ''selichot''; on Yom Kippur, many ''selichot'' are woven into the liturgy of the [[mahzor]] (prayer book). The morning prayers are followed by an added prayer (''Mussaf'') as on all other holidays. This is followed by ''Mincha'' (the afternoon prayer) which includes a reading ([[Haftarah]]) of the entire [[Book of Jonah]], which has as its theme the story of God's willingness to forgive those who repent.

The service concludes with the ''[[Ne'ila]]'' (&quot;closing&quot;) prayer, which begins shortly before sunset, when the &quot;gates of prayer&quot; will be closed. Yom Kippur comes to an end with a recitation of ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' and the blowing of the ''[[shofar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The significance of shofar to Yom Kippur is discussed at http://hearingshofar.com/Book1.htm#_PART_FOUR_%E2%80%93&lt;/ref&gt; which marks the conclusion of the fast.&lt;ref name=MJL /&gt;
{{Teshuva}}

===Repentance (''Teshuva'') and  Confessional (''Vidui'')===

The [[Talmud]]  states, &quot;Yom Kippur atones for those who repent and does not atone for those who do not repent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoma]] 85b.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Repentance in Judaism]] is done through a process called [[Teshuva]], which in its most basic form consists of regretting having committed the sin, resolving not to commit that sin in the future and to confess that sin before God. [[Confession in Judaism]] is called ''Vidui'' (Hebrew וידוי). There is also a commandment to repent on Yom Kippur.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonodes, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Teshuva 2:7&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly Yom Kippur is unique for the confessional, or ''Vidui'', that is part of the prayer services. In keeping with the requirement to repent on Yom Kippur, Jews recite the full ''Vidui'' a total of 10 times: 2 times during Mincha on Yom Kippur eve, and on Yom Kippur itself during Ma'ariv (2 times), Shacharit (2 times), Musaf (2 times), and Mincha (2 times); at Ne’eilah, only the short confessional is said. The first time in each service takes place during the personal recitation of the [[Amidah]] (standing, silent prayer), and the second time during the cantor's repetition of the Amidah, in a public recitation. 

The Yom Kippur confessional consists of two parts: a [[Confession in Judaism#Ashamnu, the short confession|short confession]] beginning with the word ''Ashamnu'' (אשמנו, &quot;we have sinned&quot;), which is a series of words describing sin arranged according to the aleph-bet, and a [[Confession in Judaism#Al Cheyt, the long confession|long confession]], beginning with the words ''Al Cheyt'' (על חטא, &quot;for the sin&quot;), which is a set of 26 double acrostics, also arranged according to the aleph-bet, enumerating a range of sins. It is notable that during the public recitation of ''Ashamnu'' together with the cantor, the entire congregation sings these words to a tune, representing the joy of being cleansed from one's sins.

===Avodah: remembering the Temple service===

A recitation of the sacrificial service of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] traditionally features prominently in both the liturgy and the religious thought of the holiday. Specifically, the ''Avodah'' (&quot;service&quot;) in the Musaf prayer recounts in great detail the sacrificial ceremonies of the Yom Kippur [[Korban]]ot (sacrificial offerings) that are recited in the prayers but have not been performed for 2,000 years, since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem by the Romans.

This traditional prominence is rooted in the [[Babylonian Talmud]]’s description of how to attain atonement following the destruction of the Temple. According to Talmud tractate [[Yoma]], in the absence of a Temple, Jews are obligated to study the High Priest’s ritual on Yom Kippur, and this study helps achieve atonement for those who are unable to benefit from its actual performance. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], accordingly, studying the Temple ritual on Yom Kippur represents a positive [[Rabbinical law|rabbinically ordained obligation]] which Jews seeking atonement are required to fulfill.

In Orthodox synagogues, most [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and some [[Progressive Judaism|progressive]]&lt;ref&gt;An abbreviated version of the Seder Avodah is used in Yom Kippur services at the [[Hebrew Union College]] Jerusalem campus&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed description of the Temple ritual is recited on the day. In most Orthodox and some Conservative synagogues, the entire congregation [[prostration|prostrates]] themselves at each point in the recitation where the [[Kohen Gadol]] (High Priest) would pronounce the [[Tetragrammaton]] (God’s holiest name, according to Judaism).

The main section of the Avodah is a threefold recitation of the High Priest’s actions regarding expiation in the [[Holy of Holies]]. Performing the sacrificial acts and reciting {{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:30|HE}}, (“Your upright children”). (These three times, plus in some congregations the ''[[Aleinu]]'' prayer during the [[Musaf]] [[Amidah]] on Yom Kippur and [[Rosh Hashanah]], are the only times in [[Jewish services]] when Jews engage in prostration, with the exception of some [[Yemenite Jews]] and ''talmedhei [[Maimonides|haRambam]]'' (disciples of Maimonides) who may prostrate themselves on other occasions during the year). A variety of liturgical poems are added, including a poem recounting the radiance of the countenance of the [[Kohen Gadol]] after exiting the Holy of Holies, traditionally believed to emit palpable light in a manner echoing the Torah's account of the countenance of [[Moses]] after descending from [[Mount Sinai]], as well as prayers for the speedy rebuilding of the [[Third Temple|Temple]] and the restoration of [[korban|sacrificial worship]]. There are a variety of other customs, such as hand gestures to mime the sprinkling of blood (one sprinkling upwards and seven downwards per set of eight).

Orthodox liturgies include prayers lamenting the inability to perform the Temple service and petitioning for its restoration, which Conservative synagogues generally omit. In some Conservative synagogues, only the ''[[Hazzan]]'' (cantor) engages in full prostration. Some Conservative synagogues abridge the recitation of the Avodah service to varying degrees, and some omit it entirely. Many [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] services omit the entire service as inconsistent with modern sensibilities.

===Date of Yom Kippur===
{{See also|Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000–2050}}
Yom Kippur falls each year on the 10th day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, which is 9 days after the first day of [[Rosh Hashanah]]. In terms of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the earliest date on which Yom Kippur can fall is September 14, as happened in 1899 and will happen again in 2013. The latest Yom Kippur can occur relative to the Gregorian dates is on October 14, as happened in 1967 and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Yom Kippur falling no earlier than September 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2010/07/an-early-rosh-hashanah-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=Rosh HaShanah and the Gregorian calendar |publisher=Oztorah.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorian calendar dates for upcoming Yom Kippur holidays are:

* 2012 – Wednesday 26 September
* 2013 – Saturday 14 September
* 2014 – Saturday 4 October
* 2015 – Wednesday 23 September
* 2016 – Wednesday 12 October

''Note: Yom Kippur begins at sundown of the previous day in the Gregorian calendar (e.g. 25 September 2012).''

==In the Torah==

The [[Torah]] calls the day ''Yom HaKippurim'' (יוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים) and in it {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:27|HE}} decrees a strict prohibition of work and affliction of the appetite (נפש means soul or appetite) upon the tenth day of the seventh month, later known as [[Tishrei]]. The laws of Yom Kippur are mentioned in three passages in the Torah:
# {{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:1–34|HE}}: God told [[Moses]] to tell [[Aaron]] that he can only enter the sanctuary in front of the cover that is on the ark when God is present on the cover in a cloud. If [[Aaron]] is to enter otherwise, he will die . On the tenth day of the seventh month, God said that the people must not work in order to cleanse and atone for their sins. The [[Kohen]] will lead in the atonement of all the people.
# {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:26–32|HE}}:  God said to [[Moses]] that the tenth day of the month is the day of atonement and will be holy.  The people must give a fire-offering to God and must not work. God told [[Moses]] that whoever does work, God will rid of the soul from its people. This is a day of complete rest from the evening of the ninth day of the month to the following evening.
# {{bibleverse||Numbers|29:7–11|HE}}: The tenth day of the seventh month is a holy day and one must not work. For an elevation offering, one must sacrifice a young bull, a ram and seven lambs who are a year old. As well, for a sin offering, one must sacrifice a male goat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scherman, Nosson 1989&quot;/&gt;

===Midrashic interpretation===

&lt;!--The midrashim described in this section need sources cited from Midrashic literature--&gt;

Traditionally, Yom Kippur is considered the date on which [[Moses]] received the second set of [[Ten Commandments]]. It occurred following the completion of the second 40 days of instructions from God. At this same time, the [[Israelites]] were granted atonement for the sin of the [[Golden Calf]]; hence, its designation as the Day of Atonement.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Rabbi Ken. [http://www.aish.edu/literacy/jewishhistory/Crash_Course_in_Jewish_History_Part_12_—_The_Golden_Calf.asp Crash Course in Jewish History Part 12 — The Golden Calf]. [[Aish HaTorah]]. accessed April 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mishnaic and Talmudic literature==

===Temple service===

The following summary of the Temple service is based on the traditional Jewish religious account described in [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Yoma]], appearing in contemporary traditional Jewish prayer books for Yom Kippur, and studied as part of a traditional Jewish Yom Kippur worship service.&lt;ref name = kasirer&gt;Arnold Lustiger, Michael Taubes, [[Menachem Genack]], and [[Hershel Schachter]], ''Kasirer Edition Yom Kippur Machzor With Commentary Adapted from the Teachings of Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]''. New York: K'hal Publishing, 2006. pp. 588–589 (summary); 590–618.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was standing (from Biblical times through 70 C.E.), the [[Kohen Gadol]] (High Priest) was mandated by the [[Torah]] to perform a complex set of special services and sacrifices for Yom Kippur to attain Divine atonement, the word &quot;kippur&quot; meaning &quot;atone&quot; in Hebrew. These services were considered to be the most important parts of Yom Kippur because through them the Kohen Gadol made atonement for all Jews and the world. During the service, the Kohen Gadol entered the [[Holy of Holies]] in the center of the Temple, the only time of the year that anyone went inside. Doing so required special purification and preparation, including five immersions in a ''[[mikvah]]'' (ritual bath), and four changes of clothing.

Seven days prior to Yom Kippur, the Kohen Gadol was sequestered in the [[Palhedrin chamber]] in the Temple, where he reviewed (studied) the service with the sages familiar with the Temple, and was sprinkled with spring water containing ashes of the [[Red Heifer]] as purification. The [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Yoma]]) also reports that he practiced the incense offering ritual in the [[Avitnas chamber]].

On the day of Yom Kippur, the Kohen Gadol had to follow a precise order of services, sacrifices, and purifications:

*'''Morning (Tamid) Offering''' The Kohen Gadol first performed the regular daily (''Tamid'') offering — usually performed by ordinary priests — in special golden garments, after immersing in a ''[[mikvah]]'' and washing his hands and feet.
*'''Garment Change 1''' The Kohen Gadol immersed in a special ''mikvah'' in the Temple courtyard and changed into special linen garments, and washed his hands and feet twice, once after removing the golden garments and once before putting on the linen garments.
* '''Bull as Personal Sin-Offering''' The Kohen Gadol leaned (performed ''[[Semicha in sacrifices|Semikha]])'' and made a confession over the bull on behalf of himself and his household, pronouncing the [[Tetragrammaton]]. The people prostrated themselves when they heard. He then slaughtered the bull as a ''chatat'' (sin-offering) and received its blood in a bowl.
* '''Lottery of the goats''' At the Eastern (Nikanor) gate, the Kohen Gadol drew lots from a lottery box over two [[goat]]s. One was selected “for the Lord,” and one “for [[Azazel]].” The Kohen Gadol tied a red band around the horns of the goat “for [[Azazel]].”
* '''Incense Preparation''' The Kohen Gadol ascended the ''[[mizbeach]]'' (altar) and took a shovel full of [[ember]]s with a special shovel. He was brought [[incense]]. He filled his hands and placed it in a vessel. (The ''[[Talmud]]'' considered this the most physically difficult part of the service, as the Kohen Gadol had to keep the shovelful of glowing [[coal]]s balanced and prevent its contents from dropping, using his armpit or teeth, while filling his hands with the incense).
* '''Incense Offering''' Holding the shovel and the vessel, he entered the [[Kadosh Hakadashim]], the Temple’s [[Holy of Holies]]. In the days of the [[First Temple]], he placed the shovel between the poles of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. In the days of the [[Second Temple]], he put the shovel where the Ark would have been. He waited until the chamber filled with smoke and left.
*'''Sprinkling of Bull's Blood in the Holy of Holies''' The Kohen Gadol took the bowl with the bull’s blood and entered the Most Holy Place again. He sprinkled the bull’s blood with his finger eight times, before the Ark in the days of the First Temple, where it would have been in the days of the Second. The Kohen Gadol then left the Holy of Holies, putting the bowl on a stand in front of the [[Parochet]] (curtain separating the Holy from the Holy of Holies).
*'''Goat for the Lord as Sin-Offering for [[Kohen|Kohanim]]''' The Kohen Gadol went to the eastern end of the Israelite courtyard near the Nikanor Gate, laid his hands (''[[Semicha in sacrifices|semikha]]'') on the goat “for the Lord,” and pronounced [[Confession (religion)|confession]] on behalf of the Kohanim (priests). The people prostrated themselves when he pronounced the Tetragrammaton. He then slaughtered the goat, and received its blood in another bowl.
*'''Sprinkling of Goat’s Blood in the Holy of Holies''' The Kohen Gadol took the bowl with the goat’s blood and entered the [[Kadosh Hakadashim]], the Temple’s [[Holy of Holies]] again. He sprinkled the goat’s blood with his finger eight times the same way he had sprinkled the bull’s blood.  The blood was sprinkled before the Ark in the days of the First Temple, where it would have been in the days of the Second Temple. The Kohen Gadol then left the [[Kadosh Hakadashim]], putting the bowl on a stand in front of the [[Parochet]] (curtain separating the Holy from the Holy of Holies).
*'''Sprinkling of blood in the Holy''' Standing in the ''[[Hekhal]]'' (Holy), on the other side of the Parochet from the Holy of Holies, the Kohen Gadol took the bull's blood from the stand and sprinkled it with his finger eight times in the direction of the Parochet. He then took the bowl with the goat's blood and sprinkled it eight times in the same manner, putting it back on the stand.
*'''Smearing of blood on the Golden (Incense) Altar''' The Kohen Gadol removed the goat’s blood from the stand and mixed it with the bull's blood. Starting at the northeast corner, he then smeared the mixture of blood on each of the four corners of the Golden (Incense) altar in the Haichal. He then sprinkled the blood eight times on the altar.
[[File:Azazel IMG 1739.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Cliffs of [[Azazel|Mount Azazel]]]] 
*'''Goat for Azazel''' The Kohen Gadol left the Haichal and walked to the east side of the ''[[Azarah]]'' (Israelite courtyard). Near the Nikanor Gate, he leaned his hands (Semikha) on the goat “for Azazel” and confessed the sins of the entire people of Israel. The people prostrated themselves when he pronounced the Tetragrammaton. While he made a general confession, individuals in the crowd at the Temple would confess privately. The Kohen Gadol then sent the goat off “to the wilderness.” In practice, to prevent its return to human habitation, the goat was led to a cliff outside Jerusalem and pushed off its edge.
*'''Preparation of sacrificial animals''' While the goat “for Azazel” was being led to the cliff, the Kohen Gadol removed the insides of the bull, and intertwined the bodies of the bull and goat. Other people took the bodies to the ''Beit HaDeshen'' (place of the ashes). They were burned there after it was confirmed that the goat “for Azazel” had reached the wilderness.
*'''Reading the Torah''' After it was confirmed that the goat “for Azazel” had been pushed off the cliff, the Kohen Gadol passed through the Nikanor Gate into the ''Ezrat Nashim'' (Women’s Courtyard) and read sections of the ''Torah'' describing Yom Kippur and its [[Korban|sacrifice]]s.
*'''Garment change 2''' The Kohen Gadol removed his linen garments, immersed in the ''mikvah'' in the Temple courtyard, and changed into a second set of special golden garments. He washed his hands and feet both before removing the linen garments and after putting on the golden ones.
*'''Offering of Rams''' The Kohen Gadol offered two rams as an ''olah'' offering, slaughtering them on the north side of the ''mizbeach'' (outer altar), receiving their blood in a bowl, carrying the bowl to the outer altar, and dashing the blood on the northeast and southwest corners of the Outer Altar. He dismembered the rams and burned the parts entirely on the outer altar. He then offered the accompanying ''[[mincha]]'' (grain) offerings and ''nesachim'' (wine-libations).
*'''Musaf Offering''' The Kohen Gadol then offered the ''[[Musaf]]'' offering.
*'''Burning of Innards''' The Kohen Gadol placed the insides of the bull and goat on the outer altar and burned them entirely.
*'''*Garment change 3''' The Kohen Gadol removed his golden garments, immersed in the ''mikvah'', and changed to a new set of linen garments, again washing his hands and feet twice.
*'''Removal of Incense from the [[Kadosh Hakadashim|Holy of Holies]]''' The Kohen Gadol returned to the Holy of Holies and removed the bowl of incense and the shovel.
*'''Garment Change 4''' The Kohen Gadol removed his linen garments, immersed in the ''mikvah'', and changed into a third set of golden garments, again washing his hands and feet twice.
*'''Evening (Tamid) Offering''' The Kohen Gadol completed the afternoon portion of the regular (''tamid'') daily offering in the special golden garments. He washed his hands and feet a tenth time.

The Kohen Gadol wore five sets of garments (three golden and two white linen), immersed in the ''mikvah'' five times, and washed his hands and feet ten times. Sacrifices included two (daily) lambs, one bull, two goats, and two rams, with accompanying ''mincha'' (meal) offerings, wine libations, and three incense offerings (the regular two daily and an additional one for Yom Kippur). The Kohen Gadol entered the Holy of Holies three times. The Tetragrammaton was pronounced three times, once for each confession.&lt;ref name=kasirer /&gt;

==Observance in Israel==
[[File:Yom Kippur on Highway 20 Tel-Aviv.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Ayalon Highway]] in [[Tel Aviv]], empty of cars on Yom Kippur 2004]]

Yom Kippur is a legal holiday in the modern state of Israel. There are no radio or television broadcasts, airports are shut down, there is no public transportation, and all shops and businesses are closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/6829.htm &quot;Sounds of The City&quot;, article from [[Israel Insider]], October 14, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, an air raid siren was sounded on the afternoon of Yom Kippur and radio broadcasts were resumed to alert the public to the surprise attack on Israel by Egypt and Syria that launched the [[Yom Kippur War]].

In 2008, 63% of the Jewish people of [[Israel]] said that they were intending to fast on Yom Kippur.&lt;ref name = &quot;ynet.co.il&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3606861,00.html |title=ynet חדשות היום – סקר ynet-גשר: 63 אחוזים עומדים לצום ביום כיפור |publisher=Ynet |date=June 20, 1995 |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason that it is very common in [[Israel]] to wish &quot;Tsom Kal&quot; ([an] easy fast) or &quot;Tsom Mo'iil&quot; ([a] benefiting fast) to everyone before Yom Kippur, even if one does not know whether they will fast or not.

It is considered impolite to eat in public on Yom Kippur or to sound music or to drive a motor vehicle. There is no legal prohibition on any of these, but in practice such actions are universally avoided in Israel during Yom Kippur. The exception being emergency services.

Over the last few decades, bicycle-riding and inline skating on the empty streets have become common among [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Israeli]] youngsters, especially on the eve of Yom Kippur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.org/2009/09/28/yom-kippur-kids-and-bikes-in-tel-aviv/ |title=Public Radio International, &quot;The World,&quot; 'Yom Kippur: Kids and Bikes in Tel Aviv' |publisher=Theworld.org |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observance by athletes==

[[File:Gabe Carimi ASU.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Gabe Carimi]]]]
Some notable athletes have observed Yom Kippur, even when it conflicted with their playing their sport.

In baseball, [[Sandy Koufax]], the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[pitcher]], decided not to pitch Game 1 of the [[1965 World Series]] because it fell on Yom Kippur.  Koufax garnered national attention for his decision, as an example of the conflict between social pressures and personal beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;yomkippur&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Yom Kippur and Sandy Koufax | work = JewishSports.com | first=Sandor | last=Solomvits | url=http://www.jewishsports.com/reflections/koufax_yom.htm | accessdate = August 2, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061018193520/http://www.jewishsports.com/reflections/koufax_yom.htm |archivedate = October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When pitcher Don Drysdale took Koufax's place and fared poorly, giving up seven runs in 2-2/3 innings, he told his manager as he was pulled from the game: &quot;I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/merron_on_green.html |title=Green, Koufax and Greenberg – same dilemma, different decisions |publisher=ESPN |date=September 26, 2001 |author= |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall of Fame [[first baseman]] [[Hank Greenberg]] attracted national attention in [[1934 in baseball|1934]], nearly three decades earlier, when he refused to play baseball on Yom Kippur, even though the Tigers were in the middle of a [[pennant race]] and Greenberg was not a religious Jew.  The ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' columnist and poet [[Edgar A. Guest]] wrote a poem titled &quot;Speaking of Greenberg,&quot; which ended with the lines &quot;''We shall miss him on the infield and shall miss him at the bat / But he's true to his religion—and I honor him for that.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:xnCPhT6vVsYJ:www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/2_04/Dab.pdf+%22hank+greenberg%22+%2B+%22jimmy+dykes%22&amp;cd=24&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |title=Shadows In The Spotlight: Two Jewish American Baseball Players Braham Dabscheck The Life And Times Of Hank Greenberg|publisher= |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Greenberg arrived in synagogue on Yom Kippur, the service stopped suddenly, and the congregation gave an embarrassed Greenberg a standing ovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] outfielder [[Shawn Green]], similarly, made headlines in 2001 for sitting out a game for the first time in 415 games, to honor Yom Kippur, even though his team was in the middle of a playoff race.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2001/0905/1248286.html|title=Dodgers' Green will not play vs. Giants on Yom Kippur|last=Schwarz |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Schwarz |accessdate=March 6, 2009 |date=September 5, 2001 |publisher= ''[[ESPN]]'' Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.5tjt.com/news/read.asp?Id=4256 |title=One, Two, Three Years You're Out At The Old Ball Game |publisher=5tjt.com |date=May 13, 2009 |author= |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other baseball players who have similarly sat out games on Yom Kippur include [[Chicago White Sox]] third baseman [[Kevin Youkilis]], former [[Houston Astros]] catcher [[Brad Ausmus]] and [[outfielder]] [[Art Shamsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=M.

[[Gabe Carimi]], the Consensus All-American [[left tackle]] in American football who won the 2010 [[Outland Trophy]] as the nation's top collegiate interior lineman faced a conflict in his freshman year of college in 2007.  That year Yom Kippur fell on a Saturday, and he fasted until an hour before his football game against Iowa started that night.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsch |first=Deborah |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/27/2742329/gabe-carimi-star-in-shul-and-on-the-football-field |title=Gabe Carimi: Star in shul and on the football field |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]] |date=December 27, 2010 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishchronicle1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishchronicle.org/article.php?article_id=6353|author= Andrea Waxman |title=Yom Kippur, then football; Carimi fasts and then tackles |work=The [[Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle]] |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hillel.org/about/news/2010/dec/16Dec10_Carimi.htm |title=The Biggest Thing in Jewish Sports?

[[Boris Gelfand]], Israel's top chess player, played his game in the prestigious London Grand Prix Chess Tournament on Tuesday 25 September 2012 (eve of Yom Kippur) earlier, to avoid playing on the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/gelfand-and-grischuk-winners-in-4th-round-london-grand-prix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary scholarship==

According to [[textual criticism|textual scholars]], the biblical regulations covering Yom Kippur are spliced together from multiple source texts,&lt;ref name = &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; as indicated by evidence such as with the [[Textual criticism|duplication]] of the confession over the bullock,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:6|}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the incongruity in one verse stating that the high priest should not enter the Holy of Holies (with the inference that there are exceptions for certain explicitly identified festivals),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the next verse indicating that they can enter whenever they wish (as long as a specific ritual is carried out first).&lt;ref name = &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt; Although [[Rashi]] tried to find a harmonistic explanation for this incongruity, the [[Leviticus Rabbah]] maintains that it was indeed the case that the high priest could enter at any time if these rituals were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;''Leviticus Rabbah'' 21&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholars argue that the ritual is composed from three sources, and a couple of redactional additions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;
*prerequisite rituals before the high priest can enter the Holy of Holies (on any occasion), namely a sin offering and a whole offering, followed by the filling of the Holy of Holies with a cloud of incense while wearing linen garments&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:1|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:3–4|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:12–13|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:34|}} (b)&lt;/ref&gt;
*regulations which establish an annual day of fasting and rest, during which the sanctuary and people are purified, without stating the ritual for doing so;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:29–34|}} (a)&lt;/ref&gt; this regulation is very similar to the one in the Holiness Code&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:27–31|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*later elaborations of the ceremony,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:5|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:7–10|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:14–28|}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include the sprinkling of the blood on the ''mercy seat'', and the use of a scapegoat sent to Azazel; the same source also being responsible for small alterations to related regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|30:10|}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the redactional additions&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:2|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:6|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:11|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of their assumptions, these scholars believe that the original ceremony was simply the ritual purification of the sanctuary from any accidental ritual impurity, at the start of each new year, as seen in the [[Book of Ezekiel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia|wstitle=Atonement, Day of}}&lt;/ref&gt; which textual scholars date to before the [[priestly source]], but after [[JE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia}}Priestly Source{{verification needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;!--http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/directory/P/12343?page=2--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Book of Ezekiel, the sanctuary was to be cleansed by the sprinkling of bullock's blood, on the first day of the first and of the seventh months&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|45:18–20|}}&lt;/ref&gt; — near the start of the Civil year and of the Ecclesiastical year, respectively; although the [[masoretic text]] of the Book of Ezekiel has the second of these cleansings on the seventh of the first month, biblical scholars regard the [[Septuagint]], which has the second cleaning as being the first of the seventh month, as being more accurate here.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; It appears that during the period that the Holiness Code and the Book of Ezekiel were written, the new year began on the tenth day of the seventh month,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|40:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus liberal biblical scholars believe that by the time the Priestly Code was compiled, the date of the new year and of the day of atonement had swapped around.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt;
