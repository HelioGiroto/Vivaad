== Removed line. ==

&quot;As [[genital integrity|circumcision opponents]] might allege.&quot;

Nice try guys.

== Brit Levanah ==

It is becoming increasingly common for girls to have a brit levanah in addition to a naming. This does not involve cutting, rather a nice service based around the moon and moon festivals. Should we include something here or a separate page? [[User:THDju|THDju]] ([[User talk:THDju|talk]]) 19:53, 27 May 2010 (UTC)
:Wouldn't it make more sense at [[Zeved habat]]? [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:50, 27 May 2010 (UTC)

== History ==

I think the article would benefit from an History section like in the hebrew wikipedia. [[User:Adiel lo|Adiel lo]] ([[User talk:Adiel lo|talk]]) 11:25, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
:That sounds like a good idea. Why don't you write one? [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:21, 27 December 2010 (UTC)

== &quot;On the eight day&quot; means the child is a week (7 days) old ==

It is wrong to say &quot;on 8-day old male infants&quot;.  The writers of the Torah had no zero, therefore started counting on the birth day (day 1).  So on the 8th day the child is 7 days old.  This makes sense in the lunar calendar - a week is a lunar quarter.

Proposed change: &quot;...religious circumcision ceremony performed &quot;on the eighth day&quot; on a 7-day old male infant by a mohel.&quot; [[User:Oneye1i|Oneye1i]] ([[User talk:Oneye1i|talk]]) 01:35, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

I agree and seeing no contrary opinions in 17 months i'll make the change as per [[WP:BB]]. &lt;small&gt;Warmest Regards, :)—&lt;sub&gt;[[user:thecurran|thecurran]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; [[user talk:thecurran|Speak your mind]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/thecurran|my past]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:04, 11 July 2012 (UTC)

== brit is the transfer of house from mother to father ==

I propose no changes since I cite no sources.  Please someone else research this.  Ishmael was born to Haggar into the House of Sarai, the chief wife of Avram.  Yitzhak was born into the House of Sarah, her name change coming from her &quot;miracle&quot; pregnancy by divine providence.  After the men were circumcised, Avram became Avraham, Ishmael became Ishmael ben Avraham, and Yizthak became Yitzhak ben Avraham.  So circumcision transfers males from the house of the mother to the house of the father.  This is, in my opinion, recording the changeover from matriarchal to patriarchal society.

Later, when there were Israelite tribes, the brit made the boy a member of the the tribe (the father's tribe), and they were expected to remain in the tribe and fight for the tribe.

It makes a female ceremony equivalent a little paradoxical, since girls are born into the house of their mother, and there is no transfer.  It also hints that women did not belong to the tribe, and could marry outside the tribe.  Men therefore often sought wives in other tribes.

== Medical Dangers ==
I propose that a paragraph or two dedicated to dangers of traditional Jewish circumcisions be added. May I add one? I will cite all medical complications that may occur. ([[User:TheDarkSideHasTacos|TheDarkSideHasTacos]] ([[User talk:TheDarkSideHasTacos|talk]]) 17:49, 16 August 2011 (UTC))
:That is handled in [[Circumcision]] and [[Circumcision controversies]], linked to in this article at [[Brit milah#The anti-circumcision movement and brit shalom]] as the dangers of which you speak are those that pertain to all circumcisions, religious or otherwise. This article is specifically about the religious covenant that includes the act of circumcision, not a repeat of [[Circumcision]]. -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] ([[User talk:Avraham|talk]]) 00:06, 17 August 2011 (UTC)

Jewish circumcision present other complication risks separate from medical circumcision. Such as the tranmission of STDs from oral-wound contact (doctors do not put their mouths on the child's penis) and accidental amputation of the penis (though this could occur in a medical circumcision as well). ([[User:TheDarkSideHasTacos|TheDarkSideHasTacos]] ([[User talk:TheDarkSideHasTacos|talk]]) 01:03, 17 August 2011 (UTC))
:You are referring to [[Brit milah#Medical controversy]], which, as you can see, is prominently in the article under [[Brit milah#Metzitzah technique]], where it belongs. -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] ([[User talk:Avraham|talk]]) 01:57, 17 August 2011 (UTC)
::Exactly. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:49, 18 August 2011 (UTC)


:::I have removed this text However, in an article titled “Is Metzitza bePeh Dangerous?” written by Dr. Daniel S.
