Could someone please archive this page, and close the sections now known to be authorered by a disruptive sockpuppet? Thanks to everyone with a level head, and especially our third opinion, Binksternet.--[[User:Tznkai|Tznkai]] ([[User talk:Tznkai|talk]]) 15:07, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

== 'Mother' vs 'pregnant woman' ==

I noticed that a lot of our sources use the word 'mother' when talking about a pregnant woman in relation to the subject of abortion, especially the religious sources. I think we need to stay true to the source when quoting it, and not switch terminology. If the source says 'pregnant woman' or 'woman', then use that terminology. If the source says 'mother', use that. This should save us the trouble of trying to decide what is politically correct, as a recently-banned editor was saying. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 18:11, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
:That should work. In general, if it's a first-time pregnancy, the expression you typically hear is &quot;She is / I am ''going to be'' a mother.&quot; [[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] &lt;sup&gt;''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]] 18:57, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
::Sure, we ought to track the sources, and we shouldn't pick out the sources that like the terminology we prefer.  One typically hears stuff like &quot;Abortion is sometimes needed to save the life of the mother.&quot;[[User:Ferrylodge|Ferrylodge]] ([[User talk:Ferrylodge|talk]]) 19:04, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
:::Yep, that's true. So go with what the source says, and we're covered. [[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] &lt;sup&gt;''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]] 19:19, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
::::Here's another wrinkle: What if she's 13. Is that a &quot;woman&quot;? [[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] &lt;sup&gt;''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]] 19:19, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
:::::Sounds like a fair compromise to me.  About that 13 year old - God only knows. - [[User:Schrandit|Schrandit]] ([[User talk:Schrandit|talk]]) 19:28, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
::::::The term 'woman' has sometimes been used to include minor females who are showing womanly traits. Being pregnant qualifies. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 19:33, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
&lt;--
What if the source uses &quot;unborn baby&quot;, &quot;murder&quot; etc.?  It isn't as simple as just deferring to what the source uses.  |→ [[User:Spaully|Spaully]]&lt;sup&gt;₪&lt;/sup&gt;[[User talk:Spaully|'''''†''''']] 11:57, 30 April 2009 ([[GMT]])

:If, for example, a source referring to an abortion in the USA is calling it &quot;murder&quot;, then it's probably not qualified as a source here other than being cited as a given church's opinion on the matter. &quot;Murder&quot; is a legal term, and if an abortion was performed legally, then by definition it is NOT &quot;murder&quot;, even if anti-abortionists think it is.

It's interesting to look through all of the abortion related articles for which terms they use.  The more scientifically oriented ones only use mother when describing a woman with a child.  Any religious sections tend to use 'mother' more liberally.  I don't know if this mainly reflects the type of editors for each article or the predominant use in the different fields.  'Mother' is generally used fairly sparingly throughout the articles, again this probably reflects the type of editor as opposed to a conscious consensus.  |→ [[User:Spaully|Spaully]]&lt;sup&gt;₪&lt;/sup&gt;[[User talk:Spaully|'''''†''''']] 12:10, 30 April 2009 ([[GMT]])

:I think 'mother' should only be used in specific circumstances.  Having looked through all of WPs abortion related articles they read well and the meaning is clear where 'woman' is used, or if necessary at the start of a paragraph 'pregnant woman'.  Obviously when quoting sections of sources whatever they use should stand.  On definitions:
::The most common definition of mother: ''A female parent; especially, one of the human race; a woman who has borne a child.''
:::Collection of dictionary links to [http://www.onelook.com/?w=mother&amp;ls=a mother], and [http://www.onelook.com/?w=parent&amp;ls=a parent].  Of these I did not find one that would suggest being pregnant makes a woman a mother.
:Now clearly mother is used in other circumstances, in conversation one might refer to a pregnant woman as a mother, but only where you are sure she is planning to become one (or I hope so if you have any tact!).  I will look through the article, and sources if possible, and think on it a bit more. |→ [[User:Spaully|Spaully]]&lt;sup&gt;₪&lt;/sup&gt;[[User talk:Spaully|'''''†''''']] 12:34, 30 April 2009 ([[GMT]])

::I'm an editor who usually works on military history articles where very strict standards are applied to articles. I don't suggest using 'mother' in place of 'woman' because I'm friendly to religion, and I don't suggest it lightly. I think the article should, consciously, choose to reflect the sources. For instance, the source I just added which reverted your change of 'mother' to 'woman' under the Muslim section, is a [http://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;pg=PA64 book about Islamic thought regarding death]. Editorial discussion in that book refers to 'pregnant woman', but phrases such as &quot;life of the mother&quot; and &quot;health of the mother&quot; appear when Islamic ideas are discussed. You'll see &quot;The mother cannot be sacrificed for the child&quot; and &quot;the mother is the origin of the fetus&quot; if you click on that link. I think it quite appropriate that wiki articles reflect in tone and style their sources. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 14:58, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

:::Thinking about it, the authors of many of these sources will themselves be from cultures where the default is to bear the child unless the woman is in grave danger; this will lead them to use terminology that to others may seem biased.  It is fine to use sources as the basis for the decision, but to always bear in mind that wikipedia articles have to retain a neutral point of view whereas many of the sources do not.  I will look for a discussion on this point, as a source that suggests the neutral ground for wording such things would be ideal, though it probably doesn't exist.  |→ [[User:Spaully|Spaully]]&lt;sup&gt;₪&lt;/sup&gt;[[User talk:Spaully|'''''†''''']] 15:17, 30 April 2009 ([[GMT]])

::::One thing to consider is the overall usage within the article. If it sometimes says &quot;mother&quot; and sometimes says &quot;pregnant woman&quot;, generally in reference to the way a source says it, that would tend to defuse the bias allegation that Spotfixer/TIIP was harping on. If it's all of one or the other, deliberately, it tends to look &quot;politically correct&quot; (toward one side or the other) and tends to evoke neutrality complaints.

:::::Just so y'all are aware, similar issues have come up a lot over the years.  For example, there's the conception vs. fertilization controversy, and the womb vs. uterus controversy.[[User:Ferrylodge|Ferrylodge]] ([[User talk:Ferrylodge|talk]]) 15:49, 30 April 2009 (UTC)
::::::Now you know why I don't edit these articles. &quot;womb&quot; vs. &quot;uterus&quot;? Where I come from, they're the same thing, just a colloquial term vs. a medical term. Good grief.

:::::::Yeah, it's pretty silly for anyone to try to have an article only use one or the other of those terms.

::::::::I think the core problem is that in casual conversation with a pregant woman / mother-to-be, these terms are used interchangeably with no issues.

(outdent)Hey, just wanted to point out that &quot;life of the mother&quot; isn't just a colloquialism, it is used in medicine and has been encoded in law.  Frankly, I prefer the term &quot;mother&quot; unless the term &quot;pregnant woman&quot; seems to fit better in the sentence but I'll take what we have now for the sake of compromise, and of course, all this is up for discussion. - [[User:Schrandit|Schrandit]] ([[User talk:Schrandit|talk]]) 03:49, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:This is pretty simple, really.  If I get pregnant, I become a pregnant woman.  If nine months pass and I have a live birth, I become a mother.  If I have an abortion or the pregnancy otherwise ends before then, I do not become a mother.  Of course, if I had already been a mother to begin with, I would remain one.

:Yes, sometimes people call pregnant women &quot;mothers&quot;, but this isn't accurate or neutral.  I've been very careful to leave this usage alone when it's in a direct quote, but otherwise, I've fixed it wherever I've seen it.

::Accurate? It is quite accurate to call a pregnant woman a mother if you are a religious scholar. Read some scholarly religious works and you'll see. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 00:53, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

:::As I said, when literally quoting a religious tract, I've left the word &quot;mother&quot; in place.  However, it's not neutral and its accuracy is clearly controversial.  Nobody disputes that a woman who is pregnant is a pregnant woman, so this term is perfectly safe to use.  On the other hand, medical practice is to avoid using it except where the woman has had a live birth.

:::To make this more fair, I'm not going to expect you to read the whole thing just to understand my point.  Instead, I'll quote a relevant sample:
::::&quot;The terms 'fetus' and 'pregnant woman' are grammatically more correct than 'baby' and 'mother'.  The latter names are used by some (including antiabortionists) euphemistically with a more sinister motivation — namely, to blur reality.  Antiabortionists also use 'baby' and 'mother' as 'linguistic fig leaves' to suggest that abortion is wrong: while the motivation of doctors using these terms is likely to differ from antiabortionists, it may be misinterpreted by patients.&quot;
:::Please feel free to read the whole thing so you can be sure that I'm not quoting out of context, but I think this is an overwhelmingly powerful argument both for accuracy and neutrality.  If for some reason a local majority disagrees with me, I will gladly take this to the next level.

:::::Is the article using that reference, the ''Textbook of perinatal medicine'', for information about religious thought relative to abortion?

::::::I'm sorry, but I think you might be confused about the context.

Even though this page is about religion, it's also bound by the same basic requirements for neutrality, so this medical textbook is entirely relevant.

:::Correct. As I already explained, we're held to a higher standard.
:::If it helps, I'll give you an example from journalism class.  When OJ was on trial, the media was obligated to report that a police officer had used a [[O._J._Simpson_murder_case#Mark_Fuhrman|particular racial epitaph]].  The term was offensive, of course, but it's not like they could have just pretended that he'd said &quot;African-American&quot; or any other neutral phrase.  However, they didn't use that word any more than they had to, and then only in the context of what the cop said.  And they never ever casually referred to OJ by that term.

This is [[WP:!VOTE|not a vote]], but if it were, it would only matter if everyone got to participate.

I will also add that no amount of !VOTES can form a consensus powerful enough to override the pillars of Wikipedia, such as [[WP:NPOV]].

:I don't agree. A woman who is carrying a zygote or greater in her uterus is commonly called a mother by herself, her family, her friends and her society. Both religious and lay people all over the world casually use the word &quot;mother&quot; to describe a pregnant woman. What's the evil you see? What's the non-neutral point of view? Where is [[WP:NPOV]] trespassed? You are coming at this from a black-white either-or perspective where pro-lifers are pitted in a death grip against pro-choicers. To me, this stance you hold is the non-neutral one! You have found a medico-political source that says the word &quot;mother&quot; has become a tool of pro-lifers who wish to skew opinion their way, and thus it should not be used by anyone who is neutral, and yet people of all stripes continue to say &quot;mother&quot; when they are conversing about pregnancy. 

:You might be surprised to find that I count myself a pro-choicer who uses the word &quot;mother&quot; to describe a pregnant woman just as casually as the other billions of people on earth who do the same.

:::That's one person writing a prescriptive text which aims to change word choice among medical personnel. Its mere presence proves my point: people commonly use the word &quot;mother&quot;. If they didn't, the author would not have seen fit to write against it. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 15:19, 15 November 2009 (UTC)
::::I'm not sure if you read the same article I did.  The point wasn't that you should ''never'' use &quot;mother&quot;, but that you should recognize that applying it to anyone other than woman who has given birth to children saddles it with connotative baggage.  This baggage may well be acceptable in the case of a woman who decides she wants to get pregnant and have children.  It's just an innocent truncation of &quot;mother-to-be&quot; to &quot;mother&quot;.  However, applying it to women with unwanted pregnancies is a different matter entirely, and it's precisely what we're dealing with when talking about abortion.
::::Fundamentally, your argument is not so much wrong as irrelevant.  It doesn't even matter that people &quot;commonly&quot; misuse &quot;mother&quot;.  People commonly do all sorts of things that are entirely unacceptable on Wikipedia, and this doesn't sway us as all.  What matters is whether calling a woman who has an abortion a &quot;mother&quot; is at all reasonable for articles here, and it's simply not.  The bias is so obvious that it's even commented on in [[Pro-life#Term_controversy]].  To use terms from the pro-life framing of the issue as if they were in some way neutral violates [[WP:NPOV]], and nothing you said has changed this conclusion.

:::::The small mention of mother at [[Pro-life#Term_controversy]] is poorly written and incomplete. Yes, pro-lifers use the term, but ''everybody'' does. Your recent addition to that article of the prescriptive word-use instructions for medical personnel still does not have any relevance on this page.
:::::I have two dictionaries on my shelf: one is Webster's New Collegiate from 1979 and the other is Oxford Illustrated from 1985. In both, the word &quot;mother&quot; has many uses, far more than just a woman who has given birth. The first definition in Webster's is simple: &quot;a female parent.&quot; We turn to &quot;parent&quot; to find that it means &quot;one who begets or brings forth offspring.&quot; &quot;Beget&quot;? Now we have the word &quot;mother&quot; meaning &quot;a female who begets or brings forth offspring.&quot; To me, that opens up the possibilities. As well, &quot;mother&quot; can be defined in more general terms as the &quot;source, origin.&quot; Clearly, the word &quot;mother&quot; can include a woman who has provided ova for fertilization. The word is not limited to its primary meaning of a woman who has given birth to a child. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 16:08, 15 November 2009 (UTC)

::::::Even if it were true -- and it's not -- just because &quot;everybody does it&quot; doesn't mean that we get to break [[WP:NPOV]] by doing it, too.  What people ''actually'' do is use the word &quot;mother&quot; only when they know that the woman ''intends'' to carry the pregnancy to term and therefore become a mother.  Aside from thoughtless people, the exceptions are pro-life advocates, who use it in a dishonest way (just as the Term Controversy paragraph explained) to exert pressure.

::::::Careful and honest speakers recognize that intentions don't guarantee results, so they speak of &quot;prospective mothers&quot; and &quot;mothers to be&quot;, knowing that pregnancies can end all by themselves.  When talking about egg donors, they usually just say &quot;egg donor&quot;, and if they use &quot;mother&quot; at all, it's likewise with a qualifier, such as &quot;biological mother&quot;.

::::::The bottom line is that, if I become pregnant and decide to get an abortion, I am at no point a mother, and characterizing me as one would be deeply manipulative and offensive; I'd report you for [[WP:CIVIL]] in a heartbeat.

[http://pcahistory.org/pca/2-015.html This reference] outlines the scriptural case against abortion and contains many of the Bible passages that were referenced previously by Canonlawyer79.

==Indirect abortion==
The article says that the Catholic Church accepts indirect abortion, i.e. in order to save the life of the mother during an ectopic pregnancy. While this is technically accurate, the article should perhaps note that several Catholic leaders have criticized the abusive use of indirect abortion for cases that may not actually be letal to the mother. Church leaders have also denounced the confusion between indirect abortion and therapeutic abortion, since they do not accept the notion that abortions can be therapeutic. See the article [[indirect abortion]] for more details. [[User:ADM|ADM]] ([[User talk:ADM|talk]]) 22:31, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

== Catholicism and abortion ==

The Catholic Church doesn't morally accept any abortion for any reason even if the life of the mother is &quot;saved&quot;.

From: 
Fundamental Dignity at Every Stage of Life: An Argument Against Abortion Rights Featuring the Rev. J. Daniel Mindling

Featuring:
The Rev. J. Daniel Mindling, Professor of Moral Theology, Mount St. Mary's Seminary 
To explore the case against abortion rights, the Pew Forum turns to the Rev. J. Daniel Mindling, a professor of moral philosophy and academic dean at Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Emmetsburg, Md. In addition to his academic duties, Mindling serves as a consultant to the Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities at the U.S. ''Catholic'' Conference of Bishops.

Interviewer:
David Masci, Senior Research Fellow, Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life

'''Let me shift gears on you and ask: Is there ever a case in which terminating a pregnancy is justified? If a woman is going to die without an abortion, is there a valid reason to perform the procedure?'''

St. Paul is pretty clear: we shouldn't do evil that good would come of it. The dignity of the unborn child is not lost because the mother's life is at risk. The dignity of the unborn child isn't lost because the mother would prefer not to have this child. The dignity of the unborn child isn't something that the mother bestows on the child and that the mother is free to take away at will.

'''But if a mother dies because she hasn't received an abortion, her fetus may die as well. So some would argue that it would be better to abort the fetus and save the mother's life as opposed to losing both of them.'''

Let's use the word &quot;murder&quot; just because of its shock value. This person is going to die unless we murder this other person? Would it be okay, then, to murder? Would it be okay for me to murder to save one life or two lives or three? How many lives would it take before it would be okay for me to murder? I think we are not free to change the moral quality of the act and say, &quot;Well, I guess it's not murder then because something good may come of it.&quot; Murder is always wrong. --[[User:Rcatholic|Rcatholic]] ([[User talk:Rcatholic|talk]]) 22:53, 9 May 2009 (UTC)

To quote the article &quot;The Roman Catholic Church believes that life begins at conception and, as such, opposes abortion under all circumstances.&quot;  However, it think is important that information about the [[Principle of Double Effect]] be included in the article, so that people unfamiliar with the subject understand it.

::If your going to talk about &quot;double-effect,&quot; you also need to mention that abortion is considered an intrinsic evil. In other words, according to the CC, direct abortion is ALWAYS morally wrong--regardless of intention. Also, isn't it kind of stupid to say that the CC &quot;believes that life begins at conception&quot; since it is a scientific fact that life begins at conception? Better to say, &quot;human life&quot; begins at conception, but even this is misleading. If a an organism has human DNA, what else can it be but a human life?

Having the two concepts brought together here was in violation of [[WP:SYNTH]]. The source says abortion is a grave offense and morally evil; those words are retained in the section here. The third paragraph made the Catholic section too large, especially in light of having a link to the main article.

Second, I think some mention of Catholic Social teaching (the third paragraph deleted) needs to be included since it is unique and an integral part of Catholic Teaching on abortion. Other religions say make statements about the morality of abortion; as far as I know, only Catholicism states directly that the state has a positive role in protecting the unborn.

I don't need to add the abortion wikiproject's pages to my already-too-busy editing schedule. I think that the word &quot;mother&quot; reflects pro-lifer bias and carries emotion-laden propaganda baggage only if it is allowed by other people to be taken away from them and so recast in nuance.

== Word choices and references ==

A minor edit war has developed in the last week between IronAngelAlice and two editors, Binksternet and Boromir123. The conflict, as I [Binksternet] see it, is not so deep-rooted that we cannot work it out equably. It appears to be a matter of wording, mainly, with little change of references. Here are the versions, with IronAngelAlice's paragraphs in navy blue, and the former text in green:

===Christianity===
&lt;font color=&quot;Navy&quot; face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;The intersection of Christianity and abortion has a long and complex history though there is no mention of abortion in the Christian Bible. At different times, early Christians held different beliefs about abortion, and most contemporary Christian denominations have nuanced positions, thoughts and teachings about abortion. More generally, some Christian denominations can be considered pro-life while others may be considered pro-choice. Additionally, there are sizable minorities in all denominations that disagree with their denomination's stance on abortion.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;There is no direct mention in the Christian Bible about abortion. Christian thought on the matter had its beginnings in Judaism, after which both strict and lenient views on abortion were voiced over next two millennia. Many Christian denominations currently have nuanced positions, thoughts and teachings concerning abortion, especially in extenuating circumstances.

The Catholic Church and Orthodox Church oppose abortion in every situation, but permit acts which indirectly result in the death of the fetus in the case where the mother's life is threatened. The Catholic Church regards the moment of conception as the start of life and therefore regards all types of abortion as equivalent to murder. Most Southern Baptists agree with the Catholic Church's teaching about abortion. More generally, some Christian traditions can be considered pro-life while others may be considered pro-choice.&lt;/font&gt;

::I like your sizable minorities edit as well Iron Angel. I do think a sentence mentioning Catholic and Orthodox church views is important. At the same time, mentioning the pro choice position of the Methodist, Lutheran, and other protestant demoninations would be fair.

===Hinduism===
&lt;font color=&quot;Navy&quot; face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;Hindus hold varying stances on abortion. Some Hindu theologians believe personhood begins at 3 months and develops through to 5 months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body. Other Hindus have suggested that abortion, especially the abortion pill, is a major step towards women's empowerment. Hindus generally tend to support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at risk or when the fetus has a severe developmental abnormality. Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on Sex-selective Abortions. Some Hindus have argued that contraception such as emergency contraceptives are a major step towards women's empowerment and the prevention of abortions.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;Individual Hindus hold varying stances on abortion; however, according to the BBC, traditional Hindu texts and teachings condemn elective abortions. Hindus generally tend to support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at risk or when the fetus has a severe developmental abnormality. Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on Sex-selective Abortions. A minority of Hindu theologians believe personhood begins at 3 months and therefore considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body. Some Hindus have argued that contraception such as emergency contraceptives are a major step towards women's empowerment and the prevention of abortions.&lt;/font&gt;

====Comments on Hindu section==== 
*Aside from the grammar and format problems in both versions, the entry from IronAngelAlice has to its advantage the revelation of the abortion pill, though it founders on repetition of empowerment. Both versions have some theologians saying personhood begins at three months, but what about those who believe differently? In contrast to 'some' theologians, the remainder would be the majority.

*Hindu texts are explicit in their denouncement of abortion but in reality abortion is widespread as a means to ensure male progeny in India. &quot;The Hindu&quot; however is a secular, non religious newspaper that has no religious connotation.

===Islam===
&lt;font color=&quot;Navy&quot; face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;Although there are different opinions among Islamic scholars about when life begins and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after four months - the point at which, in Islam, a fetus is thought to become a living soul - is not permissible. Many Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.

Among Muslims, abortion is Haram or forbidden in most cases but is acceptable depending on the circumstances around the pregnancy. In the case where the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, Muslim jurists agree that abortion is allowed based on the principle that &quot;the greater evil [the mother's death] should be warded off by the lesser evil [abortion].&quot; In these cases the physician is considered a better judge than the scholar.&lt;/font&gt;

====Comments on Islam section====
Poor quality refs, swapped paragraphs with slight word changes. This whole section could use a shot in the arm. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 00:10, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

**Again, I think the version I have been reverting to is more neutral.  There is no single (only) belief among Muslims about abortion. To say otherwise is disingenuous. --[[User:IronAngelAlice|IronAngelAlice]] ([[User talk:IronAngelAlice|talk]]) 21:08, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

::Perhaps, but I think most sources state that Islam is anti-abortion. I have no problem with including both sides but notice that most Muslim nations forbid abortion except for life, rape, etc (not saying however that abortions don't occur in such countries!).


== Christianity Section  ==
It is quite clear from the references that not all scholars believe all early Christians believed that abortion is a sin.  So to say early Christians &quot;declared&quot; abortion a sin is not in the least bit accurate.  I changed the paragraph accordingly, using references of course.  It also seems to me that '''''leading''''' the second paragraph with a list all the denominations that are pro-life is a bit much..  Therefore, I changed that paragraph as well, using references.

:It is certainly true that not ''all'' scholars believe that ''all'' early Christians considered abortion a sin.  And there is no doubt that not ''all'' scholars believe that ''all'' early Christians considered that abortion, even early abortion, was not a sin.  With regard to denominations, surely a mention of relative weight is decidedly appropriate when discussing Christianity and abortion.
:Where previously proponents of one point of view were presented as &quot;finding&quot; and &quot;noting&quot;, while proponents of another were presented as merely &quot;claiming&quot;, I have made the verbs uniform.
