[[File:Eris (Discordia).jpg|thumb|[[Eris (mythology)|Our lady Eris]], [[goddess]] of [[wikt:discord|discord]]]]

'''Discordianism''' is a [[religion]] and [[parody religion]] based on the worship of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] (also known as Discordia), the Greco-Roman goddess of chaos. It was founded circa 1958–1959 after the publication of its (first) holy book the [[Principia Discordia]], written by [[Malaclypse the Younger]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley|Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]] after a series of [[shared hallucination]]s at a bowling alley.

The religion has been likened to [[Zen]], based on similarities with [[absurdism|absurdist]] interpretations of the [[Rinzai school]], as well as [[Taoist]] philosophy. Discordianism is centered on the idea that both [[Cosmos|order]] and [[Chaos theory|disorder]] are [[illusion]]s imposed on the universe by the human [[nervous system]], and that neither of these illusions of apparent order and disorder is any more [[accurate]] or [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]ly [[truth|true]] than the other.

There is some division as to whether it should be regarded as a [[parody religion]], and if so to what degree.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...It should on no account be taken seriously but is far more serious than most jokes&quot; and &quot;See ... [also] ''ha ha only serious''&quot; [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/Discordianism.html The Jargon File v4.4.7] but present at least as far back as v4.0.0, (1996, July 24); The entry for discordianism begins, &quot;Somewhere between parody, social commentary, and religion...&quot; Rabinovitch, Shelly &amp; [[James R.

ISBN 0-8065-2406-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and because there is an encouragement to form [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] and [[cabal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usil&amp;c=trads&amp;id=7358 |title=WitchVox Traditions Discordianism Article |publisher=Witchvox.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-31}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://s23.org/wiki/Discordian_Cabals Discordian Cabals – S23Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==
The foundational document of Discordianism is the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', fourth edition, written by [[Malaclypse the Younger]], an alias of Greg Hill. This book contains many references to an earlier source, ''[[The Honest Book of Truth]]'' (HBT). From the quotations, the HBT seems to be arranged like the [[Bible]], consisting of verses grouped into chapters grouped into books grouped into the HBT itself. The ''Principia'' includes a large portion of (or possibly all of) a chapter of &quot;The Book of Explanations&quot; which recounts how the HBT was revealed to [[Kerry Wendell Thornley|Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00041&lt;/ref&gt; The tale of the discovery of the HBT contains many similarities to the tale of the discovery of the [[Book of Mormon]], and that Ravenhurst had been a [[Mormon]]. It also includes part of the next chapter, telling how the HBT was taken by a garbage collector, who refused to return it.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00030&lt;/ref&gt;

Discordianism can be interpreted as a belief that [[disharmony]] and chaos are equally valid aspects of [[reality]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The ''Principia Discordia'' often hints that Discordianism was founded as a [[dialectic]] [[antithesis]] to more popular religions based on order, although the [[rhetoric]] throughout the book describes chaos as a much more underlying impulse of the universe. This may have been done with the intention of merely &quot;balancing out&quot; the creative forces of order and disorder, but the focus is on the more disorderly aspects of the world — at times the forces of order are even [[wikt:vilify|vilified]]. There are other religions that revere the principles of [[harmony (disambiguation)|harmony]] and order in the [[Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreligions.psu.edu/world_religions15.htm |title=World Religions |publisher=Worldreligions.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/design.htm#SSH2c.i |title=Design Arguments for the Existence of God [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2009-04-12 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The very idea of a Discordian organization is something of a [[paradox]]. Nevertheless, some structure is indicated in ''Principia Discordia''. The most general group, presumably including all Discordians (and potentially others), is The Discordian Society, whose definition is “The Discordian Society has no definition”.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00032&lt;/ref&gt; Within the society are [[sect]]s of Discordianism, each under the direction of an “Episkopos” (''overseer'' or ''bishop'' in [[Koine Greek]], the same word used in the [[New Testament]] for [[Bishop (Christianity)|Christian Bishops]].)

Discordians who do not form their own [[sect]]s, whether they belong to someone else's sect or not, make up the [[Legion of Dynamic Discord]], and may be referred to as Legionnaires. Would-be Discordians are told in the ''Principia Discordia'':

{{quote|If you want in on the Discordian Society&lt;br/&gt;
then declare yourself what you wish&lt;br/&gt;
do what you like&lt;br/&gt;
and tell us about it&lt;br/&gt;
or &lt;br/&gt;
if you prefer&lt;br/&gt;
don't.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are no rules anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;
The Goddess Prevails.|Malaclypse the Younger|''Principia Discordia'', Page 00032}}

=== POEE ===
The sect of Discordianism founded by Malaclypse the Younger and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley|Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]] is known as the ''Paratheo-Anametamystikhood Of Eris Esoteric'' (POEE), a non-prophet irreligious disorganisation, and the ''Principia Discordia'' tells about POEE in particular, as well as Discordianism in general.

For example, the ''Principia'' contains some details about the structure of POEE. In particular:

{{quote|POEE has 5 DEGREES:&lt;br/&gt;
There is the neophyte, or LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLE.&lt;br/&gt;
The LEGIONNAIRE DEACON, who is catching on.&lt;br/&gt;
An Ordained POEE PRIEST/PRIESTESS or a CHAPLAIN.&lt;br/&gt;
The HIGH PRIEST, the Polyfather.&lt;br/&gt;
And POEE POPE.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
POEE LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLES are authorized to initiate others as Discordian Society Legionnaires. PRIESTS appoint their own DEACONS. The POLYFATHER ordains Priests. I don't know about the POPES.|Malaclypse the Younger|''Principia Discordia'', Page 00022}}

According to the ''Principia Discordia'', POEE is “a tribe of [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[theology|theologians]], [[magic (paranormal)|magician]]s, [[science|scientists]], [[art]]ists, [[clown]]s, and similar [[mania]]cs who are intrigued by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] goddess of confusion and her doings.” Furthermore it states that “POEE subscribes to the [[#Law of Fives|Law Of Fives]] of Omar's sect” and “POEE also recognizes the Holy [[23 (number)|23]].”

Paratheo-Anametamystikhood can be taken to mean &quot;equivalent deity, reversing beyond-mystique&quot;. Loosely interpreted, it basically states that &quot;all deities are equivalent, there is no great mystery about that&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

=== Episkopos ===
Episkoposes are the Overseers of sects of Discordianism, who have presumably created their own sect of Discordianism. They speak to Eris through the use of their [[pineal gland]]. It is said in the ''Principia Discordia'' that Eris says different things to each listener. She may even say radically different things to each Episkopos but, all of what she says is equally her word (even if it contradicts another iteration of her word).&lt;ref name = &quot;poeepr&quot;&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00024&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Episkoposes have an assumed name and/or title of bizarre nature and self-proclaimed 'mystic import', such as Malaclypse the Younger, Omnibenevolent Polyfather of Virginity in Gold; Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst, Bull Goose of Limbo; Professor Mu-Chao; and Kassil the Erratic. Some Discordians choose their entire title by themselves, some turn to random generators, others assimilate things from other people, and a few never really offer any explanation.

=== Popes ===
According to the ''Principia Discordia'', “every single man, woman, and child on this [[Earth]]” is a [[pope]].&lt;ref name = &quot;kvvfee&quot;&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00036&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the ''Principia Discordia'' is an official Pope card that may be reproduced and distributed freely to anyone and everyone.&lt;ref name = &quot;kvvfee&quot;/&gt; Papacy is not granted through possession of this card; it merely informs people that they are “a genuine and authorized Pope” of Discordia.

While the powers of a Pope are not enumerated in the ''Principia'', the card states, “A Pope is someone who is not under the authority of the authorities.” Some Discordians have also taken it upon themselves to further elaborate upon the powers of a Pope. On the back of some Pope cards, the following message can be found:

{{quote|The rights of a Pope include but are not necessarily limited to:
#To invoke [[infallibility]] at any time, including retroactively.
#To completely rework the Erisian [[church body|church]].
#To [[baptise]], [[marry]], and [[bury]] (with the permission of the deceased in the latter two cases).
#To [[excommunicate]], de-excommunicate, re-excommunicate, and de-re-excommunicate (no backsies!) both him-/her-/it-/them-/your-/our-/Him-/Her-/It-/Them-/Your-/Our-self/selves and others (if any).
#To perform all [[rite]]s and functions deemed inappropriate for a Pope of Discordia.
}}

The third right (requiring permission from the deceased in cases of [[burying]] or [[marriage]], but not baptism) may be a reference to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] practice of [[baptism for the dead]], or it may just be a witty conflation of [[marriage]] and [[death]].

This understanding of the notion of Pope has far reaching consequences in Discordianism. For example, the introduction to ''Principia Discordia'' says, “Only a Pope may [[canonize]] a [[Saint]]. ... So you can ordain yourself—and anyone or anything else—a Saint.” The last enumerated right of a Pope may be an allusion to the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]].

In most of his public presentations and lectures, [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s first gesture when taking the stage would be to declare everyone within the audience to be ordained Discordian Popes.

A female version, with the word ''Mome'' substituted for Pope, has also been promulgated.

== Philosophy ==
There are as many interpretations of Discordianism as there are Discordians,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} centering around the words &quot;Ancient Greeks&quot;, &quot;Chaos Worship&quot; and &quot;Anarchism&quot;. This is an extremely debatable assertion as to what would define Discordian philosophy as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Indeed, it is a notion directly confronted by the concept of the Eristic Illusion, as mentioned in the following passage, a summary of part of the Discordian philosophy which appears in the ''Principia Discordia'':

{{quote|''Here follows some psycho-metaphysics.''

If you are not hot for philosophy, best just to skip it.

The Aneristic Principle is that of ''apparent order''; the Eristic Principle is that of ''apparent disorder''. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of ''pure chaos'', which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.

With our concept-making apparatus called &quot;the [[brain]]&quot; we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.

The ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled &quot;reality&quot; and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see &quot;reality&quot; differently.

It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.

We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ''order'' is in the ''grid''. That is the Aneristic Principle.

Western [[philosophy]] is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be [[truth|true]]. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the ''Aneristic Illusion''. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.

''Disorder'' is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like &quot;relation&quot;, no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is &quot;absence of female-ness&quot;, or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.

The belief that &quot;order is true&quot; and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.

The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.
[[Reality]] is the original Rorschach. Verily! So much for all that.|Malaclypse the Younger|''Principia Discordia'', Pages 00049–00050}}

And this, from the ''Principia Discordia''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s very beginning, a Discordian [[kōan]]:

{{quote|''Greater Poop'': Is Eris true?

''Malaclypse the Younger'': Everything is true.

''GP'': Even false things?

''M2'': Even false things are true.

''GP'': How can that be?

''M2'': I don't know man, I didn't do it.}}

=== Chao ===
Chao (pronounced &quot;cow&quot;) is a [[neologism]] for a single unit of chaos. In Discordianism, the chao is a symbol of the [[’Pataphysics|'pataphysical]] nature of reality. The word is a [[pun]], enabling this [[quatrain]] from the ''Principia Discordia'': {{quote|To diverse gods do mortals bow; [[Holy Cow]], and Wholly Chao.}}

==== Sacred Chao ====
[[File:Sacred-Chao.svg|thumb|The Sacred Chao]]
The ''Sacred Chao'' is a symbol used by Discordians to illustrate the interrelatedness of order and disorder. It resembles a [[Taijitu|Yin-Yang symbol]], but according to the ''Principia Discordia'':

{{quote|The Sacred Chao is not the Yin-Yang of the Taoists. It is the ''Hodge-Podge'' of the Erisians. And, instead of a Podge spot on the Hodge side, it has a ''pentagon'' which symbolizes the ''Aneristic Principle'', and instead of a Hodge spot on the Podge side, it depicts the ''Golden Apple of Discordia'' to symbolize the ''Eristic Principle''.

The Sacred Chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know about absolutely anything, and more! It even symbolizes everything not worth knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding the Hodge-Podge.|Malaclypse the Younger|''Principia Discordia'', Page 00049}}

The choice of the pentagon as a symbol of the Aneristic Principle is partly related to [[The Pentagon]] in [[Virginia]] near [[Washington, D.C.]], partly a nod to the [[#Law of Fives|Law of Fives]], partially for the [[Golden Ratio]] references associated with the pentagon/apple allegory, and wholly for the five-sided pentagon from the &quot;Starbuck's Pebbles&quot; story in the ''Discordia''. The Golden Apple of Discordia is the one from the story of The Original Snub (below).

=== Law of Fives ===
The Law of Fives is summarized in the ''Principia Discordia'':

{{quote|The Law of Fives states simply that: ''All things happen in fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of five, or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5.''

The Law of Fives is never wrong.|Malaclypse the Younger|''Principia Discordia'', Page 00016}}

Like most of Discordianism, the Law of Fives appears on the surface to be either some sort of weird joke, or bizarre supernaturalism; but under this, it may help clarify the Discordian view of how the human mind works. Lord Omar is quoted later on the same page as having written, &quot;I find the Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look.&quot;

Appendix Beth of [[Robert Shea]]'s and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' considers some of the numerology of Discordianism, and the question of what would happen to the Law of Fives if everyone had six fingers on each hand. The authors assert that the real Law of Fives is realizing that everything can be related to the number five ''if you try hard enough''. Sometimes the steps required may be highly convoluted. Incidentally, the number five appears five times within the quote describing the Law of Fives, which is stated in 23 words, and 2 plus 3 is 5.

Another way of looking at the Law of Fives is as a symbol for the observation of reality changing that which is being observed in the observer's mind. Just as how when one looks for fives in reality, one finds them, so will one find conspiracies, ways to determine when the apocalypse will come, and so on and so forth when one decides to look for them. It cannot be proven wrong, because it proves itself reflexively when looked at through this lens.

At its basic level, the Law of Fives is a practical demonstration that perception is ''intent-sensitive''; that is, the perceiver's intentions inform the perception. To whatever extent one considers that perception is identical with reality, then, it has the corollary that reality is intent-sensitive.

The Law of Fives is related to the significance of the number 23 and the [[23 Enigma]] in the Illuminatus!-trilogy, as 2 plus 3 equals 5.

=== Original Snub ===
[[File:Apple of Discord.png|thumb|[[Apple of Discord]]]]
The Original Snub is the Discordian name for the events preceding the [[Judgment of Paris]], although more focus is put on the actions of Eris. [[Zeus]] believes that Eris is a troublemaker, so he does not invite her to [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]'s wedding. This is “The Doctrine of the Original Snub”.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple-of-discord&quot;&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Pages 00017–00018&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word ''kallisti'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ''καλλίστῃ'', to the prettiest one) inscribed in it. This, the [[Apple of Discord]], is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Holy Chao. The apple is traditionally described as being made of gold,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html The Judgement of Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''Principia Discordia'' notes a debate over whether the “gold” described was “[[gold|metallic gold]] or [[Acapulco gold|Acapulco]].” The story also relates that the first thing Eris did after throwing the Apple of Discord into the wedding was to joyously partake of a hot dog (thus &quot;a Discordian is to partake of No Hot Dog Buns&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;apple-of-discord&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;pentabarf&quot;&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00004&lt;/ref&gt;

When the female wedding guests disagree about who the apple is meant for, Zeus decides to leave the decision to [[Paris of Troy]]. Aphrodite bribes Paris, leading to the [[Trojan War]], which “is said to be The First War among men.”&lt;ref name=&quot;apple-of-discord&quot; /&gt;

Some recent interpretations of the Original Snub place Eris as being not at all mischievous with her delivery of the apple, but instead suggest that Eris was simply bringing the apple as a wedding present for Thetis. This interpretation would see Eris as innocent and her causing of chaos as a by-product of the other wedding guests' reaction upon seeing her at the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Liber Malorum]] ''Liber Malorum – Children Of the Apple'' – page 375&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Curse of Greyface ===
One of the most important parts of Discordianism, The Curse of Greyface features prominently on several pages of the ''Principia Discordia''. According to claims made in the ''Principia'', Greyface was a man who lived in the year 1166 BCE and taught that life is serious and play is sin. The curse is the psychological and spiritual imbalance that results from these beliefs, both individually and within groups, nations, and [[civilizations]].

According to the ''Principia'', Greyface existed and had followers who he encouraged to &quot;Look at all the order around you&quot; (''Principia Discordia'' page 00042), and he somehow convinced mankind to agree with his ideas about Serious Order. The ''Principia'' notes that it is something of a mystery why Greyface gained so many followers when anyone could have looked at all of the ''disorder'' in the world.

{{quote|Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.|Malaclypse the Younger|''Principia Discordia'', Page 00042}}

According to the ''Principia'', by accepting that life is a serious, orderly matter, the followers of Greyface end up viewing things as either ''orderly'' or ''disorderly''. In this system, order is preferred to disorder at all costs.

An alternative is to view disorder as preferable at all costs. To quote: &quot;To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder&quot; – Malaclypse the Younger, K.S.C.

In addition to the generic advice of cultivating your natural love of chaos and playing with Her, the ''Principia Discordia'' provides &quot;The Turkey Curse Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo&quot; to counteract The Curse of Greyface.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 64&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkey Curse is designed to counteract destructive order. It derives its name from the fact that the [[incantation]] resembles the sounds of a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]].

=== Law of Eristic Escalation ===
The ''Principia Discordia'' contains the Law of Eristic Escalation.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;
This law states that &quot;Imposition of Order = Escalation of Chaos&quot;. It elaborates on this point by saying that the more order is imposed the longer it takes for the chaos to arise and the greater the chaos that arises.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The idea is not new; it is mentioned in the [[s:Tao Te Ching (Wikisource translation)#Chapter 57|Tao Te Ching]]: &quot;the more laws and orders are written, the more thieves there are&quot;.

This can be read as an argument against [[zero tolerance]] and [[hard security]], or just a statement about the world and human nature. It can also be seen as a parallel to the [[second law of thermodynamics]] which states that [[entropy]] (the number of states a given system can occupy) never decreases over time. It is also reminiscent of [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's Third Law]], where every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Incidentally, if you add those Laws together you get the Law of Five, as discussed earlier.

=== Pentabarf ===
The Pentabarf is the doctrine of Discordianism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is as follows:
#There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess. There is no Movement but The Erisian Movement and it is The Erisian Movement. And every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved home of a Golden Worm.
#A Discordian Shall Always use the Official Discordian Document Numbering System.
#A Discordian is required to, the first Friday after his illumination, Go Off Alone &amp; Partake Joyously of a Hot Dog; this Devotive Ceremony to Remonstrate against the popular [[Paganism]]s of the Day: of [[Roman Catholic]] Christendom (no meat on Friday), of [[Judaism]] (no meat of Pork), of [[Hindi]]c Peoples (no meat of Beef), of [[Buddhist]]s (no meat of animal), and of Discordians (no Hot Dog Buns).
#A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns, for Such was the Solace of Our Goddess when She was Confronted with The Original Snub.
#A Discordian is Prohibited from Believing What he reads.

The Pentabarf is the most fundamental of all Discordian catmas. (&quot;Catma&quot; is a general term for Discordian teachings, sayings, quotations, explanations, jokes and illustrations, as distinguished from Discordian &quot;[[dogma]]&quot;, which consists of certain specific passages from ''The Honest Book of Truth'', cited in ''Principia''.)

The 5th law mirrors both the nature of [[Taoist]] sayings (&quot;the Tao that can be named is not the true Tao&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;from the [[Tao Te Ching]] 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; and Zen kōans (&quot;If you meet the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] on your path, kill him&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;A famous quotation from the Zen master [[Linji Yixuan|Linji]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also similar to the [[Epimenides paradox]] (&quot;All Cretans are liars&quot;), and several other [[paradoxes]].

== Five tons of Flax ==
In the Principia Discordia, &quot;Five tons of flax&quot; is given as the answer to the question, &quot;Is there an essential meaning behind POEE?&quot; (This is a reference to a [[Zen]] story about &quot;[[Kōan#Examples of traditional kōans|Three pounds of flax]]&quot;.) Discordians have taken &quot;Five tons of flax&quot; as a slogan or as a universal answer to philosophical questions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In the ''Illuminatus! Trilogy'' by Robert Shea and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], which draws heavily upon Discordianism, &quot;Flaxscrip&quot; is depicted as a genuine form of [[scrip]], serving to avoid the use of government-issued currency.

== Pineal gland ==
&quot;Consult your [[pineal gland]]&quot; is a common saying in Discordianism. Although it has never been proven, the pineal gland is believed by some, such as [[Rick Strassman]], to produce trace amounts of DMT ([[dimethyltryptamine]]), a [[psychedelic]] chemical which is believed to play a role in [[dream]]ing and other mystical states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rickstrassman.com/dmt/chaptersummaries.html|title=Chapter Summaries for DMT: The Spirit Molecule|accessdate=2006-09-12|author=[[Rick Strassman]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060826175610/http://www.rickstrassman.com/dmt/chaptersummaries.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pineal gland was also used in [[Descartes]]'s explanation of [[Cartesian Dualism]] as the &quot;seat of the soul&quot; and the connection between the material and immaterial world. In some cases it is referred to as &quot;the atrophied third eye&quot;. It has also been suggested that the [[third eye]] (''[[Ajna]]'') physically resides at this location between the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]] of the brain.

== Discordian calendar ==
{{Main|Discordian calendar}}
The [[Discordian calendar|Discordian]] or Erisian calendar is an alternative [[calendar]] used by some Discordians. It is specified on page 00034 of the Principia Discordia.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00034&lt;/ref&gt; The Discordian year 1 YOLD is [[1160s BC|1166 BC]]. Elsewhere in the ''Principia Discordia'', it is mentioned that the [[Discordianism#Curse_of_Greyface|Curse of Greyface]] occurred in 1166 BC, so this is presumably the [[Epoch (reference date)|start-date]] of the calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00042&lt;/ref&gt; As a reference, {{CURRENTYEAR}} AD is {{Dis-year}} (Which also corresponds with the Law of 5, 3+1=4, 7-4=3, and 8-3=5)YOLD (Year of Our Lady of Discord). While the abbreviation &quot;YOLD&quot; isn't used in the Principia, and the phrase &quot;Year of Our Lady of Discord&quot; is only mentioned once,&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Page 00053&lt;/ref&gt; it is a Discordian tradition to use that designation. Most common Linux operating system-distributions have the command ''ddate'' to show the current Discordian date.
