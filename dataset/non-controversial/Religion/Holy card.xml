      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5525">[[Image:holycard.jpg|frame|A German holy card from around 1910 depicting the [[Crucifixion]]]]
In the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition, '''holy cards''' or '''prayer cards''' are small, [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] pictures [[Mass production|mass-produced]] for the use of the faithful. They typically depict a religious scene or a [[saint]] in an image about the size of a [[playing card]]. The reverse typically contains a [[prayer]], some of which promise an [[indulgence]] for its recitation. The circulation of these cards is an important part of the visual [[folk culture]] of Roman Catholics.

==Old master prints==
[[Old master print]]s, nearly all on religious subjects, served many of the same functions as holy cards, especially the cheaper [[woodcut]]s; the earliest dated surviving example is from 1423, probably from southern Germany, and depicts [[Saint Christopher]], with handcolouring, it is found as part of the binding of a manuscript of the ''Laus Virginis'' (1417) which belongs to the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/specialcollections/collections/guide/atoz/incunabula/|title=Incunabula|work=Guide to Special Collections|publisher=John Rylands University Library|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Rylands Library (1969) ''Catalogue of an Exhibition of Manuscripts and Early Printing Originating in Germany''. Manchester: John Rylands Library; p. 15 (gives references to Dodgson: Woodcuts; 2 &amp; Schreiber: Manuel; 1349)&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[engraving]] or [[etching]] were more commonly used. Some had elaborate borders of paper [[lace]] surrounding the images; these were called ''dévotes dentelles'' in France.

==Lithography==
The invention of colour [[lithography]] made it possible to reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of the cards.  An early centre of their manufacture was in the environs of the [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of St Sulpice]] in Paris; the lithographed images made there were done in delicate [[pastel]] colours, and proved extremely influential on later designs. [[Belgium]] and Germany also became centres of the manufacture of holy cards, as did [[Italy]] in the twentieth century. Catholic printing houses (such as [[Bayard Presse|Maison de la Bonne Presse]] in France and [[Ars Sacra]] in Germany) produced large numbers of cards, and often a single design was printed by different companies in different countries.

==Special types of cards==
Special holy cards are printed for Roman Catholics to be distributed at funerals; these are &quot;[[In memoriam card]]s&quot;, with details and often a photograph of the person whom they commemorate as well as prayers printed on the back.  Other specialized holy cards record [[baptism]]s, [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]s, and other religious anniversaries.  Others are not customized, and are circulated to promote the [[veneration]] of the saints and images they bear.

At the end of the nineteenth century, some Protestants attempted to answer these Roman Catholic images with similar images of their own. They produced ''Bible cards'' or ''[[Sunday school]] cards'', with lithographed illustrations depicting [[Bible stories]] and [[parable]]s, more modern scenes of religious life or prayer, or sometimes just a Biblical text illuminated by [[calligraphy]]; these were linked to Biblical passages that related to the image.  The reverse typically held a [[sermonette]] instead of a prayer. Imagery here was always the servant of text, and as such these Protestant cards tended to be replaced by [[Tract (literature)|tract]]s that emphasized message instead of imagery, and were illustrated with [[cartoon]]-like images if they were illustrated at all.

==Irish law of 2009==
In [[Ireland]] cards are sold certifying that a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] has been said for the benefit of sick or dead people, and are typically given to the family of the sick or dead person. Disputes arose over the validity of cards issued by priests living outside Ireland. Section 99 of the 2009 Charities Act regulates sales of Mass Cards, which can only be sold &quot;pursuant to an arrangement&quot; with a &quot;recognised person&quot;, such as a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]], without stipulating whether that person had to be resident in Ireland or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2009/a0609.pdf Charities Act 2009 text]&lt;/ref&gt; A court challenge to the new law by a business that sold 120,000 cards a year failed in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1217/church.html McNally case; accessed from RTE website August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A breach of the law can result in a 10-year prison sentence or a €300,000 fine.
