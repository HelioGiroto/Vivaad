== Reorganization ==
I have reorganized the list as to who's list is older. That is: Tanakh, a table listing a difference between the Prod/Cath OTs, the apocrypha, and the NT. -- [[User:Hoshie|iHoshie]] 08:35, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)

: The current list appears to have dropped the deuterocanonical books of the Septuagint not kept by the Roman Catholics but retained by the Orthodox that were listed as groups B., C., and D. above. I noticed when I tried to find 3rd and 4th Maccabees. Did they just get missed in the reorganization? [[User:Wesley|Wesley]] 05:07, 30 May 2004 (UTC)

: I just added an Orthodox column to the end, because that was easiest. It still has a couple of omissions, and one or two more footnotes wouldn't hurt. The Orthodox Bible has a Psalm 151, and a few more verses at the end of Job telling who he is and how he's related to Abraham, for instance. [[User:Wesley|Wesley]] \

: To keep the columns ordered by age, I believe the Protestant column would come last; not sure how the Catholic and Orthodox columns would be sequenced, probably matters far less in that case. [[User:Wesley|Wesley]] 16:55, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== WikiProject ==
Based on a suggestion in [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention]], I have started the skeleton of a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bible|WikiProject]] to try to cut down on the overlap between the various presentations of the canon. I think that a lot of people working here will want input on this. Feel free! [[User:Mpolo|Mpolo]] 13:24, Sep 14, 2004 (UTC)

== Location Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekhiel ==
Why aren't the three books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekhiel in the Tanakh at the same level with the corresponding three books in the Christian Bibles in the table? Thanks. (Bronto)

Same question. Also, if the intention is to list the books in the order used in the holy book in question, shouldn't that be mentioned in the description? [[User:Aliter|Aliter]] 16:03, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Ditto re: alignment. [[User:Portress|Portress]] 01:52, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

==Title==
Should [[Revelation]] be labeled as ''The Prophecy'' or just ''Prophecy'', or some other name such as ''Apocalyptic Literature'' or ''Prophetic Literature''...surely some terms similar to the latter ones have wide currency in academic Biblical scholarship. --[[User:Dpr|Dpr]] 03:45, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

*I've heard it most commonaly called &quot;apocalyptic literature&quot; (like the book of Daniel).
It is called &quot;Revelation&quot; or &quot;The Apocalypse of John&quot; (aka &quot;The Apocalypse of St. John&quot;). People commonly (but incorrectly) refer to it as &quot;RevelationS&quot; (plural). &quot;Apocalypse&quot; means Revelation (translated from the Greek) so this is the most often used named in scholarly circles. I've never heard it referred to as &quot;The Prophecy&quot; by anyone in academia, or anywhere outside this discussion page, actually... [Paraforce]

== Revelation ==

I think it would be wise to change “The Prophecy” for “Apocalypse”. Where it says “Revelation11 or Apocalypse” we should change it for “Revelation11 of John”, since we have many people with their “own” version of the book of “revelations”. Also “Apocalypse” is not the name of the book but it is a stile of writing just as an epistle or biography.
[[User:Licio|Licio]] 15:36, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

== Proposed changes to table ==

I'm proposing the following changes to the table:

# Mark with an asterisk those books which are present, but in a different order (e.g. Ruth in the Tanakh column), and adding the name if it is different (e.g. Chronicles).
# Move the &quot;''Nevi'im or Prophets''&quot; and &quot;''Ketuvim or Writings''&quot; headings under the Tanakh column.
# Add column and row boundaries for &quot;asterisked&quot; cells (e.g. Isaiah)
# Make column boundaries continuous, (e.g. add boundaries between the Protestant and Catholic columns at 3 and 4 Maccabees), except at subsection headings (e.g. &quot;Historical books'')
# Eliminate row boundaries between missing books (e.g. eliminate boundaries between 2 and 3 Maccabees, in the Protestant column)

These changes would produce the following table. Comments? If no one objects, I will make these changes.

[[User:Paul August|Paul August]] [[User_talk:Paul August|&amp;#9742;]] 05:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

Ok, apparently someone has gone ahead and made this changes already. [[User:Paul August|Paul August]] [[User_talk:Paul August|&amp;#9742;]] 22:03, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

==Odes or Odes of Solomon==
I think we have some confusion here. A recent edit insinuates that the [[Odes of Solomon]] were in the Orthodox canon of Scripture. However, older edits mention a [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]] which includes the Prayer of Manasseh and others. I reverted to the previous version in the hopes someone will be able to bring some clear info to light. [[User:Yahnatan|Yahnatan]] 21:53, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:Using just &quot;Odes&quot; doesn't even lead to you a bible book at all.  Either Odes of Solomon or Book of Odes is what is needed. [[User:Harvestdancer|Harvestdancer]] 20:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

== Esther and Song of Songs not in the Bible? ==
I found a seemingly odd, unsourced claim in the [[Deuterocanonical books]] article.  Who considers Esther and Song of Songs to be Deuterocanonical? [[User:RK|RK]] 02:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

==Contradiction between [[Deuterocanonical books]] and [[Books of the Bible]] articles==
In the [[Deuterocanonical books]] article, it is implied that Protestants do not have ''any'' of the deuterocanonical books in their canon at all, except for these three:
* [[1 Esdras]]
* [[2 Esdras]]
* [[Prayer of Manasseh]]

Yet the [[Books of the Bible]] article does not list these three books.  (Nor does it list any of the other deuterocanonical books.  Which article is correct?  And is it really true that ''all'' Protestant groups reject all of the other Deuterocanonical books?  And do any Catholic Bibles include these three texts as valid deuterocanonicals? [[User:RK|RK]] 02:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

:my family is lutheran (i'm an atheist though) and indeed protestant bibles exclude the deuterocanonical books (judith, tobias, wisdom, baruch, ben sira, maccabees 1 and 2 and . most protestants anyway - I know mormons have additional books of their own. Catholics regard [[1 Esdras]], [[2 Esdras]] and [[Prayer of Manasseh]] as apocryphal though. --[[User:Philip Laurence|Philo]] 11:53, 6 July 2006 (UTC);


==Major and Minor. How about Former and Latter==

Though there is no distinction between Major nad Minor prophets in the Tanakh, the &quot;N&quot; (i.e. Neviim) are divided into two categories. Rishonim and Acharonim (Priori and Posteriori). Joshua, Judges, Samuel 1-2, Kings 1-2 are considered Neviim Rishonim, whereas the rest are considered Latter Prophets. Perhaps that ought to be included. I understand that would be hard to fit into the graph, but at least in text...

==Table explanation==
I propose removing reference what missing books are called.  The sentence is not NPOV.  In fact, it is dual-POV.  There is not set list for what is apocrypha, so using a potentianally prejoritive term like that out of context takes away from the article's neutrality on the topic.  (Proper context for apocrypha being an article about [[Apocrypha]]).  Since the topic is covered elsewhere in the article, and in its own article, it's a bit overstated when included in the table's description. [[User:Fcsuper|Fcsuper]] 01:03, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

== Minor Alterations ==

The new format makes sense, but I don't think that we should refer to the Old Testament in the Christian canons as [[Tanakh]] because it's strictly Jewish term, and should only be used for the Hebrew canon. And also, earlier, I've altered the names to most books in the Catholic canon to correspond to the [[Douay-Rheims]] and other Catholic Bibles (eg. Knox), which include Latinised names (particularly in the prophets), and other variants. --[[User:KaRoLuS|Revolution 9]] 16:47, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

Some Bibles order the OT according to the Tanakh.  I have a modern Hebrew Bible (OT + NT) and an Albanian Catholic Bible done that way, so it is valid to include.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/172.206.229.202|172.206.229.202]] ([[User talk:172.206.229.202|talk]]) 23:53, 6 December 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Why did you alter it to match the Douay-Rheims-Challoner names? Nearly no English-speaking Catholic knows them by those names - that's not how they're found in the Lectionary, for example. [[User:Cheyinka|Cheyinka]] 02:10, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

== Other Bibles ==

The OT list could also include lists for the Armenian Apostolic, Ethiopian and Syriac Bibles.
Likewise the NT list could add the Syriac NT.
There are 2 Catholic orders: Vulgate (Maccabees after Malachi) &amp; Septuagint (Maccabees after Malachi).

== Two suggestions ==

#Merging the table cells for identically called books would make it easier to verify this fact in the blink of an eye.
#The column for the Slavonic New Testament is out of sync with the other columns thereby obscuring the fact that it largely corresponds the the other columns. Please fix this like in the table for the Old Testament.

== what books are about... ==

Instead of concerning wholly on which denominations &amp; sects accept which books in which order, could we possibly have a section what each book concerns. If someone wants to make a table (which I can't do) including the name of the book, author, subject of the book, possible year, and language written in and/or addressed to who it may concern - except better worded...

== Books in Catholic Bible ==

Hello, I just discovered this page and noted with some amusement how Catholic Bibles are described (or not described) in the table. The [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] is shown in the table, but more recent translations use spellings that are similar to Protestant Bibles (1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Isaiah, etc.). It might take a new table to explain it all, but I don't know how to do that and I don't know if it would be appropriate. &lt;font color=&quot;#FF1493&quot; face=&quot;sylfaen&quot;&gt;[[User:LovesMacs|Loves]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#1E90FF&quot; face=&quot;sylfaen&quot;&gt;[[User:LovesMacs|Macs]]&lt;/font&gt;[[User talk:LovesMacs| (talk)]] 14:10, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

I am unclear why the opening section includes Eastern Catholic churches as having a separate canon from the Catholic Church.''' &quot;The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and ''Eastern Catholic'' churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books.&quot; ''' Eastern Catholic churchs are in union with the Holy See at the Vatican, hence they are unified with the Catholic Church on matters of faith (the Bible) and morals.

==I have taken the time to divide==
I have taken the time to divide the Apocryphal/Deutrocanonial into four categories that was devised by the NRSV translatiors. They are:

A. Books in the RC, Gk and Slavic Bibles:

*Tob
*Jdt
*AddEsth
*Wis
*Sir
*Bar
*LetJer
*Azar
*Sus
*Bel
*1Ma
*2Ma

B. Books in the Gk and Slavic Bibles, but NOT in the RC Bible:

*1Es
*3Ma
*PraMan
*Psa151

C. Books in the Slavic Bible and the Latin Vulgate Appendix:

*2Es

D. Books in the Gk Bible Appendix:

*4Ma

This list of catagories makes crystal clear which books are in which churches bibles. The previous list was a bit too ambigious to me.

The problem with the above list is that it only deals with the Protestant, Catholic, Greek and Russian Orthodox traditions.

== 39 articles and the Canon ==

As some articles on Wikipedia say, the 39 articles of the Church of England do admit the apocryphal books for &quot;example of life and instruction of manners&quot;, but not for doctrine. Which books do they so admit? Not just all the deuterocanonical books recognized by the Roman Catholics, but also: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses. 

I point this out because discussion of the Protestant Bible ignores the fact that these books are part of the Anglican tradition - they were included in the Lectionary of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. There have been new lectionaries since, in 1871, 1922 and others since then - but these books were read in church in the Anglican tradition - and they included the 3 books from the Vulgate that were dropped by the RCs at Trent.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.143.14.249|86.143.14.249]] ([[User talk:86.143.14.249|talk]]) 18:57, 22 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Only the Deuterocanon/Pseudepigrapha section doesn't have an ordered cell-table now. [[User:JohnChrysostom|JohnChrysostom]] ([[User talk:JohnChrysostom|talk]]) 05:51, 19 January 2012 (UTC)
:Well, the Protestant Bible doesn't include the Apocrypha at all, so there is no order to be given in that situation.  However, I could set up something like you describe as long as I had an ordered list to work from. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 02:01, 20 January 2012 (UTC)

:I'm trying to work it out on my own (how to write tables), but I believe there is an essential order for Protestant Apocrypha even if they're not canonical: they appear in this order in every Protestant Bible w/ Apocrypha; that is, starting with 3 Esdras and ending with 4 Maccabees.

::In which Protestant Bibles did you find the Apocrypha? I usually have to hunt for a version that includes them.  Wouldn't that make ''omission'' the &quot;standard order&quot;?  --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 17:17, 29 January 2012 (UTC)

::Many more liberal Protestant Bibles, all ecumenical Bibles, and all scholarly Bibles tend to include them, such as the RSV, the NRSV, the NEB, the REB, the New Interpreter's Study, the Harper-Collins, the New Oxford Annotated, etc. (as well as older Bibles, such as the KJV, New Cambridge Paragraph, etc.); more conservative Bibles such as the NKJV and NASB, heavily used by Fundamentalists and/or Evangelicals, tend not to. The ESV is a rare exception, in that Oxford has released an addition with the deuterocanonicals/apocrypha, while it is becoming the &quot;Evangelical Standard Version&quot; (I used the ESV heavily myself, as a Catholic). I recommend, if you wish to study the Apocrypha, for scholarly study, the New Oxford Annotated Bible, 3rd Expanded Edition (1977). It comes with all of the normal drawbacks of the RSV translation. One can also buy the NRSV NOAB Apocrypha (annotated) and KJV apocrypha separately, if you don't want them between the covers of your Bible. Of course, all Catholic and Orthodox Bibles (NAB, DRC, OSB, NABRE, CCD, JB, NJB) and Septuagint translations (Brenton, NETS) include them.

== Collated Jewish books in the chart ==

I collated Jewish books in the chart.  Previously the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' books were separated out from the rest of the chart and added to the bottom of the chart as a separate list.  This made it appear (without close inspection and mental collation) that there was a massive difference between the Jewish ''[[Tanakh]]'' and the Christian ''[[Old Testament]]'', which, of course, there is not.  The Hebrew Bible and the Protestant Old Testament are even identical in content.  This is made much more plain by the collation job done.  I marked the ''Ketuvim'' books in bold, and I footnoted each one so that there would be no confusion with the ''[[Nevi'im]]'' books.  I think this brings much more clarity to the chart, which before seemed rather confusing. -- [[User:Guðsþegn|Guðsþegn]] ([[User talk:Guðsþegn|talk]]) 23:36, 13 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
