==Questions (should relate to article improvement)==
I'm surprised to see an edit summary that says &quot;Popes can't resign!!&quot;.  [[Canon law]] says quite explicitly that they can, and it's happened twice. [[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] 20:34, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)

The time of the beginning of the sede vacante for 2005 should be expressed in Central European Summer Time (CEST) in my opinion. Thus, I have chnaged the time to 22:30 pm CEST.--[[User:207.65.109.90|207.65.109.90]] 20:45, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I have to disagree on what time it should be on.  I commend whoever put it up that sede vacante is currently active - it shows an extremely quick reaction to current events.  However I think that UTC is a better time for a few reasons - 
1.  UTC is the time used throughout the world for communication purposes between zones of different time, and is used on wikipedia by default.
2.  Not everyone will know what CEST is. When I saw it I thought that it was Central time US, but a confusing way to shorten it.
I do understand that yes the vatican is currently in CEST but I think that UTC time is better in this global age.  I'm going to revert it back but i'm not going to start a revert war over it.--[[User:Theloniouszen|Theloniouszen]] 23:17, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)

::That is fine. I just changed it to CEST after Eastern Time US was posted.--[[User:207.65.109.90|207.65.109.90]] 23:46, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Is ''Sede Vacante'' a latin expression? I think is in italian... [[User:Urby2004|'''&lt;font color=orange&gt;S&lt;font color=blue&gt;γ&lt;font color=brown&gt;ω&lt;font color=red&gt;Ω&lt;font color=green&gt;η&lt;font color=black&gt;Σ''']] &lt;font color=black&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Urby2004|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;tαlk&lt;font color:black&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:09, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:It happens to be identical both in Italian and in the ablative case in Latin.


'In 1878 there was no sede vacante period at all, with Pope Leo XIII being elected on the very day that his predecessor Pope Pius IX died.' - I'll revert this here, as well as in the article on Pope Leo XIII. Pius IX died on 7 February, and Leo XIII was elected on 20 February. This error may have been caused by the interesting fact that Gioacchino Cardinal Pecci, future Leo XIII, was the Camerlengo and the top official of the Catholic Church during the interregnum of 1878. [[User:Mapple|Mapple]] 19:59, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Even if he ''had'' been elected on the same day, wouldn't there still have been a sede vacante, even if it only lasted a few hours? [[User:Nik42|Nik42]] 01:15, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

== Deletion ==

I don't know whether the following sentence is accurate or not, but if it is it belongs in the [[Pope]] article, not here:
:&quot;Since the Pope is infallible after the declaration of 1870 in the Vatican Council, the Pope cannot be a heretic, and according to the likes of Alphonsus and [[St Thomas Aquinas]], a heretic cannot be Pope.&quot;
So I've deleted it. Someone who knows more can decide whether to place it somewhere else. [[User:RussBlau|RussBlau]] 15:29, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)
:It is correct, this is why the [[Old Catholic]]s broke away. It was decided at this meeting that the pope was infallible. Logically, if the pope is infallible according to Catholics, he cannot be heretic. --[[User:OldakQuill|Oldak]] [[User_talk:OldakQuill|Quill]] 22:59, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:That doesn't sound quite right. The doctrine of infallibility doesn't say that the Pope is ''always'' infallible. Only on matters of faith and morals and only when he says that he's being infallible. ;) At least, so I've been taught. --[[User:Jenmoa]] 23:34, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

It's actually pretty complex.  Explained [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07790a.htm here] (newadvent.org). --[[User:Tony Sidaway|Tony Sidaway]]|[[User talk:Tony Sidaway|Talk]] 23:41, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

== Sedevacantism ==

Sedevacantism deserves at least a section in this article. [[User:Savidan|savidan]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Savidan|(talk)]] [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000;&quot;&gt;(e@)&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</text>
