== Prayer Book ==

&quot;...are based on older Catholic tradition but have been ''moderately'' influenced by Reformation liturgical and doctrinal principles.&quot; I think this sentence in the intro paragraph misleadingly minimizes the influence of the Reformation on the Book of Common prayer, or at least gives the impression of only marginal impact. Perhaps something along the lines of &quot;are both rooted in pre-Reformation liturgical tradition and incorporates protestant liturgical and doctrinal principles&quot; is more accurate. ([[User:Mwd321|Mwd321]] ([[User talk:Mwd321|talk]]) 23:55, 9 January 2009 (UTC))

&quot;Worship and liturgy&quot;: perhaps this is unclear &quot;The BCP remains the touchstone of all Anglican liturgy.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}&quot;: as later service books can include forms that would not have been in use in earlier times this is doubtful and the positon must vary within the Communion as a whole.----[[User:Felix Folio Secundus|Felix Folio Secundus]] ([[User talk:Felix Folio Secundus|talk]]) 05:02, 23 March 2009 (UTC)
:&quot;''Entering the latter 20th century worship has evolved into modern songs as well as hymn singing. Notably Tim Hughes of Holy Trinity Brompton and Graham Kendrick.''&quot;  Can this statement be sustained?

== Areas and Archdeaconries ==

I am somewhat obsessive on the subject of verifying what seems obvious.  If a diocese is divided into areas, are the areas then subdivided into archdeaconries, and those into deaneries? [[User:J S Ayer|J S Ayer]] ([[User talk:J S Ayer|talk]]) 22:55, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

: I believe so, yes.  Most dioceses are simply divided into archdeaconries, which are further divided into deaneries.  In some dioceses the diocese is divided into Episcopal Areas which are then subdivided into archdeaconries, which are in turn subdivided into deaneries.  (To complicate things further, rural deans in some dioceses are known as area deans, so 'area' could also refer to a deanery rather than an Episcopal Area.)  There's probably no technical reason why an archdeaconry shouldn't span multiple Episcopal Areas, but I would think that this would normally be avoided.
: There's no reason that each of these subdivisions has to necessarily be multiple - the Diocese of Sodor and Man, for example, is so small that it only consists of one archdeaconry.  [[User:TSP|TSP]] ([[User talk:TSP|talk]]) 23:09, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

== Biased article? ==
Perhaps not. Why no discussion of how biased the media coverage of the Succession Rites was? It had nought to do with Roman Catholicism. One might be reminded of the similar oath to St. George in the Rites in the House of Commons which resulted in Benjamin Disraeli becoming Prime Minister. Perhaps the discussion of Jewish or dear goodness, Islamic individuals was deflected toward the good old Catholics?
Did someone mention a divorce? Perhaps the Gilman lad or suchilke?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/219.122.39.254|219.122.39.254]] ([[User talk:219.122.39.254|talk]]) 00:37, 29 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:I don't think King Henry's divorce is part of the doctrine of the C of E, but I agree that a mention could be made in the historical origins section.  Of course, that C of E was just a branch of the Roman Catholic Church that had split with Rome.  It became a Protestant church later, didn't it?

Might I suggest, with some timidity, that after the word &quot;Lollardy&quot; in Paragraph 5 a phrase regarding the continuing tensions between church and state regarding the wealth of the church should be included. Even Shakespeare couldn't avoid a mention of the issue in &quot;Henry V&quot;, although I do not offer his works as a source. Something like &quot;and long running tensions resulting from the considerable comparative wealth of the Church in England enabling the Church in some circumstances to dictate secular policy.&quot;

== pre-597? ==

Quoting the current version of the history section, I learn that:
::''The earliest unquestioned historical evidence of an organized Christian church in England is found in the writings of such early Christian fathers as Tertullian and Origen in the first years of the 3rd century, although the first Christian communities probably were established some decades earlier. Three English bishops, including Restitutus, are known to have been present at the Council of Arles in 314. The Church of England traces its formal corporate history from the 597 Augustinian mission, stresses its continuity and identity with the primitive universal Western church, and notes the consolidation of its particular independent and national character in the post-Reformation events of Tudor England.''

There is no source for the statement that the formal corporate history is traced from the 597 mission.  Were the English bishops at the Council of Arles not part of the formal corporate history?  If the historical evidence from the third century is unquestioned and shows an organized Christian church in England, then either this is a contradiction, or that organized Christian church was a different one from the one that converted to Catholicism (recently changed to that term from &quot;Western Christianity&quot;, which in turn was a substitute for &quot;Roman Catholicism&quot;).--[[User:Bhuck|Bhuck]] ([[User talk:Bhuck|talk]]) 16:20, 21 January 2009 (UTC)

:I've always understood that there was no way to trace formal continuity between the late Roman Chrisitan community in Britannia in 312, and the new mission by Augustine in 597.  The incoming Angls, Saxons etc put paid to that.  From Augustine we can trace with some certainty through to the present day a line of Archbishops of Canterbury (which are numbered from Augustine, and indeed enthroned on the chair named for hinm).

== Use of Infoboxes ==
I have added &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Infobox Christian denomination}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; back in. Aside from the fact that the Church of England is a recognised Christian denomination, this infobox allows extra detail to be shown over and above &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Infobox Anglican Church‎}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. [[User:GrahamSmith|GrahamSmith]] ([[User talk:GrahamSmith|talk]]) 17:08, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
:I'm not sure it really makes sense to use it on the CofE article, which is only one part of the Anglican Communion.  As has been discussed before, some of the sectoins in that infobox are rather simplistic anyway.  Certainly the idea of &quot;Mainline&quot; Protestantism isn't one taht's commonly used in England (and would be disputed by Anglo-Catholic members of the church anyway).  [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 17:14, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
::&quot;Church of England&quot; is not a denomination, &quot;Anglicanism&quot; is a denomination.

== &quot;Church&quot; or &quot;church&quot; ==

When - and why and by whom - was it apparently decided that this article should use &quot;Church&quot; instead of &quot;church&quot; when referring to the Church of England as a whole?  It is not Wikipedia style to do this and most articles on other churches follow the Wikipedia style - the notable exception being some Roman Catholic articles which are edited by those who want to fanatically insist that &quot;Church&quot; specifically means Roman Catholicism.  Please provide some explanation and rationale for this style in this article. [[User:Afterwriting|Afterwriting]] ([[User talk:Afterwriting|talk]]) 15:13, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
:It's a useful compromise when the word church can be used in some many different senses in one article, rather than write out Church of England in full everytime, Church is used as shorthand for the specific subject of the article.  We do the same with Communion in the Anglican Communion article.  [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 15:27, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

You haven't answered about who decided this style policy - who is the &quot;we&quot; you refer to?  I assume you are not using it as a &quot;royal we&quot;.  Why should this particular article have its own style policy?  As many words &quot;can be used in some many different senses in one article&quot; this argument seems rather weak.

:It was argued over long and hard for the same reasons at Roman Catholic Church, and so far as I remember became consensus there for braodly the reasons I've outlined here.  At different times we can be talking about church buildings, other Anglican churches etc etc. Using the capital is just the most straight forward way of disambiguating.  The usage on Anglican Communion was ceratinly discussed, maybe it hasn't been specifically here, but it seems a useful convention when church is effectively being used as a [[term of art]].  [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] ([[User talk:David Underdown|talk]]) 16:37, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

It is fairly normal practice that Church with a big C refers to a denomination e.g. United Reformed Church, Church of England, Roman Catholic Church etc.  But it is fairly normal practice that church with a small c refers to a congregation e.g. a church meeting, a church youth group etc.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.12.187.79|92.12.187.79]] ([[User talk:92.12.187.79|talk]]) 02:18, 22 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Denomination Info Box II==

==Not only in England==
Unless I've missed it, the article doesn't make any reference to the fact that the Church of England has not been ( and still isn't ) confined to England itself.  Here in Australia, for instance, the Anglican Church was for a long time an actual extension of the Church of England itself.  There is also still today the C. of E. Diocese in Europe.  Therefore the opening comments are not entirely correct.  [[User:Afterwriting|Afterwriting]] ([[User talk:Afterwriting|talk]]) 17:00, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
:It's true so far as it goes, it is the established church in England, the Dicoese of Gibraltar in Europe forms a part of the Church of England, but not the established church (its Diocesan is not entitled to a seat in the Lords for example).  Similarly Sodor and Man is not entitled to a seat in the Lrods, but does sit in some capacity in the [[House of Keys]], the [[Channel Islands]] are also interesting, not part of the UK, in church terms they are an integral par of the [[Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth]], and I'm really not sure of the consitutional position of the church there.  There's the added complication that the boundary between the Church of England and Church in Wales doesn't follow the civil boundaries, so some Welsh parishes are still in the Church of England, and some English in CinW.  Try and sumamrise that succinctly enough for the lead!

==Moved section here==
Somehow I don't think a prayer for the current economic crisis is such a major part of the CofE that it derserves an entire section dedicated to it. That said, I've moved the complete section here:

&quot;The Prayer for the Current Financial Situation was launched in September 2008 to offer the opportunity for prayer and reflection during the credit crisis. The prayer notes that 'we live in disturbing days', with rising prices, increasing debts, job losses and collapsing banks, and calls God to be a 'a tower of strength amidst the shifting sands' of the economic turmoil. When the prayer was published by the Church of England on its official website, traffic to that section of the website increased by more than 25 percent.[23]&quot; [[User:Ltwin|Ltwin]] ([[User talk:Ltwin|talk]]) 01:01, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

==Scottish Epicopal Church==

I have removed the comments about the Scottish Episcopal Church in the introduction for the reason that the original and essentially correct information is that the Church of England is the &quot;Mother Church&quot; of the Anglican Communion.  This does not therefore mean that that the Church of England is directly the Mother Church of every church or province which is now part of the communion.  Various parts of the Anglican Communion ( such as the Scottish church ) were more directly founded by the American church ( or some other member church ) - but that does not negate the fact the origins of these churches are still historically traced back to the Church of England even if less directly.  It should also so mentioned that not all parts of the current Anglican Communion are historically &quot;Anglican&quot; churches as such and therefore their historical connection to the Church of England is even more indirect.  [[User:Afterwriting|Afterwriting]] ([[User talk:Afterwriting|talk]]) 06:07, 27 October 2009 (UTC)
::No, the American Church was founded by the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], not the other way around (see [[Samuel Seabury (bishop)]]). The Scottish Episcopal Church actually has a quite different and distinct history from the CofE, and while there were many historical influences on it from England, to say it can be &quot;traced back to the Church of England&quot; is simply not correct. I think the term &quot;[[mother church]]&quot; is a pretty vague term. However, it is worth clarifying the relationship of the CofE to other parts of the UK and Ireland, as a reader may be confused by this complex history. A short explanation now puts the CofE in context without going into too much detail.[[User:Wikidwitch|Wikidwitch]] ([[User talk:Wikidwitch|talk]]) 16:37, 10 October 2012 (UTC)

:::Heh. [[Canterbury Cathedral]] is a &quot;Metropolitical Church&quot; :D  I guess it is only a minor issue, however very strictly apeaking a province is not an area &quot;under the jurisdiction of an archbishop&quot; (that would be an archdiocese).

== Disestablishment dates? ==
Any list somewhere?

According to the &quot;A~Z of Barbadian Heritage&quot; it says that [[Barbados]] was the last place in the British West Indies to &quot;disestablish&quot; the Church of England as the official state religion (in 1969)?  Is there a list anywhere that actually lists those dates of disestablishment?

*Source: The A~Z of Barbados Heritage by (Sean) Carrington, (Henry) Fraser, (John) Gilmore, and (Addington) Forde on Pg. 8 &quot;Anglicanism&quot;: (quote) Anglicanism was the state religion in England at the time of settlement of Barbados, and it was brought to the new colony as a matter of course.  A Rev. Mr. Kentlane, who was in the island in 1628, is the first Anglican clergyman known to have been in Barbados. The island was divided into six parishes by 1630, and by 1637 there were six parish churches; by 1653 (if not a year or two earlier) all eleven parishes were in existence.

[ . . . ]

The church remained strongly identified with the oligarchy, when the church was disestablished and dis-endowed elsewhere in the British West Indies at the end of the 1860s, there was much debate as to whether Barbados should take the same course, but the (Barbados) House of Assembly refused to do so.  Disestablishment did not finally take place until 1969, so that for about a century Barbados was the only place outside of Britain where Anglicanism enjoyed the privileges of a state church! in some ways it was even more of a state church than in England, for the bishop and clergy were paid directly out of general taxation, and the provision of much smaller government grants to some other denominations ('concurrent endowment') did not disguise the special position given to Anglicanism.

== Anglican Creeds ==
The external link to the C of E church law site doesn't mention which creeds are used for doctrine. My understanding was that the C of E regards the Nicene Creed (with Filioque?) as useful/binding and the Apostolic Creed as a useful summary at baptism [[Special:Contributions/194.176.105.41|194.176.105.41]] ([[User talk:194.176.105.41|talk]]) 12:02, 18 June 2010 (UTC)

==&quot;officially established&quot;==
The article begins by saying that the church is the &quot;officially established&quot; Christian church in England. Is the word &quot;officially&quot; actually necessary and isn't it somewhat redundant? One would assume that any established church would have to be &quot;officially&quot; given that status.

== Mind the Gap ==

Interesting history section, but did nothing happen between 664 and 1534? A quiet 700 years by the look of it. If anyone can contribute material about the Norman church it would be interesting.[[User:Wikidwitch|Wikidwitch]] ([[User talk:Wikidwitch|talk]]) 12:01, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

== Spelling of &quot;south-west&quot; and &quot;well-being&quot; ==

I changed the spelling of &quot;southwest&quot; and &quot;wellbeing&quot; to &quot;south-west&quot; and &quot;well-being&quot; and was very surprised to discover that the change was reverted - twice.

The first time I was told that &quot;southwest&quot; and &quot;wellbeing&quot; are both acceptable and common; however, I don't agree that either is acceptable.  To support this view, I note that both the [[SOED]] and the [[Concise Oxford Dictionary|COD]] contain entries for &quot;south-west&quot; and &quot;well-being&quot;, but don't record &quot;southwest&quot; and &quot;wellbeing&quot; even as alternative spellings.  As the &quot;Church of England&quot; article is written in British English, surely these dictionaries are appropriate authorities.

The second time I was asked who says they are not acceptable and whether I own this article.  As I mentioned earlier, the SOED and the COD say so.  Furthermore, while I don't own this article, I do have the same editing rights as everyone else - including those who reverted my changes.

I know that this is a trifling matter, but I don't see why we shouldn't get it right, so I will make the changes again.  If you decide to revert them please explain your reasoning here.

:You are, of course, entitled to your opinions and preferences on these matters - but the fact remains that both &quot;wellbeing&quot; and &quot;southwest&quot; are in common use in British English - including British academic publications.  In my experience &quot;wellbeing&quot; appears to actually now be the much more preferred British spelling style - especially since the trend in British English is to omit hyphens in most cases. Regardless of your personal preferences - and what the OED might say - both spellings are acceptable alternative spellings so I don't understand why you think that only one spelling is somehow more &quot;correct&quot; or more &quot;British&quot;. I am pleased that you realise that other editors have rights to make changes as your edit comments came across as very arrogant and highminded (or should that be &quot;high-minded&quot;?).

:When it comes to matters relating to the English language I'd rather accept the authority of the OED than your experience.  I don't think that makes me high-minded.  Were you being high-minded when you removed the hyphen from the article about Ruth Gledhill?

::I haven't been able as yet to check the latest editions of the OED.  However, it is the principal role of dictionaries to reflect the meanings of words and their spelling - not to dictate them. 

::The following recent articles are all published in ''The Independent'', an established and quality British newspaper.  They should know a few things about what is currently acceptable British English spellings with regards to your insistence of what is considered &quot;incorrect&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; spelling.

== Early History and References ==

Hi there. Reading the article I see little reference to reliable sources. 
From the current text it looks like the Church of England was an established institution with it's cannons and dogmas, head(s) and history.
Looking at the history section this does not show anything about it and has 0 references. Could you please help develop the article so we see if there was any such institution &quot;Church of England&quot; at the early period. The history of Christianity in Britain is 1 thing but putting it as history of the Church of England is totally another. [[User:Comentatorr|Comentatorr]] ([[User talk:Comentatorr|talk]]) 11:23, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

:How can you distinguish the history of the Church of England from the history of the earliest Christianity in England? The earliest Christian communities in England evolve into the Catholic Church in England, then comes the English Reformation and the Catholic Church in England embraces reformed teaching and rejects papal authority, therefore we have the Church of England we know today. By all means, add sources. [[User:Ltwin|Ltwin]] ([[User talk:Ltwin|talk]]) 18:16, 16 May 2012 (UTC)
