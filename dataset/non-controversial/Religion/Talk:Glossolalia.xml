[[:Glossolalia]] → [[Speaking in tongues]] — per [[WP:NC]], article title should be the most commonly used and recognized, for which readers are most likely to look, and to which editors will most naturally link.  [[User talk:Ἀλήθεια|Ἀλήθεια]] 19:30, 10 December 2009 (UTC)
* I oppose reversing the current redirect. There doubtlessly are some populations (denominations?) where &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; is the more common usage, but it does not appear to be predominant in reliable sources overall. Of (distinct) titles in the article's current ''References'' section, 12 use &quot;glossolalia&quot;, 3 use &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;, and 4 use the word &quot;tongues&quot; alone or in other phrases. (One is counted twice because it uses both, and one is ommitted because it is just a wiki.) GoogleBooks lists [http://books.google.com/books?q=allintitle%3A+%22Glossolalia%22 248] titles using &quot;glosolalia&quot; vs. [http://books.google.com/books?num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;q=allintitle%3A%20%22Speaking%20in%20Tongues%22 200] using &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;; and GoogleScholar lists [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=allintitle%3A+%22Glossolalia%22 310] titles using &quot;glossolalia&quot; vs. [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=allintitle%3A+%22Speaking+in+Tongues%22 283] using &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;. ~ [[User:Ningauble|Ningauble]] ([[User talk:Ningauble|talk]]) 20:22, 11 December 2009 (UTC)
**Take out your &quot;allintitle&quot; qualifier, and you'll find exactly the opposite.  Note, also, that these searches don't account for variations such as &quot;speak in tongues&quot; and simply &quot;tongues&quot;.  2,046 tongues vs. 1,660 glossolalia in books and 10,700 tongues vs. 5,350 glossolalia in scholar. While the titles qualifier gives a slight edge to the more erudite and pedantic term, regular usage shows a huge margin in favor of the common and more understandable term.  Accessibility should prevail in this argument. [[User talk:Ἀλήθεια|Ἀλήθεια]] 21:58, 11 December 2009 (UTC)
**: I am sorry that, having solicited opinions with a {{tl|movereq}} tag, you consider it ''argumentative'' for someone to offer one. At the risk of seeming even more argumentative, I would like to offer a clarification of my thinking about titles, and a point of information about Google searches. This is all I have to say – opinion solicited, opinion offered. Hopefully some other editors will share their insights on the question as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(1)&lt;/small&gt; I think it appropriate in choosing a title to use what is chosen more often in titles of reliable sources. I think it not unduly pedantic for an encyclopedia addressing the topic to follow the lead of others who set out to address the topic. Note also that the ''subject index'' for GoogleBooks lists 560 titles under [http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;q=subject%3A%22glossolalia%22 &quot;glossolalia&quot;] but has no entry for [http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;q=subject%3A%22speaking+in+tongues%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;], which more or less reflects their findings on library cataloguing data. Other nomenclatures are indeed also common, so it is felicitous to provide accessibility via [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Glossolalia&amp;hidelinks=1 redirects], which is even better than library catalogue cross-references. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(2)&lt;/small&gt; Bear in mind that Google's [[Wikipedia:Search engine test#Google unique page count issues|initial estimates]] of hits are quite rough, and tend to grossly overcount. Looking at mentions, not just titles, GoogleBooks reports quite comparable ''actual'' hits, but these tend to undercount due to idiosyncrasies described in the above linked article. ~ [[User:Ningauble|Ningauble]] ([[User talk:Ningauble|talk]]) 20:10, 12 December 2009 (UTC)
**'''Counter-point''' (not to sound ''argumentative'') - on the first page of hits in the aforementioned subject search, here's the usage count: tongue/tongues = 6, glossolalia = 2.  The second page is similar 5 vs. 2, and the third is 6 vs. 3.  So even here, the predominant usage remains tongues or speaking in tongues, not glossolalia.
* '''Oppose''': Ningauble's research is persuasive; glossolalia seems to be at least as common use in reliable sources. [[User:Knepflerle|Knepflerle]] ([[User talk:Knepflerle|talk]]) 00:39, 14 December 2009 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''': Glossolalia is the standard way to refer to this, and [[Speaking in tongues]] already redirects properly. The latter is also dialectical; it's in &quot;regular&quot; usage only in some communities. Whereas &quot;glossolalia&quot; is an international scientific term.

==small edit==
I removed a portion that stated &quot;shunda&quot; and its equivalents &quot;shindar&quot;, &quot;shinda&quot;, etc. were universal in the tongue-speaking world. A closer inspection of the source says the contrary (find it by searching 'tikitiki'). Whoever originally posted it misread the second half of the sentence, I suppose. There's also no mentions of conjugations of the word, so I have no idea where they made that up =/ .

== Incorrect Definition ==
This article is rather disturbing to me, in the fact that the definition of &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; it gives, although maybe accepted by a large community, is completely different from the definition used in the bible. A tongue, in the bible, has meant &quot;language,&quot; and as it describes in 1 Cor. 14 [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_cor/14 (Annotated KJV)], as men from different countries spoke with one another and ''understood'' one another; it isn't unintelligible babble, but that the men were speaking in more language than once, so people could speak a language they did not know, while simultaneously speaking their own. This leads me to believe that much of this &quot;modern interpretation&quot; is completely wrong, except for maybe the psychoanalysis part. --[[Special:Contributions/64.136.202.74|64.136.202.74]] ([[User talk:64.136.202.74|talk]]) 02:38, 21 July 2010 (UTC) (not logged in, actual wiki id: inthend9)

:(Response to the above) Speaking in tongues also refers to prayer to God with words inspired by the Holy Spirit, not understood by the one praying, or by others, unless interpreted by the inspiration of the Spirit.  (1 Cor 12:10, 14:1-5 (&amp; the rest of the chapter))  The language may be human or angelic. (1 Cor 13:1)

:On the day of Pentecost, the disciples were Spirit-inspired to praise God in known human languages which they had not learned.  (Acts 2:4 &quot;as the Spirit enabled them.&quot; NIV)

:As for &quot;modern interpretation&quot;, the Gospel of Christ has never changed.  (I can give you a whole long list of scriptures to back that up if you want.)

:The only way you can guarantee to get a true understanding of scripture is to read it in prayer, crying out to the Lord for wisdom, knowledge and understanding (Proverbs 2:1-6), listening to the Lord and letting Him teach you (Exodus 15:26 &amp;c &amp;c).  And of course, putting the gospel into practice.  Then you will understand the Bible a million times better than any theologian ever has, or ever will.  (Matthew 11:25,26, 1 John 2:26,27, &amp;c &amp;c)

:(Note to Wikipedia moderators: Please forgive me if this is beyond what is appropriate for even a discussion page, but the person I'm responding to seemed to need reassurance, and I can't see how to send them a personal message.)

==Concerning the Requested Move: I want to vote in favour==
(I may be late, but I have only just come across this page.)

The term: &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; is the term generally used by:

(1) Those who do it, 
(2) Those who argue against it,
(3) The vast majority of the population who have any reason to want to know anything about it.

The term: &quot;Glossolalia&quot; is generally only used by theologians and (allegedly) scientific researchers.
  
Most ordinary people would have absolutely no idea what &quot;Glossolalia&quot; means.

I propose we go with the people on this one.  That's who Wikipedia is for.

(Just in case anyone wants to know: Yes, I'm a plain ordinary bog-standard Christian who does it.) [[User:Darkman101|Darkman101]] ([[User talk:Darkman101|talk]]) 21:00, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

:Glossolalia exists in non-Christian contexts too, though.  I believe &quot;glossolalia&quot; is used because it's more culturally neutral whereas the term &quot;(speaking in) tongues&quot; is mostly used by Christians.

:If you're serious, then you could do that: find reliable sources, create a new section above &quot;See Also&quot; called &quot;In the media&quot;, and describe and cite your reliable source in that section.

==Non-religious study and interpretation==
All of the information I have been able to find about this topic focuses on religion or spiritual aspects of the event. What about when it occurs in people without any religious context? 

-Is there a seperate term for that? 

-Many definitions mention a &quot;trance-like state&quot; - what about when a person doesn't &quot;trance&quot;, just suddenly shifts into an alternative verbal pattern without any accompanying physical/emotional/situational change?

-Have there been any studies done of the behavior without it being in a faith-invoked/involved setting?

- Are there currently any studies being done that do not involve a religious element?[[Special:Contributions/144.124.243.172|144.124.243.172]] ([[User talk:144.124.243.172|talk]]) 01:41, 5 May 2011 (UTC)

:I'm not aware of any. But just to clarify, within Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, speaking in tongues is not dependent on any &quot;trance-like state&quot;. It can be done at will and is understood as the person yielding his or her vocal chords to speak whatever the spirit desires to be spoken. The content of the utterance is spontaneous, one doesn't determine what one says, but the timing is not necessarily spontaneous and no ecstatic emotional state is required. [[User:Ltwin|Ltwin]] ([[User talk:Ltwin|talk]]) 22:14, 5 August 2011 (UTC)

There are indeed people who can do this voluntarily with no religious connotation to it whatsoever (I know at least one personally).  If anyone can find some studies or source material covering non-religious glossolalia, please add it; it would be much appreciated.

== Speaking '''in''' tongues or '''with''' tongues ? ==

The OED seems to show the latter preposition is the standard. Why then the most frequent preposition in the phrase in the article is &quot;in&quot; ?

''c.II.8.c The knowledge or use of a language. Esp. in phrases '''gift of tongues''', '''to speak with a tongue (tongues)''', in reference to the Pentecostal miracle and the miraculous gift in the early Church; also simply '''tongues''' (pl. in collect. sense). 

   ''1526 Tindale [see 2 a].    ― 1 Cor. xii. 30 Do all speake with tonges?    Ibid. xiii. 8 Though that prophesyinge fayle, other tonges shall cease, or knowledge vanysshe awaye.    1533 Gau Richt Vay 48 The halie spreit‥gaif to thayme ye gift to speik with al twngis.    1538 Cromwell in Merriman Life &amp; Lett.

== Introduction neutrality ==

The introduction gives one definition as the most correct, when later in the article there are many given. [[User:Plasmic Physics|Plasmic Physics]] ([[User talk:Plasmic Physics|talk]]) 21:23, 12 June 2012 (UTC)

::Can you be more specific please? [[User:Ltwin|Ltwin]] ([[User talk:Ltwin|talk]]) 01:46, 13 June 2012 (UTC)
:::In the lead, it is stated that glossolalia is incomprehensible babble (paraphrasing), while later in the article it is indicated that there are various definitions, by various religious groups. The lead is favouring one group's view over the various others. [[User:Plasmic Physics|Plasmic Physics]] ([[User talk:Plasmic Physics|talk]]) 06:57, 13 June 2012 (UTC)

::::Well, part of the problem is that the article is about Glossolalia, which is the preferred scholarly term for speaking gibberish, sometimes in ritual contexts. However, Speaking in tongues also redirects here. Depending on what kind of Christian you are, &quot;speaking in tongues&quot; can be either glossolalia or xenoglossia which is miraculously speaking foreign languages. So, the definition in the lead is correct. Glossolalia is gibberish to observers (though it holds religious importance to the speaker). However, if you talk about glossolalia in Christianity you can't avoid getting into the discussion about what exactly is the spiritual gift known as speaking in tongues. 

::::The lead should not create multiple definitions for glossolalia, there is no scientific proof that it is actual language. However, what we do need to do is expand the lead to better summarize the entire article as it exists currently, which means we would have to explain that there is disagreement among Christians whether the &quot;gift&quot; of speaking in tongues was glossolalia or xenoglossy.

== Would it be appropriate to present the tradition on the phenomena of glossolalia in the Eastern Christian perspective? ==

I was raised in Russian Orthodoxy, &amp; when I stumbled to this page, I was surprised that the term glossolalia is in the Greek, as opposed to the more frequently used form „speaking in tongues.“ The occurrence could be read in the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2. Which made me wondered, „Why is not the Greek Christian or any other Eastern Church have a section on this page?“ So I accompanied the matter with some research, &amp; I did find some interesting perspectives about the speaking in tongues from Orthodox sources.
Here are a few that I found reliable to start a section:
*http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7112/
*http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/misc/nicozisin_tongues.htm
*http://www.sfaturiortodoxe.ro/orthodox/orthodox_advices_cleopa_speaking_in_tongues.htm
*http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/on-the-gift-of-speaking-in-tongues.aspx
*http://oca.org/questions/teaching/speaking-in-tongues-miracles
*http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/11/

Here are some blogs that cover the subject:
*http://www.orthodoxchristianity.net/forum/index.php?topic=14851.0

Here is an extensive sermon [video on the website YouTube,] which I am not sure is reliable but dœs cover the perspective:
*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrFHVQTvCA

A podcast:
*http://ancientfaith.com/podcasts/hopko/the_gift_the_gifts_and_glossolalia

Thank you for your time reading my question, I hope &amp; am seeing into the construction of an Orthodox perspective section. &lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;[[User:序名三|序名三「Jyonasan」]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#2DC800&quot;&gt;[[User talk:序名三|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0AFE47&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/序名三|Stalk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 04:13, 3 August 2012 (UTC)

==Catholicism?==
It seems that on April 10, 2012, someone added the section on Catholicism. Why does Catholicism get its own section when it seems that the way the article is outlined is by time period, not by Christian denomination. Furthermore, the section asserts that &quot;Glossolalia is the miraculous ability to speak in a foreign language so that foreigners can hear the Gospel.&quot; If this is indeed the &quot;Catholic&quot; definition of speaking in tongues, then it belongs at the article [[xenoglossia]]. One more thing, it contradicts the very real and vibrant charismatic movement within the Catholic Church, which has official papal approval. These blanket statements that glossolalia is always understood as speaking a foreign language and never as speaking a heavenly or sacred language cannot be supported. The current teaching of the Catholic Church on this charism is much more nuanced than this section leads one to believe. For this reason, I am removing this section.
