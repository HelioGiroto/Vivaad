{{POV|date=September 2011}}

A '''concordat''' is an agreement between the [[Holy See]] of the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] and a [[sovereign state]] on religious matters.  Legally, it is an international treaty. Concordats often include both recognition and privileges for the Catholic Church in a particular country. Privileges might include exemptions from certain legal matters and processes, and issues such as taxation as well as the right of a state to influence the selection of [[bishop]]s within its territory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Council of Constance]] proclaimed the Concordat to be the regular form of governing relations between the Papacy and foreign kingdoms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Although for a time after the [[Second Vatican Council]], which ended in 1965, the term 'concordat' was dropped, it reappeared with the Polish [[Concordat of 1993]] and the Portuguese [[Concordat of 2004]]. A different model of relations between the Vatican and various states is still evolving (see e.g. Petkoff 2007) in the wake of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Liberty, ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Criticism==
{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}
From a Church-State perspective, the contentions regarding Concordats involves two perspectives. ''From a Catholic perspective'', the Church has the moral and theological right to enter into diplomatic relations with states in order to reach agreements regarding the care of its members residing there. This is the concept of ''libertas ecclesiastica'' (freedom of the Church). However, ''from a non-Catholic perspective'' (NOT an anti-Catholic perspective), this poses certain concerns regarding religious freedom, such as: 1) Concordats give to the Church a privileged position that other religious groups are denied (European history in numerous books reveals this fact), 2) Concordats are not &quot;the same as treaties&quot; because they are entered into by an entity that is BOTH religious and political in nature, viz., the Catholic Church, whereas any other treaty is between two sovereign entities on a horizontal level, i.e., purely political in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Graham, “Introduction: Reflections on Vatican Diplomacy,” in Kent and Pollard, eds., ''Papal Diplomacy'', 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; and 3) depending on the negotiations agreed upon in the Concordat, some religious groups face the threat of being marginalized (example: in Spain, although the Constitution guarantees religious freedom (theoretically), yet in practice, the Church is mentioned by name and holds a pre-eminent position among other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Bonime-Blanc, ''Spain’s Transition to Democracy: The Politics of Constitution-making'' (Boulder, CO: Westview  Press, Inc., 1987), 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, debate has occurred regarding whether the Spanish government should maintain a concordat with the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Elena Olmos Ortega, “Los Acuerdos con la Santa Sede: Instrumentos Garantes de la Libertad Religiosa,” in Maria del Mar Martin, Mercedes Salido, Jose Maria Vazquez Garcia-Penuela, eds., ''Iglesia Catolica y Relaciones Internacionales: Actas del III Simposio Internacional de Derecho Concordatorio'' (Granada: Editorial Comares, 2008), 489-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some concordats guarantee the Catholic Church the tax-exempt status of a charity, either stating this explicitly, as in Brazil (2008, Article 15)&lt;ref name=&quot;twelve&quot;&gt;
[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=15311&amp;kb_header_id=37261 English translation of 2008 Brazilian concordat]
&lt;/ref&gt; and Italy (1984, Article 7.3),&lt;ref name=&quot;fifty&quot;&gt;
[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=878&amp;kb_header_id=39221 English translation of 1984 Italian concordat]
&lt;/ref&gt;
or phrasing it indirectly, as in Portugal (2004, art. 12).&lt;ref name=&quot;fiftyone&quot;&gt;
[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=1361&amp;kb_header_id=4131 English translation of 2004 Portuguese concordat]
&lt;/ref&gt;

When the political will is present, such concordat privileges can be extended by domestic legislation. In 1992 the tax exemption granted the Church by the Italian concordat was interpreted by a law which permits the Catholic Church to avoid paying 90% of what it owes to the state for its commercial activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiftytwo&quot;&gt;
[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showdoc.php?org_id=843&amp;doc_id=1741 “La Ue pronta a processare gli sconti Ici alla Chiesa”]
(“Property tax relief for the Church: EU takes Italy to court”), Curzio Maltese, La Repubblica, 25 June 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, a small shrine within the walls of a cinema, holiday resort, shop, restaurant or hotel is sufficient to confer religious exemption.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiftythree&quot;&gt;
[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showdoc.php?org_id=843&amp;doc_id=1761 “Gli alberghi dei santi alla crociata dell'Ici“]
(“Tax crusade marches on the holy hotels”), Curzio Maltese, La Repubblica, 25 October 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2007 [[Neelie Kroes]], the [[European Commissioner for Competition]] announced an investigation of this. Then, in August, the deputy finance minister in [[Romano Prodi]]’s fragile center-left coalition said the issue needed to be tackled in the next year's budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiftyfour&quot;&gt;
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/aug/28/italy.johnhooper Church ready to forgo tax breaks],
John Hooper, Guardian, 28 August 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, after that nothing more about this was heard from the [[Barroso Commission]] and a few months later the Prodi government fell.

Another way to keep Church income untaxed is to keep it secret. The Slovak concordat (2000, art. 20.2) ensures that church offertories are “not subject to taxation or to the requirement of public accountability”.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortythree&quot;&gt;
[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showkb.php?org_id=849&amp;kb_header_id=755&amp;order=kb_rank ASC&amp;kb_id=1222 English translation of 2000 Slovak concordat]
&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case in Côte d'Ivoire, where far larger sums are involved. [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro|The Basilica at Yamoussoukro]], is estimated to have cost $300 million, and the additional running expenses for what is the largest church in the world are also shielded from scrutiny by the 1992 concordat concluded with the Ivorian dictator. Houphouët-Boigny claimed that these funds came from his private fortune. A Vatican official is reported to have called it the agreement over the foundation set up to administer these funds “a delicate matter”.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiftysix&quot;&gt;
[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958078-2,00.html “The Basilica in the Bush”], Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine, 3 July 1989.
&lt;/ref&gt;
This spending was heavily criticised, since in Côte d'Ivoire most people die before they reach the age of 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiftyseven&quot;&gt;
[http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbsprd US Government’s International Database]. The life expectancy for Cote d’Ivoire for 2007 is estimated at 49.18 years.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, this concordat ensures that the foundation’s income and assets remain untaxed (art. 9.1), it holds these funds beyond the reach of both criminal and civil law (art. 7.1), it permits this money to be sent out of the country (art. 13.2) and it keeps all the foundation’s documents “inviolable”, in other words, secret (art. 8).&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyseven&quot;&gt;
[http://www.concordatwatch.eu/showtopic.php?org_id=7181&amp;kb_header_id=41031 English translation of 1992 Ivorian concordat]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colombia]] there was a crisis between state and church in 1994 when Attroeny-General [[Gustavo de Greiff#Problems with the Church| Gustavo de Greiff]] accused several Bishops of having illegal contacts with the [[Farc]] guerrillas. It turned out that under Columbia's concordat with the Holy See, members of the clergy could only be investigated by ecclesiastical courts which are ruled by [[canon law]], and that the Bishops were therefore immune from investigation by the civil authorities on what many in Columbia considered to be a serious felony.
