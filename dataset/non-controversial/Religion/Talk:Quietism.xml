==Quietism (Other uses)==

First, the term &quot;quietism&quot; is probably used in passing to describe a lot of thinkers. So just because someone gets called a quietist once, that doesn't mean they should be mentioned in this entry.

Second, this article is about a specific set of views that arose in western, analytic philosophy in the last 100-years that is widely known by the name &quot;quietism&quot;. Obviously, that is not what editors mean when they add &quot;Zen&quot; or &quot;Tao&quot; or the &quot;Grand Ayatollah Sistani&quot; to this entry. If any of those really deserve an entry about their form of quietism, then we need some form of disambiguation (e.g. as we've done for [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)]]). They are not quietist in the sense this entry is about quietism.

==Grand Ayatollah Sistani of Iraq==
''Grand Ayatollah Sistani of Iraq is a follower of the quietist school of thought, despite his indirect but decisive role in most major Iraqi political decisions.'' Then it is not quietism, is it? A &quot;quietist,&quot; but with a covert, behind-the-scenes role in political decisions! A question remains: is this an honest misunderstanding of the meaning of ''Quietism,'' or is it a conscious manipulation of the meaning, in order to win a label that confers some perceived value or credibility? --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 20:16, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:A good question.  I think the distinction they are trying to make is between &quot;turbans in the parliament&quot; and clerics as leaders.  Clearly Sistani is not going to actually take a position in the government, but he will lead from behind the scenes, even on major political issues.  Whether or not he has an effective 'veto' of sorts amongst Iraqis hasn't really been tested yet. &amp;mdash;[[User:Thames|thames]] 22:24, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Doubtless. This entry concerns ''Quietism,'' however. Perhaps the concept has not fully penetrated all our contributors. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 23:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::Well, I'm not the one who labeled Sistani or the Iraqi Shia &quot;quietists.&quot;  This is, apparently, how they are regarded, and quietism's meaning in that context may differ slightly from the meaning applied to Christian/other quietists.  I'd certainly be interested in any suggestions to improve the copy. &amp;mdash;[[User:Thames|thames]] 14:38, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::::Fixed as follows: ''Sh'ia traditions of non-involvement in politics create anomalies in modern Muslim culture: Grand Ayatollah Sistani of Iraq identifies himself as a follower of the quietist school of thought, despite his indirect but decisive role in most major Iraqi political decisions.'' Authentic Sh'ia quietism deserves more thorough exploring in this entry. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 22:38, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::::Okay, that's a good compromise text.  Thanks for working with me on that. [[User:Thames|thames]] 14:25, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::::Yes, and thanks! clear and fair is good enough! But this article lacks breadth and depth, and I'm too ignorant to provide it. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]]

== Madame Guyon claimed sinless perfection? ==

I did a lot of searching, and could not find any reliable claim that she actually &quot;maintained that she could not sin, for sin was self, and she had rid herself of self&quot;. This quotation, which I found all over the Web, is a parroting of an undocumented statement from The Columbia Encyclopedia (http://www.bartleby.com/65/qu/quietism.html).

== Speedy deletion ==
Only just created this page a few hours ago - I'm amazed that people are trying to kill it off straight away.

In any case, the page is definitely not 'patent nonsense' as alleged. Anybody with an informed view of philosophy could confirm that there are a number of philosophers (active: McDowell/historical: [[Wittgenstein]]) who take the view that philosophy should offer no substantive theses (i.e. positive doctrines such as 'the world is physical'/'souls exist' etc.) but should seek instead to explain away apparent philosophical problems by showing that they are just misunderstandings. Austin's [[Sense and Sensibilia]] is a prime example of a work of philosophy that shows philosophical problems are the result of abusing ordinary language.
I accept that the page is not yet fully referenced (though note links to Wittgenstein, Austin and McDowell) but it is not nonsense. See the article on [[John McDowell]] for a reference to quietism (in the first section on Work).

:If you encounter any similar difficulties, go ahead and leave a note over at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Philosophy]].  If we're not all busy, you should be able to get some support. - [[User:KSchutte|KSchutte]] 02:18, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

::An important part of contemporary philosophy. Definitely an article wikipedia needs. - [[User:Atfyfe|Atfyfe]] ([[User talk:Atfyfe|talk]]) 03:09, 19 February 2008 (UTC)


This really needs expanding, but also some serious editing. How can the genesis of Quietism have been 100 years after Schopenhauer wrote about it?

:Because the Schopenhauer stuff was about the other sort of quietism... [[User:Banno|Banno]] ([[User talk:Banno|talk]]) 07:03, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

Schopenhauer wrote about [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|religious quietism]]. He described the practice of minimizing willing and craving in order to seek salvation and goodness. For Schopenhauer, denial of willing resulted in goodness and painlessness. This was similar to the original tenets of Buddhism. This article on philosophical quietism as a solution to language problems is totally different from the quietism that Schopenhauier described.[[User:Lestrade|Lestrade]] ([[User talk:Lestrade|talk]]) 18:16, 16 January 2011 (UTC)Lestrade</text>
