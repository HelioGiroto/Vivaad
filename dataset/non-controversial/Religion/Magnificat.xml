[[File:Folio 59v - The Visitation.jpg|thumb|250px|The Visitation in the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry|Book of Hours]] of the [[John, Duke of Berry|Duc de Berry]]; the ''Magnificat'' in Latin]]

The '''''Magnificat''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[My soul] magnifies'') — also known as the '''''Song of Mary''''' or the '''''Canticle of Mary''''' — is a [[canticle]] frequently sung (or spoken) [[liturgy|liturgically]] in [[Christian]] [[church service]]s.  It is one of the eight most ancient Christian [[hymn]]s and perhaps the earliest [[Marian hymn]].&lt;ref name=Breed &gt;''The History and Use of Hymns and Hymn-Tunes'' by David R Breed 2009 ISBN 1-110-47186-6 page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reeves &gt;''Favourite Hymns'' by Marjorie Reeves 2006 ISBN 0-8264-8097-7 page 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Its name comes from the [[incipit|first word]] of the Latin version of the canticle's text.

The text of the canticle is taken directly from the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{bibleref2|Luke|1:46-55}}) where it is spoken by the [[Virgin Mary]] upon the occasion of her [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] to her cousin [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name=Breed /&gt; In the narrative, after Mary greets Elizabeth, who is [[pregnant]] with the future [[John the Baptist]], the child moves within Elizabeth's womb. When Elizabeth praises Mary for her faith, Mary sings what is now known as the ''Magnificat'' in response.

The canticle echoes several Old Testament biblical passages, but the most pronounced allusions are to the [[Song of Hannah]], from the [[Books of Samuel]] ({{bibleref2|1Samuel|2:1-10}}). Along with the ''[[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]]'', as well as several Old Testament canticles, the ''Magnificat'' is included in the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]], an ancient liturgical collection found in some manuscripts of the [[Septuagint]].

Within [[Christianity]], the ''Magnificat'' is most frequently recited within the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]. In [[Western Christianity]], the ''Magnificat'' is most often sung or recited during the main evening prayer service: [[Vespers]] within [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]], and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (or Evensong) within [[Anglicanism]]. In [[Eastern Christianity]], the ''Magnificat'' is usually sung at Sunday [[Matins]]. Among [[Protestant]] groups, the ''Magnificat'' may also be sung during worship services.

[[File:Church of the Visitation IMG 0651.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Translations of the ''Magnificat'' into various languages at the [[Ein Karem]] [[Church of the Visitation]]]]

The original language of the ''Magnificat'' is [[Koine Greek]], the language of the [[New Testament]]. However, in the liturgical and devotional use of the [[Western Church]], it is most often found in [[Latin language|Latin]] or the vernacular.

;[[Koine|Greek]]:

: Μεγαλύνει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύριον
: καὶ ἠγαλλίασεν τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρί μου,
: ὅτι ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης αυτοῦ.
: ἰδού γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν μακαριοῦσίν με πᾶσαι αἱ γενεαί,
: ὅτι ἐποίησέν μοι μεγάλα ὁ δυνατός,
: καὶ ἅγιον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ,
: καὶ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ εἰς γενεὰς καὶ γενεὰς
: τοῖς φοβουμένοις αυτόν.
: Ἐποίησεν κράτος ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ,
: διεσκόρπισεν ὑπερηφάνους διανοίᾳ καρδίας αὐτῶν·
: καθεῖλεν δυνάστας ἀπὸ θρόνων
: καὶ ὕψωσεν ταπεινούς,
: πεινῶντας ἐνέπλησεν ἀγαθῶν
: καὶ πλουτοῦντας ἐξαπέστειλεν κενούς.
: ἀντελάβετο Ἰσραὴλ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ,
: μνησθῆναι ἐλέους,
: καθὼς ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν
: τῷ Αβραὰμ καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zhubert.com/bible?source=greek&amp;verseref=Luke+1%3A47-55 The Resurgence Greek Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin&lt;ref&gt;Since 1979 the official Latin text of the Bible for the Catholic Church is the revised [[Vulgate]], and this text is &quot;to be used especially in the sacred [[Liturgy]] but also as suitable for other things&quot;, as laid down by [[Pope John Paul II]] in his apostolic constitution ''[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JPTHESAU.HTM Scripturarum thesaurus]'' of 25 April of that year. However, the use of the text given in earlier editions of liturgical books is permitted as an extraordinary (exceptional) form. In addition to other differences in spelling and punctuation, the earlier form has, in place of &quot;et exsultavit spiritus meus in Deo salvatore meo&quot; (second line), &quot;Et exultavit spiritus meus: in Deo salutari meo&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; (present official Roman Catholic form):

: Magnificat anima mea Dominum,
: et exsultavit spiritus meus in Deo salvatore meo,
: quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae.
: Ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes,
: quia fecit mihi magna,
: qui potens est,
: et sanctum nomen eius,
: et misericordia eius in progenies et progenies
: timentibus eum.
: Fecit potentiam in brachio suo,
: dispersit superbos mente cordis sui;
: deposuit potentes de sede
: et exaltavit humiles;
: esurientes implevit bonis
: et divites dimisit inanes.
: Suscepit Israel puerum suum,
: recordatus misericordiae,
: sicut locutus est ad patres nostros,
: Abraham et semini eius in saecula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/bible/nova_vulgata/documents/nova-vulgata_nt_evang-lucam_lt.html#1 Revised Vulgate text]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin (older form):

: Magnificat: anima mea Dominum.
: Et exultavit spiritus meus: in Deo salutari meo.
: Quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae:
: ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes.
: Quia fecit mihi magna, qui potens est:
: et sanctum nomen eius.
: Et misericordia eius, a progenie et progenies:
: timentibus eum.
: Fecit potentiam in brachio suo:
: dispersit superbos mente cordis sui.
: Deposuit potentes de sede:
: et exaltavit humiles.
: Esurientes implevit bonis:
: et divites dimisit inanes.
: Suscepit Israel puerum suum:
: recordatus misericordiae suae.
: Sicut locutus est ad patres nostros:
: Abraham, et semini eius in saecula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalist.net/hourstxt/deadves.htm Officium pro defunctis], following the unrevised [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lucas+1&amp;version=VULGATE Vulgate text]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English language|English]] (''[[Douay-Rheims]]''):

: My soul doth magnify the Lord.
: And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
: Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid;
: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
: Because he that is mighty,
: hath done great things to me;
: and holy is his name.
: And his mercy is from generation unto generations,
: to them that fear him.

== Liturgical use ==
{{Mariology}}
The text forms a part of the [[Canonical hours|daily office]] in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Vespers]] service, the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]] service, and the [[Anglican]] services of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], according to both the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and ''[[Common Worship]]'' (see [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)]]). In the ''Book of Common Prayer'' Evening Prayer service, it is usually paired with the ''[[Nunc dimittis]]''. (The ''Book of Common Prayer'' allows for an alternative to the ''Magnificat'' — the [[Psalm 98|Cantate Domino, Psalm 98]] — and modern Anglican rubrics generally allow for a wider selection of canticles, but the ''Magnificat'' and ''Nunc dimittis'' remain the most popular.) In Anglican, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic services, the ''Magnificat'' is generally followed by the ''[[Glory Be to the Father|Gloria Patri]]''.  It is also commonly used (at least amongst Lutherans) at the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Feast of the Visitation]] (July 2).

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] worship, the ''Magnificat'' is usually sung during the [[Matins]] service before the ''[[Irmos]]'' of the ninth ode of the [[Canon (hymnography)|canon]]. After each verse, the [[troparion]] is sung:
: &quot;More honourable than the [[Cherub]]im, and more glorious beyond compare than the [[Seraph]]im, without corruption thou gavest birth to God the [[Logos#Use in Christianity|Word]]: true [[Theotokos]], we magnify thee.&quot;

As a canticle, the Magnificat has frequently been set to music. Most compositions were originally intended for liturgical use, especially for Vesper services and celebrations of the Visitation, but some are also performed in concert.

==Musical settings==
As the Magnificat is part of the sung Vespers, many composers, starting with the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], set the words, for example [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in his ''[[Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610 (Monteverdi)|Vespers for the Blessed Virgin, 1610]]''. [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] composed a setting of the Latin text for soloists, choir and orchestra, also [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] in his [[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]], BWV 243, for the Christmas vespers of 1723. Bach set the German words in his [[Bach cantata|cantata]] for [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] of 1724, ''[[Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10]]''. [[Anton Bruckner]] composed a [[Magnificat (Bruckner)|Magnificat]] for soloists, choir, orchestra and organ. [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], and more recently [[John Rutter]] also set extended versions of the text. [[Arvo Pärt]] composed a [[Magnificat (Pärt)|setting]] for choir [[a cappella]].

Together with the [[Nunc dimittis]], the Magnificat is a regular part of the Anglican [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]]. The &quot;Mag and Nunc&quot; was set by many composers - such as [[Thomas Tallis]], [[Herbert Sumsion]], [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] and [[John Tavener]] - of [[Anglican church music]], often for choir a cappella or choir and organ. Since the canticles are sung every day at some [[cathedrals]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] wrote a Magnificat in every major key, and [[Herbert Howells]] published twenty settings over his career.

== Society and politics ==

In Nicaragua, the ''Magnificat'' is a favourite prayer among many peasants and is often carried as an amulet. During the [[Somoza]] years, [[Peasant|campesinos]] were required to carry proof of having voted for Somoza; this document was mockingly referred to as the ''Magnificat''.&lt;ref&gt;'The Gospel in Solentiname', Ernesto Cardenal (Maryknoll: Orbis Books, 1978) p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Magnificat'' has also been covered by Richard Wu in the album &quot;Let Morning Shine&quot;. The album was aimed to ameliorate the lives of North Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalshift.org/tag/let-morning-shine/&lt;/ref&gt;
