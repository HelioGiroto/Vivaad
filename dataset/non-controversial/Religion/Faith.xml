[[File:National gallery in washington d.c., mino da fiesole, fede, 1475-1480.JPG|right|thumb|140px|[[Mino da Fiesole]], ''Faith (Armani)''.]]

Depending on the [[religion]], '''faith''' is [[belief]] in a god or gods or in the doctrines or teachings of the religion. Informal usage of faith can be quite broad, including trust or belief without proof,&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary.reference.com&quot;&gt;faith. Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith (accessed: December 01, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;faith&quot; is often used as a substitute for &quot;hope&quot;, &quot;trust&quot; or &quot;belief&quot;. Some{{who|date=July 2012}} critics of faith have argued that faith is opposed to [[Faith and rationality|reason]]. In contrast, some{{who|date=July 2012}} advocates of faith argue that the proper domain of faith concerns questions which cannot be settled by evidence. This is exemplified by [[Eschatology|attitudes about the future]], which (by definition) has not yet occurred.

==Etymology==
The English word is thought to date from 1200–50, from the Middle English ''feith'', via Anglo-French ''fed'', Old French ''feid'', ''feit'' from Latin ''fidem'', accusative of ''fidēs'' (trust), akin to ''fīdere'' (to trust).&lt;ref name=dict&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological validity of faith==
There is a wide spectrum of opinion with respect to the [[epistemological]] validity of faith. On one extreme is [[logical positivism]], which denies the validity of any beliefs held by faith; on the other extreme is [[fideism]], which holds that true belief can only arise from faith, because reason and physical evidence cannot lead to truth. Some [[foundationalist]]s, such as [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]], hold that all of our beliefs rest ultimately on beliefs accepted by faith. Others, such as [[C.S. Lewis]], hold that faith is merely the [[virtue]] by which we hold to our reasoned ideas, despite moods to the contrary.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-06-065292-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[C.S. Lewis|Lewis, C.S.]] |title=[[Mere Christianity]]: a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[[San Francisco]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-06-065292-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] believed that the varieties of religious experiences should be sought by psychologists, because they represent the closest thing to a microscope of the mind—that is, they show us in drastically enlarged form the normal processes of things{{citation required|date=July 2012}}. For a useful interpretation of human reality, to share faith experience he said that we must each make certain &quot;[[overbelief|over-beliefs]]&quot; in things which, while they cannot be proven on the basis of experience, help us to live fuller and better lives{{citation required|date=July 2012}}.

===Fideism===
{{Main|Fideism}}
Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of [[Catholic]] thought, in a movement called Traditionalism. The Roman Catholic [[Magisterium]] has, however, repeatedly condemned [[fideism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faith in world religions==
{{God}}

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{See also|Role of faith in the Baha'i Faith}}
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], faith is ultimately the acceptance of the divine authority of the [[Manifestations of God]]{{citation required|date=July 2012}}. In the religion's view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth{{citation required|date=July 2012}}. Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |page=155 |isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Faith in Buddhism}}
Faith (Pali: ''Saddhā'', Sanskrit: ''Śraddhā'') is an important constituent element of the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]]— in both the [[Theravada]] and the [[Mahayana]] traditions.  The teachings of Buddha were originally recorded in the language [[Pali]] and the word ''saddhā'' is generally translated as &quot;faith&quot;.  In the teachings, saddhā is often described as:
* a conviction that something is
* a determination to accomplish one's goals
* a sense of joy deriving from the other two

While [[faith in Buddhism]] does not imply &quot;blind faith&quot;, Buddhist faith nevertheless requires a degree of faith and belief, primarily in the spiritual attainment of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Faith in [[Buddhism]] centers on the understanding that the Buddha is an Awakened being, on his superior role as teacher, in the truth of his [[Dharma]] (spiritual teachings), and in his [[Sangha]] (community of spiritually developed followers). Faith in Buddhism can be summarised as faith in the [[Three Jewels]]: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or [[bodhi]], and [[Nirvana]]. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.&lt;ref&gt;The Way of Wisdom The Five Spiritual Faculties by Edward Conze, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/conze/wheel065.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As a counter to any form of &quot;blind faith&quot;, the Buddha's teachings included those included in the [[Kalama Sutra]], exhorting his disciples to investigate any teaching and to live by what is learnt and accepted, rather than believing in something simply because it is taught{{citation required|date=July 2012}}.

===Christianity===
[[File:Triumph of Faith over Idolatry Theodon.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Triumph of Faith over [[Idolatry]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Théodon]] (1646–1713)]]
{{Main|Faith in Christianity}}
Faith in Christianity is based on the work and teachings of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Benedict2004&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VwwtInC5fwAC&amp;pg=a#PPA203,M1 |title=Introduction to Christianity |year=2004 |author=Benedict, Benedict X.V.I. |page=203 |isbn=978-1-58617-029-5 |accessdate=2009-04-21 |publisher=Ignatius Press |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity declares not to be distinguished by faith, but by the object of its faith. Rather than being passive, faith leads to an active life aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. It sees the mystery of [[God]] and his [[Divine grace|grace]] and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, faith is not static but causes one to learn more of God and grow, and has its origin in God.&lt;ref name= Wuerl2004&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=a#PPA237,M1 |title=The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults, Edition: 5, revised |year=2004 |author=Wuerl, By Donald W. |page=238 |isbn=1-59276-094-5 |accessdate=2009-04-21 |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Pub. Division |location=Huntingdon, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not [[fideism]] or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore, Daniel L. 2004. ''Faith seeking understanding: an introduction to Christian theology''. Grand Rapids, Mich: W.B. Eerdmans. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Christian has faith, they must understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions and on the personal experiences of the [[belief|believer]].&lt;ref&gt;Inbody, Tyron. 2005. The faith of the Christian church: an introduction to theology. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; In English translations of the New Testament, the word faith generally corresponds to the Greek noun πίστις (''pistis'') or the Greek verb πιστεύω (''pisteuo''), meaning &quot;to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure&quot;.&lt;ref name=Thomas1981&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Robert L. |last2=Editor |first2=General |year =1981 |title=New American standard exhaustive concordance of the Bible: |pages=1674–75 |isbn=0-87981-197-8 |publisher=A.J. Holman |location=Nashville, Tenn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible says that faith is &quot;the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
''Śrāddha''  ([[ITRANS]]: shraddhA) is translated as faith in [[Sanskrit]]. All schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] posit that consciousness (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'') is distinct and independent from mind and matter (''[[Prakriti|prakṛti]]''). Therefore, Hindu faith is based on the premise that [[logic]] and [[reason]] are not conclusive methods of [[Epistemology|epistemic knowing]]. Spiritual practice (''[[sadhana]]'') is performed with the faith that knowledge beyond the [[mind]] and [[Perception|sense perception]] will be revealed to the practitioner.

The schools of Hindu philosophy differ in their recommended methods to cultivate faith, including selfless action (''[[karma yoga|karma-yoga]]''), renunciation (''[[Jnana yoga|jnana-yoga]]'') and devotion (''[[bhakti yoga|bhakti-yoga]]'').

In chapter 17 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]]{{citation required|date=July 2012}}, [[Krishna]] describes how faith, influenced by the three modes (''[[guṇa]]''s) lead to different approaches in worship, diet, sacrifice, austerity and charity.

[[Swami Tripurari]] states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Faith for good reason arises out of the mystery that underlies the very structure and nature of reality, a mystery that in its entirety will never be entirely demystified despite what those who have placed reason on their altar might like us to believe. The mystery of life that gives rise to faith as a supra-rational means of unlocking life's mystery—one that reason does not hold the key to—suggests that faith is fundamentally rational in that it is a logical response to the mysterious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]], ''[http://harmonist.us/2009/05/on-faith-and-reason/ On Faith and Reason]'', [http://harmonist.us/ The Harmonist], May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Iman (concept)}}
[[File:Istiqlal Mosque Eid ul Fitr Jamaah 2.JPG|thumb|Thousands of [[Muslim]]s congregrated during a mass prayer in [[Istiqlal Mosque]] in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].]]
In [[Islam]], faith (''[[Iman (Islamic concept of faith)|iman]]'') is complete submission to the [[will of God]], which includes belief, profession and the body's performance of deeds, consistent with the commission as vicegerent on Earth, all according to God's will{{citation required|date=July 2012}}.

Iman has two aspects:
* Recognizing and affirming that there is one [[Creator deity|Creator]] of the universe and only to this Creator is worship due. According to Islamic thought{{citation required|date=July 2012}}, this comes naturally because faith is an instinct of the human soul. This instinct is then trained via parents or guardians into specific religious or spiritual paths. Likewise, the instinct may not be guided at all.

* Willingness and commitment to submitting that God exists, and to His prescriptions for living in accordance with vicegerency{{citation required|date=July 2012}}. The [[Qur'an]] is understood as the dictation of God's prescriptions through the Prophet Muhammad and is believed to have updated and completed the previous revelations that God sent through earlier prophets.

In the Qur'an, it is stated that (2:62): &quot;Surely, those who believe, those who are [[Muslim]]s, [[Jews|Jewish]], the [[Christian]]s, and the [[Sabians]]; anyone who (1) believes in GOD, and (2) believes in the Last Day, and (3) leads a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.submission.org/ Islam (Submission). Your best source for Islam on the Internet.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish principles of faith}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in [[Judaism]]. Although Judaism does recognize the positive value of ''Emunah''&lt;ref name=&quot;chabad&quot;&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1398519/jewish/Emunah.htm Emunah]&lt;/ref&gt; (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the ''Apikorus'' ([[Heresy|heretic]]), faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially as it is in the faith-possessed [[Christendom]]. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed.&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002/&gt; Classical Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of faith in [[Christianity]]), but rather to honour the idea of God.

In the Jewish scriptures trust in God - Emunah - refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the [[Torah]], notably&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |year=2002 |title=Reverberations of faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes |pages=76–78 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=faith+in+the+old+testament |isbn=0-664-22231-5 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 7:9 (The [[Torah]] - A Modern Commentary; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, NY 1981 by W. G. Plaut)&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Know, therefore, that only the LORD your God is God, the steadfast God who keeps His gracious covenant to the thousandth generation of those who love Him and keep His commandments&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, [[Orthodox Jew]]s have accepted [[Maimonides]]' Thirteen Principles of Belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html The 13 Principles and the Resurrection of the Dead] from ''The Wolf Shall Lie With the Lamb'', Rabbi Shmuel Boteach (Oxford University)&lt;/ref&gt; For a wide history of this dispute see: Shapiro, Marc: ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised'' (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (Series).)

A traditional example of Emunah as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of [[Abraham]]. On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12-15).
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The [[Talmud]] describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, 'G‑d help me!' The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d’s will by stealing from others. For emunah to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chabad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sikh===
{{Main|Sikhism|Sikh gurus}}
Sikhism, the [[major religious groups|fifth-largest]] organized [[religion]] in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Adherents.com |url= http://adherents.com/misc/rel_by_adh_CSM.html |title=Religions by adherents |accessdate=2007-02-09 |format=PHP}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 15th-century [[Punjab region|Punjab]] on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev]] and ten successive [[Sikh gurus]], the last one being the sacred text [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The core [[philosophy]] of the Sikh religion is described in the beginning [[hymn]] of the Guru Granth Sahib,
{{quote|There is one supreme eternal reality; the truth; imminent in all things; creator of all things; immanent in creation. Without fear and without hatred; not subject to time; beyond birth and death; self-revealing. Known by the Guru's grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sikhism – MSN Encarta |url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566784/Sikhism.html |accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]], the founder of the faith, summed up the basis of Sikh lifestyle in three requirements: ''[[Nām Japō]]'' (meditate on the holy name ([[Waheguru]]), ''[[Kirat karō]]'' (work diligently and honestly) and ''[[Vaṇḍ chakkō]]'' (share one's fruits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Concepts of Seva and Simran |url=http://www.sikhpoint.com/religion/philosophyofsikhism/default.php |accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faith in other spiritual traditions==
===Meher Baba===
[[Meher Baba]] described three types of faith, emphasizing the importance of faith in a spiritual master:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;One of the most important qualifications for the aspirant is faith. There are three kinds of faith: (i) faith in oneself, (ii) faith in the Master and (iii) faith in life. Faith is so indispensable to life that unless it is present in some degree, life itself would be impossible. It is because of faith that cooperative and social life becomes possible. It is faith in each other that facilitates a free give and take of love, a free sharing of work and its results. When life is burdened with unjustified fear of one another it becomes cramped and restricted....Faith in the Master becomes all-important because it nourishes and sustains faith in oneself and faith in life in the very teeth of set-backs and failures, handicaps and difficulties, limitations and failings. Life, as man knows it in himself, or in most of his fellow-men, may be narrow, twisted and perverse, but life as he sees it in the Master is unlimited, pure and untainted. In the Master, man sees his own ideal realised; the Master is what his own deeper self would rather be. He sees in the Master the reflection of the best in himself which is yet to be, but which he will surely one day attain. Faith in the Master therefore becomes the chief motive-power for realising the divinity which is latent in man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]: [http://www.discourses.org ''Discourses''], Volume Three, Sufism Reoriented, 1967, pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Support==
[[Religious epistemology|Religious epistemologists]] have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/relig-ep/ |title=Religious Epistemology |author=Clark, Kelly James |date=2 October 2004 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[William James]] offers a similar argument in his lecture ''[[The Will to Believe]].''&lt;ref name=InternetReligious/&gt;&lt;ref name=WillToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |last=James |first=William |year= |title=1896 |journal=New World |volume=5 |pages=327–347 |url=http://educ.jmu.edu//~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundationalism]] is a view about the structure of justification or [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;InternetFoundational&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep/ |title=Foundationalism |author=Poston, Ted |date=10 June 2010 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;InternetFoundational&quot;/&gt; Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and [[Theory of justification|justified belief]] are ultimately based upon what are called [[Basic belief|properly basic beliefs]]. This position is intended to resolve the [[Regress argument|infinite regress]] problem in [[epistemology]]. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of [[reformed epistemology]].&lt;ref name=InternetFoundational/&gt; 

Reformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] develop this view.&lt;ref name=Plantinga1983&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |coauthors=Nicholas Wolterstorff |year=1983 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |isbn=0-268-00964-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and [[fideism]] is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=StanfordReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/ |title=The Epistemology of Religion |author=Forrest, Peter |date=11 March 2009 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in  ''Warranted Christian Belief'' as a form of [[externalism]] that holds that the [[Theory of justification|justification]] conferring factors for a belief may include external factors.&lt;ref name=Plantinga2000&gt;{{cite book |title=Warranted Christian Belief |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-513192-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Theism|theistic]] philosophers have defended theism by granting [[evidentialism]] but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a [[probability|mathematical probability]] assigned to them.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious/&gt; Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]], whose arguments are based on [[Bayesian probability]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell1973&gt;{{cite book |title=The Justification of Religious Belief |last=Basic |first=Mitchell |authorlink=Basil Mitchell (academic) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1979&gt;{{cite book |title=The Existence of God |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.&lt;ref name=Forrest1996&gt;{{cite book |title=God without the Supernatural |last=Forrest |first=Peter |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1997&gt;{{cite book |title=Is there a God? |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some{{who|date=July 2012}} critics argue that religious faith is irrational and see faith as ignorance of reality: a strong belief in something with no evidence and sometimes a strong belief in something even with evidence against it. [[Bertrand Russell]] noted, &quot;Where there is evidence, no one speaks of 'faith'. We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand.

In the [[rationalist]] view, belief should be restricted to direct observation in the past and present{{citation required|date=July 2012}}. 

Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence{{citation required|date=July 2012}}.  He describes faith as mere belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.&lt;ref name=&quot;Is Science a Religion?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Dawkins, Richard |date=January/February 1997 |url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |title=Is Science a Religion? |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=American Humanist Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
