{{Afro-Brazilian topics sidebar}}
'''Candomblé''' ({{IPA-pt|kɐ̃dõˈblɛ}}) is an African-originated or [[Afro-American religion|Afro-Brazilian religion]], practiced mainly in [[Brazil]] by the  &quot;povo do santo&quot; (saint people). It originated in the cities of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], the capital of [[Bahia]] and Cachoeira, at the time one of the main commercial crossroads for the distribution of products and slave trade to other parts of Bahia state in Brazil. Although Candomblé is practiced primarily in Brazil, it is also practiced in other countries in the Americas, including Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama; and in Europe in Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The religion is based in the anima (soul) of the natural environment, and is therefore a kind of [[Animism]]. It was developed in Brazil with the knowledge of African Priests that were enslaved and brought to Brazil, together with their mythology, their culture and language, between 1549 and 1888.

The rituals involve the possession of the initiated by [[Orisha]]s, offerings and sacrifices of the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdom, healing, dancing/trance,and percussion. Candomblé draws inspiration from a variety of people of the African Diaspora, but it mainly features aspects of [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] [[orisha]] veneration.

== Overview ==
In many parts of Latin America, Orishás are now conflated with [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] saints. This religion, like many African religions, is an oral tradition and therefore has not been put into text throughout the years. Only recently have scholars and people of this religion begun to write down their practices. The name '''[[Batuque (religion)|Batuque]]''' is also used, especially before the 19th century when ''Candomblé'' became more common. Both words are believed to derive from a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-family language, mainly that of ([[Kongo Kingdom]]).

Candomblé may be called '''Macumba''' in some regions, notably [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], although [[Macumba]] has a distinct set of practices more akin to European [[witchcraft]]. Candomblé can also be distinguished from [[Umbanda]], a religion founded in the early 20th century by combining African elements with [[Kardecism]]; and from similar African-derived religions such as [[Quimbanda]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Cuba]]n [[Santería]], and [[Obeah]], which developed independently of Candomblé and are virtually unknown in Brazil.

There are 2 million Candombles worldwide [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/candomble/].

== Nations ==
Brazilian slaves came from a number of African [[ethnic group]]s, including [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Ewe (people)|Ewe]], [[Fon people|Fon]], and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. Slave handlers classified them by the shore of embarkment, so the relation to their actual ethnicity may be accurate or not. As the religion developed semi-independently in different regions of the country, among different ethnic groups, it evolved into several &quot;sects&quot; or ''nations'' (''nações''), distinguished chiefly by the set of worshiped deities, as well as the [[sacred music|music]] and [[sacred language|language used in the rituals]].

The division into nations was also influenced by the religious and beneficent brotherhoods (''irmandades'') of Brazilian slaves organized by the Catholic Church in the 18th and 19th centuries. These fraternities, organized along ethnic lines to allow preaching in the slaves' native languages, provided a legitimate cover for slave reunions, and ultimately may have aided the establishment of Candomblé.

The following list is a rough classification of the major nations and sub-nations, and their sacred languages:

* [[Candomblé Ketu|Ketu]] or Queto – [[Yoruba language]] (''Iorubá'' or ''Nagô'' in Portuguese)
** ''Efã'' and ''Ijexá'' in [[Bahia]]
** ''Nagô'' or ''Eba'' in [[Pernambuco]]
** ''Oió-ijexá'' or ''Batuque-de-Nação'' in [[Rio Grande do Sul]]
** ''Mina-nagô'' or ''Tambor-de-Mina'' in [[Maranhão]]
** ''Xambá'' in [[Alagoas]] and [[Pernambuco]] (nearly extinct).&lt;!--duas irmandades: uma de mulheres, a de Nossa Senhora da Boa Morte; outra reservada aos homens, a de Nosso Senhor dos Martírios--&gt;
* [[Candomblé Bantu|Bantu]] or [[Candomblé Bantu|Angola]] – mix of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] ([[Kikongo language|Kikongo]] and [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundo]]) languages
** ''Caboclo'' (A new deity that is the mixture between an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] and a white [[European ethnic groups|European]])&lt;!--Vener=E1vel Ordem Terceira do Rosário de Nossa Senhora das Portas do =
Carmo, fundada na Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Rosário do Pelourinho--&gt;&lt;!-- In Africa the Bantu generally worshiped familial deities, but in Brazil their deities evolved to something like the Orixas of the Yoruba --&gt;
* [[Candomblé Jejé|Jeje]] – [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Fon language|Fon]], and [[Gen language|Gen]] languages (''Jeje'')
** ''Mina Jeje'' in [[Maranhão]]
** ''Babaçuê'' in [[Pará]]
** ''Fun Fún'' in [[Panamá]]&lt;!--Jeje means &quot;foreigner&quot; in Yorubá, epithet they gave to Dahomey slaves--&gt;&lt;!-- devoção de Nosso Senhor Bom Jesus das Necessidades e Redenção dos Homens Pretos, na Capela do Corpo Santo, na Cidade Baixa--&gt;&lt;!--Batuque is another name for Candomblé? (no, is similar Umbanda) --&gt;&lt;!-- *Ixejá (nearly extinct, worshipped Oxum and Logunedê, now absorbed into Ketu) --&gt;&lt;!-- Macumba is a pejorative term applied to a branch of Candomblé Angola who incorporate elements of [[Umbanda]] and [[Quimbanda]] into their practices-&gt;&lt;!--* [[Candomblé Xangô|Xangô]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Paraíba]], [[Alagoas]]) --&gt;

== Beliefs ==

Candomblé is a polytheistic religion and worships a number of [[deity|gods]], derived from African deities:
* the [[Orisha]]s of [[Yoruba and Ketashi mythology]] (Ketu nation), spelled ''[[Orisha|Orixás]]'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]];
* the [[Vodun]]s of the [[Ewe (people)|Ewe]] and [[Fon (people)|Fon]] (Jeje nation); and
* the [[Nkisi]]s ([[Nkisi|Minkisi]]) of the Bantu ([[Candomblé Bantu|Angola nation and Congo]]).
* [http://pt.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tabela_Orixas-Voduns-Nkisis Tabela Orixas-Voduns-Nkisis]

These deities were created by a supreme God: [[Olodumare]], [[Olorun]] etc. of the Yoruba, [[Zambi]] or [[Zambiapongo]] of the Bantu, and [[Nana Buluku]] of the [[Fon (people)|Fon]].

On the other hand, deities from one nation may be acculturated as &quot;guests&quot; in houses and ceremonies of another nation, besides those of the latter. Some nations assign new names to guest spirits, while some retain the names used in the nation of origin.

== Syncretism ==

There is also an Islamic-linked sect within Candomblé which was more common during the slave days in Brazil.  Slaves coming from West Africa had been acculturated with Muslim traditions.  These Malês set aside Fridays as the day to worship deities as do the Muslims for prayer and meditation.  Malês were the instigators of many slave revolts in Brazil leading in all white with amulets and skull caps as in traditional Islam.

In this regard, it is worth noting that some Candomblé rites have also incorporated local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] gods — which, to the Church, were just as pagan as the Orishás — because they were seen as the &quot;Orishas of the land&quot;. Finally, one should keep in mind that many (if not most) practitioners of Candomblé through the times had not only African roots but European ones as well.

Although syncretism still seems to be prevalent, in recent years the lessening of religious and racial prejudices has given rise to a &quot;traditionalist&quot; movement in Candomblé, that rejects the Christian elements and seeks to recreate a &quot;pure&quot; cult based exclusively in Africa.

== Rituals ==

The Candomblé ritual has two parts: the ''preparation'', attended only by priests and initiates, which may start a week in advance; and a festive public &quot;mass&quot; and banquet that starts in the late evening and ends around midnight.

In the first part, initiates and aides wash and iron the costumes for the ceremony, and decorate the house with paper flags and festoons, in the colors favored by the Orixas that are to be honored on that occasion. They also prepare food for the banquet. Some domestic animals are slaughtered; some parts reserved for sacrifice, the rest is prepared for the banquet. On the day of the ceremony, starting in the early morning, [[cowrie-shell divination]]s (''jogo de búzios'') are performed, and sacrifices are offered to the desired Orixás, and to the messenger spirit ([[Eshu|Exú]] in Ketu).

In the public part of the ceremony, ''saint-children'' ([[spirit medium|mediunic]] priests) invoke and &quot;incorporate&quot; Orixás, falling into a trance-like state. After having fallen into trance, the priest-spirits perform dances symbolic of the Orixá's attributes, while the ''babalorixá'' or ''father of saint'' (leading male priest) leads songs that celebrate the spirit's deeds. The ceremony ends with a banquet.

Candomblé music, an essential part of the ritual, derives from [[African music]] and has had a strong influence in other popular (non-religious) Brazilian music styles. The word ''batuque'', for instance, has entered the Brazilian vernacular as a synonym of &quot;rhythmic percussion music&quot;.

== Temples and priesthood ==
[[Image:Ile opo afonja.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Ilê Axé Opó Afonjá]]
Candomblé [[temple]]s are called ''houses'' (''casas''), ''plantations'' (''roças''), or '' yards'' (''terreiros''). Most Candomblé houses are small, independently owned and managed by the respective higher priests (female [[mãe-de-santo]] or male [[pai-de-santo]]). A few of the older and larger houses have a more institutional character and more formal hierarchy. There is no central administration. Inside the place of worship are the altars to the Orixás, or ''Pejis''.

Candomblé priesthood is organized into symbolic ''families'', whose members are not necessarily relatives in the common sense. Each ''family'' owns and manages one ''house''. In most Candomblé houses, especially the larger ones, the head of the ''family'' is always a woman, the [[mãe-de-santo]] or ialorixá (''mother-of-saint''),  seconded by the [[pai-de-santo]] or babalorixá (''father-of-saint''). The priests and priestesses may also be known as  babalaos (interpreters of búzios), babas, babaloshas and candomblezeiros. Some houses have a more flexible hierarchy which allows the male ''[[pai-de-santo]]'' to be the head priest.  Often during the slave period, the women became the diviners and healers which was not part of African tradition; however, the male slaves were constantly working and did not have the time to take care of daily instances. Or, nursing the children, the women were in the capacity of teaching the knowledge of their old religions to the newer generations. 

Admission to the priesthood and progression in the hierarchy is conditioned to approval by the Orixás, possession of the necessary qualities, learning the necessary knowledge, and performance of lengthy initiation rites, which last seven years or more.  There are generally two types of priesthood in the different nations of Candomble, and they are made up of those who fall in trance by the Orixá (iyawo) and those who do not (Oga – male/Ekeji – female).  It is important not to confuse the meaning and usage of the Yoruba term ''iyawò'' (bride in Yoruba) with other African derived religions that use the same term with different meanings.

The seclusion period for the initiation of an iyawo lasts generally 21 days in the Ketu nation and varies depending on the nation.  The iyawo's role in the religion is assigned by a divination made by her/his babalorixá/ialorixá; one function that an iyawo can be assigned for is to take care of neophytes as they in their initiatic seclusion period, becoming an expert in all the Orisa foods, becoming an iya or babalorisa themselves, or knowing all ritual songs, etc...  The iyawos follow a 7 years period of apprenticeship within which they offer periodical sacrifices in order to reinforce their initiatic links in the form of  the so-called obligations of 1, 3 and 7 years.  At the 7th year, the iyawos earn their title and can get an honorific title or religious post (''oye'' in Yoruba).  Once the iyawo has accomplished their 7th year cycle obligation, they become elders (''egbon'' in Yoruba, ''egbomi'' in Brazil, which means ''my elder'') within their religious family.

The other priesthood is reserved for those who do not fall in trance.  Ogas and Ekejis do not endure the same path to eldership as do iyawos; they are regarded as elders immediately after their initiation.  Their role is to help the baba/ialorixá in different specific ritual tasks like drumming, singing, cooking, taking care of the orixá shrines and when he/she comes down in possession trance, etc...  Ogas and Ekejis usually do not go on to become baba/ialorixá, nor do they open their own temples or have ''filhos de santo'' (they do not initiate others).
