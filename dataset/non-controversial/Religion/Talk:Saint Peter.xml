== Hierophant ==

I think it is reasonable to read Peter as a title synonymous to the Pope as the Highest priest. Peter cognates with [[Jupiter]], hierophant of the [[Roman Empire]], as Kaiphas with the hierophant of the [[United Kingdom of Israel]]. Jesus empowerment of Peter was thus understandably tremendously controversial for both the Romans and the ruling [[Hasmonean dynasty]], who had their own Kaiphas. For the time being I couldn't find a substantiation of this attempt of identifying this reading. So, if someone find some source material, good. Historiografies/astromythologies pertaining the star constellation [[Cepheus]] gave indication.--[[User:Xact|Xact]] ([[User talk:Xact|talk]]) 15:18, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

==This article shows a Protestant Bias==
Maybe there should be two articles.  One with all the nonsense in this article and one about the real St. Peter.

:Please elucidate. I am baffled by how little we know of Peter, who was appointed by Christ to lead the movement in comparison to Paul, who was not. [[User:ThePeg|ThePeg]] 21:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)




Yeah...no that's just wrong.  The Catholic Church was founded at the Pentacost when the Holy Spirit descended upon his Apostles.

The schism was the splitting of churches off of the original catholic church, so the catholic church remained, just had fewer members.

I can give a protestant bias: The context of the 'leadership' scripture cited, if it included the context &quot;(17)Jesus replied, &quot;Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was &lt;i&gt;not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (emphasis mine) points to the way that God communicates to men, not to the way that God communicates with Saint Peter. Which sheds a bit of light on the authority of Paul. [[User:71.112.180.186|71.112.180.186]] 03:13, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

==Some Changes Explained==
I made various changes to the section on the New Testament in this article about St. Peter.  Besides nominal changes, I attempted to add more information and additional scholarly opinions in an attempt to present a more informative and balanced article in keeping with the project goals.  In each instance I attempted to provide quotes for support.  Furthermore I preserved the original opinions for comparison, with one notable exception.  The article contained the following quote and then explanatory text:

:''Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements''. &amp;mdash;Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 3.39.14&amp;ndash;16
: If this tradition were to prove to be true, then this would imply that many of the stories about Peter in the New Testament were not likely to be true, since such stories, particularly the [[paean]] to Peter [[Gospel of Matthew|in Matthew]], if genuine would be expected to have been included by Mark. The attribution of the Gospels of Matthew and of Mark to their traditional authors is disputed among scholars for many reasons, the most obvious being that the gospels themselves are [[anonymous]], and their titular attributions are not attested earlier than the second-century writings of [[Papias]].

I found the explanatory text to be worthy of removal for the following reasons.  (1) The quote clearly says that Mark knew Peter, so it does not follow that “if proved true it would imply many stores in the New Testament were not likely to be true”.  Indeed the opposite follows.  (2) The discussion of Matthew was out of place and seems rather irrelevant, though I would encourage a better section and discussion on Matthew given its proper due.  (3) The mention of paean was vague and the link referenced Homer, not Matthew.

I added &quot;traditional&quot; to &quot;lists of the Twelve&quot; because the text seemed to suggest that the NT contains such a list. Just a slight clarification.

==Strange Passage==
I found this passage to be a bit out of place:

From the early Christian writings, it is clear that Peter was considered chief leader of the early community. Most of the gospels suggest that he was favored by Jesus. ''Although, since Peter does not reappear in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew's gospel]] after his denial of Jesus, a few scholars have suggested that for Matthew, Peter was an [[apostate]]. Perhaps the mystery is solved by the fact that Jesus appeared to Peter and charged him to return.''

I did not edit it, but it seems odd on two accounts: (1) the scholars with this view are not referenced, and (2) the &quot;mystery&quot; is not well explained.  It doesn't seem very &quot;mysterious&quot; at all.  A &quot;few scholars&quot; have presented a view where a particular interpretation of Matthew is placed in contradiction with Acts and John (and all ancient authorities) - there is no way to &quot;solve&quot; this other than to either reject the interpretation or to agree with it.

==Pope from the Greek?==
If you actually go back to the origanel language,of the New Testament, Koine Greek (of which if you are interested in learning, the new Interlinear by Wallace is great), you will see that through context and Greek exegesis, Mathew 16:18 cannot be misconstrued to mean that Peter is the first pope. I thought that this would add more info on the subject, but I wanted to post it here before I went ahead and put it on the front page as it can be quite a controversial topic... In order to resolve this question we need to look at two key words in the original  Greek: The word “Peter” and the word “rock.” In the original language the text reads: “You are Petros, and on this petra I will build my church.” Notice how Jesus distinguished between Petros (Peter’s name in the Greek, which means “stone” or “pebble”) and petra (the Greek word for “rock” or “boulder”). For Jesus to have avoided any confusion all He needed to do was to simply use the word “Petros” twice. In this way, He would have clearly demonstrated that the church would be built upon Peter. However, as we have seen, He used a different word — namely, “petra” — to make it absolutely clear that He was referring to the foundation of the church. The context of the passage (which, by the way, begins in verse 13) attests to a play, by Jesus, on these two words. In fact, interestingly enough, He used “petra” (or “rock”) to refer to Peter’s confession — that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Thus, Jesus (not Peter) is said to be the rock upon which the church would be established.

Peter himself underscores this fact in Acts 4:11 and 1 Peter 2:4-8, when he alludes to Christ as a “stone rejected by builders” and as a “rock that makes unbelievers fall.” Furthermore, the apostle Paul calls Jesus the foundation (1 Cor. 3:11), the cornerstone (Eph. 2:20), and the spiritual rock (1 Cor. 10:4) of the church. And so, in light of this we must conclude  that the Bible does not support the idea of Peter being the first pope.
Ego Eime

: Not True.  Paul does not say &quot;of the church&quot; as you have stated.  If you're going to quote from scripture, let's not add to what the scripture actually says.

* Let us come to the point. Is Jesus the 'chief cornerstone' and precious, mentioned by Simon Peter and the Apostle Paul? Or is it Peter? Peter would thus be preaching about himself, as the 'stone of stumbling' and the 'rock of offense', the chief cornerstone rejected by the builders, and He is precious in our sight. Then the Apostle Paul would have been preaching Peter as the Christ, instead of Jesus. Who is the Stone made without hands, that will crush the empire of the latter days? Is it Jesus or Peter? I am almost afraid to say these words, lest it might cause anyone to stumble. So, think well before you answer. Who is the head of the Christian Church, described by Paul in the letter to the Colossians? If you think it is Peter, tell that to Jesus when you see Him. Simon Peter was a humble servant of God himself, and never would have made this claim. How could Peter have been the first Pope, when there wasn't any Pope or 'papa' for several centuries after the apostles? Jesus Himself said, &quot;Call no man Father; for you have one Father in Heaven, and you are all brothers&quot; (Matthew, I believe). All the blessed saints are brothers; the Pope is not my dad. When Jesus said, &quot;Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name&quot; (again, Matthew, I believe); He was praying to God, not to the Pope.
* James was the first bishop, or 'overseer' of the Jewish Christian Church, which began in Jerusalem! The Romans as a nation were pagans, for centuries afterward. Get your facts and your theology straight, that it might benefit your soul and your clarity of thinking. [[User:129.24.93.219|129.24.93.219]] 00:28, 27 November 2005 (UTC) (Nov.)


* * In Scripture Jesus is represented as the foundation (1 Cor 3:11), the builder (Mt 16:18), the cornerstone (Acts 4:11), and the temple (Rev 21:22).  We also see the apostles and/or believers as: builders (1 Cor 3:10), foundations (Eph 2:20; Rev 21:14), stones (1 Pet 2:4), buildings (1 Cor 3:9), and temples (Eph 2:21). In 1 Timothy 3:15 the Church is the foundation (of the truth). If we are allowed to speak only of Jesus as rock and foundation, we will have to cut several verses out of the Bible.

Could someone tell us what the Koine Greek is which is translated as 'Church'? Tyndale translates it as 'Congregation. I think this is significant as this passage is often cited as justification for the existence of an organised, hierarchial religion. [[User:ThePeg|ThePeg]] 21:55, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

-------------------------------------------------------

Moved from the main page:
: Not true. Peter was never Bishop of Rome. Paul ordained Linus the first bishop in Rome, and the second, Anacletus; Peter ordained the third, Clement, as bishop. Clement became bishop in Rome several years after Peter's death, in a period when a bishop ordained by Paul was in place, so there isn't a case here for some kind of 'direct succession' as claimed by Rome. Bishops, the leaders in the Church, comes from the Greek 'episkopi', overseers. In the Orthodox Church now, as it was then, no bishop is superior to any other in the Church.

Any documentation as to which scholars or religious groups espouse this particular history? As to whether any bishop is superior to any other, it's clear that at the very least some bishops in the Orthodox Church today are given greater honor than others. That's why some are called 'bishops' and some are called 'archbishops', some are called 'metropolitans' and some are called 'patriarchs'. Each has different appropriate forms of address, and so on. I don't know the full history of this modern practice, but am sure it's quite old; archbishops go way back. That's quite different from anything approaching infallibility, but the idea of greater and lesser honor is certainly there at the very least. [[User:Wesley|Wesley]]

I doubt whether the fact that Peter was bishop of Antioch and Rome is mentioned in the Bible. Does anybody have references? Clearly biblical is the fact that he was one of the most important disciples. -- David, 2 January 2003.

No, Peter's bishoprics are recorded separately, not in the Bible.
But speaking of Antioch, he is listed at [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch]], and according to that he was succeeded there by Euodius. The article should probably specify that he was succeeded by Linus at Rome, and by Euodius at [[Antioch]]. Suggestions for how best to do this without messing up the List of Popes template too badly?

And few Protestants would attribute any current powers to his sainthood. (No, I didn't move it; I'm just thinking out loud.) [[User:Pollinator|Pollinator]] 12:12, Jun 13, 2004 (UTC)

----

Few Protestants deny that Clement, and the later popes, were legitament episcopal successors to Peter as bishops of Rome. What Protestants deny is that there is any special authority that was also passed on. In other words popes are nothing more than pastors entrusted to shepherd the Church of Rome.

Also I removed a sentence about Eusebius considering the 2nd letter of Peter as spurious. He did not. He listed it among the disputed books as are many other books found in today's canon. I'm not sure if the other information in that section is accurate either. --
[[User:Ye110man|Ye110man]] 18:29, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I assume you go with the interpretation of McGiffert and Richardson for rejecting the &quot;spurious&quot; interpretation of the term νόθοι describing the rejected letters (Eusebius, Church History, XXV.3-4), 
The translator's note below:
&quot;then, in this passage, must not be taken, as it commonly is, to mean spurious or unauthentic, but to mean uncanonical&quot;

Given the common use, and the regular translation here of this passage, I would suggest that it at the very least ''can'' be taken to mean &quot;spurious&quot; --[[User:65.120.153.129|65.120.153.129]] 19:35, 16 May 2005 (UTC) (eleuthero--can't log in from here)

For NPOV, shouldn't the section on Roman Catholic views of St. Peter have the counterview of Protestants?  Something like &quot;Protestants, of course, do not find any scriptural basis for the office of Pope and find no evidence that Saint Peter was regarded as a Pope-like steward of the church during his lifetime.&quot; --[[User:Jeffrey Henning|Jeffrey Henning]] 03:03, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Or how about &quot;do not acknowledge the evidence...&quot;

*&quot;If you actually go back to the origanel [sic] language,of the New Testament, Koine Greek&quot;

:The original language of the New Testament may have been Koiné Greek, but the conversation in Matthew most likely took place in Aramaic, not Greek. Aramaic did not distinguish ''Kephas'' the name from ''kephas'' &quot;a stone.&quot; (Similarly, French uses ''Pierre'' for both.) It's also my understanding that Koiné Greek, unlike Attic Greek, made no distinction in meaning between ''Petros'' and ''petra,'' using both words to mean a rock or stone. ''Petros'' was required in the context because it was masculine gender, but otherwise the significance was nonexistent.

Without some of the bible vague, we would have less room for hope or interpretation (revalations would have exact dates). Anyway, Jesus spoke in Aramaic.

==Article title: NPOV?==

This title is based on Saint worship, isn't it? It should be changed to Simon Peter. [[User:Rantaro|Rantaro]] 02:24, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:While I wouldn't say &quot;saint worship&quot;, but rather &quot;saint veneration&quot;, I would personally have no objection to a more &quot;neutral&quot; name. That could be Simon Peter, Cephas, or probably a large number of other things. We could also move the &quot;Saint Peter&quot; template down to the &quot;Catholic views of Peter&quot; section&amp;mdash;although many Protestants call him &quot;Saint Peter&quot;, few would say that they venerate him. (The Wikipedia Saints project actually recommends that the template go in the &quot;Veneration&quot; section, not in the introduction or life sections, provided there is enough material to do so.) -- [[User:Mpolo|Mpolo]] 07:18, Sep 9, 2004 (UTC)

::But all the Christians don't say &quot;Saint Peter&quot;. I am a Christian but I don't say him &quot;Saint Peter&quot;. He is only &quot;Simon Peter&quot; or &quot;Apostle Peter&quot;.

Saint worship? Hardly! That's like saying that calling Karol Józef Wojtyła ''Pope John-Paul'' is Pope worship or calling Elizabeth Windsor ''Queen Elizabeth'' is Queen worship.  Most of us non-saint venerators (and non-God venerators for that matter) are quite happy to use the names ''Saint Peter'' or ''Santa Claus'' without worrying that the rest of the world is going to think that we've taken up religion!  We don't see it as some POV religious statement -- just as use of the most commonly recognised name.

:I think the problem here comes more from divisions within Christianity than from outside it. For some Protestants, it is offensive to call someone a &quot;saint&quot; other than in the plural: &quot;I am suffering here for all the saints&quot; (St. Paul, paraphrased). As such, to respect their views, I would have no problem at all with changing the title to Simon Peter, Peter the Apostle, Simon of Bethsaida or the like. &quot;Saint Peter&quot; would be mentioned in the first paragraph, as it is common usage for all Catholics and a good number of Protestants. I'm going to go ahead and move the template down lower in the article. It could be that we want it in a slightly different spot in the end, but it's very little effort and makes the article less &quot;Catholic-centered&quot;. -- [[User:Mpolo|Mpolo]] 07:19, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)

Fair enough, Mpolo, I have no particular objection to moving the article in principle.

Hmm...I can agree, in general, with the idea that it should only be used when it's the only way of differentiating, as [[Saint Lawrence]], [[Saint George]], [[Saint Paul]].  But Peter's an interesting case.  Certainly we ''could'' use [[Simon Peter]].  On the other hand, he's almost certainly better known as &quot;Saint Peter&quot; than as &quot;Simon Peter&quot;, so general wikipedia naming policy would suggest the former.  Anyway, I won't fight particularly hard if the consensus is to move to Simon Peter.  But I would suggest that we shouldn't move articles where &quot;Saint&quot; is the only way to distinguish, because it might offend certain sects of Protestants.

: As an atheist in a pseudo-secular Anglican country (the UK), I had never '''ever''' heard the term &quot;Simon Peter&quot; before it was suggested above. I'd suggest that quite a few people would also be in a similar situation.

Saint Peter seems like the best choice to me, since disambiguation is needed and it is by far the most easily recognizable disambiguation. Plenty of Christians accept the term ''saint'' in reference to the New Testament apostles even if they don't care for Roman Catholic practices in designating saints, so I don't think it should be particularly offensive. And the most basic level of recognition is in the popular folklore that has St. Peter guarding the gates of heaven, so I think this is the best choice.

I think that the article should be called something like Peter (Apostle) or Peter (Diciple), not Saint Peter.  As a Protestant, I consider all true Christians to be saints and since every Christian denomination has its own definition of who a saint is, it is somewhat biased to call him a saint since many believe that he is no more a saint than everyone else who has accepted Christ.  If we use one of the names I sugested, then there is no bias and it is still a title people know him by.  After all, there was only one disciple named Peter.

== Removing the Papal box ==

Thoughts on removing the papal box? It screws up the layout, all of the information is available in the text and in the Saint box, and the pope and patriarch succession boxes at the bottom even allow you to navigate through the order. I do like the image and will move that into the main text, but I think the box itself is just too much. If there are no objections, I'll remove it in a day or two. --[[User:MikeJ9919|MikeJ9919]] 17:38, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I'm neutral on the issue but I thought I should explain that there are a group of people who have taken up the project of adding the papal boxes to all the articles on people who have held the title of Pope in the Roman Catholic tradition.  They have begun at [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and have been working backwords until they get to all the biographies.  So if you remove the papal box now, it might find itself on the article again in the future.  There is debate as to whether or not the papal succession boxes will be removed when the project is completed.

:If I had a gun to my head and was forced to choose which infobox to get rid of, it would be the saint box as not all the saint articles have the saint box.  However, all the pope articles will have a streamlined pope box by the end of this summer.

:As for [[NPOV]] questions that might come up since calling Saint Peter a pope of the Roman Catholic Church is a strictly Roman Catholic view.... I think it's safe to have as long as it's in the section of this article that details Roman Catholic views on Saint Peter.

==Simon Peter==
I put Peter back into the Born-again Christians category because he was a born-again Christian. If you read John 3, you will see that Jesus said to have eternal life it was necessary to become &quot;born again&quot;. Peter was a follower of Jesus and he followed His commandments and became one of the leading evangelists for Jesus after Jesus left Earth. That means Peter followed what Jesus taught, and became born again. 

If we are going to remove him from this category, then we need to remove all of the Roman Catholic beliefs about him (that he was the first pope, etc.), because I dispute those beliefs. If this article is only to support a Roman Catholic Peter, PLEASE let me know so I can create a Simon Peter article to have the truth about him told. I though encyclopedias were supposed to be true...also, I thought Wikipedia had a NPOV, that would mean that we have to include him in the Born-again Christians category or it is not neutral...it is only Roman Catholic.

== Mattew, not Jesus wrote the Gospel of Matthew ==

It wasn't Jesus who did a play on words with Petros and Petra.  It was Matthew.

Furthermore, Jesus likely spoke Aramaic, NOT Greek.  He would have used the word Kephas for both &quot;Petros&quot; and &quot;Petra&quot;.

* But, Matthew was simply recording and reporting Jesus' words to his Jewish audience. It is not the 'Gospel of Matthew'; but the 'Gospel [of Jesus Christ] According to Matthew'. The other Gospels were the gospel story, according to someone else (three different times), but always about Jesus Christ. [[User:129.24.93.219|129.24.93.219]] 00:14, 2 December 2005 (UTC) And yes, Jesus did use two different words to refer to Himself, and to refer to Simon Peter. The reason for that was for Jesus' audience to avoid the error that the Roman Catholic Church has fallen into: Jesus, not Simon Peter, is the 'chief cornerstone' that the builders rejected, and He, not Simon Peter, is 'precious' in our sight.
::Of course Jesus, not Peter, is the one we worship. However, Jesus did tell Peter &quot;Simon, Son of John, ''you'' are now '''Petrus''' the rock on which ''I'' will build ''my'' church from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens above, such that the Gates of Hell will never prevail against it.&quot; 
::The name &quot;Petrus&quot; is Latin for the still-common boys' name &quot;Peter,&quot; but it is also a derivative of &quot;petra,&quot; the word for rock. I bolded the name because I was writing it in the original (earliest single-language script) Latin, whereas the rest was in English.

== Papal infobox suggestion ==

I'm not any flavor of Christian.  I both see why you'd want to have a the papal infobox in this article and why its POV to have it there.  I have a suggestion: rather than have it all up front at the very top of the article (which sort of implies that the most important thing about his is that he's the 1st pope/bishop of Rome, which many Christians would dispute), why not have it under the &quot;Roman Catholic Church&quot; heading?  --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] 13:33, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

:The box is POV. Was Peter ever a 'Pope'? =POV. Is this the most important thing to say about him? =POV. Was Linus in any sense an historical successor or even historical figure? At best POV (most neutral scholars (and many RC's) seriously doubt the historicity of the early papal succession). Peter's date of death is speculative. I'd prefer the box removed, it is POV and adds no information not easily found in the article (where it is easier to qualify the nature of the claims). The fact that some people might want to have it here irrelevant - it infringes on NPOV so it has to go. Puting in the RC section, I would perhaps accept, but only as a compromise if we can't get a consensus to remove it altogether.
:However, to avoid an edit war, I will leave it in place for a few days - but if no response in made to my charge that it is POV, I will then remove it again. --[[User:Doc glasgow|Doc]] [[User talk:Doc glasgow|&lt;sup&gt;ask?&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:53, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

::Doc, to have papal boxes on all the popes recognized by the RCC ''except'' Peter also strikes me as being POV -- it's essentially saying that Peter was not a pope, and belief that he ''was'' a pope is pretty fundamental to a lot of Catholic theology about the papacy.  Obviously he wasn't the pope the way Benedict XVI is the pope, but you'll concede that the apostolic succession thing is the basis of Catholic claims to papal supremecy.

::I realize that this is a potentially sticky argument because Peter was an important figure to several different Christian groups who have mutually contradictory views about how and why he is important.  That's why I agree that putting the papal box up top -- as if that was the most important thing about him -- is inappropriate.  I don't think it would be a terrible thing to put it in the Catholic beliefs section.  In fact, I'm just going to go ahead and do it -- we'll see if it sticks.  --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] 19:59, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

:::OK, I'm willing to look for an acceptable compromise here - and your move is a very good start. But I would gently question some of your logic - you seem to accept that the box reflects a 'RC POV', yet point out the inconsistency of having it on other 'popes' and not here. I'd submit that might be an argument for removing it from the others - rather than one for putting it here. Even the historical existence of some of the other popes is questioned - yet this box proclaims a line of succession and implies historicity. 
:::I'd prefer to omit the box altogether, but my proposed compromise (and I'm not quite sue how to do it) is to make it clear in the box that this is 'according to Roman Catholic tradition'. I think that the tradition is important enough to report (perhaps even in a box) in the RC section, as long as it is not asserting (or, equally, denying) factuality. Actually, if you want consistency, it might not be a bad idea to have such a rider in all of the papal boxes. --[[User:Doc glasgow|Doc]] [[User talk:Doc glasgow|&lt;sup&gt;ask?&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:27, 10 November 2005 (UTC)   

:There are several points in the nearly-2000-year papal sequence where there are disputes and POV differences over who was or wasn't a pope.  There are a number of [[antipope]]s, and also cases of people who were elected pope and then died before being properly consecrated, causing disputes over whether they deserve to be listed as a pope or not.  There are also some attempts to depose popes, and popes who attempted to resign, with disputes over whether such actions were legally binding at the time.  Nevertheless, Wikipedia has somehow managed to get a consistent sequence of succession boxes and infoboxes for a lineage of popes, which usually (but not always) follows that which is officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic church at present (though even the official church list has changed over time).  There's something appealing to my neat sense of logic to having such an unbroken sequence, but perhaps it is not historically justified.  (BTW, I'm not any sort of Christian, either, but have for some reason taken on the task of putting in infoboxes on numerous pope articles, going by the sequence given in the pre-existing succession boxes.)

== Judaism and &quot;St Peter&quot;? ==

This paragraph:
&quot;In Jewish folklore St Peter has a pristine reputation as a greatly learned and holy man who established the Sunday Sabbath for God-Fearers instead of Saturday, Noel (as a new year feast but not as Christmas) instead of Hanukkah, the Feast of the Cross instead of Rosh Hashana, Pascha instead of Pesach, remembering the feast of the Jews instead of Sukkot, and the Ascension for them instead of Shavuot. R. Judah Ha-Hassid, who led Germany's 12th-century Hasidei Ashkenaz, considered him to be a Tzaddik (a Jewish saint or spiritual Master among Hasidim).&quot;

sounds very un-Jewish to me, a novice student at best. I can find no extensive references to R. Judah Ha-Hassid in reference to &quot;St. Peter&quot; that don't ultimately have their origin in Wikipedia.

It's very unlikely a Jewish figure would applaud any changes in the Torah, especially of the magnitude of substituting &quot;the Feast of the Cross instead of Rosh Hashana...&quot;

Can someone verify this? It sounds very off, or at the least revisionist; I am not even sure Judaism has &quot;saints&quot; as such.

A Tzaddik Is Not a Saint, Tzaddiks are only really a hasidic Institution, as A Jew I can Guarantee they're is NO CHANCE St. Peter is a Tzaddik. The first real observed was the Besht. Their is also no validitiy in the applause of replacing Jewish holy-days with Cristian ones. My guess is this paragraph was written by a so-called &quot;Messianic&quot; Jew, aka Hebraized Evangelical Christian. I hope this is deleted.

I am in full agreement.

R. [[Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg]], who led Germany's 12th-century [[Chasidei Ashkenaz]], considered him to be a ''Tzaddik'' (a Jewish saint or spiritual Master among [[Hasidim]]) (Sefer Hasidim). The Tosaphist [[Rabbeinu Tam]] wrote that he was &quot;a devout and learned Jew who dedicated his life to guiding gentiles along the proper path&quot;. Tam also passed on the traditions that St Peter was the author of the Sabbath and feast-day ''[http://headcoverings-by-devorah.com/Nishmat.html Nishmat]'' prayer, which has no other traditional author, and also that he authored a prayer for [[Yom Kippur]] in order to prove his commitment to Judaism despite his work amongst Gentiles (R. J.D.Eisenstein). Legends about Peter and his activities are also mentioned in other medieval works, such as the Mahzor Vitri.

It seems to me you just don't want people to know about the Toledoth Yeshu? But I don't understand why that could be. It would be more in the interest of certain anti-semitic &quot;Christian&quot; groups like the KKK rather than the interest of Jews to keep it hushed up.

Coming back to the point above it seems the sources for this are Rabbi Yehuda David Eisenstein's articles on Simon Peter in Otzar Midrashim and Otzar Israel as well as notes in the Mahzor Vitry and Sefer Hasidim all these besides the Toledoth Yeshu, so I think the passage deserves to be put back in.[[User:82.6.114.172|82.6.114.172]] 10:26, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

== Is this right?: ==

'was one of the twelve original disciples or apostles of Jesus'

I'm a Catholic from the Peninsula of Yucatan, Spanish is my native language, and maybe I'm wrong but, from my understanding, there were many disciples of Jesus, but the apostles were only the 12. The sentence implies that a disciple is the same as an apostle; therefore, to me, it'd make more sense written  &quot;...was a disciple and one of the twelve original apostles of Jesus'.

:Paul refers to himself as an apostle, and mentions others as 'apostles', indeed he speaks of the gift of 'aspostleship', so the word can be used in different ways. It can refer to the 12, but it does not have to be so limited. --[[User:Doc glasgow|Doc]] [[User talk:Doc glasgow|&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ask?&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 02:27, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
:: Take a look at where Paul refers to himself as an apostle.  He  is clearly self-appointed, claiming that he does not need any &quot;letter&quot;, or certification from the disciples.  T-man is right in that there is a clear sense of apostle to mean the 12, but Paul broadened the definition somewhat, and included himself.[[User:Trishm|Trishm]] 03:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

== Peter in Rome?? ==
Saint Peter buff, trying to track this down - need some help.  I've added a citation request for Saint Peter going to Rome.

This assertion Peter went to Rome is based on a tradition but its cited within the article as fact.  I know that many believe Peter to have gone to Rome, but faith does seem to be enough for other Wikipedia articles, and so I'm asking someone to track down evidence that Peter went to Rome.

*Certainly the early writers who documented the early Popes say nothing of his visit
*The Gospels's don't have Peter going to Rome
*Saint Paul doesn't greet Saint Peter in Rome when he writes to Rome, though he greets just about everyone else
*Saint Peter certainly wan't there when Saint Paul arrived there and greeted the Jews in Rome who claim not to have heard anything about the Gospel when Paul arrives.  In fact they really wanted to hear his thoughts (Acts 28:21-22)
*'''We do''' know that Peter went to Babylon for quite some time, where he wrote his letters from (1 Peter 5:13).
*'''We also know''' that he brought the Gentile Cornelius to Christ (Acts 10:10-48)
*And '''we know''' that he headed back to Jerusalem from Babylon to attend the Countil of Jerusalem (and Paul headed back from Rome) (Acts 15:1-11)
*We also knew that Saint Peter and Saint Paul argued with each other occasionally (but this needs not be mentioned in the article)
*Other historians that document Peters travels are Metaphrastes ('''Cave, Antiquitates Apostolicæ'''), but but he doesn't have Peter going to Rome either.
*Peter writes in his own ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.ix.viii.iv.html (Book VII Section IV)] that Paul appointed the first Bishop of Rome as the [[Saint Linus]] article seems to suggest that Paul had more to do with Rome.

I've probably missed the source of this tradition somewhere.  Hopefully someone can help out here by pointing to a reference. Hopefully it shouldn't be hard to find if its true.  Therefore I think that Peter's journey to Rome either needs to be set as a tradition without substantiation, or cited.
:The assertion of Peter's going to Rome ought to be described here as tradition rather than historically uncontested fact. The sources for this tradition all come from the second century, and as mentioned above aren't backed by any of the 1st century texts. While it is more probable that Peter met a martyr's end, we simply don't have the historical basis for determining that it was in Rome, let alone that it was an upside-down crucifixion (which seems mostly to fuel the christological views of the author of Acts of Peter).

:The point about knowing things about Peter's mission from 1 Peter, however, is problematic as many scholars see it as being pseudepigraphal. Acts, likewise, proves to be problematic in many instances and its claims must be viewed very critically and carefully. The correspondence of Paul to the Romans seems to be the best case that at least in Paul's time, there was no connection between Rome and Peter. But against [[Apostolic Constitutions]], which is not likely written by Peter anyhow, Paul seems in his own letter not to have been the founder of the Roman community. So with all this, I think it shows that our evidence surrounding the association of Peter with Rome as a historical fact of the 1st century is simply lacking evidence - it might have been so, but we can't at present determine. Best to reference it as church tradition.[[User:GeneralRamos|GeneralRamos]] ([[User talk:GeneralRamos|talk]]) 13:42, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

Keep up the good work all you volunteers.  This place is awesome!

::I came to this article hoping to understand what the traditional explanation or explanations is as to how Peter went from being a leader in the Jerusalem church to being crucified in Rome. How did he end up in Rome, and how much time is he said to have spent there? As it stands now, the article says little or nothing about this and it would be very helpful if this information could be added. Sylvain1972 19:53, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

I don't know the tradition of Peter that well, but I can add that the tradition of him ending up being crucified in Rome appeared to be true when they found his body under Saint Peter's.  They were excavating under the Basilica in the middle 20th century, and they found a grave with markings around it that said that &quot;Peter is within.&quot;  They found the coffin and the remains appeared to really be Peter's, from what we know through tradition.  The man's bones indicated he was about Peter's reputed age when he died, and the clincher is that the feet were chopped off -- tradition tells us Peter was crucified upside down, and the missing feet were due to the Romans chopping his legs to get the body off the inverted cross.  Our traditions seem to be continuously confirmed by archaeology.  Maybe you might want to take a more archaeological viewpoint of Petrine tradition?  I find that it might be more reliable than historical sources.  Since the Christians of Peter's time were considered rebels, they would need to live quietly under the radar; they'd be too distracted to be able to form cohesive writings about the Christian community in Rome.  They didn't have the sort of organisation needed to get their stories straight.[[User:JesuXPIPassio|J.J. Bustamante]] 05:47, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

i don't think it's ever actually been PROVEN that it's actually Peter, i could be wrong

== What...?! ==

&quot;In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus prediction of Peter's denial is coupled with a prediction that all the apostles (&quot;you&quot;, plural) would be &quot;sifted like wheat&quot;, but that it would be Peter's task (&quot;you&quot;, singular), when he had turned again, to strengthen his brethren (Luke 22:31-32).&quot;

That is not correct in any way!

The text in the New King James Version:
&quot;And the Lord said, &quot;'''Simon, Simon!'''&quot; Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.&quot;

Would Christ have given Peter a special prayer, for Peter and Peter only, after saying that the 11 disciples would stifle as wheat, and that Satan has asked for them? Surely not! He loves His children, would a father--a Heavenly Father, to be exact, let his children be prey to a wolf? Most assuredly not. I shall delete that sentence.

Plus, it makes no mention whether He be referring to the disciples or Peter, '''except for His saying, &quot;Simon, Simon!&quot;''' &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/58.69.0.242|58.69.0.242]] ([[User talk:58.69.0.242|talk]]) 10:18, 11 January 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

:The New Testament wasn't originally written in English.  As such, reading the text in English loses some of the meaning, but the Greek makes it quite clear.  The Greek says &quot;Simon, Simon, idou, ho Satanas exetesato humas (this is you, plural, referring to the apostles), tou siniasai hos ton siton; Ego de edeethen peri sou (you, singular, addressing Peter), hina me eklipe he pistis sou; (your, singular again), kai su pote epistrepsas sterixon tous adelphous sou(your, singular)&quot;. If you don't understand any of the Greek, you can always read the original KJV: &quot;And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat;  But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted,strengthen thy brethren.&quot; Notice that it's ''you'' and hence plural in the first two instances, and ''thou'', and so singular thereafter. Hence, we can see that it is the apostles who Satan has asked for, but Peter who Jesus prayed for. Unfortunately language changes since the KJV was constructed have obscured the question in the NKJV, and most other modern English translations.

== &quot;The wise man built his house upon the rock..&quot; ==

{{bibleverse||Matthew|7:24|KJV}}  '''''Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:'''''

In this passage, the word for rock in Greek is ‘petra’, which means a large foundation type rock.  These days we use concrete foundations when we build houses.

The discussion between Jesus and Peter went like this:

{{bibleverse||Matthew|16:13-19|KJV}}  ''When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, '''Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?'''''

Mat 16:14  ''And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.''

Mat 16:15  ''He saith unto them, '''But whom say ye that I am?'''''

Mat 16:16  ''And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.''

Mat 16:17  ''And Jesus answered and said unto him, '''Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.'''''

Mat 16:18  '''''And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. '''''

Mat 16:19  '''''And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.'''''

Peter said: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus said: “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church..”

The Greek word for Peter is ‘petros’, which means a small stone, one which would be used in the construction of a building, such as a church.  These days we use bricks and blocks, but then they used stones.
 
In the phrase, “Upon this rock”, the word again is ‘petra’; a large stone foundation.
 
Jesus wasn’t telling Peter that he would be the foundation of His church, or that any single man would be. That would go against the principle taught in {{bibleverse||Matthew|23:8-12|KJV}}.

But statement: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God” represents the testimony of Jesus, which is the foundation of our Lord's church.  Peter would be honored as part of the building material.  His writings where included in the bible, and they are a very solid testimony for us today.

{{bibleverse||Acts|8:37|KJV}}  ''..And he answered and said, I believe that '''Jesus Christ is the Son of God'''. ..and he baptized him.''

{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:11|KJV}}  ''And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the '''word of their testimony'''; and they loved not their lives unto the death.''

{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:17|KJV}}  ''And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the '''testimony of Jesus Christ.'''''

{{bibleverse||Revelation|19:10|KJV}}  ''And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the '''testimony of Jesus''': worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.''

There are several points which are not mentioned in the main document: First, that discussions of the Greek form of the word are secondary, because Jesus was presumably speaking Syriac. So the pebble/boulder argument is probably irrelevant. This is particularly significant since Mark's Greek is a bit dodgy. Second, that Matthew's version of the story may be doubtful because of the &quot;agenda&quot; issue -- Jesus seldom speaks of an organization, and attributing these words to him is convenient if Peter is to be recognized as the head of the church. Third, kepha also means blockhead or clod, making this a potentially &quot;embarrassing&quot; passage and thereby providing later authors an incentive to provide an alternative explanation or simply cut it.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.217.113.254|88.217.113.254]] ([[User talk:88.217.113.254|talk]]) 21:06, 20 August 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

If Jesus truly gave Peter (stone or Rock), the Keys to Heaven and earth; would this not put Peter on the same footing as Jesus?  If he bound something on earth, God would have to do as Peter said and bound it in Heaven?  This would mean the Pope is currently on the same footing as God?  The way people 'worship' him when he ventures out, it looks like it.  Also, Peter did not do the primary, or most of the 'teaching' of Gods Word... if he was the foundation, he should have done the majority of teaching Gods Word1?!  Peter was and is only human, God would not have built His Church on such a sandy foundation. After He tells the disciples what will happen, Peter speaks, and He then tells 'Satan to get back'... some foundation to build a Church.  Now before I get a few thousand emails for blasphemy, let me say this... I currently belong to the ELCA, which is currently morally and spiritual bankrupt, in part thanks to Bishop Hanson, the leading Antichrist of the ELCA.

In the process, the editors seem to have lost sight of the fact that the arguments would have completely mystified poor Peter, who wouldn't have hadn't any clue what they were all about. 

Friends: to do justice to the man w need to deal with his frame of reference. Everything else would be  better taken up in alt.relgion.catholic-protestant-legitimacy (I made that address up, but you get the idea.)

==Category:Jewish Christians==
Peter is the only one out of the original disciples listed in the category &quot;Jewish Christians&quot;.  I would think that either all the disciples should be put under this category, or it should be stripped from Peter's article.  

Saint Paul is also listed in this category, but given how central his conversion story is to his biography, I can see how he should remain, even if Peter is removed.

== Blatant Vandalism ==

I am quite baffled by the blatantly wrong Peter image shown for this article. Next time, if you have a legitimate edit to make, please make sure the article is free from at least obvious vandalism, like you know, having a photograph of a modern man with shirt and all as opposed to a classical painting of some sort. Otherwise it becomes tedious trying to find which version to revert to. [[User:Tourskin|Tourskin]] ([[User talk:Tourskin|talk]]) 05:32, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

--- I changed the photo from &quot;peter ryan&quot; to nothing. I don't know who put &quot;peter ryan&quot; up, but I felt nothing was better than a completely false picture of saint peter. I don't know how to upload photos here, I will leave it to someone else to fix it.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.253.77.90|24.253.77.90]] ([[User talk:24.253.77.90|talk]]) 06:10, 11 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Commented out paragraph==

I commented out the following paragraph:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;===Title as First Bishop of Rome and not Pope===&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a matter of complaints in other Churches that Peter was indeed the first Bishop of Rome but he was not the first Pope. This is because in the first Church all Bishops were all equal. When the West left the East in the Great Schism the Bishop of Rome then became known as a &quot;Pope&quot;. Therefore the Roman Catholic Church was not the first original Church as the proof above tells us. This proof is from [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com Orthodox Info].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My reason for doing so was twofold: first of all, the linked reference is only to the homepage of the Website Orthodoxinfo.com, and not to any article the editor believes substantiates his claims. Second of all, the statement is innacurate. The Orthodox Church does not have any problem with the use of the title &quot;Pope&quot;. The Bishops of Rome used this title prior to the East-West Schism, and there is no historical evidence of objection by the Eastern Patriarchs. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria is also called Pope, even to this day. [[User:MishaPan|MishaPan]] ([[User talk:MishaPan|talk]]) 15:24, 4 May 2008 (UTC)

I've given the lead a good going over because that's the most important part of an article, and because I've got a lot of experience with leads. The rest of the page needs work, too. There's lots of well-intentioned information with no proper sourcing, and it's going to have to go if no one can find references for it.

== Uncited material ==
I deleted this paragraph.

&lt;nowiki&gt;In the early Greek versions of this exchange between the risen Jesus and Peter, Jesus asks whether Peter loves him unconditionally (ἀγάπος).  Peter responds that he considers Jesus a friend (φίλος).  The third time, Jesus asks whether Peter considers Jesus a friend (φίλος), and Peter responds that he considers Jesus a friend (φίλος).  One interpretation of this is that Peter actually denies Jesus two more time (i.e., denies Jesus the unconditional love (ἀγάπος) that Jesus requests); Jesus &quot;comes down&quot; to Peter's level with the final request of mere friendship (φίλος). (&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Thomas Keating's Awakenings -- http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/awakenings/awake06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Someone put a lot of work into this, and it sounds interesting, but the citation is not scholarly so not allowed. Can someone verify this interpretation? [[User:Leadwind|Leadwind]] ([[User talk:Leadwind|talk]]) 23:46, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

== Deleted, cited material ==

Soidi has cleaned up a fair bit of my work on the page. Thanks. This sentence also got deleted, and I think it should be reinstated. 

&lt;nowiki&gt;In John's version of the Last Supper, Jesus washes the disciples' feet instead of instituting a new covenant in his body and blood (the bread and wine), as found in the synoptics.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I don't think that the average reader understands that foot-washing appears instead of the body and blood covenant, which appears only in the synoptics.

That said, this deletion suggests that others' patience with my work is wearing thin, and maybe I should lay off this page for a while. [[User:Leadwind|Leadwind]] ([[User talk:Leadwind|talk]]) 13:58, 21 June 2008 (UTC)
:There were two problems: the matter was off-topic, unrelated to St Peter; and it declared that Jesus washed feet ''instead of'' instituting the Eucharist (i.e., that Jesus did not in fact institute the Eucharist).
:The source quoted must surely have meant that ''John described'' the washing of feet instead of describing the institution of the Eucharist.
:Can we agree to remove it as off-topic, and so make irrelevant the question whether what Harris is quoted as saying (that Jesus washes the disciples' feet ''instead of'' doing something else) is so (at best) ambiguous that it requires adding a quotation or two for the view that it is by no means NPOV to assert that Jesus did not in fact institute the Eucharist.  ''Lack of mention'' of an action is not the same as ''denying'' that it took place.  Most people suppose there was no question of doing one action ''instead of'' the other.
:So let us avoid a dogfight by removing what seems to be a bone of contention.  OK?  [[User:Soidi|Soidi]] ([[User talk:Soidi|talk]]) 12:09, 22 June 2008 (UTC)

== Dont know what to name this ==

The article simply does not appear scholarly -- there's protestant &amp; catholic biases throughout. It's unfortunate that wikipedia can't get this stuff right -- it's not hard &amp; there's plenty of great info. This article should begin, like any good history, with what we know and how we know it. Like many religious figures, what we know is often limited to texts created long after the religious persona lived. if that's the case, and it is in the case of St. Peter just as it is in the case of Jesus Christ, it is very important to spell this out up front. Ie. &quot;According to the New Testament, Saint Peter is an apostle of JC. . . In the writings of the early Christian scholars it is alleged that Peter journeyed to Rome and established a church . . &quot;

As it stands, this entry does not remotely resemble decent scholarship.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.232.118.211|71.232.118.211]] ([[User talk:71.232.118.211|talk]]) 01:43, 5 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Although there has been some unnecessary edit warring recently, it seems to have raised a legitimate point i.e. that all traditions on Peter's death are not based on New Testament accounts and should therefore be dealt with at some other point in the article.

It seems to me that there are several schools of thought on Peter:-

1. He was martyred in Rome and was the first Pope (Catholic orthodoxy)

2. He was martyred in Rome but later Catholic claims about his importance are dubious (probably the dominant Protestant view)

3. The account in the Gospels and the Acts is accurate or largely accurate, but later accounts about him going to Rome are dubious (some radical Protestants)

4. He did end up in Rome but some later accounts of his death are dubious (one possible interpretation of the evidence)

5. All we can say for sure is that there was an early Christian leader called Peter who gets the odd mention in some of Paul's epistles (some radical revisionists).

With the possible exception of 4 I believe all these views are held by some people, so the article ought to reflect this, while avoiding giving undue weight to minority views. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 17:08, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

:Peter at one point in his writings says &quot;greetings from Babylon&quot;.  The real Babylon being an abandoned settlement and the word &quot;Babylon&quot; being a common code word for Rome, many do believe that scripture quite clearly tells us that Peter was in Rome.  Hence, to say that the new testament is silent in that regard is not exactly accurate.  That's what the word &quot;cryptic&quot; was there for.  As such, I would suggest changing it back, but will await reply.  The other changes seem to be improvement though.

The user at the above IP was clearly making some POV edits, and I, being oddly entertained by such forms of vandalism, was looking back through the edits to see how many times he/she did it and I noticed that citations (notes) 18 and 19 seem to be inappropriate for sources.  18 is a random blog, and 19 is, last I checked, an anti-Catholic hate site.  Is there any reason for them to stay?[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 09:39, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

:The actual citation for notes 18 and 19 seem fine.  The problem stems from the additional references appended onto the notes.  Why was this done?  It certainly isn't proper Wikipedia style to append a secondary link onto a reference note, much less a reference which bears little or no relation to the work cited in the note. Both appended references should be removed simply for that reason alone. Not the notes for 18 and 19, just the &quot;a more populat account...&quot; links. The appended reference on note 18 is indeed to a blog and is, therefore, also outside standard Wikipedia style and practices.  The blog does contain a link to an actual [http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200310/mueller Atlantic Monthly article] which might make a good additional reference - in the proper place.  The additional reference appended to note 19 doesn't seem to me to be anti-Catholic in any way.  I wouldn't know, being an atheist, I suppose. Maybe I'm misreading the link somehow?  In any case, it might be acceptable if put in the proper location in the article itself, rather than appended to an unrelated note.

== Connection to Rome Section ==

Of all the sections of Wikipedia articles I have seen, the 'Connection to Rome' part of this article ranks among the worst. See this horrible piece of self-conflict:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Irenaeus of Lyons believed '''in the second century''' that Peter and Paul had been the founders of the Church in Rome and had appointed Linus as succeeding bishop.[31][32]

The notion that Peter was the first bishop of Rome and founded the Christian church there can be traced back '''no earlier than the third century'''.[44][neutrality is disputed]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not only should nothing with disputed neutrality even be in an article, but it blatantly conflicts with a point backed by verified neutral sources a few lines above. And then this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The study of the New Testament offers no proof that Jesus established the papacy nor even that he established Peter as the first bishop of Rome.[45][neutrality is disputed]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Assuming that this was a serious edit and not Protestant spam, but why is this even in and stated as a fact? Like most Biblical arguments, it's a matter of opinion based on interpretation.

Thanks for such informative and useful sources, but wrong guess, I am not going to have it exactly half-half. I am talking about whether we include non-Lutheran sources on the whole context of Jesus-Peter conversation. Let's examine your accusation:

*''Non-Lutheran Christians also reject the Catholic teaching on Peter's status, saying that Peter himself was hardly the Rock because at the same time Jesus criticized Peter, in the same chapter of the Gospel of Matthew'':

So, where is the non-encyclopedia tone/&quot;Anti-Catholicism&quot;? you point it out and I will fixe it.

*{{quotation|''Jesus turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men'.'' (Matthew 16:23)}}

Are you saying the word of Christ is Anti-Catholic? Jesus criticizing Peter is Anti-Catholic?

*''The apologists claim that it's impossible for Jesus to build a church upon a Satanic stumbling block. Jesus's comment is thus about Peter's confession instead of Peter himself.&lt;ref&gt;David, C.K., Ng, ''Distinction between Protestantism and Catholicism'', International Seed Press&lt;/ref&gt; Bible commentaries also states that the Bible verse of Galatians 2:11 clearly rejects Peter's Primacy claimed by Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Peter had no superiority over him, as the Judaizers claimed, and as the Romanists still assert.''&quot;, [http://biblecommenter.com/galatians/2-11.htm People's New Testament - Galatians 2:11 Bible Commentary]&lt;/ref&gt;''

So, talking about &quot;Distinction between Protestantism and Catholicism&quot; is Anti-Catholic? Show me where's the non-encyclopedic tone. I'm ok with rephrasing.

Farsight001, &lt;u&gt;showing readers the whole context is one of the best ways to reach NPOV&lt;/u&gt;. Please offer your clarification, as honestly I still have impression that the reverts are simply echoing the RCC propagandists. I call that &quot;POV-pushing&quot;.

:Where do I even begin?  They don't &quot;say&quot;.  They &quot;claim&quot;.  And &quot;was not the rock&quot; is far more npov than &quot;was hardly the rock&quot;.  Plus a citation would be nice and some explanation of exactly why Jesus criticizing Peter means he couldn't be the rock would be helpful too.  The quotation from scripture you added is then there to make an obvious point.  Then in the next paragraph, you use words like &quot;satanic stumblingblock&quot; to refer to Peter.  Then in the next sentence, you make a statement of fact when it is instead an opinion.  Then you use the rather generic &quot;bible commentaries&quot;, which is to open and certainly not universally true.  I'd say a good half of the bibles in existence would say otherwise about those verses.  I know mine does.  Add to that the questionable sources you used, and that whole paragraph really just doesn't belong.  Then you continue with the OR and the SYNTH by providing more verses and interpreting them yourself.

:And just so you know, in every religious discussion I have ever participated in or watched online, the first one to do the accusing of propaganda is the propagandist.

There is no evidence that monarchical &quot;bishops&quot; existed in the early apostolic age.  Acts 15 is clearly against it.

== bishop's office likely didn't exist in the time of St Peter.. ==

In the forth line, Saint Peter is credited with having been the bishop of Antioch. The source given, is clearly written by a true believer, with little regard for the fact that the currently used terms are the outcome of centuries of re-interpreting a very limited pool of original (mostly oral for decades) information. The mistake made, is that the institution of Bishop, (being the highest authority on his own, above that of the council of elders) was created most likely at least a century later. (Source: see the Wiki-lemma on [[Bishop]]) By retrospectively naming St Peter a bishop, one suggests that absolute church power in one hand was already normal by that time.  But this is most likely untrue; churches were then run by a council of elders, in which the leader of this council was at best a primus inter paribus (first among equals.)  

By calling St Peter a bishop, the false suggestion is given that the hierarchical, one guy is the boss-structure of the catholic church was created by its first generation of leaders, which is a clear example of what historians call a 'mythe d'origine' , a mythical story, unproven but presented as a fact, used to explain and justify a current power-structure.

They see him as a prophet, one of three great ones, Mohammed and Moses being the other two, and Mohammed being the most important.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/50.76.245.253|50.76.245.253]] ([[User talk:50.76.245.253|talk]]) 20:33, 2 April 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Agree. I found the sentence and editted it as follows: &quot;Likewise, they see Peter as the vicegerent, behind [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]].&quot; [[User:Ckruschke|Ckruschke]] ([[User talk:Ckruschke|talk]]) 17:02, 3 April 2012 (UTC)Ckruschke
::If Muslims do not believe [[Isa]] to be [[Masih]], then how do we explain the facts given in those articles? Complete hoaxes? [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 18:08, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:::I'll take your word for it. Seems obvious to me that Muslims wouldn't see Christ as the Messiah, but what do I know I'm not Muslim... [[User:Ckruschke|Ckruschke]] ([[User talk:Ckruschke|talk]]) 18:50, 3 April 2012 (UTC)Ckruschke
::::In Islam Jesus is perhaps the most important of Prophets after Muhammed (PbuH) and held in very high regard. [[User:Mythic Writerlord|Mythic Writerlord]] ([[User talk:Mythic Writerlord|talk]]) 18:53, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

== Mythology category? ==

This article presents a lot of unfounded nonsense about a possibly fictional character as if it absolutely true.  What it ''does'' is describe a mythological character, and perhaps could have a section on possible historicity.  Otherwise it's pretty much a religious page that takes all the myths as true and never mentions that they might not be.
