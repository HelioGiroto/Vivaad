==History==

===Pre-19th century===
Efforts by [[Jewish Christians]] to [[Christian mission to Jews|proselytize Jews]] go back to the first Century when Paul preached first at the synagogues in each city he visited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnett&quot; /&gt; However, early accounts of missions to the Jews, such as [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]' record of the conversion of Count Joseph of Tiberias, and [[Sozomen]]'s accounts of Jewish conversions, do not mention converted Jews playing any leading role in proselytization.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Stemberger Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the fourth century  2000 &quot;For example, Sozomen reports that in Constantinople (under Constantine?) countless Jews also converted to Christianity.92 The question remains to what extent it could still be expected of Jewish converts of this period that they should join a Jewish Christian congregation. Would they not rather attempt to make a radical break with their past? The Judaizers mentioned again and again, for example, in Jerome, are not automatically Jewish Christians.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Notable converts from Judaism who themselves attempted to convert other Jews are more visible from at least the 13th century, when Jewish convert [[Pablo Christiani]] attempted to convert other Jews. This activity, however, typically lacked any independent Jewish-Christian congregations, and was often imposed through force by organized Christian churches.&lt;ref name = &quot;Flannery&quot; /&gt;

In the 15th and 16th century, Jewish Christians occupying professorships at the European universities began to provide translations of Hebrew texts. Scholars such as [[Paul Nuñez Coronel]], [[Alfonso de Zamora]], Alfonso de Alcalá, [[Domenico Gerosolimitano]] and [[Giovanni Battista Jona]] were actively engaged in spreading Jewish learning.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cohn-Sherbok2000_12&quot; /&gt;

===19th and early 20th centuries===
{{main|Hebrew Christian Movement}}
In the 19th century, some groups attempted to create congregations and societies of Jewish converts to Christianity, though most of the early congregations were short-lived.&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p192/&gt; Early formal organizations run by converted Jews include: the Anglican [[London Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews]] of [[Joseph Frey]] (1809),&lt;ref&gt;John James Moscrop. ''Measuring Jerusalem: the Palestine Exploration Fund and British ... '' p15 2000 &quot;the perspective of the Holy Land the most important of these societies was the [[London Jews' Society]]. Founded in 1809 during the high point of evangelical endeavour, the London Jews' Society was the work of Joseph Samuel Frederick Frey , ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which published the first ''[[Bible translations by language|Yiddish New Testament]]'' in 1821;&lt;ref&gt;''Yiddish language &amp; culture then &amp; now'' &quot;The first Yiddish New Testament distributed by the BFBS was published by the [[London Jews Society]] in 1821; the translator was Benjamin Nehemiah Solomon, &quot;a convert from Judaism, who [had come] over to England from Poland.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;Beni Abraham&quot; association, established by Frey in 1813 with a group of 41 [[Jewish Christian]]s who started meeting at Jews' Chapel, London for prayers Friday night and Sunday morning;&lt;ref name = &quot;Cohn-Sherbok2000_16&quot; /&gt; and the London [[Hebrew Christian Alliance of Great Britain]] founded by Dr. [[Carl Schwartz]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schwartz The Scattered nation 5 p16 1870 &quot;What does the Hebrew-Christian Alliance signify? is asked by well-wishers and opponents. True, its objects have been clearly stated from the ... Let me try briefly to state the nature and objects of the Hebrew-Christian Alliance.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 1813 meeting of Frey's &quot;Beni Abraham&quot; congregation at the rented &quot;Jews' Chapel&quot; in [[Spitalfields]] is sometimes pointed to as the birth of the semi-autonomous [[Hebrew Christian movement]] within Anglican and other established churches in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewish Journal of Sociology]]'' Volumes 9-10 [[World Jewish Congress]] 1967 &quot;It was on 9 September 1813 that a group of forty-one Jewish converts to Christianity met in London setting forth ... ... Thus, in 1813, Hebrew Christianity was born in England through the efforts of a group of converts calling themselves the Beni Abraham, or Sons of Abraham. This group was followed by a number of others variously known as the [[Episcopal Jew's Chapel Abrahamic Society]] (1835), the [[Hebrew Christian Union]] (1865), and the [[Hebrew Christian Alliance of Great Britain|Hebrew Christian Prayer Union]] (1882).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; though the non-Anglican minister of the chapel at Spitalfields evicted Frey and his congregation only three years later, and Frey severed his connections with the Society.&lt;ref&gt;William Thomas Gidney ''The history of the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews''  1908 &quot;As regards missionary work in London during this period we find that the lectures to the Jews and also to ... The Jews' Chapel, Spitalfields, had to be given up in 1816, as the minister refused his consent to its being licensed as a place of worship of the Church of England. Frey's connexion with the Society ceased in the same year.&lt;/ref&gt; A new location was found and the Episcopal Jew's Chapel Abrahamic Society registered in 1835.&lt;ref name = Cohn-Sherbok_Petry /&gt;

In Eastern Europe, [[Joseph Rabinowitz]] established a Hebrew Christian mission and congregation called &quot;Israelites of the New Covenant&quot; in Kishinev, Ukraine in 1884.{{refn|name=Rabinowitz|Please see references:&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn (2005).

''The challenges of the Pentecostal, Charismatic, and Messianic Jewish movements: the tensions of the spirit''. Ashgate Publishing, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Rabinowitz was supported from overseas by the Christian theologian [[Franz Delitzsch]], translator of the first modern ''[[Bible translations into Hebrew#New Testament|Hebrew New Testament]].''&lt;ref&gt;The Missionary review of the world No.35 Royal Gould Wilder, Delavan Leonard Pierson, James Manning Sherwood - 1912 &quot;The letter to Joseph Rabinowitz brought an encouraging answer and also a few copies of the New Testament translated into Hebrew by Franz Delitzsch. They gave Scheinmann the thought to organize a class of young men for their study&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, Rabinowitz created a sample order of worship for Sabbath morning service based on a mixture of Jewish and Christian elements. Mark John Levy pressed the Church of England to allow members to embrace Jewish customs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cohn-Sherbok2000_181924&quot; /&gt;

In the United States, a congregation of Jewish converts to Christianity was established in New York City in 1885.&lt;ref name=NYT18851012/&gt; In the 1890s, immigrant Jewish converts to Christianity worshiped at the [[Methodism|Methodist]] &quot;Hope of Israel&quot; mission on New York’s [[Lower East Side]] while retaining some Jewish rites and customs.&lt;ref name=Ariel2000p9/&gt; In 1895, the 9th edition of Hope of Israel's ''Our Hope'' magazine carried the subtitle “A Monthly Devoted to the Study of Prophecy and to Messianic Judaism”, the first use of the term &quot;Messianic Judaism&quot;.&lt;ref name=RauschCCa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris-Shapiro1999p27/&gt; Hope of Israel was controversial; other missionary groups accused its members of being [[Judaizers]], and one of the two editors of ''Our Hope'' magazine, [[Arno C. Gaebelein]], eventually repudiated his views, and, as a result, was able to become a leader in the mainstream Christian evangelical movement.&lt;ref name=RauschCCa/&gt;  In 1894, Christian missionary&lt;ref name=&quot;Balmer2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Randall Herbert Balmer|title=Encyclopedia of evangelicalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=21 August 2011|year=2002|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22409-7|pages=127–|quote=Chosen People Ministries  Shortly after Leopold Cohn arrived in New York City from Hungary in 1892, he forsook his Jewish heritage and converted to Christianity.  He founded the Williamsburg Mission in 1894 and started a newsletter, ''Chosen People'', in an attempt to apprise Christians of evangelistic initiatives among the Jews.  In 1924, Cohn gave the Williamsburg Mission a new name, the American Board of Missions to the Jews; the administration of the organization devolved in 1937 to Joseph H. Cohn, a graduate of Moody Bible Institute, after the death of his father, the mission's founder.  The San Francisco arm of the American Board of Missions to the Jews, headed by Moishe Rosen, broke off from the national organization in 1973 to form Jews for Jesus.  The original mission changed its name yet again in 1986, to Chosen People Ministries.  The organization, now based in Charlotte, North Carolina, produces a daily radio program, ''Through Jewish Eyes'', occasional television specials, and various evangelistic materials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Baptist minister&lt;ref name=HCC_minutes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcje.net/cgi-bin/gsdl/library?e=d-01000-00---off-0jewishmi--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-prs-50---20-about---01-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0gbk-00&amp;a=d&amp;cl=CL5.3&amp;d=HASH6e9ec8f9ca91b75511d08e |title=MINUTES OF THE FIRST Hebrew-Christian Conference OF THE United States |year=1903 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopold Cohn (Christian clergyman)|Leopold Cohn]], a convert from Judaism, founded the Brownsville Mission to the Jews in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York as a Christian mission to Jews.

Missions to the Jews saw a period of growth between the 1920s and the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p191b/&gt;&lt;ref name =Ariel2000p191/&gt; In the 1940s and 50s, missionaries in Israel, including the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]], adopted the term ''meshichyim'' (משיחיים  &quot;Messianics&quot;) to counter negative connotations of the word ''[[notsrim]]'' (נוצרים &quot;Christians&quot;, from &quot;Nazarenes&quot;); the term was used to designate all Jews who had converted to Protestant evangelical Christianity.&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p194b/&gt;

===The Messianic Judaism movement, 1970s===
Messianic Judaism itself arose in the 1960s and 70s.{{refn|name=List1}} In the 1970s, a growing number of young Jews who had converted to Christianity were committed to maintaining a culturally Jewish lifestyle, in the mode advocated by Rabinowitz in the 19th century. Going against the thinking of the older members of the Hebrew Christian movement, they believed that different methods of evangelism of Jews were needed. They looked to and adopted some of the evangelizing techniques of [[Jews for Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Cohn-Sherbok|title=Messianic Judaism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5aOOlWdLpNwC|accessdate=12 August 2011|date=September 2000|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-5458-4|quote = Distancing themselves from the older members of the movement, the youth believed that different methods of evangelism should be used. Influenced by the techniques devised by Jews for Jesus, the promoted the use of pamphlets with humorous illustrations and dramatic themes proclaiming Yeshua. In addition, like Moishe Rosen's group, they participated in street theatre and outdoor concerts.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hocken (2009) &quot;the new thrust that turned Hebrew Christians into Messianic Jews was distinctly charismatic.&quot; This reflected the influence of the [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic Jesus movement]] at the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hocken ''The challenges of the Pentecostal, Charismatic, and Messianic ...'' 2009 Page 100 &quot;The new thrust that turned Hebrew Christians into Messianic Jews was distinctly charismatic. This reflected the influence of the Jesus movement. However the Evangelical missions to the Jews were and remained non-charismatic.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These younger members pressed the HCAA to change the &quot;outdated&quot; name of the [[Hebrew Christian Alliance of America]] (HCAA) to the [[Messianic Jewish Alliance of America]] (MJAA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=5aOOlWdLpNwC&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;ots=WWks11A8pV&amp;dq=Dan%20Cohn-Sherbok%20Continuum%20Messianic&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=Rabinowitz&amp;f=false Cohen-Sherbok, Dan ''Continuum'' (2000) p65]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, when the HCAA was founded, it had &quot;consistently assuaged the fears of fundamentalist Christians by emphasizing that it is not a separate denomination but only an evangelistic arm of the evangelical church&quot;, and insisted that it would be free of these Judaizing practices &quot;now and forever&quot;.&lt;ref name=RauschCCb/&gt; Martin Chernoff, who was president of the HCAA from 1971 to 1975, led the effort to shift the organization's focus.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rausch_MJ&quot; /&gt;  In June 1973, a motion was made to change the name of the HCAA to the [[Messianic Jewish Alliance of America]] (MJAA), and the name was officially changed in June 1975. According to [[David A. Rausch]], &quot;The name change, however, signified far more than a semantical expression—it represented an evolution in the thought processes and religious and philosophical outlook toward a more fervent expression of Jewish identity&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rausch_MJ&quot; /&gt; The [[Messianic Israel Alliance]], an organization of over 130 Messianic congregations and ministries, was formed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.messianicisrael.com/who-we-are.html Who We Are], Messianic Israel Alliance website.

==Theology and core doctrines==
{{see also|Messianic Jewish theology}}
As with many religious faiths, the exact tenets held vary from congregation to congregation. In general, essential doctrines of Messianic Judaism include views on God (that he is omnipotent, omnipresent, eternal, outside creation, infinitely significant and benevolent—viewpoints on the [[Trinity]] vary), Jesus (who is believed to be the [[Jewish Messiah]], though views on his divinity vary), written [[Torah]] (with a few exceptions, Messianic Jews believe that Jesus taught and reaffirmed the Torah and that it remains fully in force), Israel (the [[Children of Israel]] are central to God's plan; [[replacement theology]] is opposed), the Bible ([[Tanakh]] and the [[New Testament]] are usually considered the divinely inspired Scripture, though Messianic Judaism is more open to criticism of the [[New Testament]] canon than is Christianity), eschatology (sometimes similar to many evangelical Christian views), and [[Oral Torah|oral law]] (See also [[Christian Oral Tradition]] -  observance varies, but most deem these traditions subservient to the written Torah). Certain additional doctrines, including those on sin and atonement and on faith and works, are more open to differences in interpretation.&lt;ref name = &quot;MJAA Statement of Faith&quot; /&gt;

===God and Jesus===

====The Trinity====
Many Messianic Jews affirm the doctrine of the Trinity: [[God the Father]], God the Son, and God the [[Holy Spirit]] as three representations of the same divinity.&lt;ref name = &quot;UMJC-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afii.org/digitalibrary/0878084215.pdf |title=Everything you need to grow a Messianic Synagogue |page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmmen.org/jt/godhead-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''God the Father'''—Messianic Jews believe in [[God]] and that he is all-powerful, omnipresent, eternally existent outside of creation, and infinitely significant and benevolent. Some Messianic Jews affirm both the [[Shema]] and the Trinity, by understanding that the phrase &quot;the Lord is One&quot; to be referring to &quot;a differentiated but singular deity,”&lt;ref name = &quot;Kinzer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

 | quote = Paul likely uses the term Kyrios here as a Greek substitute for both the tetragram- maton and the Hebrew word Adonai (“My lord”), which in Jewish practice acts as its surrogate. In this way he builds upon the most fundamental biblical confession of faith, the Shema, highlighting the two primary divine names (Theos/Elohim and Kyrios/Adonai) and the word “one.” Paul thus expands the Shema to include Yeshua within a differentiated but singular deity. The nicene Creed adopts Paul’s language (“one God, the Father…one Lord, Yeshua the Messiah…”), and thereby affirms its own continuity with the Shema. Paul’s short confession is a Yeshua-faith interpretation of the Shema, and the nicene Creed is an expanded interpretation of Paul’s confession.

&lt;/ref&gt; Many English-speaking Messianic Jews prefer to refer to Jesus by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name &quot;[[Yeshua]]&quot; rather than by the English name &quot;Jesus&quot;.

====Jesus====
{{main|Jesus}}
The place of Jesus in Messianic Judaism is usually clearly defined. His Jewishness and that of all the original disciples is affirmed. Messianic Judaism asserts that Jesus is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]] become manifest (John 1:1;14), a belief that is identical with normative Christian doctrine regarding the nature and identity of the son of God. Furthermore, Messianic Judaism generally asserts that the Messiah has a dual aspect as revealed in Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Messiah#Christian view]] for further elaboration&lt;/ref&gt; Messianic Jews believe Jesus' first role as Messiah was to rescue the world from spiritual bondage, and that he will return again to rescue the world from physical oppression and establish his unending Kingdom—again, a belief that is identical to the normative Christian view of the Messiah. George Berkley writes that the Messianic Jews of the MJAA &quot;worship not just God but Jesus&quot; whom they call ''Yeshua''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkley&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

===Scriptures and writings===

While the Prophets and the Writings amplify and clarify the intent of the Torah, the Torah is always foundational in matters of Halakhah. In addition to Tanakh, we as Messianic Jews have another authoritative source for the making of halakhic decisions: the Apostolic Writings.…In addition, the Book of Acts and the Apostolic Letters provide crucial halakhic guidance for us in our lives as Messianic Jews.…They also provide guidelines relevant to other areas of Messianic Jewish Halakhah, including (but not restricted to) areas such as distinctive Messianic rites, household relationships, and dealing with secular authorities.…As Messianic Jews we affirm the special precedence given to Scriptural law in Rabbinic Halakhah. However, we also affirm the Scriptural character of the Apostolic Writings. While the Torah is foundational in relation to the teaching of Yeshua and the Shelichim (Apostles), the writings that record that teaching (the New Covenant Scripture) are also inspired, and they offer us an entirely reliable guide to the meaning and intent of the Mosaic Torah.

&lt;/ref&gt; Messianic believers generally consider the written Torah, the five books of [[Moses]], to remain in force as a continuing covenant, revised by Jesus in the New Testament, that is to be observed both morally and ritually.&lt;ref name = &quot;JCTorah&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Since the Torah is the Messiah in this sense that he is the Word of HaShem, then it is rightly said that he is also the Covenant G-d makes with all men.…When G-d makes his Covenant with us as sinners, which was made on that day with all who where “there” and “not there” in Deuteronomy 29:14-15, our inclination to sin caused us to break it the moment we sinned (and all have sinned in Adam). So then when G-d renews his Covenant with us (as a new regenerated man alive to the Messiah, the Torah) it is therefore to us, renewed, and to the new man (that is, we who are the righteous in Messiah) it is “new.” Thus that is why it is called a “new” or “renewed” Covenant.…Brit Chadashah = Covenant Renewed

====Jewish oral tradition====
Some Messianic communities believe that the rabbinic commentaries such as the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]], while historically informative and useful in understanding tradition, are not normative and may not be followed where they differ from the messianic scriptures.&lt;ref name = &quot;Talmud&quot; /&gt; Other Messianic believers call rabbinic commentaries such as the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] &quot;dangerous&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;RabbiYeshuaRab&quot; /&gt; stating that followers of rabbinic and [[Halakha|halakhic]] explanations and commentaries are not believers in Jesus as the Messiah.&lt;ref name = &quot;RabbiYeshuaRab&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;BT&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, many Messianic believers deny the authority of the Pharisees, believing that they were superseded, and their teachings contradicted, by Messianism.&lt;ref name = &quot;RabbiYeshuaRab&quot; /&gt;

There is no unanimity among Messianic congregations on the issue of the Talmud and the [[Oral Torah]]. Most Messianic congregations and synagogues can be said to believe that the oral traditions are subservient to the Written Torah, and where there is a conflict between the Torah and the Talmud, the plain interpretation of the Written Torah take precedence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jerusalemcouncil.org/articles/apologetics/messanic-apologetics-101/ The Jerusalem Council, a Global Association of Orthodox Jewish Believers, teaches &quot;This is based on the premise that one can not add to nor take away from the Torah, as in Deut 13:1 ... This is also why one’s beliefs about Mashiach can not rest on one’s understanding of the Prophets and Writings alone (or any tradition derived therefrom), apart from the Torah!&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some congregations believe that adherence to the Oral Law, as encompassed by the Talmud, is against Messianic beliefs, since the Talmud was not written until after the whole of the affirmed canon (begun 70 CE, completed approx 500 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chosenpeople.com/main/index.php/jewish-roots/175-rabbinic-objections |title=The phrase sefer torah (&quot;Book of the Law&quot;, occurs twenty times in the Tanakh, while there are no references whatsoever to an Oral Torah (torah she-be‘al peh) in the entire Tanakh.

What then will you follow: the sure and certain testimony of the written Word, or the traditions of men, no matter how beautiful those traditions might be?

====Messianic Bible translations====
{{See also|Messianic Bible translations}}
Messianic Jews generally consider the entire [[Christian biblical canons|Christian Bible]] to be sacred scripture. Theologian [[David H. Stern]] in his &quot;Jewish New Testament Commentary&quot; argues that the writings and teachings of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] are fully congruent with Messianic Judaism, and that the [[New Testament]] is to be taken by Messianic Jews as the inspired Word of God. This is the mainstream view within the movement,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} although—as with many religions—there are several schools of thought. A very few Messianic believers are troubled by the writings of Paul and may reject his writings, holding them in less esteem than those of the [[Gospel]] writers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====Messianic publications====
There are a number of Messianic commentaries on various books of the Bible, both Tanakh and New Testament texts, such as [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], and [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]]. [[David H. Stern]] has released a one-volume Jewish New Testament Commentary, providing explanatory notes from a Messianic Jewish point of view. Other noted New Testament commentary authors include: Joseph Shulam, who has written commentaries on Acts, Romans, and Galatians; [[Arnold Fruchtenbaum]] of Ariel Ministries, who has written commentaries on the Epistles, Judges &amp; Ruth, and Genesis, and 7 systematic doctrinal studies; Tim Hegg of TorahResource, who has written commentaries on Romans, Galatians, Hebrews, and is presently examining Matthew; Daniel Thomas Lancaster, who has written extensively for the First Fruits of Zion Torah Club series;  Stuart Sacks, author of ''Hebrews Through a Hebrews' Eyes''; and J.K. McKee of TNN Online who has written several volumes under the byline &quot;for the Practical Messianic&quot; (James, Hebrews, Philippians, Galatians, and surveys of both the Tanakh and the Apostolic Scriptures).

====Attitudes toward Paul====

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) that [[Paul the Apostle]] (who is often referred to as Sha’ul, his Hebrew name) remained a Jewish Pharisee even as a believer until his death (see [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]]). This is based on Acts 23:6, detailing events after Paul's acceptance of Jesus as Messiah. &quot;But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2023:6&amp;version=NASB |title=Acts 23:6 NASB - But perceiving that one group were |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messianic believers cite the cutting off of Paul’s hair at [[Cenchrea]] because of a vow he had taken (Acts 18:18), references in passing to him observing the [[Jewish holidays]], and his consistent good standing with his Rabbinic master [[Gamaliel]], to show that he was wholly in continued observance of the laws and traditions of Judaism. They maintain that Paul never set out to polarize the gospel between faith and righteous works, but that one is necessary to maintain the other. The [[New Perspective on Paul]] is important in Messianic Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crosscurrents.org/eisenbaum.htm Eisenbaum, Pamela 'Is Paul the Father of Misogyny and Antisemitism?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sin and atonement===
Messianic believers define [[sin]] as transgression of the Torah (Law/Instruction) of God (1 John 3: 4–5). Messianics hold to a belief that all sin (whether committed yet or not) is already atoned for because of Jesus's death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afii.org/digitalibrary/0878084215.pdf |title=Everything you need to grow a Messianic Synagogue |pages=5–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messianic Jews believe God's people have a responsibility to spread his name and fame to all nations (Psalms 96:3, Ezekiel 3:18–19)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.breslov.com/bible/ |title=Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples' and 'I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; and when thou shalt hear a word at My mouth, thou shalt give them warning from Me. ...

Most Messianic believers, whether Jewish or non-Jewish, can be said to oppose [[supersessionism]] (popularly referred to as [[replacement theology]]), the view that the [[Christian Church|Church]] has replaced [[Israel]] in the mind and plans of God.&lt;ref name = &quot;KehilatTNuvahSOF2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist among Messianic believers a number of perspectives regarding who exactly makes up God's [[chosen people]]. Most commonly, Israel is seen as distinct from the church; Messianic Jews, being a part of both Israel and the church, are seen as the necessary link between the 'gentile' People of God and the commonwealth of God's people of Israel. The two-house view, and the ''one law/grafted-in'' view are held by many identifying as Messianic, although some Messianic groups do not espouse these theologies.&lt;ref name = &quot;MJO&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Since we are one in Messiah, both Jew and Gentile, there is not sharp division between the two groups. Therefore, if a Gentile has a heart for Israel and God's Torah, as well as being a Believer in Yeshua, and this person marries a Jewish Believer, it is not considered an &quot;intermarriage&quot; in the same way Rabbinic Judaism sees it, since both partners are on the same spiritual plane. Children born from this union are part of God's Chosen, just like the Gentile parent who has been grafted in to the vine of Israel through His grace.

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Messianic group Jerusalem Council, &quot;the people of Israel are members of the covenant [[HaShem]] made with [[Abraham|Avraham]], [[Isaac|Yitzhak]], and [[Jacob|Ya'akov]]. Covenant membership is extended to converts to Judaism from the nations, as well as to the descendants of covenant members. Israel is a nation of nations and their descendants, or more specifically a people group called out from other people groups to be a people separated unto HaShem for his purposes. HaShem's promise of covenantal blessings and curses as described in the Torah are unique to Am Yisrael (People of Israel), and to no other nation or people group. The bible describes an Israelite as one descended from Ya'akov ben Yitzhak ben Avraham, or one who has been converted or adopted into that group by either human or spiritual means.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jerusalemcouncil.org/component/content/article/36-20-conversion/58-21-identity.html|title=2.1 Identity|publisher= JerusalemCouncil.org|accessdate=2008-05-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080610045907/http://jerusalemcouncil.org/component/content/article/36-20-conversion/58-21-identity.html |archivedate = June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain branches of Messianic Judaism, Jews are individual who have one or more Jewish parents, or who have undergone halakhic conversion to Judaism. As in [[Reform Judaism]], those who have Jewish fathers but gentile mothers are considered Jewish only if the individual claims Jewish identity. The statement of the Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council on Jewish identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/15/29/|title=Jewish Status|publisher= Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council|accessdate=2007-11-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928055847/http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/15/29/ |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often disputed among Messianic believers who either don't find it necessary or discourage halakhic conversion, in accordance with their interpretation of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 2:29 (that a &quot;Jew&quot; is not one who is one &quot;outwardly&quot; but is one who is a Jew in his heart). They also believe that salvation is received by accepting Jesus into one's heart and confessing that he is Lord.&lt;ref name = &quot;UMJC-Atonement&quot; /&gt;

Messianic believers from the nations are also considered a part of the People of God. Depending on their status within various Messianic Jewish groups, such as the Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations, an allowance for formal conversion is made based on their understanding that Messianic converts are not automatically considered Jewish. The reasoning for this variance is as follows: While Titus may have been the norm in the epistles, a Gentile not converted to Judaism, Paul nevertheless made an exception for Timothy, whom he circumcised and brought under the Covenant, probably because though Timothy's father was Greek, his mother was Jewish. According to the statement of the Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council regarding Conversion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/18/32/|title=The Case for Conversion: Welcoming Non-Jews into Messianic Jewish Space|publisher=Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council|accessdate=2007-11-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928055918/http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/18/32/ |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; converts to Judaism do not in any way have a higher status within Messianic Judaism than the Messianic believers who are considered by the UMJC to still be gentiles who are attached to their communities.

====One Law theology====
One Law theology teaches that anyone who is a part of Israel is obligated to observe the Covenant and its provisions as outlined in the Torah. Dan Juster of Tikkun, and Russ Resnik of the UMJC, have argued against the One Law movement's insistence on Gentiles being required to observe the entirety of Torah in the same way as Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umjc.net/umjc/dmdocuments/onelaw_movements_abridged.pdf One Law Movements; a Challenge to the Messianic Jewish Community] January 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Hegg responded to their article defending what he believes to be the biblical teaching of &quot;One Law&quot; theology and its implications concerning the obligations of Torah obedience by new Messianic believers from the nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torahresource.com/EnglishArticles/OLMResponse.pdf One Law Movements A Response to Russ Resnik &amp; Daniel Juster]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Two House theology====
Proponents of [[Two House theology]] espouse their belief that the phrase &quot;[[House of Judah]]&quot; in scripture refers to Jews, while &quot;the [[House of Israel]]&quot; refers to the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel, or [[Ephraim]]. Where scripture states the House of Israel and Judah will again be &quot;one stick&quot; ({{bibleverse||Ezekiel|37:15–23|KJV}}), it is believed to be referring to the End Times, immediately prior to the [[Second Coming]], when many of those descended from Israel will come back to Israel. Advocates of this theology postulate that the reason so many &quot;gentiles&quot; are converting to Messianic Judaism is that the vast majority of them are truly Israelites. Like One Law groups, the Two House movement has many superficial similarities to Messianic Judaism, such as their belief in the ongoing validity of the Mosaic Covenant. While much of the Two House teaching is based on interpretations of Biblical prophecy, the biggest disagreements are due to inability to identify the genealogy of the Lost Tribes. Organizations such as the [[Messianic Jewish Alliance of America]] and [[Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations]] have explicitly opposed the Two House teaching&lt;ref&gt;MJAA position paper:[http://www.mjaa.org/files/EphraimiteError.pdf The Ephraimite Error]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Reference necessary|text=and it continues to be a sensitive issue among Messianic congregations.|date=August 2010}}

====Supersessionism====
Historically, Christianity has taught [[supersessionism]] (replacement theology), which implies or outright states that Christianity has superseded Judaism, that the [[Mosaic Covenant]] of the Hebrew Bible has been superseded by the [[New Covenant]] of Jesus, wherein salvation is brought about by the grace of God, and not by obedience to the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabion.org/html/supersessionism.html |title=Supersessionism |publisher=nabion.org |accessdate=8 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally complemented with the concept of God having transferred the status of &quot;God's people&quot; from the Jews to the Christian Church. Messianic Jews, in varying degrees, challenge both thoughts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.messianicassociation.org/ezine05-replacement.htm |title=Winds of Doctrine: Replacement Theology |first=Pete |last=Koziar |publisher=messianicassociation.org |accessdate=8 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead believing that although Israel has rejected Jesus, it has not forfeited its status as God's chosen people (Matthew 5:17). Often cited is Romans 11:29:  &quot;for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable&quot;. The core of supersessionism, in which the Mosaic Covenant is canceled, is less agreed upon. Though the [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]] may or may not be seen as necessary, most are still followed, especially the keeping of Shabbat and other holy days. Some followers of the movement believe that Jews can still find favor with God through the Torah without accepting Jesus, as did Moses, David, and the Prophets.

===Eschatology===
Some Messianic Jews hold to certain [[Eschatology|eschatological]] beliefs concerning events such as the [[End of Days (eschatology)|End of Days]], the Second Coming of Jesus as the conquering Messiah, the re-gathering of Israel, a rebuilt [[Third Temple]], a Resurrection of the Dead, and the [[Millennialism|Millennial Sabbath]].

Some Messianic Jews believe that all of the [[Jewish holidays|moedim]], and indeed the entire Torah, intrinsically hint at the Messiah, and thus no study of the [[End Times]] is complete without understanding the major [[Jewish Festivals]] in their larger prophetic context. To certain believers, the feasts of [[Passover|Pesach]] and [[Shavuot]] were fulfilled in Jesus's first coming, and [[Rosh Hashanah|Yom Teruah]], [[Yom Kippur]], and [[Sukkot]] will be at his second. Some also believe in a literal 7000-year period for the human history of the world, with a Millenial Messianic kingdom prior to a final judgment.&lt;ref name = &quot;BiblicalHolidays&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Torah observance===
There is a variety of practice within Messianic Judaism regarding the strictness of Torah observance. Generally, &quot;Torah observant&quot; congregations observe Jewish Law, biblical feasts, and Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctomc.ca/sof.html |title=Statement of Faith |publisher=Ctomc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most traditional Christians deny that the ritual laws and specific civil laws of the [[Pentateuch]] apply to gentiles, certain passages&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:17–19, Matthew 28:19–20, 1 John 3:4, Romans 3:3&lt;/ref&gt; regarding Torah observance in the [[New Testament]] are cited by Messianic believers as proof that Torah was not abolished for Jews. They point out that in Acts 21 Jewish believers in Jerusalem are described as &quot;zealous for Torah&quot;, and that Paul himself never stopped being observant.

| publisher = JerusalemCouncil.org
| quote = This section will detail common halakha accepted by the known orthodox Messianic Jewish community. References will be provided, and links back to the discussion forum will be available for continued discussion. Accepted halakha follows the centrality of the written Torah as the final arbiter and standard for behavior and right living. Primary consideration is given to the teachings of the Messiah, Yeshua, and those of his immediate disciples. Other sources include traditional rabbinic Judaism, with emphasis on understandings and traditions accepted during the period of the Taanitic Sages (Jewish teachers that existed during the time of the 2nd Temple period), as well as accepted halakha practiced by the majority of the Israelite community today. It is hoped that by organizing a code of law that is at a glance a reflection of who the Messiah is and what he does, that the community of the Body of Messiah at large can better imitate Him, and thus mature in their love of HaShem and of people in the way HaShem has intended since the foundation of the world. In short, what follows is a short behavioral description of what it means to be a member of the Jewish sect of HaDerech – the Way (Gen 18:19, Ex 18:20, Deut 5:33, Deut 11:28, Psalm 32:8, Psalm 85:13, Psalm 119:30, Prov 2:8, Prov 4:11, Prov 6:23, Prov 8:20, Prov 9:6, Prov 10:17, Prov 12:28, Isa 26:7, Isa 26:8, Isa 30:21, Isa 40:3, Isa 48:17, Isa 62:10, Jer 5:4, Jer 21:8, Eze 18:25, Micah 2:13, Mal 3:1, Matt 3:3, Matt 21:32, Matt 22:16, John 14:4, John 14:6, Acts 9:2, Acts 18:25, Acts 18:26, Acts 24:14, Rom 3:17, 1 Cor 14:1, 2 Pet 2:2, 2 Pet 2:21).

==Religious practices==

===Sabbath and holiday observances===
Worship services are generally held on Friday evenings (''Erev Shabbat'') or Saturday mornings.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rein&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/16/30/|title=Shabbat|accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080127184350/http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/16/30/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Southern Baptist Messianic Fellowship (SBMF), services are held on Saturday to &quot;open the doors to Jewish people who also wish to keep the Sabbath.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;SBMF Liturgy&quot; /&gt;  The liturgy used is similar to that of a Jewish [[siddur]] with some important differences including the omission of of &quot;salvation by works&quot; as the Messianic belief is Salvation through Jesus.&lt;ref name = &quot;SBMF Liturgy&quot; /&gt; According to the SBMF, the main purpose in using a liturgy similar to a Jewish siddur is to bring others to Jesus.&lt;ref name = &quot;SBMF Liturgy2&quot; /&gt; Other branches of the movement have attempted to &quot;eliminate the elements of Christian worship that cannot be directly linked to their Jewish roots&quot;.&lt;ref name=Feher1998p20/&gt;

The Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council recommends the observance of Jewish holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/19/33/|title=Holidays|accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080127184403/http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/19/33/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most larger Messianic Jewish congregations follow Jewish custom in celebrating seven key holidays (Pesach, Shavuot, [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]], [[Sukkot]], [[Hanukkah]], and [[Purim]]). Celebration of other holidays is less widespread.

===Dietary laws===
The observance of the ''[[kashrut]]'' dietary laws is a subject of continued debate among Messianic Jews.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rein&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/20/34/|title=Kashrut|accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080127011145/http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/content/view/20/34/ |archivedate = January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Messianic believers keep kosher purely for the purposes of evangelism to Jewish people.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rein&quot; /&gt; Most avoid pork and shellfish, but there is disagreement on more strict adherence to kosher dietary laws.

===Conversion to Messianic Judaism===
Messianic perspectives on &quot;Who is a Jew&quot; vary. The Messianic Jewish Rabbinical Council, (West Haven, Connecticut, 2006) a global Messianic body, acknowledges a Jew as one born to a Jewish mother, or who has converted to Judaism.  Copying from the Reform stream of Judaism, the Council also recognizes as a Jew one who was born to a Jewish father (but not a Jewish mother) on the condition that the family of the child (or the individual as an adult) has undertaken public and formal acts of identification of the individual with the Jewish faith and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourrabbis.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=29 | accessdate = September 22, 2010 |title=For those beyond childhood claiming Jewish identity, other public acts or declarations may be added or substituted after consultation with their rabbi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of those calling themselves Messianic Jews are not of Jewish descent,&lt;ref&gt;Carol Harris-Shapiro ''Messianic Judaism: a rabbi's journey through religious change in '' 1999 &quot;However, not all Messianic believers are Jews. Nothing is as problematic as the large numbers of Messianic Gentiles in the movement. To claim Jewish identity when one is not Jewish oneself adds another layer of struggle: &quot;We are Jews!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but join the movement anyway as they &quot;enjoy the Messianic Jewish style of worship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brown ''Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus'' p12 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The MJAA views conversion for Gentiles an unbiblical practice, but accepts gentiles into their congregations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kesherjournal.com/Issue-18/Competing-Trends-In-Messianic-Judaism-The-Debate-Over-Evangelicalism |title=Competing Trends In Messianic Judaism: The Debate Over Evangelicalism &amp;#124; Issue 18 |publisher=Kesher Journal |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Messianic organizations hold to similar views.

====Baptism====
Messianic Jews practice [[baptism]], calling it a ''[[mikveh]]'' (&quot;cistern&quot;, from Leviticus 11) rather than the term ''hattvila'' (&quot;baptism&quot; הטבילה in the [[Bible translations by language|Hebrew New Testament]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok Messianic Judaism 2000 p161 &quot;For Gentile Christians, baptism is perceived as a means of entering into the body of Christ. Within Messianic Judaism, however, immersion is understood as a religious act symbolizing the believer's commitment to Yeshua: the faithful are &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Circumcision====
Some within the [[Ephraimite]] movement seek to convert themselves for identification with Israel, but most Messianic governing bodies acknowledge the presence of gentiles in the congregations, and do not see a need for them to convert to worship in the Messianic style and understanding. When conversion is sincerely desired by a gentile Messianic believer, Messianic Jewish halachic standards (including circumcision) are imposed to maintain integrity among the world Messianic Jewish community.&lt;ref name = &quot;JeC1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Be immersed in the name of Yeshua, witnessed by others (Go through a mikveh in his name).

| quote = To convert to the Jewish sect of HaDerech, accepting Yeshua as your King is the first act after one’s heart turns toward HaShem and His Torah – as one can not obey a commandment of God if they first do not love God, and we love God by following his Messiah. Without first accepting Yeshua as the King and thus obeying Him, then getting circumcised for the purpose of Jewish conversion only gains you access to the Jewish community. It means nothing when it comes to inheriting a place in the World to Come.…Getting circumcised apart from desiring to be obedient to HaShem, and apart from accepting Yeshua as your King, is nothing but a surgical procedure, or worse, could lead to you believe that Jewish identity grants you a portion in the World to Come – at which point, what good is Messiah Yeshua, the Word of HaShem to you? He would have died for nothing!…As a convert from the nations, part of your obligation in keeping the Covenant, if you are a male, is to get circumcised in fulfillment of the commandment regarding circumcision. Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member (that is, being made righteous before HaShem, and thus obtaining eternal life), but it is a requirement of obedience to God’s commandments, because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham, whether born into the family, adopted, or converted.…If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is, and that is an act of obedience, rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life, then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death, the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him, then pursue circumcision, and thus conversion into Judaism, as an act of obedience to the Messiah.

===Use of Hebrew names and vocabulary in English===
The movement generally avoids common Christian terms, such as Christ and cross (''tsalav'' - צלב), and prefers to maximise the use of Hebrew terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=oZiScvbS6-cC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA194&amp;dq=When%20the%20term%20resurfaced%20in%20Israel&amp;pg=RA1-PA200#v=snippet&amp;q=origins%20messianic&amp;f=false| author=Ariel, Yaakov |title=''The unique Culture of Messianic'' in &quot;Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America”  |publisher= Harcourt Education,Greenwood Publishing Group| date=Oct 1, 2006)| ISBN=0313050783= page=200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro ''Messianic Judaism: a rabbi's journey through religious change in America.'' p106&lt;/ref&gt; Messianic Jews take the opposite approach from the [[Sacred Name Movement]] regarding the name of God. The transliterated name &quot;[[Yahweh]]&quot; is rarely used, nor the New Testament &quot;Lord&quot;, but &quot;[[HaShem]]&quot; (Hebrew השם, &quot;the name&quot;). Messianic Jews take the same approach as the [[Sacred Name Movement]] for the name &quot;Yeshua&quot;.

== Culture ==

=== Music ===
Messianic Jewish hymnologies are not merely Christian evangelical ones.  Many of the hymns relate to Israel’s role in history, convey a messianic hope, and refer to Jesus as the Savior of Israel.  In addition , small changes differentiate them from the usual contemporary evangelical hymns, such as the use of the name Yeshua instead of Jesus.  Messianic hymnals also include a large number of Israeli songs.&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=oZiScvbS6-cC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=RA1-PA208#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| author=Ariel, Yaakov |title=''The unique Culture of Messianic'' in &quot;Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America”  |publisher= Harcourt Education,Greenwood Publishing Group| date=Oct 1, 2006)| ISBN=0313050783= page=208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception of the Messianic Judaism movement==

===Reception among mainstream Christianity===
In America the emergence of the Messianic Jewish movement created some stresses with previous Jewish-Christian and proselytzing organization; the [[Fellowship of Christian Testimonies to the Jews]] (FCTJ) in 1975 condemned several aspects of the Messianic Jewish movement.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Tomson, Doris Lambers-Petry ''The image of the Judaeo-Christians in ancient Jewish and Christian ...'' 2003 p292 &quot;From outside the movement hostile criticism of Messianic Judaism was voiced by such bodies as the Fellowship of Christian Testimonies to the Jews. At their annual conference from 16 to 19 October 1975 a resolution was passed condemning &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, the linguistic distinction between Messianic Jews and generic Christians is less clear, and the name &quot;Messianic&quot; (''Meshiyhiy'' משיחי) is commonly used by churches anyway, in preference of the secular government administrative term for Christian, &quot;Nazarene&quot; (''Notsri'' נוצרי). The Israel Trust of the Anglican Church (ITAC) based at [[Christ Church, Jerusalem]], although [[ecumenical]], and running an inter-faith school in Jerusalem gives some social support to Messianic Jews in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of Jewish-Christian relations - Page 97  Dr. Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn - 2005 &quot;Messianic Jews in Israel who accept Yeshua (Hebrew for Jesus) as the Messiah are supported, when they meet with hostility, by CMJ/ITAC. In the 1980s CMJ gave some support to evangelistic campaigns by Jews for Jesus,&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception among Jews===

====Specific response to Messianic Judaism====
Jewish objections to Messianic Judaism are numerous, and often begin with objections to the term &quot;Messianic Judaism&quot; itself: They state that while Judaism is a messianic religion, its messiah is not Jesus,&lt;ref name = &quot;Aish2&quot; /&gt; and thus the term is misleading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lotker&quot; /&gt;  Use of &quot;Judaism&quot; in the term is also considered misleading and as a subversive tactic used for missionary purposes.

All denominations of Judaism, as well as national Jewish organizations, reject Messianic Judaism being a form of Judaism, often on the grounds that belief in Jesus as the Messiah is an insuperable dividing line between Christianity and Judaism.&lt;ref name = &quot;Denominations&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;JList1&quot;&gt;

It is nothing more than a disguised effort to missionize Jews and convert them to Christianity. It deceptively uses the sacred symbols of Jewish observance…as a cover to convert Jews to Christianity, a belief system antithetical to Judaism.…Hebrew Christianity is not a form of Judaism and its members, even if they are of Jewish birth, cannot be considered members of the Jewish community. Hebrew Christians are in radical conflict with the communal interests and the destiny of the Jewish people. They have crossed an unbreachable chasm by accepting another religion. Despite this separation, they continue to attempt to convert their former coreligionists.

 | quote = Messianic Jewish organizations, such as Jews for Jesus, often refer to their faith as fulfilled Judaism, in that they believe Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. Although Messianic Judaism claims to be Jewish, and many adherents observe Jewish holidays, most Jews regard Messianic Judaism as deceptive at best, fraudulent at worst. They charge that Messianic Judaism is actually Christianity presenting itself as Judaism. Jewish groups are particularly distressed at the aggressive evangelistic attempts on the part of Messianic Jews.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] (Reform):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;For us in the Jewish community, anyone who claims that Jesus is their savior is no longer a Jew and is an apostate. Through that belief she has placed herself outside the Jewish community. Whether she cares to define herself as a Christian or as a 'fulfilled Jew,' 'Messianic Jew,' or any other designation is irrelevant; to us, she is clearly a Christian.&quot;&lt;ref name=RELTOL&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/mess_jud4.htm Opposition to Messianic Judaism from the Jewish community] by Robinson, B. ([[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canadian [[B'nai Brith]] considers messianic activities as antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One of the more alarming trends in [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] activity in Canada in 1998 was the growing number of incidents involving messianic organizations posing as &quot;synagogues&quot;. These missionizing organizations are in fact evangelical Christian proselytizing groups, whose purpose is specifically to target members of the Jewish community for conversion. They fraudulently represent themselves as Jews, and these so-called synagogues are elaborately disguised Christian churches.&quot;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnaibrith.ca/publications/audit1998/audit1998-07.html |year=1998 |title=Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. Missionaries and Messianic Churches }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several anti-missionary organizations, such as [[Outreach Judaism]] and [[Jews for Judaism]] oppose Messianic Judaism on theological grounds, usually from an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] perspective. In recent years these organizations have noticeably narrowed their focus from countering the missionizing of Jews in the name of Christianity in general to countering the spread of Messianic Judaism in particular. The Jewish anti-missionary organizations view the latter (Messianic Judaism) as a more threatening and subversive form of missionary activity than the former (openly missionizing in the name of Christianity).

Jewish leaders dispute the Jewishness of the movement.

It’s a church designed to appear as if it were a synagogue and I’m there to expose him. What these irresponsible extremist Christians do is a form of consumer fraud.

*'''God is one''':  Belief in the [[Trinity]] is considered idolatrous by most rabbinic authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/analysis/286-dabru-emet-berger Rabbi David Berger, ''Dabru Emet - Some Reservations about a Jewish Statement on Christians and Christianity'']&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a minority view that it is only ''[[shituf]]'' (association with God), which is still considered idolatrous for Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;OhrSomayach&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;CJN-Shochet&quot;&gt;{{cite news

*'''The Messiah is not divine''': Jewish theology rejects the idea that the Messiah, or any human being, is a [[divinity]], and consequently the majority Christian teaching of the Trinity has always been regarded as idolatrous.&lt;ref name=&quot;OhrSomayach&quot;/&gt; Further, Judaism does not view the role of the Messiah to be the salvation of the world from its sins, an integral part of Christian theology.&lt;ref name = &quot;UMJC-Atonement&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Grudem&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Jesus is not accepted as the Messiah''': Judaism does not accept Jesus as the [[Jewish messianism|Messiah of the Hebrew Bible]], but generally considers him as one of many false [[Jewish Messiah claimants]]. Judaism rejects Jesus as a messiah, because—
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies of [[Isaiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zachariah]].
#Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah:
#*Jesus was not a prophet, prophecy having ended with [[Malachi]] approximately 350 years prior to Jesus' birth.
#*Jesus was not a scion of the house of David, as tribal affiliation in Judaism is solely patrilineal, and Jesus is claimed to be the son of God, not man.
#*Jesus did not lead the Jews back to full Torah observance, instead contradicting the Written and Oral Laws in the New Testament.
#Biblical verses &quot;referring&quot; to Jesus are mistranslations, including those relating to virgin birth and suffering servitude.
#Jewish belief is based on national revelation, not on miraculous events performed for small groups, and there was no mass revelation similar to the one at Sinai.&lt;ref name = &quot;Aish2&quot; /&gt;

| quote = In a landmark decision today, the Supreme Court of Israel ratified a settlement between twelve Messianic Jewish believers and the State of Israel, which states that being a Messianic Jew does not prevent one from receiving citizenship in Israel under the Law of Return or the Law of Citizenship, if one is a descendent of Jews on one's father's side (and thus not Jewish according to halacha). This Supreme Court decision brought an end to a legal battle that has carried on for two and a half years. The applicants were represented by Yuval Grayevsky and Calev Myers from the offices of Yehuda Raveh &amp; Co., and their legal costs were subsidized by the Jerusalem Institute of Justice. There is a growing trend, today, to use the term Messianic Believers, which solves the objections of Jews and makes the movement more 'accessible' to Gentiles as well, who make up a significant proportion of those who attend Messianic fellowships. This is important because some fellowships under the heading Messianic Judaism, do not actually have any Jews as members and the title does not, therefore, reflect the reality on the ground.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Israel grants [[Law of Return|''Aliyah'' (right of return)]] and citizenship to Jews, and to those with Jewish parents or grandparents who are not considered Jews according to halakha, e.g. people who have a Jewish father but a non-Jewish mother. The old law had excluded any “person who has been a Jew and has voluntarily changed his religion,” and an [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] decision in 1989 had ruled that Messianic Judaism constituted another religion.&lt;ref name = &quot;New York Times - 1989&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

 | quote = Messianic Jews are not entitled to automatic Israeli citizenship, Israel's Supreme Court has ruled, concluding that their belief that Jesus was the Messiah makes them Christians instead of Jews. The ruling, published in Israeli newspapers today, supported Orthodox religious interpretations of the state's 1950 Law of Return. The law forms the basis of Jewish immigration to Israel. The law and its subsequent amendments define a Jew as a person born to a Jewish mother or who converts to Judaism and professes no other faith. Orthodox politicians have long sought a more precise definition, and the court's Christmas Day ruling has resolved one issue. The 100-page decision said that belief in Jesus made one a member of another faith and ineligible for automatic Israeli citizenship, The Jerusalem Post, Hadashot and Yediot Ahronot reported.…“Messianic Jews attempt to reverse the wheels of history by 2,000 years,” Justice Elon wrote in a passage quoted by the Israeli newspapers. “But the Jewish people has decided during the 2,000 years of its history” that Messianic Jews “do not belong to the Jewish nation and have no right to force themselves on it. Those who believe in Jesus are, in fact, Christians.”
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, on April 16, 2008, the Supreme Court of Israel ruled in a case brought by a number of Messianic Jews with Jewish fathers and grandfathers. Their applications for Aliyah had been rejected on the grounds that they were Messianic Jews. The argument was made by the applicants that they had never been Jews according to halakha, and were not therefore excluded by the conversion clause. This argument was upheld in the ruling.&lt;ref name = &quot;JIJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;JPost&quot;&gt;{{cite web

This antagonism has led to harassment and some violence, especially in Israel, where there is a large and militant Orthodox community. Several Orthodox organizations, including [[Yad L'Achim]], are dedicated to rooting out missionary activity in Israel, including the Messianic Jewish congregations.

Contrary to the way many Americans viewed the matter, conservative evangelicalism did not consider itself defeated following the Scopes trial in 1925.  The decades between the trial and the evangelical resurgence of the late 1960s and early 1970s were in actuality years of quiet growth in the movement.  ...In the 1970s many were caught by surprise when they discovered in the early 1970s the existence of a large and dynamic movement of missions to the Jews.

|chapter= Chapter 20: The Rise of Messianic Judaism
|chapterurl=
|quote= Messianic Judaism, although it advocated the idea of an independent movement of Jewish converts, remained the offspring of the missionary movement, and the ties would never be broken. The rise of Messianic Judaism was, in many ways, a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions. The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians. The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer. Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom. Similarly, the missions' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah. Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism, it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth. The ideology, rhetoric, and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced.

But in the twentieth century groups of young Jews claimed that they had overcome the historical differences between the two religions and amalgamated Jewish identity and customs with the Christian faith.

|quote=The Rise of Messianic Judaism. In the first phase of the movement, during the early and mid-1970s, Jewish converts to Christianity established several congregations at their own initiative. Unlike the previous communities of Jewish Christians, Messianic Jewish congregations were largely independent of control from missionary societies or Christian denominations, even though they still wanted the acceptance of the larger evangelical community.

|quote=When the term resurfaced in Israel in the 1940s and 1950s, it designated all Jews who accepted Christianity in its Protestant evangelical form. Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews, the term ''nozrim'', &quot;Christians&quot; in Hebrew, meant, almost automatically, an alien, hostile religion. Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion, missionaries sought a more neutral term, one that did not arouse negative feelings. They chose ''Meshichyim'', Messianic, to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term ''nozrim''. ''Meshichyim'' as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated. It conveyed the sense of a new, innovative religion rather that''{{sic}}'' an old, unfavorable one. The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior, and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians. The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage.

 | quote = Messianic Judaism is proactive in seeking Jewish converts and is condemned by the vast majority of the Jewish community. Although a Jewish convert to Christianity may still be categorised a Jew according to a strict interpretation of the '''''halakhah''''' (Jewish law), most Jews are adamantly opposed to the idea that one can convert to Christianity and still remoan a Jew or be considered part of Jewish life. From a mainstream Christian perspective Messianic Judaisms can also provoke hostility for misrepresenting Christianity.

Communion is therefore associated with Passover, since the Eucharist originated during Ushua’s Last Supper, held at Passover.  In this way, Passover is given a new, Yshua-centered meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;

I have examined both sides of the subject and can assure you that I have no ax to grind, but have found that the information on the Trinity is without any foundation, nor is it supported by the language of the Scripture. Let me state that I believe in our Heavenly Father and in his Son Y’shua (Jesus) and that the Father sent Y’shua to be a way back to Him and a means for our salvation, but I do not believe the Scripture supports the idea of the Moshiach (Messiah) being G-d of very G-d. When wrong ideas of the Mashiach are espoused they put us on the course of misinterpretations and a misconception of who our Mashiach and his Heavenly Father are. These misconceptions and misinterpretations lead us further away from the truth and ultimately further away from the Father who is the only true G-d.

| quote =  The Christian idea of a trinity contradicts the most basic tenet of Judaism – that G-d is One. Jews have declared their belief in a single unified G-d twice daily ever since the giving of the Torah at Sinai – almost two thousand years before Christianity. The trinity suggests a three part deity: The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19). In Jewish law, worship of a three-part god is considered idolatry; one of the three cardinal sins for which a person should rather give up his life than transgress. The idea of the trinity is absolutely incompatible with Judaism.

| quote =  When we begin to study and observe Torah to become like Messiah, there are pitfalls we must avoid. One such pitfall is the study of Mishnah and Talmud (Rabbinic traditional Law). There are many people and congregations that place a great emphasis on rabbinic legal works, such as the Mishnah and the Talmud in search of their Hebrew roots. People are looking to the rabbis for answers on how to keep God’s commands, but if one looks into the Mishnah and does what it says, he or she is not a follower of the Messiah. Or, if one looks into the Talmud and does what it says, he or she is not a follower of the Messiah – he or she is a follower of the rabbis because Rabbi Yeshua, the Messiah, is not quoted there.…Rabbinic Judaism is not Messianic Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism is not founded in Messiah. Rabbinic Judaism, for the most part, is founded in the yeast – the teachings of the Pharisees. Yeshua’s teachings and the discipleship that He brought His students through was not Rabbinic Judaism. There is a real danger in Rabbinics. There is a real danger in Mishnah and Talmud. No one involved in Rabbinics has ever come out on the other side more righteous than when he or she entered. He or she may look “holier than thou” – but they do not have the life changing experience clearly represented in the lives of the believers of the Messianic communities of the first century.

Most of their opponents also agreed that this was so. In fact, both the term “Messianic Judaism” and the frustration with the movement go back to the 19th century. During 1895 Our Hope magazine, which became a bulwark in the fundamentalist-evangelical movement under the editorship of [[Arno C. Gaebelein]], carried the subtitle “A Monthly Devoted to the Study of Prophecy and to Messianic Judaism.”

| quote = It is fascinating that the movement would arise in the American branch of the Hebrew Christian Alliance (HCAA), an organization that has consistently assuaged the fears of fundamentalist Christians by emphasizing that it is not a separate denomination but only an evangelistic arm of the evangelical church. The organization’s Quarterly, however, reveals that the tension between the Messianic Jewish movement and the Hebrew Christian movement had always been present. After the inception of the HCAA in 1915, the first major controversy was over an “old” heresy -- and the “heretical” dogma that was being proposed was Messianic Judaism. The controversy could have split the organization asunder during that period but for a strong united effort against Messianic Judaism.

Despite the use of the ''Shema'' in the liturgy, the conviction that God is triune is a central feature of the faith.…For Messianic Jews the concept of the trinity sounds overly Gentile; hence, within Messianic Judaism, a different terminology is used to depict the same divine reality. Nonetheless, the belief God is triune is based on the conviction that Yeshua is God.

More than that, Talmud is a Jewish way of thought about subjects important from a Jewish frame of reference. It is a guide for Messianic Judaism in forming halakhah*, not as a book of halakhic decisions, but a guide to the kinds of questions that must be asked and the areas of life that require halakhic rulings.

 | quote = [T]he Mishnah as a part of the Talmud, and the Talmuds, both  Jerusalem and Babylonian, have much value for us. We see in many cases that what is said there is paralleled by Yeshua's words. And while we can learn from the Talmuds, we must be careful to not give their words the weight of the Scriptures. HaShem's Word from Genesis to Revelation is our ultimate authority. While there are many things in the Talmuds that we view as wonderful traditions, and even descriptions of the way to do certain things, we cannot give them the same level of authority as Scripture. So, with this in mind, realize that as I bring you certain portions from the Talmuds that they are here to help us understand what we already believe as shown in Scripture, and their words are not authoritative unless they are in full agreement with the written Torah.
