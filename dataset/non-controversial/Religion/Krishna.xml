&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity, a &quot;complete&quot; [[avatar]] (or &quot;incarnation&quot;) of the preserver-god, [[Vishnu]].

Krishna is often described and portrayed as an infant or young boy playing a [[Venu|flute]] as in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'',&lt;ref

Worship of a deity of Krishna, either in the form of  [[Krishna Vasudeva|Vasudeva]], [[Bala Krishna]] or [[Gopal (Krishna)|Gopala]], can be traced to as early as 4th century BC.&lt;ref name =  &quot;Cultofgopal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =  &quot;Hastings540&quot;/&gt; Worship of Krishna as  ''[[svayam bhagavan]]'', or the Supreme Being, known as [[Krishnaism]], arose in the Middle Ages in the context of the [[bhakti movement]]. From the 10th century AD,  Krishna became a favourite subject in performing arts and  regional traditions of devotion developed for forms of Krishna such as [[Jagannatha]] in [[Orissa]], [[Vithoba]] in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Shrinathji]] in [[Rajasthan]]. Since the 1960s the worship of Krishna has also spread in the West, largely due to the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last  = Selengut |first= Charles| title = Charisma and Religious  Innovation:Prabhupada and the Founding of ISKCON| journal = [[ISKCON Communications Journal]]| volume= 4| issue = 2|year = 1996|url=http://content.iskcon.com/icj/4_2/4_2charisma.html |ref  = harv |postscript  = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of  titles and names of Krishna}}

The [[Sanskrit]] word in its origin language ''{{IAST|Kṛṣṇa}}'' is primarily an adjective meaning &quot;black&quot; or  &quot;dark&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionaries&quot;/&gt; sometimes it is also translated as &quot;all attractive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Essential Hinduism|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=224|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WuVG8PxKq_0C&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-0-275-99006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is cognate with Slavic [[:wikt:чрънъ|čьrnъ]] &quot;black&quot;. 

As a feminine noun, ''{{IAST|Kṛṣṇa}}'' is used in the meaning &quot;night, blackness, darkness&quot; in the [[Rigveda]]. As a proper noun, ''{{IAST|Kṛṣṇa}}'' occurs in [[RV 8]].85.3 as the name of a poet.&lt;ref&gt;

As a name of Vishnu,  Krishna listed as the 57th name in the ''[[Vishnu Sahasranama]]''. Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted  in [[murti]]s as black or blue-skinned. Krishna is also known by  various [[List of titles and names of Krishna|other names, epithets and titles]], which reflect his many  associations and attributes. Among the most common names are ''Mohan'' &quot;enchanter of women or cowherdesses&quot;, ''[[Govinda]]'',  &quot;finder of cows&quot;, or ''Gopala'', &quot;protector of cows&quot;, which refer to  Krishna's childhood in [[Vraja]] (in present day [[Uttar Pradesh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilt&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Iconography==
[[File:Krishna with flute.jpg|thumb|left|Krishna with cows, herdsmen and [[Gopi]]s, Pahari painting [Himalayan] from [[Smithsonian Institution]]]]
Krishna is easily recognized by his representations. Though his  skin colour may be depicted as black or dark in some representations,  particularly in [[murti]]s,  in other images such as modern pictorial representations, Krishna is  usually shown with blue skin.  He is often shown wearing a yellow silk [[dhoti]] and peacock feather crown. Common  depictions show him as a little boy, or as a young man in a  characteristic relaxed pose, playing the [[bansuri|flute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;&gt;{{cite book

A steatite tablet unearthed from [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Larkana District|Larkana district]], [[Sindh]] depicting a young boy uprooting two trees from which are emerging two human figures is an interesting archaeological find for fixing dates associated with Krishna. This image recalls the Yamalarjuna episode of ''Bhagavata'' and ''Harivamsa Purana''. In this image, the young boy is undoubtedly Krishna, and the two human beings emerging from the trees are the two cursed Gandharvas, identified as Nalakubara and Manigriva. Dr. E.J.H. Mackay, who did the excavation at Mohanjodaro, compares this image with the Yamalarjuna episode. Prof. V.S. Agrawal has also accepted this identification. Thus, it seems that the Indus valley people knew stories related to Krishna. This lone find may not establish Krishna as contemporary with Pre-Indus or Indus times, but, likewise, it cannot be ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;kurukshetra.nic.in&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Mackay's report part 1, pp.344–45, Part 2, plate no.90, object no. D.K.10237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Age of Bharata War by G.C. AGARWALA and K.L VERMA page.81&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene on the battlefield of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', notably where he addresses Pandava prince [[Arjuna]] in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', is another common subject for representation. In these depictions, he is shown as a man, often with typical god-like characteristics of Hindu religious art, such as multiple arms or heads, denoting power, and with attributes of Vishnu, such as the [[chakra]] or in his two-armed form as a charioteer. Cave paintings dated to 800 BCE in [[Mirzapur]], [[Mirzapur district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], show raiding horse-charioteers, one of whom is about to hurl a wheel, and who could potentially be identified as Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Kosambi (1962), Myth and Reality: Studies in the Formation of Indian Culture, New Delhi, CHAPTER I: SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA, paragraph 1.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations in temples often show Krishna as a  man standing in an upright, formal pose. He may be alone, or with  associated figures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harle, J.

Often,  Krishna is pictured with his gopi-consort [[Radha]]. [[Vaishnavism in Manipur|Manipuri Vaishnavas]] do not worship Krishna alone, but  as [[Radha Krishna]],&lt;ref&gt;

Krishna  is also depicted and worshipped as a small child (''[[Bala Krishna]]'', {{IAST|Bāla Kṛṣṇa}} the child Krishna), crawling on his  hands and knees or dancing, often with butter or [[Laddu]] in his hand being Laddu Gopal.&lt;ref&gt;

The earliest text to explicitly provide detailed descriptions of Krishna as a personality is  the epic [[Mahābhārata]]  which depicts Krishna as an incarnation of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-357806/Mahabharata|title=  Britannica: Mahabharata|accessdate=2008-10-13 |work = encyclopedia|publisher=  Encyclopædia Britannica Online |year= 2008|author = Wendy Doniger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krishna is central to many of the main stories of the epic. The eighteen  chapters of the sixth book (''Bhishma Parva'')  of the epic that constitute the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''  contain the advice of Krishna to the warrior-hero [[Arjuna]], on the battlefield. Krishna is  already an adult in the epic, although there are allusions to his  earlier exploits. The ''[[Harivamsa]]'', a later appendix to this epic,  contains the earliest detailed version of Krishna's childhood and youth.

In early texts, such as [[Rig Veda]], there are confidential  references to  Krishna

&quot;apasyam gopam anipadyamana ma ca para ca pathibhis carantam
sa sadhricih sa visucir vasana avatirvati bhuvanesv antah &quot;

I saw a cowherd. He never falls from his position; sometimes he is near, and some times far, wandering on various paths. He is a friend, decorated with a variety of clothes. He comes again and again to the material world. - Rig Veda 1.22.164 sukta 31

Thus Krishna is the only Infallible Cowherd boy in Hinduism, Who comes again and again to save the earth in His various avatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01164.htm |title=Rig Veda: Rig-Veda Book 1: HYMN CLXIV. Viśvedevas |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar  attempted to show that &quot;the very  same Krishna&quot; made an appearance, e.g. as the ''drapsa ... krishna''  &quot;black drop&quot; of [[RV 8]].96.13.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya ''Krishna-cult in Indian  Art''. 1996
M.D. Publications  Pvt. Ltd. ISBN 81-7533-001-5 p.&amp;nbsp;126:  &quot;According to (D.R.Bhadarkar), the  word Krishna referred to in the expression 'Krishna-drapsah' in the  Rig- Veda,  denotes the very same Krishna&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some authors have also likened prehistoric depictions of deities to Krishna.

[[Chandogya Upanishad]] (3.17.6) Composed around 900BC-700BC {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} mentions Vasudeva Krishna {{quote|as the son of Devaki and the disciple of Ghora Angirasa , the seer who preached his disciple the philosophy of ‘Chhandogya.’ Having been influenced by the philosophy of ‘Chhandogya’ Krishna in the Bhagavadgita while delivering the discourse to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra discussed about sacrifice, which can be compared to purusha or the individual.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;kurukshetra.nic.in&quot;&gt;[http://kurukshetra.nic.in/museum-website/archeologicaltreasure.html]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=85w-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Chandogya+Upanishad+son+of+Devaki&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8SjaTIuyM4GfcbfJyMMG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Matapariksha: An examination of religions, Volume 1 By John Muir |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ITJ5fGSsgygC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=Chandogya+Upanishad+son+of+Devaki&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8SjaTIuyM4GfcbfJyMMG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chandogya%20Upanishad%20son%20of%20Devaki&amp;f=false |title=The Religions of India Volume 1, Volume 1 By Edward Washburn Hopkins |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CeEmpfmbxKEC&amp;pg=SL1-PA297&amp;dq=Chandogya+Upanishad+son+of+Devaki&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8SjaTIuyM4GfcbfJyMMG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD4Q6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Indian Hist (Opt) By Reddy |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yāska]]'s ''[[Nirukta]]'',  an etymological dictionary around 6th century BC, contains a  reference to the Shyamantaka jewel in the possession of [[Akrura]], a motif from well known Puranic  story about Krishna.&lt;ref name = bryant4&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] and ''Aitareya-Aranyaka'',  associate Krishna with his Vrishni origins.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil  Kumar Bhattacharya ''Krishna-cult in Indian  Art''. 1996 M.D. Publications  Pvt. Ltd. ISBN 81-7533-001-5 p.128: Satha-patha-brahmana and Aitareya-[[Aranyaka]] with reference to first  chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connected with the festival [[Holi]]

[[Pāṇini]], the ancient grammarian and author of Asthadhyayi (probably belonged to 5th century or 6th century BC) mentions a character called Vāsudeva, son of Vasudeva, and also mentions Kaurava and Arjuna which testifies to Vasudeva Krishna, Arjuna and Kauravas being contemporaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;kurukshetra.nic.in&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Hastings&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hastings|2003|pp=540–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pâṇ. IV. 3. 98, Vâsudevârjunâbhyâm vun. See Bhandarkar, Vaishnavism and Śaivism, p. 3 and J.R.A.S. 1910, p. 168. Sûtra 95, just above, appears to point to bhakti, faith or devotion, felt for this Vâsudeva.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Megasthenes]] (350 – 290 BC) a [[Greek ethnographer]] and an ambassador of [[Seleucus I]] to the court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] mentioned about [[Megasthenes' Herakles|Herakles]] in his famous work [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]]. Many scholars have suggested that the deity identified as Herakles was Krishna. According to [[Arrian]], [[Diodorus]], and [[Strabo]], Megasthenes described an Indian tribe called Sourasenoi, who especially worshipped Herakles in their land, and this land had two cities, Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river, the Jobares. As was common in the ancient period, the Greeks sometimes described foreign gods in terms of their own divinities, and there is a little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the [[Yadu]] dynasty to which Krishna belonged; Herakles to Krishna, or Hari-Krishna: Methora to Mathura, where Krishna was born; Kleisobora to Krishnapura, meaning &quot;the city of Krishna&quot;; and the Jobares to the [[Yamuna]], the famous river in the Krishna story. [[Quintus Curtius]] also mentions that when Alexander the Great confronted [[King Porus|Porus]], Porus's soldiers were carrying an image of Herakles in their vanguard.&lt;ref&gt;Krishna: a sourcebook, pp 5, Edwin Francis Bryant, Oxford University Press US, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Kṛșṇa occurs in Buddhist writings in the form Kānha, phonetically equivalent to Kṛșṇa.&lt;ref&gt;III. i. 23, Ulâro so Kaṇho isi ahosi&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghata-Jâtaka (No. 454) gives an account of Kṛishṇa's childhood and subsequent exploits which in many points corresponds with the Brahmanic legends of his life and contains several familiar incidents and names, such as Vâsudeva, Baladeva, Kaṃsa. Yet it presents many peculiarities and is either an independent version or a misrepresentation of a popular story that had wandered far from its home. Jain tradition also shows that these tales were popular and were worked up into different forms, for the Jains have an elaborate system of ancient patriarchs which includes Vâsudevas and Baladevas. Kṛishṇa is the ninth of the Black Vâsudevas and is connected with Dvâravatî or Dvârakâ. He will become the twelfth tîrthankara of the next world-period and a similar position will be attained by Devakî, Rohinî, Baladeva and Javakumâra, all members of his family. This is a striking proof of the popularity of the Kṛishṇa legend outside the Brahmanic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Hemacandra Abhidhânacintâmani, Ed. Boehtlingk and Rien, p. 128, and Barnett's translation of the Antagada Dasāo, pp. 13-15 and 67-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthasastra]] of [[Kautilya]] (4th century BCE) ''Vāsudeva'' was worshiped as supreme Deity in a strongly monotheistic format.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastings&quot;/&gt;

Around  150 BC, [[Patanjali]]  in his  ''[[Mahabhashya]]''  quotes a verse: &quot;May the might of  Krishna accompanied by Samkarshana increase!&quot; Other verses are  mentioned.  One verse speaks of &quot;Janardhana with himself as fourth&quot;  (Krishna with three companions, the three possibly being Samkarshana,  Pradyumna, and Aniruddha). Another verse mentions musical instruments  being played at meetings in the temples of Rama ([[Balarama]]) and Kesava (Krishna). Patanjali  also describes dramatic and mimetic performances (Krishna-Kamsopacharam)  representing the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1st century BC, there seems to be evidence for a worship of five Vrishni heroes (Balarama, Krishna, [[Pradyumna]], [[Aniruddha]] and [[Samba]]) for an inscription has been  found at [[Mora, Uttar Pradesh|Mora]] near Mathura, which apparently mentions a son of the great ''satrap'' [[Rajuvula]], probably the ''satrap'' Sodasa, and an image of Vrishni,  &quot;probably Vasudeva, and of the &quot;Five Warriors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Hindu Gods and Heroes: Studies in the History of the Religion of  India|last= Barnett|first= Lionel David|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=  1922 |publisher= J.

Many [[Puranas]] tell Krishna's life-story or some  highlights from it. Two Puranas, the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',  that contain the most elaborate telling of Krishna’s story and  teachings are the most theologically venerated by the [[Vaishnava]] schools.&lt;ref name = &quot;Elkman1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Life==
This summary is based on details  from the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'', the ''[[Harivamsa]]'',  the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]''.  The scenes from the narrative are set in north [[India]], mostly in the present states of [[Uttar Pradesh]],  [[Bihar]],  [[Haryana]],  [[Delhi]]  and [[Gujarat]].

===Birth===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Krishna Carried Across the River.jpg|thumb|Krishna Carried Across the River]]
According to [[Bhagavata Purana]], Krishna was born without a sexual union, but by divine &quot;mental transmission&quot; from the mind of Vasudeva into the womb of Devaki. Based on  scriptural details and [[Jyotisha|astrological calculations]] the date of Krishna's birth, known as [[Krishna Janmashtami|Janmashtami]],&lt;ref name = Knott61&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; is 18 July 3228 BCE and departed on 3102 BCE. Krishna belonged to the [[Vrishni]] clan of [[Yadava]]s from [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]],&lt;ref&gt;Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.105-107.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the eighth son born to the princess [[Devaki]], and her husband [[Vasudeva]].

Mathura (in present day [[Mathura district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]) was the capital of  the [[Yadava]]s, to which Krishna's parents Vasudeva and Devaki belonged. King [[Kamsa|Kansa]], Devaki's brother,&lt;ref&gt;According to the Bhagavata and Vishnu  Puranas, but in some Puranas like Devi-Bhagavata-Purana, her paternal uncle. See the Vishnu-Purana Book V Chapter 1, translated by H. H. Wilson, (1840), the Srimad  Bhagavatam, translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, (1988) copyright Bhaktivedanta Book Trust&lt;/ref&gt; had ascended the  throne by imprisoning his father, King [[Ugrasena]]. Afraid of a [[prophecy]] from a divine voice from the heavens that predicted his death at the  hands of [[Devaki]]'s eighth &quot;garbha&quot;, Kansa had the couple locked into a prison cell. After Kansa killed the first six children, Devaki apparently had a miscarriage of the seventh. However in reality, the womb was actually transferred to Rohini secretly. This was how [[Balarama]], Krishna's elder brother was born. Once again Devaki became pregnant. Now due to the miscarriage, Kamsa was in a puzzle regarding 'The Eighth One' but his ministers advised that the divine voice from the heavens emphasised &quot;the eight garbha&quot; and so this is the one. That night Krishna was born in the Rohini [[nakshatra]] and simultaneously Goddess Durga was born as Yogamaya in Gokulam to Nanda and Yashoda. 

Since Vasudeva knew Krishna's life was in danger, Krishna was secretly taken out of the prison cell to be  raised by his foster parents, [[Yasoda]] &lt;ref name=&quot;yashoda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/sss/ho_1982.220.8.htm |title=Yashoda and Krishna |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2011-10-10 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], in [[Gokul]]a (in present day [[Mathura district]]). Two of his other siblings also survived, [[Balarama]]  (Devaki's seventh child, transferred to the womb of [[Rohini Devi|Rohini]], Vasudeva's first wife) and [[Subhadra]] (daughter of Vasudeva and Rohini,  born much later than Balarama and Krishna).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=124–130,224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and youth===
[[File:Krishna Holding Mount Govardhan - Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Krishna holding [[Govardhan hill]] as depicted in [[Pahari painting]]]]
Nanda was the head of a community of cow-herders,  and he settled in [[Vrindavana]].  The stories of Krishna's childhood and youth tell how he became a cow  herder,&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]],  ''[http://www.swami.org/pages/sanga/1999/1999_17.php  Gopastami]'', ''[http://swami.org/pages/sanga/current.php  Sanga]'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; his  mischievous pranks as ''Makhan  Chor'' (butter thief), his  foiling of attempts to take his life, and his role as a protector of the  people of Vrindavana.

Krishna killed the demoness like Putana, disguised as a wet nurse, sent by Kansa for Krishna's life. He tamed the serpent [[Kāliyā]], who previously poisoned the  waters of [[Yamuna]]  river, thus leading to the death of the cowherds. In Hindu art, Krishna  is often depicted dancing on the multi-hooded Kāliyā.

Krishna lifted the [[Govardhana hill]]  and taught [[Indra]],  the king of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and rain, a lesson to protect  native people of Vrindavana from persecution by Indra and prevent the  devastation of the pasture land of Govardhan. Indra had too much pride  and was angry when Lord Krishna advised the people of Vrindavana to take care  of their animals and their environment that provide them with all their  necessities, instead of worshipping Indra annually by spending their resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;UC&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In Bhagavat Purana, Lord Krishna says that the rain came from the nearby hill Govardhana, and advised that the people worshiped the hill instead of Indra. This made Indra furious, so he punished them by sending out a great storm. Lord Krishna then lifted Govardhan and held it over the people like an umbrella.

The  stories of his play with the [[gopi]]s (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, especially Radha (daughter of Vrishbhanu, one of the original residents of Vrindavan) became  known as the ''[[Rasa lila]]'' and were romanticised in the poetry  of [[Jayadeva]],  author of the [[Gita Govinda]].  These became important as part of the development of the Krishna [[bhakti]] traditions worshiping [[Radha Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===The prince===
[[File:Krishna Rukmini Satyabhama Garuda.jpg|thumb|Krishna with his two principal queens. (From left) [[Rukmini]], Krishna, [[Satyabhama]] and his vahana [[Garuda]].]]
On his return to Mathura as a young man, Krishna overthrew and killed his maternal uncle, Kansa, after avoiding several assassination attempts from Kansa's followers. He reinstated Kansa's father, [[Ugrasena]], as the king of the Yadavas and became a leading prince at the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he became a friend of [[Arjuna]] and the other [[Pandava]] princes of the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] kingdom, who were his cousins. Later, he took his Yadava subjects to the city of [[Dvārakā|Dwaraka]] (in modern [[Gujarat]]) and established his own kingdom there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna  married [[Rukmini]], the [[Vidarbha]] princess, by abducting her, at her request, from her proposed wedding with [[Shishupala]]. Krishna subsequently married 16,100 maidens who were held captive by [[asura|demon]] [[Narakasura]], to save their honour.&lt;ref&gt;Charudeva  Shastri, Suniti Kumar Chatterji(1974) [http://books.google.com/books?id=WiAhAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=16108+wives&amp;dq=16108+wives  Charudeva Shastri Felicitation Volume, p.  449]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David L.

According to social custom of the time, all of the captive women were degraded, and would be unable to marry, as they had been under the Narakasura's control. However  Krishna married them to reinstate their status in the society. This symbolic wedding with 16,100 abandoned daughters was more of a mass women rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vaishnava  traditions, Krishna's wives are forms of the goddess [[Lakshmi]]— consort of Vishnu, or special [[jiva|souls]] who attained this qualification  after many lifetimes of [[tapasya|austerity]],  while his queen Satyabhama, is an expansion of [[Radha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2006|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Yudhisthira was assuming the title of emperor, he had invited all the great kings to the ceremony and while paying his respects to them, he started with Krishna because he considered Krishna to be the greatest of them all. While it was a unanimous feeling amongst most present at the ceremony that Krishna should get the first honours, his cousin [[Shishupala]] felt otherwise and started berating Krishna. Due to a vow given to Shishupal's mother, Krishna forgave a hundred verbal abuses by Shishupal, and upon the one hundred and first, he assumed his Virat (universal) form and killed Shishupal with his [[Chakra]]. The blind king [[Dhritarashtra]] also obtained divine vision during this time to be able to see the Lord's form. Essentially, Shishupal and [[Dantavakra]] were both re-incarnations of Lord Vishnu's gate-keepers [[Jaya-Vijaya|Jaya and Vijaya]], who were cursed to be born on Earth, to be delivered by the Lord back to Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mantraonnet.com/shopping/comic-books/gods/krishna-shishupal.html |title=Krishna &amp; Shishupal |publisher=Mantraonnet.com |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurukshetra War and Bhagavad Gita===
{{Main|Kurukshetra War|Bhagavad Gita}}
[[File:Krishna Mediating between the Pandavas and Kauravas.jpeg|thumb|Krishna Mediating between the Pandavas and Kauravas]]
Once  battle seemed inevitable, Krishna offered both sides the opportunity to  choose between having either his army called [[narayani sena]] or himself alone, but on the condition that he personally would not raise any weapon. Arjuna, on  behalf of the Pandavas, chose to have Krishna on their side, and [[Duryodhana]],  Kaurava prince, chose Krishna's army. At the time of the great battle, Krishna acted as Arjuna's charioteer, since this position did not require the wielding of weapons.

Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart does not allow him to fight and he would rather prefer to renounce the kingdom. and put down his ''[[Gandiva|Gandiv]]'' (Arjuna's bow).  Krishna then advises him about the battle, with the conversation soon extending into a discourse which was later compiled as the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, by Robert N.  Minor in {{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avatars of Vishnu.jpg|thumb|left|Krishna displays his Vishvarupa  (Universal Form) to [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield of [[Kurukshetra]].]]
Krishna asked Arjuna, &quot;Have you within no time, forgotten the Kauravas' evil deeds such as not accepting the eldest brother Yudhishtira as King, usurping the entire Kingdom without yielding any portion to the Pandavas, meting out insults and difficulties to Pandavas, attempt to murder the Pandavas in the [[Barnava]] lac guest house, publicly disrobing and disgracing Draupadi. Krishna further exhorted in his famous Bhagaad Gita, &quot;Arjuna, do not engage in philosophical analyses at this point of time like a Pundit. You are aware that Duryodhana and Karna particularly have long harboured jealousy and hatred for you Pandavas and badly want to prove their hegemony. You are aware that Bhishmacharya and your Teachers are tied down to their dharma of protecting the unitarian power of the Kuru throne. Moreover, you Arjuna, are only a mortal appointee to carry out my divine will, since the Kauravas are destined to die either way, due to their heap of sins. Open your eyes O Bhaarata and know that I encompass the Karta, Karma and Kriya, all in myself. There is no scope for contemplation now or remorse later, it is indeed time for war and the world will remember your might and immense powers for time to come. So rise O Arjuna!, tighten up your Gandiva and let all directions shiver till their farthest horizons, by the reverbration of its string.
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Wajangpop van karbouwenhuid voorstellende Prabu Kresna TMnr 809-163e.jpg|thumb|right|Krishna in [[Balinese art|Balinese]] [[Wayang]] form]]
Krishna had a profound effect on the Mahabharata war and its consequences.  He considered the Kurukshetra war as a last resort by voluntarily making himself as a messenger in order to establish peace between the Pandavas and Kauravas.  But, once these peace negotiations failed and was embarked into the war, then he became a clever strategist. During the war, upon becoming angry with Arjun for not fighting in true spirit against his ancestors, Krishna once picked up a carriage wheel and converted it to a [[Chakra]] (discus) to challenge [[Bhishma]] when the latter injured him. Upon seeing this, Bhishma dropped his weapons and asked Krishna to kill him. However, Arjuna apologized to Krishna, promising that he would fight with full dedication here/after, and the battle continued. Krishna had directed [[Yudhisthira]] and Arjuna to return to Bhishma the boon of &quot;victory&quot; which he had given to Yudhisthira before the war commenced, since he himself was standing in their way to victory. Bhishma understood the message and told them the means through which he would drop his weapons—which was if a woman entered the battlefield. Next day, upon Krishna's directions, [[Shikhandi]] ([[Amba (Mahabharata)|Amba]] reborn) accompanied Arjuna to the battlefield and thus, Bhishma laid down his arms. This was a decisive moment in the war because Bhishma was the chief commander of the Kaurava army and the most formidable warrior on the battlefield. Krishna aided Arjuna in killing [[Jayadratha]], who had held the other four Pandava brothers at bay while Arjuna's son [[Abhimanyu]] entered [[Drona]]'s [[Padmavyuha|Chakravyuha]] formation—an effort in which he got killed by the simultaneous attack of eight Kaurava warriors. Krishna also caused the downfall of Drona, when he signalled [[Bhima]] to kill an elephant called [[Ashwatthama]], the namesake of Drona's son. Pandavas started shouting that Ashwatthama was dead but Drona refused to believe them saying he would believe it only if he heard it from Yudhisthira. Krishna knew that Yudhisthira would never tell a lie, so he devised a clever ploy so that Yudhisthira wouldn't lie and at the same time Drona would be convinced of his son's death. On asked by Drona, Yudhisthira proclaimed {{quote|''Ashwathama Hatahath, naro va Kunjaro va''}} i.e. Ashwathama had died but he was nor sure whether it was a Drona's son or an elephant. But as soon as Yudhisthira had uttered the first line, Pandava army on Krishna's direction broke into celebration with drums and conchs, in the din of which Drona could not hear the second part of the Yudhisthira's declaration and assumed that his son indeed was dead. Overcome with grief he laid down his arms, and on Krishna's instruction [[Dhrishtadyumna]] beheaded Drona.
[[File:KRISHNA BREAKS HIS VOW.jpg|150px|thumb|Krishna breaks his vow]]
When Arjuna was fighting [[Karna]], the latter's chariot's wheels sank into the ground. While Karna was trying to take out the chariot from the grip of the Earth, Krishna reminded Arjuna how Karna and the other Kauravas had broken all rules of battle while simultaneously attacking and killing Abhimanyu, and he convinced Arjuna to do the same in revenge in order to kill Karna. During the final stage of the war, when [[Duryodhana]] was going to meet his mother [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]] for taking her blessings which would convert all parts of his body on which her sight falls to steel, Krishna tricks him to wearing banana leaves to hide his groin. When Duryodhana meets Gandhari, her vision and blessings fall on his entire body except his groin and thighs, and she becomes unhappy about it because she was not able to convert his entire body to steel. When Duryodhana was in a mace-fight with Bhima, Bhima's blows had no effect on Duryodhana. Upon this, Krishna reminded Bhima of his vow to kill Duryodhana by hitting him on the thigh, and Bhima did the same to win the war despite it being against the rules of mace-fight (since Duryodhana had himself broken [[Dharma]] in all his past acts). Thus, Krishna's unparalleled strategy helped the Pandavas win the Mahabharata war by bringing the downfall of all the chief Kaurava warriors, without lifting any weapon. He also brought back to life Arjuna's grandson [[Parikshit]], who had been attacked by a [[Brahmastra]] weapon from Ashwatthama while he was in his mother's womb. Parikshit became the Pandavas' successor.

===Family===
[[File:Krishna and pradyumna.jpg|thumb|left|text|Krishna and Pradyumna battle the demon Nikumbha who assumes the form of bird]]

Krishna had a total of 16,108 wives, out of which eight were his princely wives and 16,100 were rescued from Narakasura, who had forcibly kept them in his palace. After Krishna killed Narkasura he rescued these 16,100 women and freed them, but all of them returned to him saying that they have been kept by Narkasura so now neither their family will accept them nor will any one marry them, thus remaining shelterless. Krishna married them and gave them shelter in his new palace and a respectful place in the society &lt;ref&gt;B. R. Kishore, Lord Krishna, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hamilton, Genealogies of the Hindus extracted from Sacred Texts, page 123, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The first son of Queen Rukmini was [[Pradyumna]], and also born of her were Charudeshna, Sudeshna and the powerful Charudeha, along with Sucharu, Chharugupta, Bhadracaru, Charuchandra, Vicaru and Caru, the tenth. Pradyumna fathered the greatly powerful [[Aniruddha]] in the womb of [[Rukmavati]], the daughter of Rukmi. This took place while they were living in the city of [[Bhojakata]].
[[File:Krishna flute suchindram temple car carving.jpg|thumb|upright|Temple car carving of Krishna playing flute with Radha, suchindram, Tamil Nadu]]
The ten sons of Satyabhama were Bhanu, Subhanu, Svarbhanu, Prabhanu, Bhanuman, Chandrabhanu, Brihadbhanu, Atibhanu (the eighth), Sribhanu and Pratibhanu.

[[Samba (Krishna's son)|Samba]], Sumitra, Purujit, Satajit, Sahasrajit, Vijaya, Citraketu, Vasuman, Dravida and Kratu were the sons of [[Jambavati]]. These ten, headed by [[Samba (Krishna's son)|Samba]], were their father's favorites.

The sons of Nagnajiti were Vira, Candra, Asvasena, Citragu, Vegavan, Vrisha, Ama, Sanku, Vasu and the opulent Kunti.

Sruta, Kavi, Vrisha, Vira, Subahu, Bhadra, Santi, Darsa and Purnamasa were sons of Kalindi. Her youngest son was Somaka.

Madra's sons were Praghosha, Gatravan, Simha, Bala, Prabala, Urdhaga, Mahasakti, Saha, Oja and Aparajita.

Mitravinda's sons were Vrika, Harsha, Anila, Gridhra, Vardhana, Unnada, Mahamsa, Pavana, Vahni and Kshudhi.

Sangramajit, Brihatsena, Sura, Praharana, Arijith, Jaya and Subhadra were the sons of Bhadra, together with Vama, Ayur and Satyaka.

Diptiman, Tamratapta and others were the sons of Lord Krishna and Rohini.

According to Mahabharata, the Kurukshetra war resulted in the death of all 100 sons of Gandhari. On the night before Duryodhana's death, Lord Krishna visited Gandhari to offer his condolences. Gandhari felt that Krishna knowingly did not put an end to the war, and in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari cursed that Krishna, along with everyone else from [[yadu]] dynasty, will perish after 36 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happywink.org/janmashtami/lord-krishna-disappearance.html |title=Lord Krishna's Disappearance, Disappearance of Lord Krishna, Life Span of Lord Krishn, Disappearance of Sri Krishna |publisher=Happywink.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBReLkDv94l ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urday.in/mkrishnaheaven.htm |title=MAHABHARATA -Krishna`s Return to Heaven |publisher=Urday.in |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a festival, a fight broke out between the [[Yadava]]s, who killed each other. His elder brother, [[Balarama]], then gave up his body using [[Yoga]]. Krishna retired into the forest and started meditating under a tree. The Mahabharata also narrates the story of a hunter who kills Krishna. The hunter Jara, mistook Krishna's partly visible left foot for that of a deer, and shot an arrow, wounding and killing him mortally. After he realised the mistake, Lord Krishna told Jara, &quot;O Jara, you were Vaali in your previous birth, killed by myself as Rama in Tretayuga. Here you had a chance to even it and since all acts in this world are done as desired by me, you need not worry for this&quot;. Krishna's soul then ascended to heaven, while his mortal body was cremated by Arjuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m16/m16004.htm|title=  The Mahabharata (originally published between 1883 and  1896)|accessdate=2008-10-13|work= book|publisher= Sacred Texts|date= 2006 -  digitized|author = Kisari Mohan Ganguli|chapter = Book 16: Mausala Parva Sections 4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 0-8426-0822-2|authorlink =Vettam Mani|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Purana|Puranic sources]],&lt;ref&gt;The Bhagavata Purana (1.18.6), Vishnu Purana  (5.38.8), and Brahma Purana (212.8), the day Krishna left the earth was the day that the Dvapara Yuga ended and the Kali Yuga  began.&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna's disappearance marks the end of [[Dvapara Yuga]]  and the start of [[Kali Yuga]],  which is dated to February 17/18, 3102 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;See: Matchett, Freda, ''&quot;The  Puranas&quot;'', p 139 and Yano,  Michio, ''&quot;Calendar,  astrology and astronomy&quot;'' in {{Cite book|last=Flood| first=Gavin (Ed)|  year=2003| title=Blackwell companion to Hinduism| place=| publisher= [[Blackwell Publishing]]| edition=| isbn=0-631-21535-2|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaishnava  teachers such as [[Ramanujacharya]]  and [[Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] held the view that the body of Krishna is completely spiritual and never decays (Achyuta) as this appears to be the perspective of the [[Bhagavata Purana]].  The great Vaishnava Saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu exhorted, &quot;Krishna Naama Sankirtan&quot; i.e. the constant chanting of the Lord's name is the supreme healer in [[Kali Yuga]]. It destroys sins and purifies the hearts through Bhakti ensures universal peace.

Krishna never appears to grow old or age at all in the historical depictions of the [[Puranas]] despite passing of several decades, but there are grounds for a debate whether this indicates that he has no material body, since battles and other descriptions of the Mahabhārata epic show clear indications that he seems to be subject to the limitations of nature.&lt;ref name = Sutton&gt;Sutton (2000) pp.174-175&lt;/ref&gt;  While battles apparently seem to indicate limitations, Mahabharata also shows in many places where Krishna is not subject to any limitations as through episodes Duryodhana trying to arrest Krishna where his body burst into fire showing all creation within him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05131.htm|title=  The Mahabharata, Book 5: Udyoga Parva: Bhagwat Yana Parva: section  CXXXI (originally published between 1883 and 1896)|accessdate=2008-10-13 |work=  book|publisher= Sacred Texts|date= 2006 - digitized|author =  Kisari Mohan  Ganguli}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krishna is also explicitly described as without deterioration elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05131.htm|title=  The Mahabharata, Book 5: Udyoga Parva: Bhagwat Yana Parva: section  CXXX(originally published between 1883 and 1896)|accessdate=2008-10-13 |work=  book|publisher= Sacred Texts|date= 2006 - digitized|author =  Kisari Mohan  Ganguli}} &quot;Knowest thou not sinless Govinda, of terrible prowess and incapable of  deterioration?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rasa Lila in Manipuri dance style.jpg|thumb|''[[Rasa lila|Rasa Lila]]'' in [[Manipuri dance]] style.]]
The  worship of Krishna is part of [[Vaishnavism]], which regards [[Vishnu]] as the [[Supreme God]] and venerates His associated  [[Avatar]]s, their consorts, and related saints and teachers. Krishna is especially looked upon as a full manifestation of Vishnu, and as one with Vishnu himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Dowson  |title=Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography,  History and Literature |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location=  |year=2003 |page= 361|isbn=0-7661-7589-8| url = http://books.google.com/?id=6JB-KOXy5k8C&amp;pg=PA361&amp;dq=Vishnu+Sahasranama+Krishna}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the exact relationship between Krishna and Vishnu is complex and diverse,&lt;ref name = Beck&gt;See Beck, Guy, ''&quot;Introduction&quot;'' in {{Harvnb|Beck|2005|pp=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Krishna is sometimes considered an independent deity, supreme in  his own right.&lt;ref name=Knott55&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|2000|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of many deities, Krishna is particularly important, and traditions of Vaishnava lines are generally centered either on Vishnu or on Krishna, as supreme. The term Krishnaism has been used to describe the sects of Krishna, reserving term &quot;Vaishnavism&quot; for sects focusing on Vishnu in which Krishna is an [[Avatar]], rather than as a transcendent Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996)  p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The deity ''Krishna-Vasudeva'' (''{{IAST|kṛṣṇa  vāsudeva}}''  &quot;Krishna, the son of [[Vasudeva]]&quot;) is historically one of the earliest forms of worship in [[Krishnaism]] and [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name =  &quot;Cultofgopal&quot;&gt;{{cite web

According to historical testimonies Krishna-Vasudeva worship already flourished in and around Mathura several centuries before Christ. A second important element is the cult of Krishna Govinda. Still later is the worship of Bala-Krishna, the Child Krishna—a quite prominent feature of modern Krishnaism. The last element seems to have been Krishna Gopijanavallabha, Krishna the lover of the Gopis, among whom Radha occupies a special position. In some books Krishna is presented as the founder and first teacher of the Bhagavata religion.

===Bhakti tradition===
{{Main|Bhakti yoga}}
Bhakti, meaning devotion, is not confined to any one deity. However Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotional and ecstatic aspects of Hindu religion, particularly among the [[Vaishnava]] sects.&lt;ref  name = McDaniel/&gt;&lt;ref name =  &quot;Klostermaier1974&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the [[lila (divine play)|concept of ''lila'']],  meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the Universe. The ''lilas'' of Krishna, with their expressions of  personal love that transcend the boundaries of formal reverence, serve  as a counterpoint to the actions of another avatar of Vishnu: [[Rama]], &quot;He of the straight and narrow  path of ''maryada,'' or rules and regulations.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kennedy1925&quot;/&gt;

The bhakti movements devoted to Krishna became prominent in southern India in the 7th to 9th centuries AD. The earliest works included those of the [[Alvars|Alvar]] saints of the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] country.&lt;ref name=Vaudeville1962&gt;{{cite journal

===Spread of the Krishna-bhakti movement===
[[File:Westindischer Maler um 1550 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gita Govinda]]  by [[Jayadeva]].]]
The movement  spread rapidly from northern India into the south, with the [[Sanskrit]] poem ''[[Gita Govinda]]''  of [[Jayadeva]]  (12th century AD) becoming a landmark of devotional, Krishna-based  literature. It elaborated a part of the Krishna legend—his love for one particular [[gopi]], called  [[Radha]], a minor character in ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' but a major one in other texts like ''[[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]]''.  By the influence of ''Gita  Govinda'', Radha became  inseparable from devotion to Krishna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahony1987&quot;/&gt;

While the learned sections of  the society well versed in Sanskrit could enjoy works like ''Gita Govinda'' or  Bilvamangala 's '' Krishna-Karnamritam '',  the masses sang the songs of the devotee-poets, who composed in the regional  languages of India. These songs expressing intense personal devotion  were written by devotees from all walks of life. The songs of [[Meera]] and [[Surdas]] became epitomes of Krishna-devotion in  north India.

[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|Krishna (left) with the flute with  gopi-consort  Radha, [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]], [[Watford]], England]]
These devotee-poets, like the Alvars before them, were  aligned to specific theological schools only loosely, if at all. But by  the 11th century AD, [[Vaishnava]]  Bhakti schools with elaborate theological frameworks around the worship  of Krishna were established in north India. [[Nimbarka]] (11th century AD), [[Vallabhacharya]] (15th century AD) and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (16th century AD) were the founders of the most influential schools. These schools, namely [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], [[Vallabha Sampradaya]] and [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] respectively, see Krishna as the supreme god, rather than an avatar, as generally seen.

In the [[Deccan]], particularly in [[Maharashtra]],  saint poets of the [[Varkari]]  sect such as [[Dnyaneshwar]],  [[Namdev]],  [[Janabai]],  [[Eknath]]  and [[Tukaram]]  promoted the worship of [[Vithoba]],&lt;ref name = &quot;vithoba&quot;/&gt; a local form of  Krishna, from the beginning of the 13th century until the late 18th  century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahony1987&quot;/&gt; In southern  India, [[Purandara Dasa]]  and [[Kanakadasa]]  of [[Karnataka]] composed songs devoted to the Krishna image of [[Udupi]]. [[Rupa Goswami]] of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, has  compiled a comprehensive summary of bhakti named  Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu .&lt;ref  name = &quot;Klostermaier1974&quot;/&gt;

===In the West===
Since 1966, the Krishna-bhakti movement has also spread outside India. This is largely due to the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot; /&gt; The movement was founded by [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], who was instructed by his [[guru]], [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]], to write about Krishna in English and to share the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] philosophy with people in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;''Srila Prabhupada - He Built a House in which the whole world can live, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, 1984, ISBN 0-89213-133-0'' page xv&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the performing arts==
[[File:Kathakali of kerala.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Kathakali]] performer as Krishna]]
While discussing the  origin of [[Indian theatre]], Horwitz talks about the mention of the Krishna story in [[Patanjali]]'s [[Mahabhashya]] (c. 150 BC), where the episodes  of slaying of Kamsa (Kamsa Vadha) and &quot;Binding of the heaven storming  titan&quot; (Bali Bandha) are described.&lt;ref&gt;Varadpande  p.231&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhasa]]'s ''Balacharitam'' and ''Dutavakyam'' (c. 400 BC) are the only [[Sanskrit]] plays centered on Krishna written  by a major classical dramatist. The former dwells only on his childhood exploits and the latter is a one-act play based on a single episode from  the ''Mahābhārata'' when Krishna tries to make peace  between the warring cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Varadpande  p.232-3&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 10th century AD, with the growing [[bhakti movement]],  Krishna became a favorite subject of the arts. The songs of the ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' became popular across India, and had  many imitations. The songs composed by the Bhakti poets added to the  repository of both folk and classical singing.

The [[classical Indian dance]]s, especially [[Odissi dance|Odissi]] and [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], draw heavily on the story. The '[[Rasa lila]]' dances performed in [[Vrindavan]] shares elements with [[Kathak]], and the [[Krisnattam]], with some cycles, such as Krishnattam, traditionally restricted to the [[Guruvayur temple]], the precursor of [[Kathakali]].&lt;ref name=Zarrilli2000&gt;{{cite book

|year = 2000
|title = Kathakali Dance-Drama: Where Gods and Demons Come to Play

|page = 246
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sattriya]] dance, founded by the [[Assam]]ese Vaishnava saint [[Srimanta Sankardeva|Sankardeva]], extols the virtues of Krishna.  Medieval [[Maharashtra]]  gave birth to a form of storytelling known as the ''Hari-Katha'', that told Vaishnava tales and  teachings through music, dance, and narrative sequences, and the story  of Krishna one of them. This tradition spread to [[Tamil Nadu]] and other southern states, and is  now popular in many places throughout India.

Narayana Tirtha's  (17th century AD) ''Krishna-Lila-Tarangini'' provided material for the musical  plays of the ''Bhagavata-Mela'' by telling the tale of Krishna from  birth until his marriage to [[Rukmini]]. [[Tyagaraja]] (18th century AD) wrote a similar  piece about Krishna called ''Nauka-Charitam''.  The narratives of Krishna from the Puranas are performed in [[Yakshagana]],  a performance style native to [[Karnataka]]'s coastal districts. Many movies  in all Indian languages have been made based on these stories. These are  of varying quality and usually add various songs, melodrama, and  special effects.

==In other religions==
===Jainism===
{{Further|Salakapurusa}}
The most exalted figures in  Jainism are the twenty-four Tirthankaras. Krishna, when he was incorporated  into the [[Jain]]  list of heroic figures presented a problem with his activities which  are not pacifist or non-violent. The concept of Baladeva, Vasudeva and Prati-Vasudeva was  used to solve it. The Jain list of sixty-three Shalakapurshas or notable figures  includes amongst others, the twenty-four Tirthankaras and nine sets of this  triad. One of these triads is Krishna as the Vasudeva, Balarama as the  Baladeva and Jarasandha as the Prati-Vasudeva. He was a cousin of the twenty-second  Tirthankara, Neminatha. The stories of these triads can be found in the ''Harivamsha'' of Jinasena (not be confused with its  namesake, the addendum to ''Mahābhārata'')  and the ''Trishashti-shalakapurusha-charita'' of Hemachandra.&lt;ref name = Jer&gt;See Jerome H.

In  each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a Vasudeva with an elder  brother termed the Baladeva. The villain is the Prati-vasudeva.  Baladeva is the upholder of the Jain principle of non-violence. However, Vasudeva has to forsake this principle to kill the Prati-Vasudeva and  save the world.

These details resemble that of the story given in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].  Vasudeva, along with his nine other brothers (each son a powerful  wrestler) and one elder sister (Anjana) capture all of [[Jambudvipa]]  (many consider this to be India) after beheading their evil uncle, King  [[Kamsa]],  and later all other kings of Jambudvipa with his [[Sudarshana Chakra]].  Much of the story involving the defeat of [[Kamsa]] follows the story given in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref name=Jaiswal&gt;{{cite  journal

As depicted in the [[Mahābhārata]], all of the sons are eventually killed due to a curse of sage Kanhadipayana ([[Veda Vyasa]], also known as Krishna Dwaipayana). Krishna himself is eventually speared by a hunter in the foot by mistake, leaving the sole survivor of their family being their sister, Anjanadevi of whom no further mention is made.&lt;ref name=Hiltebeitel1990&gt;{{cite book

Since  Jataka tales are given from the perspective of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s  previous lives (as well as the previous lives of many of Buddha's  followers), Krishna appears as one of the lives of [[Sariputra]], one of Buddha's foremost  disciples and the &quot;Dhammasenapati&quot; or &quot;Chief General of the Dharma&quot; and  is usually shown being Buddha's &quot;right hand man&quot; in Buddhist art and  iconography.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel090.html#turner  The Turner of the Wheel]''.  The Life of Sariputta, compiled and translated from the Pali texts by  Nyanaponika Thera&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bodhisattva]], is born in this tale as one of  his youngest brothers named Ghatapandita, and saves Krishna from the  grief of losing his son.&lt;ref name=Law1941/&gt;  The 'divine boy' Krishna as an embodiment of wisdom and endearing  prankster forms a part of worshipable pantheon in Japanese Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ismailia Muslim Faith===
According to the [[Ismailism|Ismailia]] sect of [[Islam]], Krishna was a &quot;[[Manifestation of God]]&quot;. In [[Aga Khan III]]'s famous book ''[[Islam is the religion of my ancestor]]'', Krishna and [[Shri Ram]] were prophets of God for the people of India.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

===Bahá'í Faith===
Bahá'ís believe that Krishna was  a &quot;[[Manifestation of God]]&quot;, or one in a line of prophets who  have revealed the Word of God progressively for a gradually maturing humanity. In this way, Krishna shares an exalted station with [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Muhammad]], [[Jesus]], the [[Báb]], and the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Manifestations of God |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=  Esslemont, J.E. |authorlink=John Esslemont |year= 1980 |title=  Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition= 5th |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing  Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn= 0-87743-160-4 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/je/BNE/bne-6.html#gr5  |page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadiyya Islam===
Members of the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Community]] believe Krishna to be a great prophet of God as described by their founder, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]]. Ghulam Ahmad also claimed to be the likeness of Krishna as a latter day reviver of religion and morality whose mission was to reconcile man with God.&lt;ref  name = Sialkot&gt;{{cite book | title = Lecture Sialkot |  first = Mirza Ghulam | last = Ahmad | publisher = Islam International Publications Ltd. | location = Tilford | year = 2007 |isbn = 1-85372-917-5 | url = http://alislam.org/library/books/LectureSialkot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadis  maintain that the term ''Avatar'' is synonymous with the term  'prophet' of the middle eastern religious tradition as God's  intervention with man; as God appoints a man as his vicegerent upon earth. In ''Lecture  Sialkot'', Ghulam Ahmed wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let it be clear that Raja Krishna, according to what has been revealed to me, was such a truly great man that it is hard to find his like among the Rishis and Avatars of the Hindus. He was an Avatar—i.e., Prophet—of his time upon whom the Holy Spirit would descend from God. He was from God, victorious and  prosperous. He cleansed the land of the Aryas from sin and was in fact the Prophet of his age whose teaching was later corrupted in numerous ways. He was full of love for God, a friend of virtue and an enemy of evil.&lt;ref name = Sialkot/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Krishna is also called Murli Dhar. The flute of Krishna means the flute of revelation and not the physical flute. Krishna lived like humans and he was a prophet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krishna|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_1.html|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth|title=Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth|publisher=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Krishna worship or reverence has  been adopted by several [[new religious movements]] since the 19th century, and he is  sometimes a member of an eclectic pantheon in [[occult]] texts, along with [[Greek mythology|Greek]],  [[Buddhist]],  [[Bible|Biblical]]  and even historical figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Harvey |first= D.
