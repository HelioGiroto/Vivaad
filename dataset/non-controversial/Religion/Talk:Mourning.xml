==2004==
Mourning in Islam is missing in this website...The tragedy of Kerbala, which is commemorated to this date on every 1st month of the Islamic lunar Calender.It was a tragedy when the grand son of the Holy Prophet sacrificed all he had for saving Islam.This is why Islamic New year begins with mourning for forty days remebering the tragedy of Kerbala and learning lessons for defending the truth,and being steadfast in your  duties.
I believe this very important information is missing on this website 
----
I have added the [[:Category:Other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention]] since there is no article on [[Bereavement]] or the more severe forms of mourning. Most morning is normal and not a clinic condition. --[[User:CloudSurfer|CloudSurfer]] 05:59, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Miscellaneous disorders]] ==

Mourning is now supposed to be a psychiatric disorder?  You're sad because somebody died; take a pill and make it better.  Therapists and therapism are really, really, ''really, '''really''''' scary.  -- [[User:Ihcoyc|Smerdis of Tlön]] 01:00, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)


== Stages of dealing with death ==

This article does not talk about the stages of dealing with death. I think it is like this
1st) denial
2nd) barging
3rd) anger
4th) depression
5th) acceptance

These are the physiological steps every one takes when deling with the death of a very close loved one.[[User:Ace ofgabriel|Ace ofgabriel]] 17:55, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

:See: 
:[[Kübler-Ross model]] .   It seems to me this information has more place on a page explaining 'mourning' than descriptions of Victorian dress codes. --[[Special:Contributions/78.86.146.148|78.86.146.148]] ([[User talk:78.86.146.148|talk]]) 16:21, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
KR stage model. Stage 2 is 'bargaining'. These are the stages on the K-R model for dealing with one's own approaching death I think, (or that of a a close friend/relative). And it's generally accepted now that you don't progress smoothly from one to the other, but often revisit, in a lesser form, the torments of an earlier stage. C S Lewis [[A Grief Observed]] has it fairly well described. [[User:Linuxlad|Linuxlad]] ([[User talk:Linuxlad|talk]]) 17:03, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

== Narrow in scope ==

The article, in its current state, could be renamed &quot;''Victorian'' mourning&quot; (on the other hand the article made it pretty clear that was presenting this particular influence).  It is awfully specific; no mention of [[Shiv'ah]] nor mourning in other cultures.   (The reason I thought of this was I was working on [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] practices and wondered if I could find something besides similarities with Shiv'ah.) -- [[User:Gyrofrog|Gyrofrog ]] [[User_talk:Gyrofrog|(talk)]] 19:46, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I agree, and I hope that someone with knowledge of other cultures' mourning customs steps up to the plate and adds them.  (Same way with [[funeral]]).  FWIW, shiv'ah is in fact linked in the article, if only as a see-also.  [[User:Ihcoyc|Smerdis of Tlön]] 20:19, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::Please help us add mourning customs for other cultures.  I also want to add this picture of Mary Queen of Scots [[:Image:Mary qos mourning.jpg]] in French mourning at some point. [[User:PKM|PKM]] 04:55, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:::If I am not mistaken, Muslims wear white when mourning (but I'm not sure whether this only pertains to female mourners). -- [[User:Gyrofrog|Gyrofrog ]] [[User_talk:Gyrofrog|(talk)]] 05:12, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

::::&quot;Narrow in scope&quot; - agreed, I think this article could be expanded by also examining grief/mourning like behaviour in species other than humans. e.g. Elephants have been known to spend long periods of time hanging around the carcass of deceased family members, even after the carcass has decayed down to just the bones.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Gazzarrr|Gazzarrr]] ([[User talk:Gazzarrr|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gazzarrr|contribs]]) 11:05, 24 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::::: But the article doesn't even discuss human mourning. It's more of a review of fashion. This is downright bizarre!

== Ethiopia ==

I have added a little bit about the Ethiopian ''edir'' (or ''iddir''). -- [[User:Gyrofrog|Gyrofrog ]] [[User_talk:Gyrofrog|(talk)]] 03:49, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

== United Kingdom Section - history ==
In Victorian times, &amp; maybe before I'm not sure, when a widow, or other relative progressed through the mourning period, dress codes involved the transition from entirely black to black+white. Also as the mourning period progressed from 'mourning' to 'half-mourning', first of all purple shades were added to the black as the first addition of colour into the wardrobe.  There is something about it here :
http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-half-mourning.htm &lt;br /&gt;
and here! :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_black_dress&lt;br /&gt;
&amp; see 'colors' here

== history &amp; traditions Vs current day practice ==
I think these different subjects could be better divided on this page, or maybe put on different pages ? 
How about putting most of the content on this page onto another 'history' or 'historical traditions' page. And re-focussing this one on things people do today around the world, &amp; the 'Stages of dealing with death' mentioned above. Maybe more links to (&amp; content from) these places also:&lt;br /&gt;

== Animal mourning ==

I believe their should be a section (or perhaps a whole new article) on the subject of the mourning of animals. The are several species in the animal kingdom that are known to mourn their dead (e.g. dolphins) and I think this would be a worthwhile addition.--[[User:Marcus Brute|Marcus Brute]] ([[User talk:Marcus Brute|talk]]) 17:38, 15 November 2009 (UTC)

== Expense ==

When stated in the section where mourning could be expensive the question is asked &quot;Why?&quot;  Gouging the bereft continues to this day.  Then, as now, grief could be very profitable.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mrbentley|Mrbentley]] ([[User talk:Mrbentley|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mrbentley|contribs]]) 10:48, 18 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
