==Jesus Seminar==

I actually have no problem with MerricMaker adding the basic paragraph which he did, but I do have great problems with presenting the &quot;Jesus Seminar&quot; as the consensus of mainstream scholarship, because it's not.  Please rewrite the paragraph so it isn't so laudatory, and there will be no problem. [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] 17:51, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

As per your request, I have reworked and reintroduced the passage. Please have a look at it to keep me honest, and thanks for the feedback. [[User:MerricMaker|MerricMaker]] 18:10, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

Thanks to whoever edited the section mentioned, however, I removed the &quot;liberal&quot; label applied broadly to the Jesus Seminar. There are about a hundred people in it and some of them are hardly liberal at all if you read their works outside of the Seminar itself. To be frank, there is no such thing as &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; scholarship. There is only well-founded scholarship or poorly-constructed scholarship and liberals and conservatives contribute equally to both forms. On a lighter note, I know that the Jesus Seminar was just a distillation of quite a lot of archeological work, translation, and form criticism that was going on before Funk gathered the group. If someone is familiar with that research (dare we dream that someone from United Bible Socities is paying attention?) they might strengthen this segment of the article by actually addressing the various old Gospel fragments, the Dead Sea Confetti and the like.

== historical view ==

I tried to unify this section. Since this formula is uttered by the resurrected Jesus, and the so-called &quot;historical Jesus&quot; is portrayed as not having been resurrected, the scholars who take a purely historical view of Jesus conclude that Jesus didn't say it.

==Latin==

I can have sworn that the appropriate latin phrase was &quot;In nominae pater et filius et spiritus sancti.&quot; Is the latin used in the article just the modern vulgar form? Because instead of &quot;In the names of the father, the son, and the holy spirit,&quot; it comes across more as: &quot;In the name of father(more or less), ''sons'', and the holy spirit.&quot; I wish I understood why this is so.  -me

:First off, the form ''nominae'' is impossible in Latin -- this is a third declension noun where the nominative singular is ''nomen'', the genitive singular is ''nominis'', the ablative singular is ''nomine'', etc.  The ending &quot;-ae&quot; only occurs in the nominative plural and genitive singular of the 1st declension. Also, ''pater'' and ''filius'' are in the nominative form, whereas a genitive singular case form is required here (&quot;in the name '''''OF'''''&quot;).   The genitive plural form (&quot;of the sons&quot;) would be ''filiorum''.  See [[Latin declension]]. [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] 07:22, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

== Greek ==

I notice the Greek {{lang|grc|εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος}} is in the accusative after {{lang|grc|εἰς}} implying a direction; a more literal translation would be &quot;''into'' the name of the Father etc.&quot; The Latin, on the other hand, uses the ablative after ''in'' implying static location, like the English &quot;''in'' the name of the Father&quot; etc. Would the Greek equivalent of the Latin, {{lang|grc|ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος}} (Greek {{lang|grc|ἐν}} + dative = Latin in + ablative), ever be used? —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 17:26, 15 December 2008 (UTC)

:Don't know, but it's not in the accepted Greek text of Matthew 28:19... [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 14:18, 10 December 2009 (UTC)

==Church authority for trinitarian baptisms==
The article should maybe mention the issue of Church authority for trinitarian baptisms. I think there is a historical Catholic practice of considering that all Protestant baptisms are de facto Catholic baptisms because they are trinitarian in character. This explains the development of the ecumenical movement and the absence of modern conversion efforts directed at Protestants. Hence, as it is shown in the 2007 document [[&quot;Subsistit in&quot; in Lumen Gentium]] about the ''ecclesial communities born out of the Reformation'', the Catholic Church continues to behave as if it literally owns the souls of the vast majority of Protestants in the world. This issue also applies for the Eastern Orthodox, given that the Holy Office continues to assert that the Eastern Churches are mere '' local Churches'' subjected to the authority of the Roman protos.

== Holy Ghost ==
I'm no theologian, by i'm prety sure in anglican (CoE) services &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; is used, not &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;. Shouldn't this be mentioned and explained?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/188.81.11.178|188.81.11.178]] ([[User talk:188.81.11.178|talk]]) 20:29, 4 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Only in traditional-language services. Contemporary-language services use &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;. Anyway, the place for the two terms to be discussed is at [[Holy Spirit]], not here. [[User:Angr|—Angr]] ([[User talk:Angr|talk]]) 21:12, 4 May 2011 (UTC)

:188.81.11.178 -- &quot;Ghost&quot; has distracting meanings in modern English, and should mostly only be used when directly quoting some specific document in Renaissance or imitation-Renaissance English... [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 02:04, 5 May 2011 (UTC)</text>
