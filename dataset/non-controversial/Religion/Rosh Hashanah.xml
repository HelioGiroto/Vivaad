'''Rosh Hashanah''' ({{lang-he|ראש השנה}}, literally &quot;head of the year&quot;), is the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[New Year]]. It is the first of the [[High Holy Days]] or ''Yamim Nora'im'' (&quot;Days of Awe&quot;) which usually occur in the early autumn of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Rosh Hashanah is a two day celebration which begins on the first day of [[Tishrei]], the first month of the Jewish calendar. The day is believed to be the anniversary of the creation of [[Adam and Eve]], the first man and woman, and their first actions toward the realization of mankind’s role in [[God in Judaism|God]]’s world. Rosh Hashanah customs include sounding the [[shofar]] and eating symbolic foods such as apples dipped in honey. The common greeting on Rosh Hashanah is &quot;Shanah Tovah.&quot;

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot; does not appear in the [[Torah]]. {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:24|HE}} refers to the festival of the first day of the seventh month as &quot;''Zikhron Teru'ah''&quot; (&quot;a memorial with the blowing of horns&quot;); it is also referred to in the same part of Leviticus as 'שַׁבַּת שַׁבָּתוֹן' or penultimate Sabbath or meditative rest day, and a &quot;holy day to God&quot;. These same words are commonly used in the Psalms to refer to the anointed days. {{bibleverse||Numbers|29:1|HE}} calls the festival ''Yom Teru'ah'', (&quot;Day [of] blowing [the horn]&quot;), and symbolizes a number of subjects, such as the [[Binding of Isaac]] and the [[Korban|animal sacrifice]]s that were to be performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0429.htm Numbers 29:1]&lt;/ref&gt; (The term Rosh Hashanah appears once in the Bible in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|40:1|HE}} where it means generally the time of the &quot;beginning of the year&quot; or is possibly a reference to Yom Kipur,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;&gt;Jacobs, Louis. &quot;Rosh Ha-Shanah.&quot; Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 17. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 463-466.&lt;/ref&gt; but the phrase may also refer to the month of Nissan in the spring, especially in light of {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:2|HE}} where the month of Nissan is stated as being &quot;the first month of the year&quot; and {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|45:18|HE}} where &quot;the first month&quot; unambiguously refers to Nissan, the month of Passover, as made plain by {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|45:21|HE}}.&lt;ref name=Mulder&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulder|first=Otto|title=Simon the High Priest in Sirach 50: An Exegetical Study of the Significance of Simon the High Priest As Climax to the Praise of the Fathers in Ben Sira's Concept of the History of Israel|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004123168|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In the [[Siddur]] and [[Machzor]] Rosh Hashanah is also called &quot;Yom Hazikaron&quot; (a day of remembrance), not to be confused with the [[Yom Hazikaron|modern Israeli holiday of the same name]] which falls in spring. 

The [[Hebrew]] Rosh HaShanah is etymologically related to the [[Arabic]] [[Ras as-Sanah]], the name chosen by Muslim lawmakers for the Islamic New Year, reflecting the Islamic imitation of older Jewish traditions. Other pre-Islamic mid-eastern cultures, such as Egypt, Persia and Babylon, did not use this unique name.

Rosh Hashanah marks the start of a new year in the Hebrew calendar (one of four &quot;new year&quot; observances that define various legal &quot;years&quot; for different purposes as explained in the [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Mishnah and Talmud]]). It is the new year for people, animals, and legal contracts. The [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Mishnah]] also sets this day aside as the new year for calculating calendar years, [[shmita]] and [[yovel]] years. [[Jews]] are confident that Rosh Hashanah represents either figuratively or literally God's creation [[ex nihilo]]. However, according to Rabbi [[Eleazar ben Shammua]], Rosh Hashanah commemorates the creation of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/chagim/elul/introelul.htm |title=OU on Elul |publisher=Ou.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
The [[Mishnah]] contains the second known reference to Rosh Hashanah as the &quot;day of judgment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tractate on Rosh Hashanah I,2&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|tractate on Rosh Hashanah]], it states that three books of account are opened on Rosh Hashanah, wherein the fate of the wicked, the righteous, and those of an intermediate class are recorded. The names of the righteous are immediately inscribed in the book of life, and they are sealed &quot;to live.&quot; The intermediate class are allowed a respite of ten days, until Yom Kippur, to reflect, repent and become righteous;&lt;ref&gt;Tractate on Rosh Hashanah, I,16b&lt;/ref&gt; the wicked are &quot;blotted out of the book of the living forever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;({{Bibleverse||Psalms|69:29|HE}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish liturgy]], Rosh Hashanah leads to Yom Kippur, which is described as &quot;the day of judgment&quot; (''Yom ha-Din'') and &quot;the day of remembrance&quot; (''Yom ha-Zikkaron''). Some [[midrash]]ic descriptions depict [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] as sitting upon a [[throne]], while books containing the deeds of all humanity are opened for review, and each person passes in front of Him for evaluation of his or her deeds. The Talmud provides three central ideas behind the day:

&quot;The Holy One said, 'on Rosh Hashanah recite before Me [verses of] Sovereignty, Remembrance, and Shofar blasts (''malchuyot, zichronot, shofrot''): Sovereignty so that you should make Me your King; Remembrance so that your remembrance should rise up before Me. And through what? Through the Shofar.' (Rosh Hashanah 16a, 34b)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;ArtScroll Machzor, Rosh Hashanah. Overview, p. XV.&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the prayers composed by the classical rabbinic sages for Rosh Hashanah found in all [[machzor]]im where the theme of the prayers is the strongest theme is the &quot;coronation&quot; of God as King of the universe in preparation for the acceptance of judgments that will follow on that day, symbolized as &quot;written&quot; into a Divine book of judgments, that then hang in the balance for ten days waiting for all to repent, then they will be &quot;sealed&quot; on [[Yom Kippur]]. The assumption is that everyone was sealed for life and therefore the next festival is [[Sukkot]] (Tabernacles) that is referred to as &quot;the time of our joy&quot; (''z'man simchateinu'').

==Shofar blowing==
[[File:Jemenittisk sjofar av kuduhorn.jpg|250px|right|thumb| [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite-style shofar]]]]
Laws on the form and use of the [[shofar]] and laws related to the religious services during the festival of Rosh Hashanah are described in [[Rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Mishnah]] that formed the basis of the [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|tractate &quot;Rosh HaShanah&quot;]] in both the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] and the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. This also contains the most important rules concerning the calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Mishnah/Seder Moed/Tractate Rosh Hashanah/Chapter 1/1|Tractate Rosh Hashanah 1:1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The shofar is blown in long, short and staccato blasts that follow a set sequence: 
* ''Teki'ah'' (long sound)  Numbers 10:3;
* ''Shevarim'' (3 broken sounds) Numbers 10:5;
* ''Teru'ah'' (9 short sounds)  Numbers 10:9;
* ''Teki'ah Gedolah'' (very long sound) Exodus 19:16,19;
* ''Shevarim Teru'ah'' (3 broken sounds followed by 9 short sounds).

The total number of blasts on Rosh Hashana is 100.

==Duration and timing==
{{See also|Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000–2050}}
Rosh Hashanah occurs 163 days after the first day of [[Passover]] (''Pesach''). In terms of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the earliest date on which Rosh Hashanah can fall is September 5, as happened in 1899 and will happen again in 2013. The latest date that Rosh Hashanah can occur relative to the Gregorian dates is October 5, as happened in 1967 and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Rosh Hashanah falling no earlier than September 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2010/07/an-early-rosh-hashanah-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=Rosh HaShanah and the Gregorian calendar |publisher=Oztorah.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Jewish calendar is based on the lunar cycle, so that the first day of each month originally began with the first sighting of a new moon, since the fourth century it has been arranged so that Rosh Hashanah never falls on a Wednesday, Friday, or Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/101,2160898/Why-is-Yom-Kippur-never-on-a-Sunday.html |title=Why is Yom Kippur never on a Sunday |publisher=Askmoses.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torah defines Rosh Hashanah as a one-day celebration, and since days in the Hebrew calendar begin at sundown, the beginning of Rosh Hashanah is at sundown at the end of 29 [[Elul]]. The rules of the Hebrew calendar are designed such that the first day of Rosh Hashanah will never occur on the first, fourth, or sixth day of the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish week]]&lt;ref&gt;A popular [[mnemonic]] is &quot;''lo adu rosh''&quot; (&quot;Rosh [Hashanah] is not on ''adu''&quot;), where ''adu'' has the [[gematria|numerical value]] 1-4-6 (corresponding to the numbering of days in the Jewish week, in which Saturday night and Sunday daytime make up the first day).&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday). Since the time of the destruction of the [[Second Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE and the time of Rabban [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]], [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] Jewish law appears to be that Rosh Hashanah is to be celebrated for two days, due to the difficulty of determining the date of the [[new moon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, there is some evidence that Rosh Hashanah was celebrated on a single day in Israel as late as the thirteenth century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The two days of Rosh Hashanah are said to constitute &quot;''Yoma Arichtah''&quot; (Aramaic: &quot;''one'' long day&quot;). In [[Reform Judaism]], some communities observe only the first day of Rosh Hashanah, while others observe two days. [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]], who do not recognize Rabbinic [[oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Jewish oral law]] and rely on their own understanding of the Torah, observe only one day on the first of Tishrei, since the second day is not mentioned in the [[Written Torah]].

==Pre-Rosh Hashanah customs==
The ''Yamim Nora'im'' are preceded by the month of [[Elul]], during which Jews are supposed to begin a self-examination and repentance, a process that culminates in the ten days of the ''Yamim Nora'im'' known as beginning with Rosh Hashanah and ending with the holiday of [[Yom Kippur]]. 

The ''shofar'' is traditionally blown each morning for the entire month of [[Elul]], the month preceding Rosh Hashanah. The sound of the ''shofar'' is intended to awaken the listeners from their &quot;slumbers&quot; and alert them to the coming judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah|Yad]]'', Laws of Repentance 3:4&lt;/ref&gt; The shofar is not blown on [[Shabbat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Halakha|Jewish Law]] permits the Shofar to be blown in the presence of a rabbinical court called the [[Sanhedrin]], which had not existed since ancient times. A recent group of Orthodox rabbis in [[Israel]] claiming to constitute a [[Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin|modern Sanhedrin]] held, for the first time in many years, an Orthodox shofar-blowing on Shabbat for Rosh Hashanah in 2006. [http://thesanhedrin.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=355 TheSanhedrin.net: Shofar Blowing on Shabbat] (translation of [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/766399.html Haaretz] article)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period leading up to the ''Yamim Nora'im'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], &quot;days of awe&quot;), penitential prayers, called ''[[selichot]]'', are recited.

==Rosh Hashanah eve==
The evening before Rosh Hashanah day is known as ''Erev Rosh Hashanah'' (&quot;Rosh Hashanah eve&quot;). As with Rosh Hashanah day, it falls on the 1st day of the Hebrew month of [[Tishrei]], since days of the Hebrew calendar begin at sundown. Some communities  perform [[Hatar'at nedarim]] (a nullification of vows) after the morning prayer services during the morning on the 29th of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]], which ends at sundown, when Erev Rosh Hashanah commences. The mood becomes festive but serious in anticipation of the new year and the synagogue services. Many Orthodox men immerse in a [[mikveh]] in honor of the coming day.

==Rosh Hashanah prayer service==
On Rosh Hashanah day, religious poems, called ''[[piyyut]]tim'', are added to the regular [[Jewish prayer services|services]].  A special prayer book, the [[mahzor]], is used on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (plural ''mahzorim''). A number of additions are made to the regular service, most notably an extended repetition of the [[Amidah]] prayer for both [[Shacharit]] and [[Mussaf]]. The Shofar is blown during Mussaf at several intervals. (In many synagogues, even little children come and hear the Shofar being blown.) Biblical verses are recited at each point. According to the [[Mishnah]], 10 verses (each) are said regarding kinship, remembrance, and the shofar itself, each accompanied by the blowing of the shofar. A variety of ''[[piyyut]]im'', medieval penitential prayers, are recited regarding themes of repentance. The ''Alenu'' prayer is recited during the repetition of the Mussaf [[Amidah]].

==Symbolic foods==
[[File:Ribotroshhashana.jpg|thumb|200px|Rosh Hashanah jams prepared by Libyan Jews]]
[[File:Newyear.jpg|thumb|250px|Traditional Rosh Hashanah foods: Apples and honey, pomegranates, wine for [[kiddush]]]]
Rosh Hashanah meals usually include [[apple]]s and [[honey]], to symbolize a sweet new year. Other foods with a symbolic meaning may be served, depending on local ''[[minhag]]'' (&quot;custom&quot;), such as the head of a fish (to symbolize the &quot;head&quot; of the year). 

The Sephardi and Mizrahi communities hold a &quot;Rosh Hashanah seder&quot; during which blessings are recited over a variety of symbolic dishes.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Sephardic Customs and Traditions,'' Marc Angel, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maimonfamily.com/yehi1.htm Maimon Family] Yehi Ratzones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.org/shabbat_shalom/article/segura_the_rosh_hashanah_seder/ The Orthodox Union] Yehi Ratzones&lt;/ref&gt; The blessings start with the phrase &quot;Yehi ratzon,&quot; meaning &quot;May it be thy will.&quot; In many cases, the name of the food in Hebrew or Aramaic represents a play on words or pun. The Yehi Ratson platter may include apples (dipped in honey, baked or cooked as a compote called ''mansanada''); dates; pomegranates;  black-eyed peas; pumpkin-filled pastries called ''rodanchas''; leek fritters  called ''keftedes de prasa''; beets; and a whole fish with the head intact. It is also common to eat stuffed vegetables called ''legumbres yaprakes''.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, Robert ''The Sephardic Kitchen: The Healthful Food and Rich Culture of the Mediterranean Jews'', Harper Collins, 1996, pp. 320-321, ISBN 0-06-017691-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the symbolic foods eaten are [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], [[black-eyed pea]]s, [[leek]], [[spinach]] and [[gourd]], all of which are mentioned in the [[Talmud]]. [[Pomegranate]]s are used in many traditions, to symbolize being fruitful like the pomegranate with its many seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiceand&quot;&gt;''Spice and Spirit: The Complete Kosher Jewish Cookbook, 1990, New York, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; The use of apples and honey, symbolizing a sweet year, is a late medieval [[Ashkenazi]] addition, though it is now almost universally accepted. Typically, round [[challah]] bread is served, to symbolize the cycle of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiceand&quot; /&gt; [[Gefilte fish]] and [[Lekach]] are commonly served by Ashkenazic Jews on this holiday. On the second night, new fruits are served to warrant inclusion of the [[shehecheyanu]] blessing.

==Tashlikh==
[[File:Swieto trabek I.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hasidic Jews performing [[tashlikh]] on Rosh Hashanah, painting by [[Aleksander Gierymski]], 1884]]

The ritual of [[tashlikh]] is performed on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah. Prayers are recited near natural flowing water, and one's sins are symbolically cast into the water. Many also have the custom to throw bread or pebbles into the water, to symbolize the &quot;casting off&quot; of sins. In some communities, if the first day of Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbat, ''tashlikh'' is postponed until the second day. The traditional service for ''tashlikh'' is recited individually and includes the prayer &quot;Who is like unto you, O God...And You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea&quot;, and Biblical passages including {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|11:9|HE}} (&quot;They will not injure nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be as full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea&quot;) and {{Bibleverse||Psalms|118:5-9|HE}}, 121 and 130, as well as personal prayers. Though once considered a solemn individual tradition, it has become an increasingly social ceremony practiced in groups.

==Traditional greetings==
*On the first night of Rosh Hashanah after the evening prayer, it is the Ashkenazi and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] custom to wish ''Le'shana Tova Tikoteiv Vetichoteim (Le'Alter LeChaim Tovim U'Leshalom)'' which is Hebrew for &quot;May you (immediately) be inscribed and sealed for a Good Year (and for a Good and Peaceful Life)&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Jewish-Holiday-Greetings.html |title=Jewish Holiday Greeting Chart |publisher=Patheos.com |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Shana Tova'' ({{IPA-he|ʃaˈna toˈva|pron}}) is the traditional greeting on Rosh Hashanah which in Hebrew means &quot;A Good Year.&quot; ({{lang-he|שנה טובה}})
*''Shana Tova Umetukah'' is Hebrew for &quot;A Good and Sweet Year.&quot; ({{lang-he|שנה טובה ומתוקה}})
*''Ketiva ve-chatima tovah'' which translates as &quot;May You Be Written and Sealed for a Good Year.&quot; ({{lang-he|כתיבה וחתימה טובה}})
*The formal Sephardic greeting is ''Tizku leshanim rabbot'' (&quot;may you merit many years&quot;), to which the answer is ''ne'imot ve-tovot'' (&quot;pleasant and good ones&quot;).  Less formally, people wish each other &quot;many years&quot; in the local language.
