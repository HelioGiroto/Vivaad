      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6167">I think CANON means &quot;Rules and regulation&quot;
All camera manufacturers are easy to find. Except for Canon (one of the most famous). Why must Canon be hidden in section 'Names'?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.73.157.191|88.73.157.191]] ([[User talk:88.73.157.191|talk]]) 22:20, 28 January 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The other sentence was confusing and had bad grammar. -sharon

I feel it's important to identify that canon is not merely a monotonous exercise in pattern but that content is relevant as well. - Adrienne

----
My proposed outline for the tangled musical canon section:

 (Definition)
 I. History
 II. Types of canons
  A. Number of voices
  B. Interval at which follower starts
  C. Direction in which follower moves
   1. Inversion or &quot;mirror&quot;
   2. Retrograde
  D. Mensuration and tempo canons
  E. Other types of canons
 III. Contemporary use of canons

I think this page deserves to be split into two or three articles (four, maybe).


Any sugestions? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 12:47, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I would imagine that '''Canon in D''' (aka [[Pachelbel's Canon]]) would be a frequent search. Would it be better to add a link to it here or on [[Canon_(music)]]? [[User:12.217.180.16|12.217.180.16]] 05:55, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I moved the Canon: In music section to [[Canon (music)]]. The other sections would be stub articles so they may as well stay in one article.-[[User:Hyacinth|Hyacinth]] 17:58, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Cleanup ==

I have made a rather bold edit to cleanup the page as was very difficult to find all the pages related to &quot;canon&quot; amoungst all the text and links.  Feel free to revert/comment on my edits but i have tried to keep them inline with [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation]] and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)]]. Please check i haven't cut out anything important. [[User:Johnteslade|john'''SLADE''']] [[User_talk:Johnteslade|(talk)]] 11:49, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
:I made an even bolder cleanup of your cleanup. I removed all articles that aren't really supposed to be disambiguated as well as the red links.

==Literary canon==
Isn't canon also used to indicate the collection of works by a certain author, as distinct from an imitator?  I am thinking in the context of Chaucer, Shakespeare, etc.  [[Canon (fiction)]] doesn't seem to apply here. -- [[User:MSchmahl|MSchmahl]] 02:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
:Yes. It's a distinct sense of &quot;literary canon&quot; when the definition is stated more precisely than it is here. You could expand that discussion a bit here or, if you can find something to say about it that's more than a dicdef, create the article and link it in. ''[[User:Csernica|TCC]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Csernica|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Csernica|(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

==Origin==
Should I include that the word &quot;canon&quot; is derived frokm a Greek term, perhaps borrowed from the Phoenecians; it probobly origially meant a rod or ruler for measuring objects?  Or what about that the first recorded use of the word for the authoritative list of books in the Bible came in the year 367 from Athanasius, the bisop of Alexandria in North Africa?
-paris blues

:If you're asking the world in general, then my opinion is yes to the first, but that the second belongs in [[Biblical canon]] and not this disambiguation page. ''[[User:Csernica|TCC]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Csernica|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Csernica|(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:29, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

== Disambiguation? ==

Isn't this a disambiguation page? If so, shouldn't the title say that? Someone looking for Canon_(disambiguation) will most probably not look on this page, rather be mislead to Cannon_(disambiguation) link towards the top. [[User:122.162.70.188|122.162.70.188]] 08:19, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

:Yes it is; but no, not necessarily; and no one ever looks for dab pages deliberately -- should someone end up at [[Cannon (disambiguation)]] they're looking up something else anyway. You get a situation like the current one here when no meaning of the word is sufficiently more common than the others to be the subject covered in the article without a qualifier in its title. ''[[User:Csernica|TCC]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Csernica|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Csernica|(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 10:38, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

== Religous meanings - explanation of edits ==

I have reorganized the section on religious meanings by definition to make it clearer that the concept of canon is shared by many religions.  To reduce the feeling of bias towards one particular religion, religions have been listed in alphabetical order under each definition with wiki links to each religon and to their particular understanding of &quot;canon&quot;.  I hope this will not upset anyone, but if it does, lets discuss it here.  Best to all, [[User:Egfrank|Egfrank]] 09:18, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

Additionally, during the rearranging it was clear that the textual and legal canons of many religions do not have links on this page.  If there is anyone with knowledge of these traditions (or interested in researching them), I invite you to add what you know.  Again, best to all, [[User:Egfrank|Egfrank]] 09:18, 12 October 2007 (UTC)


== Vandalism ==
Some twat deleted the page 6 days ago...Wikipedia should be on this...
undid it anyway
