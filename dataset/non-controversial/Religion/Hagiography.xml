      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11652">'''Hagiography''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|h|æ|ɡ|i|ˈ|ɒ|ɡ|r|ə|f|i}}) is the study of [[saint]]s.

From the Greek ''{{lang|el-Latn|(h)ağios}}'' (''{{lang|el|ἅγιος}}'', “holy” or “saint”) and ''{{lang|el-Latn|graphēin}}'' (''{{lang|el|γράφειν}}'', “to write”), it refers literally to writings on the subject of such [[holy]] people, and specifically to the biographies of [[saints]] and [[ecclesiastical]] leaders. The term '''hagiology''', the study of hagiography, is also current in English, though less common. This latter term, in fact, follows original Greek practice, where ''ἁγιογραφία'' refers to visual images of the saints, while their written lives (''{{lang|el|βίοι}}'' or ''{{lang|la|vitæ}}'') or the study thereof are known as ''{{lang|el|ἁγιολογία}}''.

Christian hagiographies focus on the lives, and notably the [[miracle]]s of men and women [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Roman Catholic church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]], and the [[Church of the East]]. Other religions such as [[Buddhism]],  [[Islam]]  and [[Sikhism]] also create and maintain hagiographical texts (such as the Sikh [[Janamsakhis]]) concerning saints, gurus and other individuals believed to be imbued with sacred power.

The term “hagiography” has also been used as a [[pejorative]] reference to the works of [[biography|biographers]] and [[historian]]s perceived to be uncritical or “reverential” to their subject. Nonetheless, hagiographic works, particularly those of the [[Middle Ages]], can often incorporate a valuable record of institutional and [[local history]], and evidence of popular [[cult]]s, customs, and [[tradition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, S. (2008). ''Archive and manuscripts: contents and use: using the sources'' (3rd ed.). Aberystwyth, UK: Department of Information Studies, Aberystwyth University. p. 5.20. ISBN 978-1-906214-15-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Hagiography constituted an important [[literature|literary]] [[genre]] in the [[early Christian church]], providing some informational history along with the more inspirational stories and [[legend]]. A hagiographic account of an individual saint can constitute a ''vita'' or biography, a description of the saint's deeds and/or miracles, or an account of the saint's martyrdom (a ''[[passio]]'') - or be a combination of these.

The genre of lives of the saints first came into being in the [[Roman Empire]] as legends about [[Christian]] [[martyr]]s were recorded. The dates of their deaths formed the basis of [[martyrology|martyrologies]]. In the 4th century, there were three main types of catalogs of lives of the saints:
*annual calendar catalogue, or ''[[menaion]]'' (in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''menaios'' means &quot;month&quot;) (biographies of the saints to be read at [[sermon]]s);
*''[[synaxarion]]'', or a short version of lives of the saints, arranged by dates;
*''[[paterikon]]'' (in Latin, ''pater'' means &quot;father&quot;), or biography of the specific saints, chosen by the catalog compiler.

In [[Western Europe]] hagiography was one of the more important vehicles for the study of inspirational history during the [[Middle Ages]]. The ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacob de Voragine]] compiled a great deal of mediæval hagiographic material, with a strong emphasis on miracle tales. Lives were often written to promote the cult of local or national states, and in particular to develop pilgrimages to visit [[relic]]s. The bronze [[Gniezno Doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]] in Poland are the only [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] doors in Europe to feature the life of a saint. The life of Saint [[Adalbert of Prague]], who is buried in the cathedral, is shown in 18 scenes, probably based on a lost illuminated copy of one of his Lives.

The [[Bollandists|Bollandist]] Society continues the study, academic assembly, appraisal and publication of materials relating to the lives of Christian saints. (See ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]''.)

== Medieval England ==
With the introduction of [[Latin]] literature into England in the 7th and 8th centuries the genre of the life of the saint grew increasingly popular. It is not surprising that such a genre would become popular in England. When one contrasts it to the popular heroic poem, such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', one finds that they share certain common features. In ''Beowulf'', the titular character battles against [[Grendel]] and his mother, while the saint, such as [[Athanasius]]’ [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]] (one of the original sources for the hagiographic motif) or the character of [[Guthlac]], battles against figures no less substantial in a spiritual sense. Both genres then focus on the hero-warrior figure, but with the distinction that the saint is of a spiritual sort.

In [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[mediaeval|mediæval]] England, Hagiography became a literary genre par excellence for the teaching of a largely illiterate audience. Hagiography provided priests and theologians with the classical handbooks in a form that allowed them the rhetorical tools necessary to defend the truth of their scriptures. Many of the important hagiographical texts composed in medieval England were written in the dialect of [[Anglo-Norman_literature#Hagiography|Anglo-Norman]].

Of all the English hagiographers no one was more prolific nor so aware of the importance of the genre as Abbot [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]. His work [[The Lives of the Saints]] (MS Cotton Julius E.7) comprises a set of sermons on saints' days, formerly observed by the English Church. The text comprises two prefaces, one in Latin and one in [[Old English language|Old English]], and 39 lives beginning on December 25 with the nativity of [[Christ]] and ending with three texts to which no saints' days are attached. The text spans the entire year and describes the lives of many saints, both English and continental, and hearkens back to some of the earliest saints of the early church.

Imitation of the life of Christ then was the benchmark against which saints were measured, and imitation of the lives of saints was the benchmark against which the general population measured itself.

There are two known instances where saint's lives were adapted into vernacular [[play (theatre)|plays]] in Britain. These are the [[Cornish language|Cornish-language]] works ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]'' and ''[[Beunans Ke]]'', about the lives of Saints [[Meriasek]] and [[Saint Kea|Kea]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|last= Koch|first= John T. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2006|publisher= ABC-CLIO|location= |isbn= 1-85109-440-7|page= |pages= 203–205|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Celtic+Culture#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval Ireland ==
Ireland is notable in its rich hagiographical tradition, and for the large amount of material which was produced during the mediæval period. Irish hagiographers wrote primarily in Latin while some of the later saint's lives were written in the hagiographer's native vernacular [[Irish language|Irish]]. Of particular note are the lives of [[St. Patrick]], [[St. Columba]] and [[St. Brigit]]—Ireland's three patron saints.

== Eastern Orthodoxy ==
[[File:Hagiasophia-christ.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Greek Orthodox visual hagiography. This is one of the best known surviving Byzantine mosaics in [[Hagia Sophia]] - [[Christ Pantocrator]] flanked by the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Baptist]] made in the 12th century.]]

In the 10th century, a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[monk]] [[Simeon Metaphrastes]] was the first one to change the genre of lives of the saints into something different, giving it a moralizing and [[panegyric]]al character. His catalog of lives of the saints became the standard for all of the [[Western world|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] hagiographers, who would create relative biographies and images of the ideal saints by gradually departing from the real facts of their lives. Over the years, the genre of lives of the saints had absorbed a number of narrative plots and poetic images (often, of pre-Christian origin, such as [[dragon]] fighting etc.), mediaeval [[parable]]s, short stories and [[anecdote]]s.

The genre of lives of the saints was brought to [[Kievan Rus']] by the [[South Slavs]] together with [[writing]] and also in [[translation]]s from the Greek language. In the 11th century, the [[Rus' people|Rus']] began to compile the original life stories of the first Rus'ian saints, e.g. [[Boris and Gleb]], Theodosius Pechersky etc. In the 16th century, [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Macarius]] expanded the list of the Rus'ian saints and supervised the compiling process of their life stories. They would all be compiled in the so called ''Velikiye chet’yi-minei'' catalog (Великие Четьи-Минеи, or [[Great Menaion Reader]]), consisting of 12 [[volume]]s in accordance with each month of the year. They were revised and expanded by St. [[Dimitry of Rostov]] in 1684-1705.

This literary genre was often used as ecclesiastic and [[political]] [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Propaganda_in_Hagiography Propaganda in Hagiography] By Theodore Felix, 20 August 2008; Revised - All Empires History&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the works in the genre of lives of the saints represent a valuable historical source and reflection of different social ideas, world outlook and [[aesthetic]] [[concept]]s of the past.
