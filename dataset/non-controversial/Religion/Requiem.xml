[[Image:Bulla-Ferdinant.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Requiem Mass for [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] at the [[Catholic Church of St. Catherine]], [[Saint Petersburg]], 1914.]]
A '''Requiem''' or '''Requiem Mass''', also known as '''Mass for the dead''' (Latin: ''Missa pro defunctis'') or '''Mass of the dead''' (Latin: ''Missa defunctorum''), is a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated for the repose of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the [[Roman Missal]]. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a [[funeral]].

Musical settings of the [[Proper (liturgy)|propers]] of the Requiem Mass are also called Requiems, and the term has subsequently been applied to other musical compositions associated with death and mourning, even when they lack religious or liturgical relevance.

The term is also used for similar ceremonies outside the [[Catholic Church]], especially in the [[Anglo-Catholic]] branch of [[Anglicanism]] and in certain [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] churches.  A [[Memorial_service_(Orthodox)|comparable service]], with a wholly different ritual form and texts, exists in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], as well as in the [[Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin |title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity, Volume 4 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA649&amp;dq=The+Office+of+the+Dead+Anglican&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MHKUULfHG4eS9gT9mICYDA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Office%20of%20the%20Dead%20Anglican&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 November 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English|isbn=0802824161|quote=The possibility of a funeral Eucharist is provided in North American Lutheran, Episcopal/Anglican, and United Methodist worship books.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mass and its settings draw their name from the [[introit]] of the liturgy, which begins with the words &quot;''Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine''&quot;&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Grant them eternal rest, O Lord&quot;.  (&quot;Requiem&quot; is the [[accusative case|accusative]] singular form of the Latin noun ''requies'', &quot;rest, repose&quot;.)  The Roman Missal as revised in 1970 employs this phrase as the first entrance [[antiphon]] among the formulas for Masses for the dead, and it remains in use to this day.

==Liturgical rite==
In earlier forms of the Roman Rite, some of which are still in use, a Requiem Mass differs in several ways from the usual Mass in that form. Some parts that were of relatively recent origin, including some that have been excluded in the 1970 revision, are omitted. Examples are the psalm ''Iudica'' at the start of Mass, the prayer said by the priest before reading the Gospel (or the blessing of the deacon, if a deacon reads it), and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving Communion.&lt;ref&gt;''Missale Romanum, Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae'', XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Other omissions include the use of [[incense]] at the Introit and the Gospel, the kiss of peace, lit candles held by acolytes when a deacon chants the Gospel, and blessings. There is no [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]] and no recitation of the [[Creed]]; the [[Alleluia]] chant before the Gospel is replaced by a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]], as in [[Lent]]; and the ''[[Agnus Dei]]'' is altered.  ''[[Ite missa est]]'' is replaced with ''[[Requiescant in pace]]'' (May they rest in peace); the &quot;Deo gratias&quot; response is replaced with &quot;Amen&quot;. Black is the obligatory [[Liturgical colours|liturgical colour]] of the [[vestment]]s in the earlier forms, while the later form allows a choice between black and violet, and in some countries, such as England and Wales, white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, with adaptations for England and Wales], 346&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]'' [[Dies Irae|Dies Iræ]]'', recited or sung between the [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] and the Gospel, is an obligatory part of the Requiem Mass in the earlier forms. As its opening words, ''Dies irae'' (Day of wrath), indicate, this poetic composition speaks of the Day of Judgment in fearsome terms; it then appeals to Jesus for mercy.

Celebrations of the Requiem Mass were sometimes referred to as &quot;black Masses&quot;, from the colour of the [[vestment]]s worn by the priest. This term has no connection with the [[Satanism|Satanist]] [[black mass|ritual of the same name]].

===Post [[Vatican II]]===
In the liturgical reforms of the mid-20th century in the Roman Catholic Church following the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a significant shift in the [[funeral rites]] used by the Church. The emphasis on sorrow and grief was to be replaced by one which also includes the whole community's worship of God and in which the deceased is entrusted to God's love, based on trust in the [[salvation|salvific]] value of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], Death and [[Resurrection]] of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.richmonddiocese.org/worship/liturgies/funeral.htm The Catholic Diocese of Richmond, Office of Worship &quot;Rites of the Order of Christian Funerals&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Requiem Mass&quot; was often replaced by the term '''Mass of the Resurrection'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mass%20of%20the%20resurrections%20of%20the%20resurrection Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Mass of Christian Burial'''. In line with this shift, the use of black vestments was made optional (and has all but disappeared by the 21st century), with the new preference being for white, the color of joy associated with [[Easter]], or purple, for a muted version of mourning. The texts used for the service made a similar change, with the overall theme of the service to be a proclamation of the promise of eternal life made by Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rites of Christian Burial'', Catholic Publishing Company 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[Image:RequiemAeternamChant.jpg|thumb|400px|float|[[Incipit]] of the [[Gregorian chant]] [[introit]] for a Requiem Mass, from the ''[[Liber Usualis]]''.]]
The Requiem Mass is notable for the large number of musical compositions that it has inspired, including settings by [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart]], [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi]], [[Requiem (Dvořák)|Dvořák]], [[Requiem (Fauré)|Fauré]] and [[Requiem (Duruflé)|Duruflé]]. Originally, such compositions were meant to be performed in liturgical service, with monophonic chant. Eventually the dramatic character of the text began to appeal to composers to an extent that they made the requiem a genre of its own, and the compositions of composers such as Verdi are essentially concert pieces rather than liturgical works.

The following are the texts that have been set to music.

===Sequence===
{{Main article|Dies Irae}}
A [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] is a liturgical poem sung, when used, after the Tract (or Alleluia, if present).  The sequence employed in the Requiem, ''Dies Irae'', attributed to [[Thomas of Celano]] (c. 1200&amp;nbsp;– c. 1260–1270), has been called &quot;the greatest of hymns&quot;, worthy of &quot;supreme admiration&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Seven Great Humns of the Mediaeval Church|last=Nott |first=Charles C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1902|publisher=Edwin S.

Some extracts too have been set independently to music, such as ''Pie Iesu'' in the settings of [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Maurice Duruflé|Duruflé]] and [[John Rutter]].

The ''Pie Jesu'' consists of the final words of the ''Dies Irae'' followed by the final words of the ''Agnus Dei''.

Musical Requiem settings sometimes include passages from the &quot;Absolution at the bier&quot; (''Absolutio ad feretrum'') or &quot;Commendation of the dead person&quot; (referred to also as the [[Absolution of the dead]]), which in the case of a funeral, follows the conclusion of the Mass.

==History of musical compositions==
For many centuries the texts of the requiem were sung to [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] melodies. The [[Requiem (Ockeghem)|Requiem]] by [[Johannes Ockeghem]], written sometime in the later half of the 15th century, is the earliest surviving [[polyphony|polyphonic]] setting. There was a setting by the elder composer [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]], possibly earlier, which is now lost: Ockeghem's may have been modelled on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitch&quot;&gt;Fabrice Fitch: &quot;Requiem (2)&quot;, Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (Accessed January 21, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many early compositions employ different texts that were in use in different liturgies around Europe before the [[Council of Trent]] set down the texts given above. The requiem of [[Antoine Brumel|Brumel]], circa 1500, is the first to include the ''[[Dies irae|Dies Iræ]]''. In the early polyphonic settings of the Requiem, there is considerable textural contrast within the compositions themselves: simple chordal or [[fauxbourdon]]-like passages are contrasted with other sections of contrapuntal complexity, such as in the Offertory of Ockeghem's Requiem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitch&quot;/&gt;

In the 16th century, more and more composers set the Requiem mass. In contrast to practice in setting the Mass Ordinary, many of these settings used a [[cantus-firmus]] technique, something which had become quite archaic by mid-century. In addition, these settings used less textural contrast than the early settings by Ockeghem and Brumel, although the vocal scoring was often richer, for example in the six-voice Requiem by [[Jean Richafort]] which he wrote for the death of [[Josquin des Prez]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitch&quot;/&gt; Other composers before 1550 include [[Pedro de Escobar]], [[Antoine de Févin]], [[Cristóbal Morales]], and [[Pierre de La Rue]]; that by La Rue is probably the second oldest, after Ockeghem's.

Over 2,000 Requiem compositions have been composed to the present day. Typically the Renaissance settings, especially those not written on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], may be performed ''[[a cappella]]'' (i.e. without necessary accompanying instrumental parts), whereas beginning around 1600 composers more often preferred to use instruments to accompany a choir, and also include vocal soloists. There is great variation between compositions in how much of liturgical text is set to music.

Most composers omit sections of the liturgical prescription, most frequently the Gradual and the Tract. [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] omits the ''Dies iræ'', while the very same text had often been set by French composers in previous centuries as a stand-alone work.

Sometimes composers divide an item of the liturgical text into two or more movements; because of the length of its text, the ''Dies iræ'' is the most frequently divided section of the text (as with Mozart, for instance). The ''Introit'' and ''Kyrie'', being immediately adjacent in the actual Roman Catholic liturgy, are often composed as one movement.

Musico-thematic relationships among movements within a Requiem can be found as well.

===Requiem in concert===
Beginning in the 18th century and continuing through the 19th, many composers wrote what are effectively concert works, which by virtue of employing forces too large, or lasting such a considerable duration, prevent them being readily used in an ordinary funeral service; the requiems of [[François-Joseph Gossec|Gossec]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] are essentially dramatic concert [[oratorio]]s. A counter-reaction to this tendency came from the Cecilian movement, which recommended restrained accompaniment for liturgical music, and frowned upon the use of operatic vocal soloists.

==Requiem in other rites and churches==
'''Requiem''' is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral, or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the Roman Catholic Mass. Among the earliest examples of this type are the German settings composed in the 17th century by [[Heinrich Schütz]] and [[Michael Praetorius]], whose works are Lutheran adaptations of the Roman Catholic requiem, and which provided inspiration for the mighty ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem|German Requiem]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].&lt;ref&gt;A rather exhaustive list of requiem composers can be found on [http://www.requiemsurvey.org Requiemsurvey.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such works include:
* [[Greek Orthodox Church]]—[[Parastas]]
* [[Russian Orthodox Church]]—Panikhida
* Anglican (English) Requiem

===Eastern Christian rites===
{{Main|Memorial service (Orthodox)}}
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholic]] Churches, the requiem is the fullest form of [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] ({{lang-el|Parastas}}, [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''Оpеlо''). The normal memorial service is a greatly abbreviated form of [[Matins]], but the Requiem contains all of the psalms, readings, and hymns normally found in the [[All-Night Vigil]] (which combines the [[Canonical Hours]] of [[Vespers]], [[Matins]] and [[Prime (liturgy)|First Hour]]), providing a complete set of [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] for the departed. The full requiem will last around three and a half hours. In this format it more clearly represents the original concept of ''parastas'', which means literally, &quot;standing throughout (the night).&quot; Often, there will be a [[Divine Liturgy]] celebrated the next morning with further propers for the departed.

Because of their great length, a full Requiem is rarely served. However, at least in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] liturgical tradition, a Requiem will often be served on the eve before the [[Canonization#Eastern Orthodox Practice.E2.80.94Glorification|Glorification]] (canonization) of a [[saint]], in a special service known as the &quot;Last Panikhida.&quot;

===Anglicanism===
The [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' contains no Requiem Mass, but instead a service named &quot;The Order for the Burial of the Dead&quot;. Within this service are several texts with rubrics stating that they shall be said or sung by the priest or clerks. The first few of these texts are found at the beginning of the service, while the rest are meant to occur during the actual burial of the body into the grave.  These texts are typically dividing into seven, and collectively known as &quot;funeral sentences&quot;. Composers who have set the Anglican burial service to music include [[William Croft]], [[Thomas Morley]], [[Thomas Tomkins]], [[Orlando Gibbons]], and [[Henry Purcell]]. The text of these seven sentences, from the 1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'', is as follows:
* I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
* I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.
* We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord.
* Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.
* In the midst of life we are in death: of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.
* Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.
* I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, From henceforth blessed are the dead which die in the Lord: even so saith the Spirit: for they rest from their labours.

==Modern treatments==
In the 20th century the requiem evolved in several new directions. The genre of War Requiem is perhaps the most notable, which comprise of compositions dedicated to the memory of people killed in wartime. These often include extra-liturgical poems of a pacifist or non-liturgical nature; for example, the ''[[War Requiem]]'' of [[Benjamin Britten]] juxtaposes the Latin text with the poetry of [[Wilfred Owen]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s ''[[Polish Requiem]]'' includes a traditional Polish hymn within the sequence, and [[Robert Steadman]]'s ''[[Robert Steadman#Choral music|Mass in Black]]'' intersperses [[natural environment|environmental]] [[poetry]] and [[prophecies]] of [[Nostradamus]]. [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] Requiem may be regarded as a specific subset of this type. The ''[[World Requiem]]'' of [[John Foulds]] was written in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] and initiated the [[Royal British Legion]]'s annual festival of remembrance. Recent requiem works by [[Taiwan]]ese composers [[Tyzen Hsiao]] and [[Fan-Long Ko]] follow in this tradition, honouring victims of the [[2-28 Incident]] and subsequent [[White Terror]]. Another recent requiem composed by Hong Kong composer [[Man-Ching Donald Yu]], in remembrance of the victims of the 2008 [[Sichuan Earthquake]].

Lastly, the 20th century saw the development of the secular Requiem, written for public performance without specific religious observance, such as [[Frederick Delius]]'s ''[[Requiem (Delius)|Requiem]]'', completed in 1916 and dedicated to &quot;the memory of all young Artists fallen in the war&quot;,&lt;ref name=corleonis&gt;Corleonis, Adrian. [http://www.allmusic.com/work/requiem-for-soprano-baritone-double-chorus--orchestra-rt-ii-8-c151935/description Requiem, for soprano, baritone, double chorus &amp; orchestra, RT ii/8] ''All Music Guide'', Retrieved 2011-02-20&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dmitry Kabalevsky]]'s ''[[List_of_compositions_by_Dmitry_Kabalevsky#Vocal_Orchestral|Requiem]]'' (Op. 72&amp;nbsp;– 1962), a setting of a poem written by [[Robert Rozhdestvensky]] especially for the composition.&lt;ref name=flaxman&gt;Flaxman, Fred.  [http://www.compactdiscoveries.com/CompactDiscoveriesArticles/Kabalevsky.html Controversial Comrade Kabalevsky] ''Compact Discoveries with Fred Flaxman'', 2007, Retrieved 2011-02-20;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Howells]]'s unaccompanied ''Requiem'' uses [[Psalm 23]] (&quot;The Lord is my shepherd&quot;), Psalm 121 (&quot;I will lift up mine eyes&quot;), &quot;Salvator mundi&quot; (&quot;O Saviour of the world,&quot; in English), &quot;Requiem aeternam&quot; (two different settings), and &quot;I heard a voice from heaven.&quot; Some composers have written purely instrumental works bearing the title of ''requiem'', as famously exemplified by Britten's ''Sinfonia da Requiem''. [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''[[Das Floß der Medusa]]'', written in 1968 as a requiem for [[Che Guevara]], is properly speaking an [[oratorio]]; Henze's [[Requiem (Henze)|Requiem]] is instrumental but retains the traditional Latin titles for the movements. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Requiem canticles'' mixes instrumental movements with segments of the &quot;Introit,&quot; &quot;Dies irae,&quot; &quot;Pie Jesu,&quot; and &quot;Libera me.&quot;

==Notable compositions==

===Annual requiems===
A Solemn Requiem Mass is held by the [[Catholic Police Guild]] in October every year. It is celebrated in [[Westminster Cathedral]], [[London]] to commemorate:
* Members of the [[Catholic Police Guild]] who have recently died
* Serving [[police]] officers and staff who have died or lost their lives in the course of their duty in the last year
* All deceased colleagues and friends in the police service.
This memorial has been taking place since 1914.  In the early years it was covered every year by British [[Pathé News]].
