'''Karma''' ({{lang-sa|कर्म}} {{IPA-sa|ˈkərmə|IPA|Karma.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|[[:wikt:कर्मन्#Sanskrit|kárman]]}}''—&quot;act, action, performance&quot;—a neuter ''n''-stem, nominative ''{{IAST|kárma}}'' {{lang|sa|कर्म}} ; from the root ''{{IAST|√kṛ}}''  which means &quot;to do, make, perform, accomplish, cause, effect, prepare, undertake&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-pi|kamma}}) in [[Indian religions]] is the concept of &quot;action&quot; or &quot;deed&quot;, understood as that which causes the entire cycle of [[causality|cause and effect]] (i.e., the cycle called [[saṃsāra]]) originating in [[History of India|ancient India]] and treated in the [[Hindu]], [[Jainist|Jain]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |accessdate=4 June 2011 |publisher=Parvesh singla |pages=5– |id=GGKEY:0XFSARN29ZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
A concept of karma (along with ''[[samsara]]'' and ''[[moksha]]'') may originate in the ''[[shramana]]'' tradition of which [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] are continuations. This tradition influenced the [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanic]] religion in the early [[Vedantic]] (Upanishadic) movement of the 1st millennium BC. This worldview was adopted from this religious culture by [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmin]] orthodoxy, and Brahmins wrote the earliest recorded scriptures containing these ideas in the early [[Upanishads]]. Until recently, the scholarly consensus was that [[reincarnation]] is absent from the earliest strata of Brahminical literature. However, a new translation of two stanzas of the Rig Veda indicate that the Brahmins may have had the idea, common among small-scale societies around the world, that an individual cycles back and forth between the earth and a heavenly realm of ancestors. In this worldview, moral behavior has no influence on rebirth. The idea that the moral quality of one's actions influences one's rebirth is absent from India until the period of the ''shramana'' religions, and the Brahmins appear to have adopted this idea from other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Jurewicz, [http://www.ocbs.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63:the-rigveda-small-scale-societies-and-rebirth-eschatology&amp;catid=29:articles-archive&amp;Itemid=121 ''The Rigveda, 'small scale' societies and rebirth eschatology'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth''  University of California Press, 2002, passim, see in particular page 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, ISBN 81-208-0815-0, page 37: “This confirms that the doctrine of transmigration is non-aryan and was accepted by non-vedics like Ajivikism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Indo-aryans have borrowed the theory of re-birth after coming in contact with the aboriginal inhabitants of India. Certainly Jainism and non-vedics [..] accepted the doctrine of rebirth as supreme postulate or article of faith.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner, ''The Longhaired Sage'' in ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Karel Werner, ed., Curzon Press, 1989, page 34. &quot;Rahurkar speaks of them as belonging to two distinct 'cultural strands' ... Wayman also found evidence for two distinct approaches to the spiritual dimension in ancient India and calls them the traditions of 'truth and silence.' He traces them particularly in the older Upanishads, in early Buddhism, and in some later literature.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, [[Cambridge University Press]]: UK ISBN 0-521-43878-0 – “The origin and doctrine of Karma and Samsara are obscure. These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahaminical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions.” Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S. Jaini 2001 “Collected Paper on Buddhist Studies” Motilal Banarsidass Publ 576 pages  ISBN 81-208-1776-1: &quot;Yajnavalkya’s reluctance and manner in expounding the doctrine of karma in the assembly of Janaka (a reluctance not shown on any other occasion) can perhaps be explained by the assumption that it was, like that of the transmigration of soul, of non-brahmanical origin. In view of the fact that this doctrine is emblazoned on almost every page of sramana scriptures, it is highly probable that it was derived from them.&quot; Page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Govind Chandra Pande, (1994) Life and Thought of Sankaracarya, Motilal Banarsidass ISBN 81-208-1104-6 : Early Upanishad thinkers like Yajnavalkya were acquainted with the sramanic thinking and tried to incorporate these ideals of Karma, Samsara and Moksa into the vedic thought implying a disparagement of the vedic ritualism and recognising the mendicancy as an ideal. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of Yoga By Vivian Worthington 1982 Routledge ISBN 0-7100-9258-X – &quot;The Upanishads were like a breath of  fresh air blowing through the stuffy corridors of power of the vedic brahminism. They were noticed by the Brahmin establishment because the yogis did not owe allegiance to any established religion or mode of thought.. So although, the Upanishads came to be noticed by Brahmin establishment, they were very largely saying what may well have been current among other sramanic groups at that time. It can be said that this atheistic doctrine was evidently very acceptable to the authors of Upanishads, who made use of many of its concepts.&quot; Page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of Yoga By Vivian Worthington 1982 Routledge ISBN 0-7100-9258-X: &quot;The idea of re-incarnation, so central to the older sramanic creeds is still new to many people throughout the world. The Aryans of the Vedic age knew nothing of it. When the Brahmins began to accept it, they declared it as a secret doctrine. […] It will be seen from this short account of Jains, that they had fully developed the ideas of karma and reincarnation very early in history. The earliest Upanishads were probably strongly influenced by their teachings. Jainism the religion, Samkhya the philosophy and yoga the way to self discipline and enlightenment dominated the spiritual life of Indian during the Dravidian times. They were to be overshadowed for over thousand years by the lower form of religion that was foisted on the local inhabitants by the invading Aryans, but in the end it was Sramanic disciplines that triumphed. They did so by surviving in their own right and by their ideas being fully adopted by the Brahmins who steadily modified their own vedic religion.&quot; Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The sudden appearance of this theory [of karma] in a full-fledged form is likely to be due, as already pointed out, to an impact of the wandering [[Jain monasticism|muni]]-and-[[shramana]]-cult, coming down from the pre-Vedic non-Aryan time.&quot; Kashi Nath Upadhyaya, ''Early Buddhism and the Bhagavadgita''. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1998, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Some traditions (i.e., the [[Vedanta]]), believe that a [[supreme being]] plays some kind of role, for example, as the dispenser of the 'fruits' of karma&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bs_3/bs_3-2-08.html The Brahma Sutras – Chapter 3]. Swami-krishnananda.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; or as exercising the option to change one's karma in rare instances. In general, followers of Buddhism and many followers of Hinduism consider the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, ''The Hindu Religious Tradition'' 54–80 (Allied Pub. 1976) ISBN 0-7100-8668-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol. II'', at 217–225 (18th reprint 1995) ISBN 81-85301-75-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Michaels, ''Hinduism: Past and Present'' 154–56 (Princeton 1998) ISBN 0-691-08953-1&lt;/ref&gt; Another view holds that a [[Satguru|Sadguru]], acting on a god's behalf, can mitigate or work out some of the karma of the disciple.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa, ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', Chapter 21 ISBN 1-56589-212-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/ans/ans_57.html Swami Krishnananda on the Guru mitigating the karma of the disciple].

==In the Indian religions==

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Karma in Hinduism}}
Many Hindus see God's direct involvement in this process; others consider the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Compare'' [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/bs_3/bs_3-2-08.html Swami-Krishnananda.org] ''with'' Pratima Bowes, The Hindu Religious Tradition 54–80 (Allied Pub. 1976) ISBN 0-7100-8668-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol. II, at 217–225 (18th reprint 1995) ISBN 81-85301-75-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Michaels, ''Hinduism: Past and Present'' 154–56 (Princeton 1998) ISBN 0-691-08953-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of [[Vedanta]] consider [[Ishvara]], a personal supreme God, as playing a role in the delivery of karma. [[theism|Theistic]] schools of Hinduism such as Vedanta thus disagree with the [[Buddhist]] and [[Jain]] views and other Hindu views that karma is merely a law of cause and effect but rather is also dependent on the will of a personal supreme God. A summary of this theistic view of karma is expressed by the following: &quot;God does not make one suffer for no reason nor does He make one happy for no reason. God is very fair and gives you exactly what you deserve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gitamrta.org/laws_of_nature.html#laws7 What is Karma], Gitamrta.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma is not punishment or retribution but simply an extended expression or consequence of natural acts. Karma means &quot;deed&quot; or &quot;act&quot; and more broadly names the universal principle of [[cause]] and [[Result|effect]], action and reaction, that governs all life. The effects experienced are also able to be mitigated by actions and are not necessarily fated. That is to say, a particular action now is not binding to some particular, pre-determined future experience or reaction; it is not a simple, one-to-one correspondence of reward or punishment.

Karma is not [[Destiny|fate]], for humans act with [[Free will in theology|free will]] creating their own destiny. According to the Vedas, if one sows [[Good and evil|goodness]], one will reap goodness; if one sows [[evil]], one will reap evil. Karma refers to the totality of our actions and their concomitant reactions in this and previous lives, all of which determines our future. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and dispassionate response.

One of the first and most dramatic illustrations of Karma can be found in the [[Bhagavad Gita]]. In this poem, [[Arjuna]] the protagonist is preparing for battle when he realizes that the enemy consists of members of his own family and decides not to fight. His charioteer, [[Krishna]] (an [[avatar]] of god), explains to Arjuna the concept of ''[[dharma]]'' (duty) among other things and makes him see that it is his duty to fight. The original Hindu concept of karma was later enhanced by several other movements within the religion, most notably [[Vedanta]], and [[Tantra]].

In this way, so long as the stock of ''[[Sanchita karma]]'' lasts, a part of it continues to be taken out as ''[[Prarabdha karma]]'' for being experienced in one lifetime, leading to the cycle of birth and death. A ''[[jiva]]'' cannot attain [[moksha]] until the accumulated ''sanchita karmas'' are completely exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Goyandaka J, ''The Secret of Karmayoga'', Gita Press, Gorakhpur&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]], all living beings are described as being under the influence of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'s'' three qualities. Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of ''maya'' bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane. Above these three qualities is the eternal time. Due to the influence of three modes of Maya's nature, ''[[jiva]]s'' (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time. These activities are called &quot;karma&quot;. The underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.

This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be. Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated. This is the Gurbani's ([[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]) law of karma. Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurbani.org/webart40.htm Gurbani.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main| Karma in Buddhism}}
In Buddhism, karma (Pāli ''kamma'') is strictly distinguished from ''[[vipaka|vipāka]]'', meaning &quot;fruit&quot; or &quot;result&quot;.  Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli ''hetu'') in the [[Twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of &quot;volitional activities&quot; (Pali ''sankhara'') and &quot;action&quot; (Pali ''bhava''). Any action is understood as creating &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that will sprout into the appropriate result (Pāli ''vipaka'') when met with the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one within the wheel of ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsāra]]'', while others will liberate one to ''[[nirvana|nirvāna]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Karma is one of five categories of causation, known collectively as ''[[niyama#In Buddhism|niyama dhammas]]'', the first being ''kamma'', and the other four being ''utu'' (seasons and weather), ''bīja'' (heredity, lit. &quot;seed&quot;), ''chitta'' (mind) and ''[[dhamma]]'' (law, in the sense of nature's tendency to perfect).

===Jainism===
{{Main| Karma in Jainism}}
{{See also|Types of Karma (Jainism)|Causes of Karma (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], &quot;karma&quot; conveys a totally different meaning from that commonly understood in [[Hindu philosophy]] and western civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Hermann Kuhn, Karma, the Mechanism, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, karma is referred to as karmic dirt, as it consists of very subtle and microscopic particles (''pudgala'') that pervade the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya Umasvati, Tattvartha Sutra, Ch VIII, Sutra 24&lt;/ref&gt; Karmas are attracted to the karmic field of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] due to vibrations created by activities of mind, speech, and body as well as various mental dispositions. Hence the karmas are the [[subtle matter]] surrounding the [[consciousness]] of a soul. When these two components (consciousness and karma) interact, we experience the life we know at present.

Herman Kuhn, quoting from [[Tattvarthasutra]], describes karmas as &quot;a mechanism that makes us thoroughly experience the themes of our life until we gained optimal knowledge from them and until our emotional attachment to these themes falls off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]],&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]his emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one’s own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to ''shrardha'' (the ritual Hindu offerings by the son of deceased), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in ones fate, while Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting bodhisattvas, transfer of merit and like. Only Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Collected papers on Jaina studies | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers | editor=Jaini,  Padmanabh | year=2000 | edition=1st | location=Delhi | pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The key points where the theory of Karma in Jainism differs from the other religions such as theistic traditions of Hinduism, can be stated as follows:
# Karma operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them. (absence of the exogenous &quot;Divine Entity&quot; in Jainism)
# Jainism advocates that a soul's karma changes even with the thoughts, and not just the actions. Thus, to even think evil of someone would endure a ''karma-bandha'' or an increment in bad karma. For this reason, the [[Ratnatraya]] gives a very strong emphasis to ''samyak dhyan'' (rationality in thoughts) and &quot;samyak darshan&quot; (rationality in perception) and not just &quot;samyak charitra&quot; (rationality in conduct).
# In Jain theology, a soul is released of worldly affairs as soon as it is able to emancipate from the &quot;karm-bandh&quot;. A famous illustration is that of Marudevi, the mother of [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Rishabha]], the first ''[[Tirthankara]]'' of the present time cycle, who reached such emancipation by elevating sequentially her thought processes, while she was visiting her Tirthankara son.&lt;ref name=&quot;FN2M&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=From Nigoda to Moksa: The Story of Marudevi | encyclopedia=Jainism and Early Buddhism: Essays in Honor of Padmanabh S. Jaini | publisher=Asian Humanities Press (an imprint of Jain Publishing Company) | accessdate=September 13, 2011 | author=Jaini, Padmanabh S. | editor=Qvarnström, Olle | year=2003 | volume=I | location=Fremont CA | pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illustration explains how [[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]] and [[moksa (Jainism)|moksha]] are different than in other religions of India. In the presence of a Tirthankara, another soul achieved [[Kevala Jnana]] and subsequently nirvana, without any need of intervention by the Tirthankara.&lt;ref name=&quot;FN2M&quot; /&gt;
# The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. Tirthankaras are not attributed &quot;godhood&quot;. Thus, even the Tirthankaras themselves have to go through the stages of emancipation, for attaining that state. While Buddhism does give a similar and to some extent a matching account for Gautama Buddha, Hinduism maintains a totally different theory where &quot;divine grace&quot; is needed for emancipation.
# Jainism treats all souls equally, inasmuch as it advocates that all souls have the same potential of attaining nirvana. Only those who make effort, really attain it, but nonetheless, each soul is capable on its own to do so by gradually reducing its karma.&lt;ref&gt;Sancheti Asoo Lal, Bhandari Manak Mal – Fist Steps to Jainism (Part Two): Doctrine of Karma, Doctrine of Anekant and Other Articles with Appendices – Catalogued by [[Library of Congress|Library of U.S. Congress]], Washington, Card No. 90-232383&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Falun Gong==
Falun Gong differs from [[Buddhism]] in its definition of the term &quot;karma,&quot; Ownby says, in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term. The Chinese term &quot;''de''&quot; or &quot;virtue&quot; is reserved for what might otherwise be termed &quot;good karma&quot; in Buddhism. Karma is understood as the source of all suffering - what Buddhism might refer to as &quot;bad Karma&quot;. Li says &quot;A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators it's karmic obstacles, so there's birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is ordinary karma.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture&gt;David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China (2008) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Falun Gong]] teaches that the spirit is locked in the cycle of rebirth, also known as [[samsara]]&lt;ref name=TRAN&gt;Transcending the Five Elements and Three Realms, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html Zhuan Falun], accessed 31/12/07&lt;/ref&gt; due to the accumulation of karma.&lt;ref name=kar&gt;Transformation of Karma, Zhuan Falun Lecture 4, accessed 01/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts. Falun Gong states that karma is the reason for suffering, and what ultimately blocks people from the truth of the universe and attaining enlightenment. At the same time, is also the cause of ones continued rebirth and suffering.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt; Li says that due to accumulation of karma the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over again, until the karma is paid off or eliminated through cultivation, or the person is destroyed due to the bad deeds he has done.&lt;ref name=kar /&gt;

Ownby regards the concept of karma as a cornerstone to individual moral behaviour in Falun Gong, and also readily traceable to the Christian doctrine of &quot;one reaps what one sows&quot;. Others say Matthew 5:44 means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are Judged by God after death in Hell. Ownby says Falun Gong is differentiated by a &quot;system of transmigration&quot; though, &quot;in which each organism is the reincarnation of a previous life form, its current form having been determined by karmic calculation of the moral qualities of the previous lives lived.&quot; Ownby says the seeming unfairness of manifest inequities can then be explained, at the same time allowing a space for moral behaviour in spite of them.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;!-- Ownby 2008 p.110 --&gt; In the same vein of Li's [[monism]], matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

Li says that &quot;Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe. They no longer met the requirements of the Fa at their given levels in the universe, and thus had to drop down. Just as we have said before, the heavier one's mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings.&quot; He says that in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a &quot;setting of delusion&quot;, and return. &quot;That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you. Those who fail to return will have no choice but to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]], with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref name=ZFLII&gt;Li Hongzhi, [http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl2.htm Zhuan Falun, Volume II], published 1996, translated June 2008, accessed 2008-06-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong's apparent &quot;opposition to practitioners' taking [[medication|medicine]] when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the [[illness]] through cultivation.&quot; Penny shares this interpretation. Since Li believes that &quot;karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people&quot;, Penny asks: &quot;if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of ''xinxing'', then what good will medicine do?&quot;&lt;ref name=Fellow&gt;Perry, Benjamin, Canberra, 2001, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present and Future of Falun Gong, A lecture by Harold White Fellow, Benjamin Penny, at the National Library of Australia], accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Li himself states that he is not forbidding practitioners from taking medicine, maintaining that &quot;What I'm doing is telling people the relationship between practicing cultivation and medicine-taking&quot;. Li also states that &quot;An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lectures in United States, 1997, Li Hongzhi&lt;/ref&gt; Schechter quotes a Falun Gong student who says &quot;It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not.&quot;&lt;ref name=schechter&gt;Danny Schechter, ''Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?'', Akashic books: New York, 2001, pp. 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western interpretation ==
[[File:It Shoots Further Than He Dreams.jpg|alt=|thumb|''It Shoots Further Than He Dreams'' by John F. Knott, March 1918.]]
Many [[Western culture]]s have notions similar to karma, as demonstrated in the phrase [[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Well-Being – A Gift – Your Life|author=Dorothy M. Neddermeyer|url=http://drdorothy.info/?p=1444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian expressions similar to karma include [[wikt:reap what one sows|reap what one sows]] (Galatians 6:7), [[violence begets violence]] and [[live by the sword, die by the sword]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma, rhythmic return to harmony|author=Haridas Chaudhuri|pages=78 and 79|quote=The Meaning of Karma in Integral Philosophy|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ve_Nim-MChcC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, God plays a role and is seen as a dispenser of [[Karma in Hinduism|its version of karma]]. The non-interventionist view is that of [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], the latter originally a non-theist religion.

== Spiritism ==
{{Main|Spiritist doctrine}}
In [[Spiritism]], karma is known as &quot;the law of cause and effect&quot;, and plays a central role in determining how one's life should be lived. Spirits are encouraged to choose how (and when) to suffer retribution for the wrong they did in previous lives. How we know of this without remembering we had the choice is ambiguous. Disabilities, physical or mental impairment or even an unlucky life are due to the choices a spirit makes before [[Reincarnation|reincarnating]] (that is, before being born to a new life).

What sets Spiritism apart from the more traditional religious views is that it understands karma as a condition inherent to the spirit, whether incarnated or not: the consequences of the crimes committed by the spirit last beyond the physical life and cause him (moral) pain in the afterlife. The choice of a life of hardships is, therefore, a way to rid oneself of the pain caused by moral guilt and to perfect qualities that are necessary for the spirit to progress to a higher form.

Because Spiritism always accepted the plurality of inhabited worlds, its concept of karma became considerably complex. There are worlds that are &quot;primitive&quot; (in the sense that they are home to spirits newly born and still very low on intellect and morals) and a succession of more and more advanced worlds to where spirits move as they are elevated. A spirit may choose to be born on a world inferior to his own as a [[penance]] or as a mission.

== New Age and Theosophy ==
The idea of karma was popularized in the [[Western world]] through the work of the [[Theosophical Society]]. In this conception, karma was a precursor to the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] ''law of return'' or ''Threefold Law,'' the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself. Colloquially this may be summed up as 'what goes around comes around.'

The Theosophist [[I. K. Taimni]] wrote that &quot;Karma is nothing but the Law of Cause and Effect operating in the realm of human life and bringing about adjustments between an individual and other individuals whom he has affected by his thoughts, emotions and actions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;I.K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when [[humans]] reincarnate they come back as humans only, not as [[animals]] or other [[organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;E.L. Gardner ''Reincarnation: Some Testimony From Nature'' 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

In the west, karma is often confused with concepts such as the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], psychic energy, [[synchronicity]] (a concept originally from psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], which says that things that happen at the same time are related), and ideas from [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] or theoretical physics (which most physicists would not grant as having any bearing on morality or codes of conduct, much less on supernatural notions). This mishmash of word associations is well illustrated by the once-common bumper sticker &quot;My karma ran over your dogma.&quot;

==Karma and emotions==
The modern view of karma, devoid of any spiritual exigencies, obviates the need for an acceptance of [[reincarnation]] in [[Judeochristian]] societies and attempts to portray karma as a universal psychological phenomenon which behaves predictably, like other physical forces such as [[gravity]].

[[Sakyong Mipham]] eloquently summed this up when he said; {{Quote|Like gravity, karma is so basic we often don't even notice it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/28647.Sakyong_Mipham GoodReads.com]. GoodReads.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view of karma, as a universal and personally impacting emotional constant, correlates with [[Buddhist]] and [[Jungian]] understanding that [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] (or [[libido]], created from personal and cultural biases) is the primary instigator of karma. Any conscious thought, word and/or action, arising from a cognitively unresolved emotion ([[cognitive dissonance]]), results in karma.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I declare, O Bhikkhus, that volition is Karma. Having willed one acts by body, speech, and thought.&quot; (Anguttara Nikaya)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jung]] once opined on unresolved emotions and the [[synchronicity]] of karma; {{Quote|'When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate.'&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. and Wolfgang Pauli, The Interpretation of Nature and Psyche, New York: Pantheon Books, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Popular methods for negating cognitive dissonance include [[meditation]], [[metacognition]], [[counselling]], [[psychoanalysis]], etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma. This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Buddha, at First Council of monks (approx. 544 b.c.e.): Bhikkhus, this is the one and the only way for the purification (of the minds) of beings, for overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the cessation of physical and mental pain, for attainment of the Noble Paths and for the realization of Nibbana. That (only way) is the four satipatthanas. What are these four? Here (in this teaching), bhikkhus, a bhikkhu (i.e. a disciple) dwells perceiving again and again the body (kaya) as just the body (not mine, not I, not self, but just a phenomenon) with diligence, clear understanding, and mindfulness, thus keeping away covetousness and mental pain in the world; he dwells perceiving again and again feelings (vedana) as just feelings (not mine, not I, not self but just as phenomena) with diligence, clear understanding, and mindfulness, thus keeping away covetousness and mental pain in the world; he dwells perceiving again and again the mind (citta) as just the mind (not mine, not I, not self but just a phenomenon) with diligence, clear understanding, and mindfulness, thus keeping away covetousness and mental pain in the world; he dwells perceiving again and again dhammas as just dhammas (not mine, not I, not self but just as phenomena) with diligence, clear understanding, and mindfulness, thus keeping away covetousness and mental pain in the world.&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent neuronal changes within the [[amygdala]] and left [[prefrontal cortex]] of the human brain attributed to long-term meditation and metacognition techniques have been proven scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Richard J., Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jessica Schumacher, Melissa Rosenkranz, Daniel Muller, Saki F. Santorelli, Ferris Urbanowski, Anne Harrington, Katherine Bonus, and John F. Sheridan. &quot;Alterations in Brain and Immune Function Produced by Mindfulness Meditation.&quot; Psychosomatic Medicine 65 (2003): 564–70&lt;/ref&gt; This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of [[Individuation]] or [[self-actualisation]]. Such [[peak experience]] are hypothetically devoid of any karma ([[nirvana]]).

As [[Rabindranath Tagore]] most eloquently explained about the heat of human emotions; {{Quote|Nirvana is not the blowing out of the candle. It is the extinguishing of the flame because day is come&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkexist.com/quotes/with/keyword/nirvana/ ThinkExist.com]. ThinkExist.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
