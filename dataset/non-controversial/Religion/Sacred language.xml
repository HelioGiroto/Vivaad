A '''sacred language''', &quot;'''holy language'''&quot; (in religious context), or '''liturgical language''', is a [[language]] that is cultivated for [[religion|religious]] reasons by people who speak another language in their daily life.

==Concept==
Once a language becomes associated with religious worship, its believers often ascribe virtues to the language of worship that they would not give to their native tongues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the case of sacred texts, there is a justified fear of losing authenticity and accuracy by a translation or re-translation, and difficulties in getting general acceptance for a new version of a text. The sacred language is typically vested with a solemnity and dignity that the vernacular lacks. Consequently, the training of clergy in the use of the sacred language becomes an important cultural investment, and their use of the tongue is perceived to give them access to a body of knowledge that untrained lay people cannot (or should not) access. In medieval Europe, the (real or putative) ability to read (see also [[benefit of clergy]]) scripture&amp;mdash;which was in Latin&amp;mdash;was considered a prerogative of the priesthood, and a benchmark of literacy; until near the end of the period almost all who could read and write could do so in Latin.

Because sacred languages are ascribed with virtues that the vernacular is not perceived to have, the sacred languages typically preserve characteristics that would have been lost in the course of language development. In some cases, the sacred language is a [[Extinct language|dead language]]. In other cases, it may simply reflect [[archaism|archaic]] forms of a living language. For instance, some 17th century elements of the English language remain current in [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] worship through the use of the ''[[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]]'' or older versions of the [[Anglican]] ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. In more extreme cases, the language has changed so much from the language of the [[sacred text]]s that the liturgy is no longer comprehensible without special training.

In some instances, the sacred language may not even be (or have been) native to a local population, that is, [[missionary|missionaries]] or [[pilgrim]]s may carry the sacred language to peoples who  never spoke it, and to whom it is an altogether alien language.

The concept of sacred languages is distinct from that of [[divine language]]s, which are languages ascribed to the divine (i.e. God or gods) and may not necessarily be natural languages. The concepts may however overlap, as expressed for example in ''[[Devanāgarī]]'', the name of a script that means &quot;urban(e) [script] of the deities.&quot;

==Buddhism==
[[Theravada]] Buddhism uses [[Pali language|Pali]] as its main liturgical language, and prefers its [[Pali Canon|scriptures]] to be studied in the original Pali.

[[Mahayana]] Buddhism makes little use of its original language, Sanskrit. An unusual form of liturgical language is found in some Japanese rituals where Chinese texts are read out or recited with the Japanese pronunciations of their constituent characters, resulting in something unintelligible in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Buswell|editor-first=Robert E.|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|year=2003|page=137|location=London|publisher=Macmillan}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, Pali is written using the Thai alphabet, resulting in a Thai monotone-like pronunciation of the Pali language. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan language]] is used, but mantras are in [[Sanskrit]].

==Christianity==
Christian rites, rituals, and ceremonies are not celebrated in one single sacred language. The Churches which trace their origin to the Apostles have continued to use the standard languages of the first few centuries AD.

These include:
* [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] in the [[Latin liturgical rites]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. (N.B. While Latin is still the official language of all formal works of the church, it has largely been replaced by the vernacular in liturgical use since 1964.)
* [[Koine Greek language|Koine Greek]] in several [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and [[Greek Catholic Church]]
* [[Church Slavonic]] in several [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]]
* [[Georgian language|Ancient Georgian]] in the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]
* [[Classical Armenian]] in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]
* [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Church]]
* [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in [[Coptic Christianity|Egyptian Christianity]]
* [[Syriac]] in [[Syriac Christianity]] represented by the [[Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], and [[Syrian Catholic Church]], and [[Syrian Orthodox Church]].

The extensive use of the [[Greek language|Greek]] in the Roman Liturgy has continued up to the present, in theory; it was used extensively on a regular basis during the Papal Mass, which has not been celebrated for some time. The continuous use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy came to be replaced in part by Latin by the reign of Pope Saint [[Damasus I]]. Gradually, the Roman Liturgy took on more and more Latin until, generally, only a few words of [[Hebrew]] and Greek remained. The adoption of Latin was further fostered when the [[Vetus Latina]] version of the [[Bible]] was edited and parts retranslated from the original Hebrew and Greek by [[Saint Jerome]] in his [[Vulgate]]. Latin continued as the Western Church's language of liturgy and communication. One simply practical reason for this may be that there were no standardized vernaculars throughout the Middle Ages. [[Church Slavonic]] was used for the celebration of the Roman Liturgy in the 9th century (twice, 867-873 and 880-885).

In the mid-sixteenth century the [[Council of Trent]] rejected a proposal to introduce [[national language]]s as this was seen, among other reasons, as potentially divisive to Catholic unity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The [[vernacular]] was used in the rite of the Roman Liturgy only among certain Roman Rite Slavs of Croatia and Dalmatia, for example in the so-called [[Missale Romanum Glagolitice]][http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06575b.htm].  The particular vernacular was also used in the inquiry of bride and bridegroom as to whether they accepted their marriage-vows itself.  

Jesuit missionaries to China had sought, and for a short time, received permission to translate the Roman Missal into scholarly Classical Chinese.  (See [[Chinese Rites controversy]]).  However, ultimately permission was revoked.  Among the Algonquin and Iroquois, the received permission to translate the propers of the Mass into the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Salvucci, Claudio R. 2008. ''The Roman Rite in the Algonquian and Iroquoian Missions''. Merchantville, NJ:Evolution Publishing. See also http://mysite.verizon.net/driadzbubl/IndianMasses.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th c., Pope Pius XII granted permission for a few vernaculars to be used in a few rites, rituals, and ceremonies. This did not include the Roman Liturgy of the Mass.

The [[Catholic Church]], long before the Second Œcumenical Council of the Vatican ('Vatican II') accepted and promoted the use of the non-vernacular liturgical languages listed above; vernacular (i.e. modern or native) languages were never used liturgically until 1964,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} when the first permissions were given for certain parts of the Roman Liturgy to be celebrated in certain approved vernacular translations. The use of vernacular language in liturgical practice created controversy for a majority of Catholics, and opposition to liturgical vernacular is a major tenet of the Catholic [[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditionalist]] movement.

In the twentieth century, Vatican II set out to protect the use of Latin as a liturgical language. To a large degree, its prescription was initially disregarded and the vernacular became not only standard, but generally used exclusively in the liturgy. Latin, which remains the chief language of the [[Roman Rite]], is the main language of the [[Roman Missal]] (the official book of liturgy for the Latin Rite) and of the [[Code of Canon Law]], and use of liturgical Latin is still encouraged. Large-scale papal ceremonies often make use of it. Meanwhile, the numerous [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] in union with Rome each have their own respective 'parent-language'. As a subsidiary issue, unrelated to liturgy, the Eastern Code of Canon Law, for the sake of convenience, has been promulgated in Latin.

[[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches are varied in use of liturgical languages within their Church services. [[Koine Greek]] and [[Church Slavonic]] are the main sacred languages used in the Churches of the Eastern Orthodox communion. However, The Eastern Orthodox Church permits other languages to be used for liturgical worship, and each country often will have the liturgical services in their own language. This has led to a wide variety of languages used for liturgical worship, but there is still uniformity in the liturgical worship itself. So one can attend an Orthodox service in another location and the service will be (relatively) the same.
Liturgical languages used in the Eastern Orthodox Church include (but are not limited to): [[Koine Greek]], [[Church Slavonic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese Language|Japanese]], many African dialects, and many other world languages.

[[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches regularly pray in the vernacular of the community within which a Church outside of its ancestral land is located. However some clergymen and communities prefer to retain their traditional language or use a combination of languages.

Many Anabaptist groups, such as the [[Amish]], continue to use High German in their worship despite not speaking it amongst themselves.

==Hinduism==
[[Hinduism]] is traditionally considered to have one liturgical language, [[Sanskrit]]. It is the language of the [[Veda]]s, [[Bhagavadgita]] and the [[Upanishad]]s, and various other liturgical texts such as the [[Sahasranama]], [[Shri Rudram Chamakam|Chamakam]] and [[Rudram]]. It is also the tongue of most Hindu rituals.

The people following [[Murugan|Kaumaram]], [[Sri Vaishnavism|Vainavam]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Shaivam]] sects of Tamil Nadu use [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as liturgical language along with [[Sanskrit]].  [[Divya Prabandha]] is chanted in most of the [[South India]]n [[Vishnu]] temples. Tamils consider their language to be sacred and divine with equal status to Sanskrit within temple rituals. The divya prabhandams and Devarams are referred to as Dravaida Vedam (Tamil Veda). A long standing myth states that Sanskrit and Tamil emerged from either side of Lord Shiva's divine drum of creation as he danced the dance of creation as Nataraja or sound of cosmic force.

==Islam==
[[Classical Arabic]] is the sacred language of Islam. It is the language of the Qur'an, and the native language of [[Muhammad]]. Like Latin in medieval Europe, [[Arabic]] shares both the role of intellectual language as well as the role of liturgical language in much of the [[Islamic world]]. Muslim history, particularly the [[Nizari-Ismailis]] of [[Khurasan]] and [[Badakhshan]], witnessed and experienced Persian as a liturgical language during the [[Alamut]] period(1094 to 1256 CE) and post-Alamut period (1256 to present).

==Judaism==
{{main|Lashon Hakodesh}}
The core of the [[Tanakh]] (the [[Hebrew Bible]]) is written in [[Classical Hebrew]], referred to by some [[Jew]]s as ''{{lang|he-Latn|Leshon Ha-Kodesh}}'' ({{lang|he|לשון הקודש}}), &quot;The Holy Language.&quot;

Hebrew remains the traditional language of [[Jewish services|Jewish religious services]], though its usage today varies by denomination: [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] services are, generally, entirely in Hebrew, [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] services make more use of the national language, and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] services usually fall somewhere in-between.

Aramaic too serves in traditional liturgy albeit in a very limited capacity.

==Lingayatism==
[[Kannada]] is the language of [[Lingayatism]], founded by Shri [[Basaveshwara]] and other [[sharana]]s. Most of the literature of this religion is in Kannada. Some literature of this religion is also found in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and Sanskrit.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
