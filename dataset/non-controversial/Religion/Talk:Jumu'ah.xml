==Untitled Comments==
I am not sure whether the Persian name here is a useful addition. The Friday prayer has a role not just in Iranian islam but in most Islamic societies and countries. I have therefore removed this particular bit. (for further use (In [[Persian language|Persian]]: &amp;#1606;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1586; &amp;#1580;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1607;)

Having said this I think the article would benefit from getting a specific political (and Iranian) slant, explaining the huge role of Friday prayers and Friday sermons in Iranian politics. [[User:Refdoc|Refdoc]] 22:22, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Article name ==

I strongly feel that this article should be located at its arabic name of Jumu'ah, as with all the other prayers. There is currently no article under &quot;Jumu'ah&quot;, not even a redirect to here, so it should be a simple matter of moving this article. Please comment. [[User:Zunaid|Zunaid]] 09:50, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:Yes I agree, but I wouldn't mind having a redirect either way. I will redirect this to Jumu'ah if no one else has any concerns. --[[user:Anonymous editor|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''a.n.o.n.y.m''']]  &lt;sup&gt;[[user talk:Anonymous editor| ''t'']]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:17, 11 November 2005 (UTC)


The picture in the article is not depicting a real &quot;Jumu'ah&quot; as in real &quot;Jumu'ah&quot; people pray together and their actions are synchronized. This is not an exaggeration but a real fact based on the practice of all Muslims around the world. This picture should depict actual prayer or at least a big gathering from a renouned Mosque.

== Article move ==

The article was moved back from Jumu'ah to Friday prayer. I feel it should stay at Jumu'ah. This is consistent with the naming of all the [[salat]] articles under their given names. Friday prayer is not &quot;also known as&quot; Jumu'ah, it is Jumu'ah that is also known as Friday prayer by those who do not perhaps know the term. The current location is inconsistent and more importantly, incorrect, and the article should be moved back to Jumu'ah.

The external links are for ''Friday prayer''.  Unlike ''jihad'', ''Jumu'ah'' is not ubiquitous and deserves translation.--[[User:Patchouli|Patchouli]] 23:05, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;Friday prayer&quot; is not a translation, it is a description. Imagine having Cairo under &quot;capital of Egypt&quot;. While accurate and unambiguous, it is still not the &quot;correct&quot; name, or even a translation (or transliteration) of the name into English. Geddit?

:Jumu'ah=Friday.--[[User:Patchouli|Patchouli]] 08:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

I think it would be better and more accurate for this article to be under &quot;Jumu'ah&quot; and have &quot;Friday Prayer&quot; redirect to it, rather than the other way around. In the Islamic vocabulary it is referred to as &quot;Jumu'ah&quot; and only as &quot;Friday Prayer&quot; by English-speaking non-Muslims, usually to avoid confusion in mass media presentation where actual education of the audience is not the priority. I think the officially used term of the people who actually participate in jumu'ah should have precedence, and to use the term &quot;Friday Prayer&quot; does a disservice to people who are actually trying to learn about the practices of Islam.

== Article name ==
The Arabic transliteration was incorrect on this page, i.e., it should be jum'a, and not jumu'a.  I changed the contents, but I don't know how to change the Article title. ([[User:7up|7up]] ([[User talk:7up|talk]]) 03:30, 18 July 2008 (UTC)).

== Reason for Friday ==

Some explanation of why Friday was designated as the day of prayer would be of interest. In Christianity  the special nature of Friday reflects commemoration of the crucifixion of Christ having occurred on that day. In Judaism, where traditionally days are considered  to begin at sunset, Friday evening marks the beginning of the Sabbath.   What is the reason for Friday as a day of prayer in Islam?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.225.189.76|76.225.189.76]] ([[User talk:76.225.189.76|talk]]) 11:12, 20 June 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:I'm glad you asked, Friday &quot;Jumu'ah&quot; which means ASSEMBLY has firm routs religion, it is known as the best of all days, in Islam the day of Jumu’ah has more importance then the two Eids, On this day Is the day Adam (PBUH) was made, on this day he died, on this day the end of the world will be. There is a date and a month I know of for the Judgement day but no year is given, it will be on a Friday 10 Muharam  but not sure how valid this date is. I think what I’ve just mentioned should be added by wiki on the main page of Jumu’ah. There are many books written on the importance of Jumu’ah. More info on Islam and other topics at United Muslim Nations International. PS Each of the last Prophets were given a day of Importance e.g. Sunday to Isa &quot;Jesus&quot; (PBUH), Friday to Mohammed Sallallahu Alaihi Wa'salaam. I hope I have given enough input other then this visit the Masjid and find out more.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/169.202.5.106|169.202.5.106]] ([[User talk:169.202.5.106|talk]]) 07:26, 3 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
