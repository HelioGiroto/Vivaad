Jerusalem has been the [[Jerusalem in Judaism|holiest city in Jewish tradition]] since, according to the [[Hebrew Bible]], King [[David]] of Israel first established it as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united Kingdom of Israel]] in c. 1000 BCE, and his son, King [[Solomon]], commissioned the building of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|First Temple]] in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;1000BCE&quot;&gt;Since the 10th century BCE:{{ref label|bible-david|v|a}}

In exile, the Jewish nation came to be identified with the city that had been the site of its ancient capital. Jews, wherever they were, prayed for its restoration.&quot; Roger Friedland, Richard D.

Today, the [[Positions on Jerusalem|status of Jerusalem]] remains one of the core issues in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], [[West Jerusalem]] was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while [[East Jerusalem]], including the Old City, was captured by [[Jordan]].

For example, the Jewish periods of the city's history are important to Israeli nationalists ([[Zionists]]), whose [[discourse]] suggests that modern Jews descend from the [[Israelites]] and [[Maccabees]],&lt;ref&gt;“No city in the world, not even Athens or Rome, ever played as great a role in the life of a nation for so long a time, as Jerusalem has done in the life of the Jewish people.” [[David Ben-Gurion]], 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“For three thousand years, Jerusalem has been the center of Jewish hope and longing. No other city has played such a dominant role in the history, culture, religion and consciousness of a people as has Jerusalem in the life of Jewry and Judaism. Throughout centuries of exile, Jerusalem remained alive in the hearts of Jews everywhere as the focal point of Jewish history, the symbol of ancient glory, spiritual fulfillment and modern renewal. This heart and soul of the Jewish people engenders the thought that if you want one simple word to symbolize all of Jewish history, that word would be ‘Jerusalem.’” [[Teddy Kollek]] (DC: Washington Institute For Near East Policy, 1990), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the Islamic, Christian and other non-Jewish periods of the city's history are important to [[Palestinian nationalism]], whose [[discourse]] suggests that modern [[Palestinians]] descend from all the different peoples who have lived in the region.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: [[Canaanites]], [[Jebusites]], [[Philistines]] from [[Crete]], Anatolian and [[Lydia]]n Greeks, [[Hebrews]], [[Amorites]], [[Edomites]], [[Nabateans]], [[Arameans]], [[Roman empire|Romans]], Arabs, and European [[Crusades|crusaders]], to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Hittites]], [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Babylonians]], and [[Mongols]], were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were as ravaging as the effects of major earthquakes&amp;nbsp;... Like shooting stars, the various cultures shine for a brief moment before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine. The people, however, survive.

In the five centuries following the Bar Kokhba revolt, the city remained under Roman then [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule.

The eastern continuation of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], maintained control of the city for years.

Following [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] [[Khosrau II]]'s early 7th century push into [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], advancing through Syria, Sassanid Generals [[Shahrbaraz]] and [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] attacked the Byzantine-controlled city of Jerusalem ({{lang-fa|Dej Houdkh}}).

Byzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab armies of Omar ibn Hattab in 634. Among [[Muslims]] of Islam's earliest era it was referred to as ''Madinat bayt al-Maqdis'' (&quot;City of the Temple&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Dov, M. ''Historical Atlas of Jerusalem''. Translated by David Louvish. New York: Continuum, 2002, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; which was restricted to the Temple Mount.

In 1099, The [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] ruler expelled the native Christian population before Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|conquered]] by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who massacred most of its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants when they took the solidly defended city by assault, after a period of siege, and left the city emptied of people; later the Crusaders created the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The city had been virtually emptied and recolonized by a variegated inflow of Greeks, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Georgians, Armenians, Syrians, Egyptians, Nestorians, Maronites, Jacobite Monophysites, Copts and others, to block the return of the surviving Muslims and Jews. The north-eastern quarter was repopulated with Eastern Christians from the Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J.

From 1250 to 1517, Jerusalem was ruled by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]s. During this period of time many clashes occurred between the Mamluks on one side and the crusaders and the [[Mongols]] on the other side. The area also suffered from many earthquakes and [[Black Death|black plague]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some European Christian presence was maintained in the city by the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]].

===Early modern period===
[[File:DavtowerS.jpg|thumb|David's Citadel and the Ottoman walls]]
In 1517, Jerusalem and environs fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], who generally remained in control until 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;century1&quot;/&gt; Jerusalem enjoyed a prosperous period of renewal and peace under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] – including the rebuilding of magnificent walls around the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. Throughout much of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem remained a provincial, if religiously important center, and did not straddle the main trade route between [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Cohen. &quot;Economic Life in Ottoman Jerusalem&quot;; Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The English reference book ''Modern history or the present state of all nations'' written in 1744 stated that &quot;Jerusalem is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern history or the present state of all nations|last=Salmon|first=Thomas|page=461|year=1744|url=http://books.google.com/?id=f7I-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA534&amp;dq=palestine#v=onepage&amp;q=palestine&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans brought many innovations: modern postal systems run by the various consulates and regular stagecoach and carriage services were among the first signs of modernization in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;[http://jeru.huji.ac.il/eh1.htm The Jerusalem Mosaic], Hebrew University, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 19th century, the Ottomans constructed the first paved road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and by 1892 the railroad had reached the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;

===Modern period===
[[File:Ben Zakai.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ben-Zakai Synagogue in 1893]]
With the annexation of Jerusalem by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city. In 1836, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] allowed Jerusalem's Jewish residents to restore four major synagogues, among them the [[Hurva Synagogue|Hurva]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]], Qasim al-Ahmad led his forces from [[Nablus]] and attacked Jerusalem, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, entered the city on 31 May 1834.

Ottoman rule was reinstated in 1840, but many Egyptian Muslims remained in Jerusalem and Jews from [[Algiers]] and North Africa began to settle in the city in growing numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt; In the 1840s and 1850s, the international powers began a tug-of-war in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the region's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through consular representatives in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Judaica'', Jerusalem, Keter, 1978, Volume 9, &quot;State of Israel (Historical Survey)&quot;, pp. 304–306&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prussian consul, the population in 1845 was 16,410, with 7,120 Jews, 5,000 Muslims, 3,390 Christians, 800 Turkish soldiers and 100 Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt; The volume of Christian pilgrims increased under the Ottomans, doubling the city's population around Easter time.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, new neighborhoods began to develop outside the Old City walls to house pilgrims and relieve the intense overcrowding and poor sanitation inside the city.

Until the 1880s there were no formal [[orphanage]]s in Jerusalem, as families generally took care of each other. In 1881 the [[Diskin Orphanage]] was founded in Jerusalem with the arrival of Jewish children orphaned by a Russian [[pogrom]].

The war of 1948 resulted in Jerusalem being divided, with the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] lying entirely on the Jordanian side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|line]]. A no-man's land between East and West Jerusalem came into being in November 1948: [[Moshe Dayan]], commander of the Israeli forces in Jerusalem, met with his Jordanian counterpart [[Abdullah el Tell]] in a deserted house in Jerusalem’s [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara]] neighborhood and marked out their respective positions: Israel’s position in red and Jordan's in green. This rough map, which was not meant as an official one, became the final [[Green Line (Israel)|line]] in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], which divided the city and left [[Mount Scopus]] as an Israeli [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] inside [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jposttravel.com/jerusalem_tours/FormerIsrael1008.html|title=No Man's Land|publisher=Jposttravel.com|accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbed wire and concrete barriers ran down the center of the city, passing close by [[Jaffa Gate]] on the western side of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]], and a crossing point was established at [[Mandelbaum Gate]] slightly to the north of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]].

After 1948, since the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] in its entirety was to the east of the armistice line, [[Jordan]] was able to take control of all the holy places therein, and contrary to the terms of the armistice agreement, denied Jews access to Jewish holy sites, many of which were desecrated.

In 1967, despite Israeli pleas that Jordan remain neutral during the [[Six-Day War]], [[Six-Day War#West Bank|Jordanian forces attacked Israeli-held West Jerusalem on the war's second day]]. After hand to hand fighting between Israeli and Jordanian soldiers on the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Israel Defense Force]] captured East Jerusalem, along with the entire West Bank.

Jewish and Christian access to the holy sites inside the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] was restored.

The old quarter was thus extended into the Mughrabi Harat Abu Sa'ud, and other quarters steeped in Arab and Palestinian history.

[[Mount Herzl]], at the western side of the city near the [[Jerusalem Forest]], serves as the national cemetery of Israel.

===Climate===
The city is characterized by a [[Mediterranean climate]], with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation. January is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of {{convert|9.1|°C|1|abbr=on}}; July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of {{convert|24.2|°C|1|abbr=on}}, and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around {{convert|550|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Demographics==

===Demographic history===
{{Main|Demographic history of Jerusalem}}
Jerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000 year history. Since medieval times, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem has been divided into [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish]], [[Muslim Quarter|Muslim]], [[Christian Quarter|Christian]], and [[Armenian Quarter|Armenian quarters]].

Most population data pre-1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the [[Jerusalem District]].&lt;ref&gt;Usiel Oskar Schmelz, in Ottoman Palestine, 1800-1914: studies in economic and social history, Gad G. Gilbar, Brill Archive, 1990 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdYUAAAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates suggest that since the end of the [[Crusades]], Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century. 

Between 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became a majority of the population.

===Current demographics===
In December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—64% were Jewish, 32% Muslim, and 2% Christian.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa-40th&quot;/&gt; At the end of 2005, the population density was {{convert|5750.4|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st02_14.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]|title=Population and Density per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Localities Numbering Above 5,000 Residents on 31 XII 2005|year=2006|accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim [[birth rate]], and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/09/26/mideast.jerusalem.reut/index.html &quot;Arab population growth outpaces Jews in Jerusalem&quot;] Reuters, 26 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kiryat sanz.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ezrat Torah]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] neighborhood]]
In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high [[birth rate]], especially in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] and [[Arab people|Arab]] communities. Consequently, the [[total fertility rate]] in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt; This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades. In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3254277,00.html|publisher=YNet|title=Jerusalem: More tourists, fewer Jews|accessdate=10 March 2007|last=Sel|first=Neta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] are leaving in higher numbers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past 7 years (2012).

In 2009, the percentage of Haredim in the city was increasing. As of 2009, out of 150,100 schoolchildren, 59,900 or 40% are in state-run secular and [[Religious Zionism|National Religious]] schools, while 90,200 or 60% are in Haredi schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/165421|title=Most Jerusalemites Attend Hareidi-Religious Schools|publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]|accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1086819.html|title=Most of Jerusalem's non-Jewish children live below poverty line|author=Nadav Shragai|publisher=Haaretz|date=21 May 2009|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some Israelis see Jerusalem as poor, rundown and riddled with religious and political tension, the city has been a magnet for Palestinians, offering more jobs and opportunity than any city in the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip]]. Palestinian officials have encouraged Arabs over the years to stay in the city to maintain their claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-orthodox5jun05,1,1841144.story?page=2&amp;coll=la-util-nationworld-world|title=Clashing values alter a city's face|author=Richard Boudreaux|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/weekinreview/13myre.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=Israeli Riddle: Love Jerusalem, Hate Living There|author=Greg Myre|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=13 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinians are attracted to the access to jobs, [[health care|healthcare]], [[social security]], other benefits, and [[quality of life]] Israel provides to Jerusalem residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-barrier4jun04,1,5137437.story?coll=la-util-nationworld-world|title=Change cast in concrete|author=Ken Ellingwood|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab residents of Jerusalem who choose not to have Israeli citizenship are granted an Israeli identity card that allows them to pass through checkpoints with relative ease and to travel throughout Israel, making it easier to find work. Residents also are entitled to the subsidized healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighborhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as [[Hadassah Medical Center]] are available to residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-barrier4jun04,1,5853828,full.story|title=Change cast in concrete|author=Ken Ellingwood|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=22 July 2009|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the [[Jerusalem Development Authority]] proposed expanding city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;laub2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120200463_pf.html|title=Jerusalem Barrier Causes Major Upheaval|date=2 December 2006|publisher=The Associated Press via The Washington Post|last=Laub|first=Karin|accessdate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. The Jewish birthrate recently overtook the Arab birthrate. Currently, the city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/InJerusalem/CityFront/Article.aspx?id=270431&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/155980#.UDHgZt2PX_k&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully  Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived  in the previously exclusively Jewish neighborhood of [[Pisgat Zeev]] and constituted three percent of the population in [[Neve Yaakov]]. In the [[French Hill]] East Jerusalem Jewish neighborhood, which was built after Israeli occupation, Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjp.org/page.aspx?id=206230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban planning issues===
Critics of [[Judaization of Jerusalem|efforts to promote a Jewish majority]] in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Hodgkins, &quot;The Judaization of Jerusalem – Israeli Policies Since 1967&quot;; PASSIA publication No. 101, December 1996, (English, Pp. 88)&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[World Bank]] report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighborhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and &quot;the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators&quot; than Jewish violators of the permit process.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank&quot;/&gt; In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the [[City of David]] archaeological park in the 60% Arab neighborhood of [[Silwan]] (adjacent to the Old City),&lt;ref&gt;Meron Rapoport.[http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=530047&amp;contrassID=1 Land lords]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}; Haaretz, 20 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Tolerance]] on [[Mamilla]] cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank&quot;&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WestBankrestrictions9Mayfinal.pdf &quot;Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency&quot;]; World Bank Technical Team, 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esther Zandberg.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/825662.html &quot;The architectural conspiracy of silence&quot;]; Haaretz, 24 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents view such urban planning moves as geared towards the [[Judaization of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Allison Hodgkins.

The Jerusalem [[city council|City Council]] is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, [[Uri Lupolianski]], was elected in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;corridors&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1173879092720&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=28 March 2007|date=15 March 2007|title=Corridors of Power: A tale of two councils|last=Cidor|first=Peggy}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 2008 city elections, [[Nir Barkat]] came out as the winner and is now the mayor. Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was [[Teddy Kollek]], who spent 28 years—-six consecutive terms-—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;corridors&quot;/&gt; Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jerusalem Becomes A Battleground Over Gay Rights Vs.

The headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at [[Safra Square]] (''Kikar Safra'') on [[Jaffa Road]]. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 moved from the [[Jerusalem Historical City Hall Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/site_form_atar_eng.asp?site_id=147&amp;pic_cat=2&amp;icon_cat=6&amp;york_cat=7|publisher=The Municipality of Jerusalem|accessdate=24 April 2007|title=Safra Square – City Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city falls under the [[Jerusalem District]], with Jerusalem as the district's capital.

==Political status==
{{See also|Positions on Jerusalem}}

Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] passed by the UN in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a [[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]] administered by the United Nations. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the [[Arab Higher Committee]] in Palestine and the [[Arab League]]) rejected it, opposing any partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Palestinian refugees in Jordan 1948–1957|last=Plascov|first=Avi|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-3120-2|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=daLPXTYcoewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jerusalem question, 1917–1968|last=Bovis|first=H.

The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty in the city.
On 5 December 1949, the State of Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's capital,&lt;ref name=&quot;ben-gurion&quot;/&gt; and since then all branches of the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]]—[[Politics of Israel#Legislative branch|legislative]], [[Politics of Israel#Judicial system|judicial]], and [[Politics of Israel#Prime Ministers and governments in the last ten years|executive]]—have resided there, except for the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]], located at [[HaKirya]] in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4181.IH:|publisher=The Library of Congress|title=Jerusalem and Berlin Embassy Relocation Act of 1998|accessdate=12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the proclamation, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan and thus only West Jerusalem was proclaimed Israel's capital. Following the Six-Day War, Israel annexed East Jerusalem, and a provision stipulating that the city was the united capital of Israel was added to the country's Basic Law.&lt;ref name=&quot;basiclaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1980_1989/Basic%20Law-%20Jerusalem-%20Capital%20of%20Israel|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=2 April 2007|date=30 July 1980|title=Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not internationally recognised as the Israeli capital, and its status is one of the central controversies in the Middle East.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]], passed on 20 August 1980, declared that the Basic Law was &quot;null and void and must be rescinded forthwith&quot;. Member states were advised to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem as a punitive measure. Most of the remaining countries with embassies in Jerusalem complied with the resolution by relocating them to Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Currently, there are no embassies located within the city limits of Jerusalem, although there are embassies in [[Mevaseret Zion]], on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and four consulates in the city itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;foreign-embassies&quot;/&gt; In 1995, the United States Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which required, subject to conditions, that that country's embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ45/content-detail.html|title=Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=15 February 2007|date=8 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] have argued that Congressional resolutions regarding the status of Jerusalem are merely advisory. The Constitution reserves foreign relations as an executive power, and as such, the United States embassy is still in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/print/20020930-8.html|title=Statement on FY 2003 Foreign Relations Authorization Act|accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2009, United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] warned that Jerusalem must be the capital of both Israel and Palestine if peace is to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=32762&amp;Cr=jerusalem&amp;Cr1=|title=Jerusalem must be capital of both Israel and Palestine, Ban says|publisher=United Nations|date=28 October 2009|accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]]. The Palestinian Authority claims all of East Jerusalem, including the [[Temple Mount]], as the capital of the [[State of Palestine]], and claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an [[open city]].&lt;ref name=PalestinianPosition&gt;In the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]'s [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] of 1988, Jerusalem is stated to be the capital of the [[State of Palestine]]. In 2000 the [[Palestinian Authority]] passed a law designating the city as such, and in 2002 this law was ratified by Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]]. See [http://english.people.com.cn/200210/06/eng20021006_104530.shtml Arafat Signs Law Making Jerusalem Palestinian Capital], People's Daily, published 6 October 2002; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2302961.stm Arafat names Jerusalem as capital], BBC News, published 6 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister [[Moshe Kahlon]] said that the bill sent &quot;a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided&quot;, and that &quot;all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over {{sic|it's}} capital are mistaken and misleading&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tzippe Barrow|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2010/October/Bill-to-Grant-Jerusalem-Priority-Status/|title=Bill to Grant Jerusalem Priority Status – Inside Israel – CBN News – Christian News 24–7|publisher=CBN.com|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government precinct and national institutions===
Many national institutions of Israel are located in [[Kiryat HaMemshala]] in [[Givat Ram]] in Jerusalem as a part of the [[Kiryat HaLeom|Kiryat HaLeom project]] which is intended to create a large district that will house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. Some government buildings are located in [[Kiryat HaMemshala (East Jerusalem)|Kiryat HaMemshala in East Jerusalem]].

Prior to the creation of the State of Israel, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of the [[British Mandate for Palestine]], which included present-day Israel and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem as administrative capital of the British Mandate:

As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of [[Levi Eshkol]] extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm|title=Jerusalem in International Diplomacy|author=[[Dore Gold]]|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Israel ordered the closure of [[Orient House]], home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], for security reasons.

The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem.

Due to its proximity to the city, especially the [[Temple Mount]], [[Abu Dis]], a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, Mitchell G.

Jerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protecting Jerusalem's Holy Sites: A Strategy for Negotiating a Sacred Peace|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2 October 2006|edition=1st|last=Guinn|first=David E.|isbn=0-521-86662-6|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy.

[[File:Holy sepulchre Anastasis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]
Jerusalem has been sacred to the Jews since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE.

Many Jews have &quot;[[Mizrah|Mizrach]]&quot; plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;returning&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish injunction to pray toward Jerusalem comes in the ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' section of ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (94:1) – &quot;When one rises to pray anywhere in the Diaspora, he should face towards the Land of Israel, directing himself also toward Jerusalem, the Temple, and the Holy of Holies.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity reveres Jerusalem not only for its [[Old Testament]] history but also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the [[New Testament]], Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]]: &quot;And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought [Jesus] to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;&quot; ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2:22)&lt;/ref&gt; and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]]: &quot;And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;&quot; ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 11:15)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cenacle]], believed to be the site of Jesus' [[Last Supper]], is located on [[Mount Zion]] in the same building that houses the [[David's Tomb|Tomb of King David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem in the Time of the Crusades|last=Boas|first=Adrian J.|publisher=Routledge|date=12 October 2001|isbn=0-415-23000-4|page=112|chapter=Physical Remains of Crusader Jerusalem|quote=The interesting, if not reliable illustrations of the church on the round maps of Jerusalem show two distinct buildings on Mount Zion: the church of St Mary and the Cenacle (Chapel of the Last Supper) appear as separate buildings. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Life of Jesus|last=Endo|first=Shusaku|authorlink=Shusaku Endo|isbn=0-8091-2319-3|year=1999|editor=Richard A.

==High-rise construction==
Jerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a [[skyscraper]] by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporis.com/statistics/tallest-buildings-jerusalem-israel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporis.com/building/holylandtower2-jerusalem-israel&lt;/ref&gt;

A new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Towers reaching up to 24 stories will be built along [[Jaffa Road]] and [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George Street]]. At the entrance to the city, near the [[Jerusalem Chords Bridge]] and the [[Jerusalem Central Bus Station|Central Bus Station]], 12 skyscrapers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an [[Jerusalem Binyanei HaUma Railway Station|underground train station]] serving a new express line between Jerusalem and [[Tel Aviv]], and will be connected by bridges and underground tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/jerusalem-skyline-to-undergo-massive-transformation-with-12-new-skyscrapers.premium-1.458031&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/jerusalem-reaches-for-the-heavens-1.347554&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=281153&lt;/ref&gt; The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;http://israelity.com/2011/03/07/a-revitalized-downtown-jerusalem-with-skyscrapers/&lt;/ref&gt;
