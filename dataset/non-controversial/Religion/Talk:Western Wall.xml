:A search came up with this [http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=167 Dr. Shmuel Berkovitz, an attorney, an expert on Jerusalem and a research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies].

I am concerned about the use of descriptors like &quot;nowadays&quot; and &quot;in olden times&quot; peppered throughout this article.  It is not good style.

And who is he to claim that the wall just became significant for Muslims in the past 100 years? He is jewish and of course he is biased to his own Zionist clan. It should be taken out.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.147.172.22|99.147.172.22]] ([[User talk:99.147.172.22|talk]]) 04:11, 9 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== GA-Class? ==

The article has come along way since when it was given B-Class in July 2007: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Wall&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=147358774] (It then had 6 references!) [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 00:49, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
:Excellent point. This article looks close to GA to me too. One item I think of is that the lead could use a little expansion, it should maybe double or triple. One way I think it could expand is to include a sentence to introduce each section and subsection. Just an idea. Then someone has to be there to tweak the prose according to the reviewers comments. Are you going to nominate it? Regards, [[User_talk:DVD R W|dvdrw]] 00:57, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
:Looking through the history, I see that you added many of the refs. I think you should nominate it if you are ready for the review. It looks good to me. [[User_talk:DVD R W|dvdrw]] 01:03, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

::Al Buraq, the Moslem name, should be in the lead. The section dealing on this aspect is written in a way that downplays Islamic traditions associated with this section of the wall, unnecessarily, and needs some work on it to achieve NPOV.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 17:45, 5 October 2008 (UTC)
:::There is confusion in the Siege of Jerusalem section between the western retaining wall of the Temple enclosure, which is what this article is about, and the western boundary wall of the city of Jerusalem, which is what Josephus is talking about. It was this city wall that was spared by the Romans - the text makes specific reference to the &quot;wall as enclosed the city on the west side&quot;. The bracketed words [in the Upper City] do not appear in the Josephus text. I would strongly recommend you remove the statement that the Western Wall was spared, also the whole Josephus quote. The destruction of the Temple is dealt with by Josephus in Wars of the Jews, Book VI, Chs IV and V. [[User:Brianboulton|Brianboulton]] ([[User talk:Brianboulton|talk]]) 18:49, 5 October 2008 (UTC)

== POV issues, likely serious ==
This article should raise alarm bells on POV. For instance, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wall#1929_Palestine_riots the events of 1929] are treated in a seriously distorted fashion, the article currently says: 

''On August 14, 1929, after attacks on individual Jews praying at the Wall, 6,000 Jews demonstrated in Tel Aviv, shouting “The Wall is ours.” The next day, the Jewish fast of Tisha B'Av, 300 youths raised the Zionist flag and sang the Zionist anthem at the Wall.[30] The day after, on August 16, an organized mob of 2,000 Muslim Arabs descended on the Western Wall, injuring the beadle and burning prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town and was followed a few days later by the infamous Hebron massacre.[33]''

Even the most highly regarded Israeli historians give a much more nuanced impression than this - Benny Morris in &quot;Rightous Victims&quot; says that the Muslims long feared a violent take-over of the Wall - p.112 ''&quot;the Palestinian delegation to Mecca during the hajj, or pilgrimage, of 1922 had declared: &quot;the Holy Places are in great danger on account of the horrible Zionist aggressions&quot;''.

Morris doesn't mention any attacks on &quot;individual Jews&quot; on Aug 14th 1929 (and I don't see a reference for this). Rather, he infers that organised and/or mass violence was brought to the Wall (and for the first time?) by the Zionists, starting the following day with: ''&quot;hundreds of Jews - some of them extremist members of Betar, carrying batons - demonstrated on the site&quot;''. Benny Morris (a very, very long way from being a friend of the Palestinians!) says things like: ''&quot;In 1928 the Muslims sought British confirmation of their traditional rights at the Wall, after all, they owned the Wall and the adjacent passage where the Jews worshipped.[226 Porath, 1976] ... Right-wing Zionists began to demand Jewish control of the Wall&quot;.

I'm also very alarmed at statements like this ''&quot;In October 1928, the Grand Mufti organised a series of provocations against the Jews who prayed at the Wall. He ordered new construction next to and above the Wall, with bricks often falling on the worshippers below. The volume of the muezzin was turned up while the Jews were praying.[31]&quot;'' being referenced to &quot;The Case For Israel&quot;, a polemical work that, amongst other things, appears to justify torture and communal punishment. There seems no doubt that the construction work did interfere with worship - but we should be absolutely sure of our facts before claiming it was done provocatively to damage race relations. The Mufti, for all his faults, has too long been used as a propaganda bogeyman with the most absurd exaggeration of his influence. We reference the distinguished historian &lt;s&gt;(who specialises somewhat in Israel)&lt;/s&gt; and convinced Zionist [[Martin Gilbert]] - but only for the trivial statement ''&quot;The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town and was followed a few days later by the infamous Hebron massacre.[33]&quot;''. Again, alarm bells ring - where's his real scholarly input? [[User:PalestineRemembered|PR]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:PalestineRemembered|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:49, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

Congratulations, this article is now at GA-class. [[User:Pyrotec|Pyrotec]] ([[User talk:Pyrotec|talk]]) 19:06, 10 October 2008 (UTC)
:I've only documented from RS the POV problems at one section, but problems are clearly evident in several other places. The lead is seriously distorted - the statement &quot;''an important Jewish religious site located in the Old City of Jerusalem which is also of significance to Islam&quot;'' is probably the reverse of the situation - 3/4s of what's now visible was put there by Muslims, some of it relatively recently. The pre-1967 section &quot;Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there&quot; looks like Hasbara - access was not restricted by religion, whatever restrictions were placed on holders of Israeli passports. [[User:PalestineRemembered|PR]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:PalestineRemembered|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:42, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

::Whoa! Why did you pass the article when POV issues have been raised? In addition to the occasional POV, the &quot;Wall in Islam&quot; section is way to small. It briefly mentions what Muslims consider the wall to be and the remainder of the section is basically questioning whether or not the wall is holy in Islam or not. There is no mention of Palestinian or Israeli Arab visitation and prayer at the wall and although the restrictions that Jordan placed on Israelis is mentioned, I see nothing on the restrictions Israel places on Palestinians who wish to pray at the Wall. The POV issue was raised by PR and Nishidani before him, but were not addressed. POV is a major issue and should not be dismissed without discussion. Is it so hard just to fix it for the overall quality of the article? Those are two major issues that have been bypassed: '''NPOV''' and '''Broadness'''. Also, the Mufti issue was not addressed and the &quot;Rabbis of the Wall&quot; sub-sub section either should be merged with the main section or removed from the article. The &quot;Structural damage&quot; section should definitely be expanded. If these problems are ignored and are not addressed soon, then the article which is of a relatively good quality will be nominated for reassessment. --[[User:Al Ameer son|Al Ameer son]] ([[User talk:Al Ameer son|talk]]) 21:41, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

:::What is in the article is verifiable through references and in-line citations. The minor deficiencies that I raised in the GAR have been addressed quickly to my satisfaction. [[User:PalestineRemembered|PR]] only raised questions, at 16:40 today, of POV about one small section that was a very minor portion of the article. He has not attempted to &quot;correct&quot; what is seen as POV, but has done other edits since. The latest points of POV raised by PR are a matter of emphasis, e.g, should it read &quot;an important Jewish religious site located in the Old City of Jerusalem which is also of significance to Islam&quot;, or &quot;an important Islamic religious site located in the Old City of Jerusalem which is also of significance to Israel&quot;, or some middle way? I don't have a strong view on that point and it appears that PR's view is not sufficiently strong to impel a &quot;correction&quot; of the perceived POV. The article will be at GA-level regardless of how the emphasis is laid in that particular sentence. The second claim of POV is an alleged distinction between &quot;discrimination&quot; by religion versus discrimination by PassPort holder, but no supporting evidence has been provided yet to back up the claim.

:::[[User:Al Ameer son|Al Ameer son]] has raised a number of points about perceived omissions from the article and gives helpful examples on how the article might be improved. There does not appear to be any recent evidence of edit wars, so I must presume that those editors who claim to see lack of balance in the article do not wish to improve the article themselves; and I don't understand why that should be so. Can I suggest that both editors expand the sections / subsections that they consider in need of expansion, adding adequate references and in-line citations to enable their statements to be verified. Again, expanding the &quot;structural damage&quot; section has no bearing on the Broadness of the article, or whether the article is at GA-class or not. The riots in February 2007 over a wall built in 19 BCE could be &quot;down played&quot; as a very recent event, but POV in this section would be unwise bearing in mind the sensitivities of the wall. However, you are welcome to expand that section, subject to the constraint of [[WP:Verify]].[[User:Pyrotec|Pyrotec]] ([[User talk:Pyrotec|talk]]) 22:47, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

::::I'm not an expert on this business, and I am more usefully engaged elsewhere. However, I can tell you of (and prove that) some parts of the article are severely POV - and I can point out one of the major problems, atrocious sources. We use a sensational passage from a book that was publicly discredited - in Scarborough Country on Sep 8th, 2003 the author of &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; said &quot;''I will give $10,000 to the P.L.O. in your name if you can find historical fact in my book that you can prove to be false&quot;''. Go [http://www.democracynow.org/2003/9/24/scholar_norman_finkelstein_calls_professor_alan here for the challenge made and proved], (relevant part at minute 27.0 but lots that's significant) in a radio exchange that resulted 16 days later, Sept 24, 2003. (It's also on YouTube somewhere). According to p.80 of &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; book, &quot;between 2,000 and 3,000 Arabs fled their homes&quot; where Morris says 200,000 to 300,000 (p.256 of &quot;Righteous Victims&quot;). The $10,000 was never paid - hardly surprising, when the book stands credibly accused of &quot;appropriates large swathes&quot; from another hoax book - and then &quot;goes one better ... cites absurd sources or stitches evidence out of whole cloth&quot;. There is another apparently wholly unjustifiable claim in the book at p.126, also mentioned at the debate. We use this source to claim that the Islamic establishment deliberately provoked the Jews by doing work on the wall? The allegation doesn't make any sense unless you suppose that Islam didn't care much for the wall - an astoundingly insulting and totally false insinuation. With adherence to Reliable Sources Policy so poor, there can be no way this article does the project credit. The article can only have been written as Hasbara, and it takes no more than a glance over it for this to be obvious. [[User:PalestineRemembered|PR]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:PalestineRemembered|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:10, 11 October 2008 (UTC)
:::::I will read Morris, but if this article is [[Hasbara]] why don't you attempt to balance it? I don't see why, for instance one of the passages mentioned could be changed to (for instance) &quot;thousands of Arabs fled their homes: two to three thousand according to Ref 1, or 200 to 300 thousand according to ref 2&quot; and the necessary sources provided; there are also many other ways that sentence could be rewritten. WikiPedia works on [[WP:Consensus]], you have the power like any other editor to change/improve articles, subject to the [[WP:verify]]. You can also do it now; if I do it, it will not happen until I get hold of a copy of Morris, read it and decide what changes need to be made.[[User:Pyrotec|Pyrotec]] ([[User talk:Pyrotec|talk]]) 10:03, 11 October 2008 (UTC)

If in fact 200,000 were told to leave instead of 2,000, that strengthens my argument. That is the argument that I make. If the book says 2,000 to 3,000 there were only two explanations. Either it is a '''typographical error''' or I have to check the book obviously, I was referring to '''a smaller phase'''.

::::::::There is no way this book could ever be an RS, it's a polemic, some of it &quot;extreme&quot; in the usual sense of the word eg discussing good ways to torture - needles inserted under the finger-nails (sterilized needles, of course). The author knew there would be problems and attempted to choose the battleground (and confuse the issue) by offering a $10,000 prize to anyone who could find an error. He proceeds to hog the interview but two clear errors are brought to his attention in the time available. In actual fact, errors are not really all that significant - it's the polemical problems which are really serious, particularly claiming to be quoting established human rights organisations and failing to do so (sorry, this from memory, get back to you presently if you're puzzled).

Why not join and help improve the article and remove the [[Hasbara]] that you see in it. Making statements about the &quot;acceptability&quot;, or otherwise, of book authors used as sources is hardly [[WP:NPOV]].

::::::::::::PR, how can you say that a sentence that previously read: ''“In October 1928, the Grand Mufti organised a series of provocations against the Jews who prayed at the Wall”'', still lacks NPOV when reworded to: ''“From October 1928 onward, Amin al-Husayni, the new Grand Mufti, organised a series of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs”''? Whether or nor these works were done deliberately as a provocation is not inferable from the revision (ref. 36 does state: ''“deliberately antagonised”''). The fact is that the Jews saw them as a provocation. Mention of the falling bricks, unintentional as they may be, show why the Jews felt disturbed during their prayers. Since the Muslims believed they had exclusive rights, they tried to demonstrate this fact? There were a number of commissions to determine what rights both groups indeed had. We should not second-guess that the Muslims '''“had”''' exclusive rights here. The ''&quot;tried to establish Muslim rights”'' ref. quote you find disturbing because they “have never been doubted” is just your POV. Did the Jews doubt the Muslims rights to the Wall? Most certainly. Let’s stop the nit-picking and try to bang out a version that is suitable to everyone. Thanks. [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 15:19, 13 October 2008 (UTC)

According to the article, only the top 3 rows were added by a Muslim. The first 7 are Herodian, the next 4 were “added by Umayyads”. This means during that period, maybe by Jews? Even if it was done at the behest of a Muslim governor, it is doubtful that it was done to enhance the significance of the site. It was probably general maintenance, as layers of the same period are also found on the southern wall. The next 14 rows were added at the request of the Jew Monrefiore. Provide infomation which would change the wording to something stronger than &quot;significance&quot;. Is it holy because a winged steed was teathered there? (NB. I read a hadith that said Buraq was tied to the Sakrah). I think the lead should give more weight to Judaism as it has gained the status of the holiest and most venerated Jewish site.

::How ''do'' we know that &quot;the Wall was very, very, very significant to Muslims?&quot; If this is true, we need it to be included. I have come accross the following: ''In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam,&quot; there is no mention of the Western Wall in relation to Al-Burak. In the entry under Hara al Sharif, the wall is called the &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; without any reference to it's being sacred to Islam. Official guidebooks issued by the Waqf as recently as 1990 say nothing about the Western Wall being significant to Islam. A British commission of inquiry into the riots of 1929 issued an official finding of fact that the Muslims never used the wall as a prayer site and it was &quot;never sacred to Islam.&quot;'' [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 22:23, 12 October 2008 (UTC)
:::If I'm wrong on this score, then I'm wrong. But I can hardly see how it's not highly significant to Muslims, because they'd mostly built it, and we know how very upset they were that the Zionists were intent on seizing it. The Umayyads are the first Caliphate. Part of the problem we've got is the Hasbara mindset we're having imposed on us by which Islam and Judaism are completely distinct and that they hate each other.

Hmm. If the bulk of the wall is Herodian (look at the size of the courses), how could it be mostly built by Muslims? Herod predated the formation of Islam by around 600 to 700 years. As for being upset, isn't it not more likely that they were upset at losing any ground to the Jews in 1948 and 1967, as opposed to the wall having any inherent sanctity to Islam? The wall's discussion in Lamnetations Rabbah, which is Mishnaic in origin and thus predates the formation of Islam by around 400 years or so, does indicate reliably that it was very important to Jews centuries before Islam existed. -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] ([[User talk:Avraham|talk]]) 04:27, 13 October 2008 (UTC)
:Well, I'm not sure now. The Muslims have clearly resented, very bitterly, the suggestion they hand the wall over - the pressure for which became violent by 1922 at the latest (cf Morris). We seem to have nothing to indicate that the space in front of the wall, and the surface of it, has any religious significance to Islam, though the wall itself, as a margin of the Temple Mount can hardly not be significant. I'm in no position to explain the Muslim position, what I can tell everyone is that, to the &quot;passer-by&quot; there's a noticeable hole.
:And to anyone who knows anything of the other history, the whole article looks highly lop-sided. The Military Government of the British (Allensby, Bols) was/were profoundly irritated by the Zionists - but Colonel Storrs, their subordinate in Jerusalem, turned a blind eye to Jabotinsky ''&quot;seems scarcely credible ... openly drilling at the back of Lemel School and on Mount Scopas [sic] ... no word of it reached either the Governorate or the Administration until after the riots.&quot;''(The Palin Report, p.68 cited Huneidi).

::::I.e. that 'exclusive' is editorial POV, whoever put it in.

::Neither of these comments is helpful. Or be specific or . . The whole area was under waqf property arrangements, and it was Moslem property for 1400 years. It is not an insult to remark that.  Israel in 1967 simply asserted the right of conquest to a holy place, destroyed the Morocco Quarter and 4 Islamic sites, and made the plaza a place for worship. It has, as the document shows, strong religious meanings for Jews, though their worship therr has been historically rare for 2000 years. It also figures in Muslim itineries for pilgrims (al Buraq) as a place of prayer for them. The traditional arrangement down to Zionism was that it was Moslem property, with customary Jewish rights to pray there. Most Moslems knew little of the wall sector al-Buraq, as most Jews knew little of the Wailing wall, outside of rabbinical traditions and local Jewish fervour. These are what are called 'the invention of traditions' and al-Husayni invented as freely as did his Zionist competitors, both however building a national or pan-national 'tradition' out of relatively rare historical data.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 18:48, 15 October 2008 (UTC)

::::::::&lt;blockquote&gt; The more interest the Jews took in the wall, the more the Muslims responded. A myth started circulating that Mohammed, when he rose to the heavens from Jerusalem, tethered his magic steed al Buraq by the Western Wall (which is to be known thus by the Muslim community as al-Buraq wall: the Jordanians put up a sign to this effect). The story only comes into being in the late nineteenth century, and has become popular only much more recently still: older sources give quite a different spot for this brief moment in the story of the Night Journey. The myth attempts to locate the wall as a significant site for Muslim religious narrative, a claim that leads inevitably to the assertion of property rights. [I miss the next bit out to avoid further offence - Pyrotec] It is a good example of the competitive myth-making that is such a feature of the Jerusalem landscape.

::::The thing I find difficult to grasp is why the commission accepted that the whole wall is sacred to Moslems. Was the whole wall used to tie up this celestial being? If Buraq was tied to the Wailing Wall section, surely just one stone should be sacred, as the [[Black Stone]] on the [[Kaaba]]. Usually, when associated with events, sacredness is limited to certain spots. Saying that the whole wall is sacred by dint of one stone is interesting. (Note the fact that there are a number traditional sites, and that the tradition of the Western Wall of the Mount most probably refers to the southern tip.) Remember that the commission were trying to prevent the recurrence of riots and were therefore trying to keep everyone satisfied. Keeping the status quo was most probably their aim. So it is no wonder that they accepted the Muslim claim of sacredness. The report can be used as a primary source in a historical context, but whether or not it can be used as a source to designate sacredness is questionable.

::[[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]], you've come hard up against what troubles a lot of academic editors of Wiki. I.ew. professional knowledge, training in the use of documents, etc., tells one accessible reliable sources clearly fail to give the full story, and yet editorial conventions, by necessity, do not allow one to write the text according to personal, even deeply informed understanding. One is strictly limited to what the texts one can access say. I happen myself not to believe that the Wall was sacred to Muslims. I also happen to believe that the wall was not sacred to 'Jews' as opposed to a number of Jerusalemite Jews, and certain schools in the rabbinical tradition, and that most Jews historically knew little if anything of the wall. The anecdotes from the medieval period reflect rare anecdotes issuing over few centuries from a community that numbered a thousand or so people, who mainly thought an area on the Mount of Olives was the place to pray and weep for the lost glories of the Judaic past. Like the [[Four Holy Cities]] of Judaism, there grew up, slowly, after the Sephardic expulsion from Spain an attachment in certain circles to these areas which was earlier relatively unattested, and with the onset of [[aliyah]], religious and secular Zionism in the late 19th century, the mythic centrality of the Wall assumed the status of a fideistic cynosure as news from Palestine was diffused throughout the popular Yiddish and Hebrew press, informing the world's Jews that their brethren in Palestine were attached to this place. The Muslims naturally reacted to this appropriative (for that was what it was) (re-)invention of tradition (Hobsbawm and Ranger 1982) by their own counter mythology, and this was the seed for increasingly violent clashes. The picture of Herzl atop the mosque of al-Aqsa, which was a montaqe in the New York Press, for example, in 1920-21 was relayed to Jerusalem, and fed Arab suspicions that this was the ultimate object of Jewish claims to worship at the wall. A feedback system of disinformation between the parties ended with the massacres of 1929. Identity, like it or not, is constantly reinvented, especially in nation-formation - there is a vast literature on this, and Palestine illustrates its logic rather than constituting some exception. The Wall itself is a misnomer, since it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Temple (the real focus of rabbinical nostalgia), but a late structure built by a Roman puppet, some might also say, quisling, namely Herod who in modern orthodox Jewish law was not even Jewish, since his mother was a Cyprian, but in the law of his time might have been, even though Josephus calls him an Idumean, Jewish through assimilation but basically Arab ethnically, some sources say even of Askalon philistine origins.
::To use sources selectively, and read them in order to patch up an ethnic belief-systerm or worldview, attributable to a people, a faith, a community, is what modernity is about. Go into the details, and this collapses. By now the Western Wall is fixed in the Israeli and diaspora imagination as what the article says it was, an age old cynosure of Jewish hopes. It, as opposed to Jerusalem, or al Quds for Arabs, was no such thing. That is the essential problem, as I see it, in writing this article. I don't envy you your task. Good luck with it [[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 13:58, 19 October 2008 (UTC)
:::Your comments are an interesting read. I am no academic, and you probably are more well versed on many of the related topics here. Let me just add that the rabbinical traditions, namely the Zohar, which writes that the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall and the Midrash which quotes Rav Acha who transmitted that the Divine Presence has never moved away from the Western Wall, do not apply to only Jews from Jerusalem. All Jews, based on these traditions, view the wall as sacred. I cannot speak for most Jews in previous centuries and whether they knew of the wall or not. But those who studied the main backbone of Jewish legal and philisophcial works, will have come across the Wall and its special significance. These are included in the writings of the leaders and codifies of the Jewish nation: [[Radvaz]], [[Yoel Sirkis]] whose commentary is printed in [[Arba'ah Turim]], [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]], [[Jacob Ettlinger]], etc. The Wall is just not comparable to the [[Four Holy Cities]] which have no source in Jewish texts. There is no doubt that the wall was used as an issue by the Zionists in their propaganda, but I would not go as far and say it was a “invention of tradition”! The rabbis put an emphasis on remembering the destruction of Temple and Jerusalem. The wall was not the main thing, but it is what’s left, so naturally, it has become significant. When the Temple stood, the Western Wall was most probably quite insignificant, besides from the fact of being part of the Tempe complex. However, as this article describes, after the Temple was destroyed, it most certainly did attain a sacred status. The midrashim attest to this. The physicality of the place, the closest one could get to the holy of hoiles, makes it so. If Jews would not have been exiled from their land and banished from Jerusalem for centuries, I am sure that the significance of the Wall would be beyond doubt. If the Jews had held onto Jerusalem for as long as the Muslim’s had, there would not be any Islamic structures there. Taking into account what history planned, Jewish attachment and mention of the Wall is impressive. I do not wish to debate the matter of whether the wall had significance for Jews before the 18th century and whether the Western Wall in Judaism is a myth, (This is noted in the opinions section). Lot’s of the History section deals with 1850 onwards. The Jewish section cites mention of the wall in Jewish texts. I am confident that this article is of GA standard. [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]])

::The Zohar, excuse me if I am presumptuous and perhaps ignorant in my presumption, is not, strictly speaking, a 'rabbinical tradition'. On this indeed it is not quite reliable, since scholars have shown the author had only a very vague knowledge of Palestine. It was an esoteric text, in conflict with the kind of halakhic Judaism theorized by Maimonides, which gained a certain avid readership, and popularity some centuries later. It was widely believed that only males with a considerable initiation in the depths of Jewish learning, over 40, could even dare read it. When I think of 'the Jews', I think of all Jewish people, not to this or that tradition among one school or another, or a rabbinical world of intercommunal commentary. Most Jews historically did not know, or presume to know, what the law was. That was the function of a rabbi. Just as most Catholic or Protestant cannot cite chapter and verse of the doctrines which inform exquisite debates in their various ecclesiastical hierarchies. It is one thing to speak of the 'Western Wall' within a certain vein of learned literature, another to speak of popular Jewish feelings. Even among the learned, the wall is not mentioned, but just generically, the ruins of the Temple. I would like someone however to explain to me why Moses Maimonides, in the text quoted by Rabbi Eleazar Azikri, says that he entered the site of the Temple and prayed there. From memory, he seemed more taken up by Hebron that by a specific site, 'The Western Wall'. Nachmanides, who only found 2 Jewish families there, spoke  of weeping over the ruins of the Divine Sanctuary, not of the Western Wall. 

::Just as it is one thing to talk of the federalist papers as they are understood within constitutional historiography in the United States, and another thing to speak of what the American public understands by them. In the latter instance, we may be talking of 'Americans' both are referring to the same 'tradition'. The public however, hardly knows anything about the federalist papers, and even, when snippets are quoted, tend to identify Madison or Jefferson's opinions with Communism). I was speaking to a Catholic rigourist some weeks ago, and upset him when saying: 'Of course, apply the law too strictly, and much that is useful to civil life would be impossible, because sinful.' He replied, 'Nonsense'. I in turn replied, 'Only if St Thomas Aquinas spoke nonsense'. 'What do you mean?'. 'I mean, ''multae utilitates impedirentur si omnia peccata districte prohiberentur''.'

::I cite this to show that much of what a scholar might harvest from the recondite literature dealing with a faith, a belief-system, a world-view, is not known to, or has little purchase on, the community that formally subscribes to, or is ethnically attached to, that faith or belief-system. This is true of the Jews, as it is true of the Dogon, the Daoists or Catholics or whatever community you like. My objections therefore are not to evidence that in rabbinical traditions or even the Zohar, things like the Western Wall have a mystical value or aroused in the learned a powerful affective attachment. I am simply stating the obvious. Most Jews throughout history down to modern times probably did not have their piety leavened by erudite disquisitions or lyrical prayers on the Wall. The modern attachment, now that the world is interconnected, people undergo instruction in their beliefs, nations diffuse selected traditions to highlight what is '''now''' thought to be central (the WW is now thought central because of Zionist showcasing of it as the jewel in the crown of Jewish claims to Jerusalem and a homeland within Palestine). The process whereby this eclectic harvesting of the abundant world of tradition to winnow and thresh out symbols to serve as foci for passionate collective identity is one which also systematically represses other knowledge - the point was made by Ernest Renan in a famous 1882 lecture, 'What is a nation?'
::I'm boring you with a lecture. To be brief and recap. If the text says, 'in Jewish tradition' that is one thing. If it says 'for all Jews' (implying throughout the ages) then it requires a very strong reliable source, not making that assertion, but one that builds its generalization on the basis on a detailed survey of Jewish ''popular'' belief and opinion throughout the ages (impossible to do, since it was far too varied). The phrase, secondly, 'invention of tradition' refers to a specific book by that name, quite famous for opening up a large new perspective, from which we have learned that most of what we respectively, as citizens and members of various cultures, take for granted as 'traditions' were in fact late constructions dating even to three or four generations back. Lastly, I refrain from editing this article, and have no desire whatsoever to trouble its GA status. The few remarks I have made are those I thought obligatory, as a bystander. NPOV means, functionally, the capacity to see one's own perspective through the imagined eyes of another who shares an opposed understanding, and edit so that both viewpoints achieve balance. That the evidence points towards a more intense rabbinical or pious attachment to that section of the wall historically, seems to be strong. If Maimonides and Nachmanides did not specifically name it, but rather wept at the ruins of a generic Temple, their attachment was not to the wall, but to the Temple. All the more so, even if it is an ''argumentum ex silentio'', Jews throughout the ages were certainly mindful in their thoughts and prayers, of the Temple, but I very much doubt that one can write to NPOV standards by suggesting they imagined, as now all Jews can imagine and visit, a fragment of wall as being that Temple, or the beloved Jerusalem of Biblical memory.

Indeed, many Israeli school children today are probably not aware of the religious significance of the Wall or the Mount. Is there need for this be mentioned? The fact is, that today, the midrash and laws have been put to paper, and any reference has become of significance to contemporary religious Jewry. As far as I know, whatever images were conjured up in the minds of Jews praying and mourning for the Temple in the diaspora, the fact that Maimonides rules referring to the Temple Mount that “the first sanctity sanctified for eternity” and the early texts which attached the Divine presence to the Wall, is enough for the Wall to have holiness nowadays, albeit, retroactively. Meaning that even if world Jewry up till recent centuries had not viewed the Wall exclusively as a holy site, the holiness was still upon it. And as soon as Jews started growing in number in Jerusalem in the mid-1800’s, the Wall also gathered importance. They could view it, touch it. The Southern wall was ignored, as was the Eastern and Northern wall. So I am not sure why this has become such a problem. You seem to be using this talk page as professing the assumption that historically Jews never thought of the Wall as a holy place, but for what purpose? The article does not claim “Jews” ever thought of it as such.

:::Regarding the ruins that Maimonides and Nachmanides mentioned; did they refer to the haram area with it’s mosques? Or was it a wall?  Maybe a heap of rubble? We don’t know. I have heard the Wall being referred to as Serid Beit Mikdasheinu, which translates as “the remnant of our Temple”. So maybe a generic term was being used.

::I may have given the wrong impression.If so I apologise. My responses were to remarks on the talk page (with some latent regret that the Moghrabi quarter after 1967 and its four shrines weren't redesigned by negotiation, to allow the plaza to accommodate worshippers). I find this above GA status. It is generally speaking a very good article, and your labours have enriched the encyclopedia. I reread it quickly, and from memory (apart from the minor correction I made). 20,000sq. metres of the plaza have the capacity to accommodate 400,000? Doesn't that work out as 20 people per square metre? p.s. check p.84 the Meron Benvenisti book does not (n54) support the text here(2) The phrasing 'Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall' is stylistically awkward in English. The problem is 'became', which is clearly intended to indicate a starting point in time but that is implicit in 'were'. 'Became forbidden to' grates on native ears (at least mine) because, even if acceptable, one tends to expect 'from' after 'forbidden'. If one wrote, 'Jews were thereafter forbidden from placing benches and candles by the Wall' it would be better. 'Light' candles creates an amiguity (not heavy/used for lighting) as well as being a pleonasm.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 19:22, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

==Rashid Khalidi==
I have looked at ''Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness'' by [[Rashid Khalidi]] and have not found anything of particular relevance. On the contrary, he compliments Simon Goldhill who was cited by [[User:Pyrotec|Pyrotec]]. On page 216, note 25 he writes: ''This dispute about the tethering place of an apocryphal winged horse shows that otherwise sober scholars risk &lt;u&gt;getting carried away&lt;/u&gt; where religious claims in Jerusalem are concerned.'' Read: Islamic myth-making. (Note that the version by Ibn Furkah, (d. 1328), was recently added to the article.)
:::Rashid Khalidi nowhere in his 1997 book compliments Simon Goldhill's recent book (2008). On this remark, Goldhill is demonstrably wrong, and Rashid Khalidi, an expert, right. 

On page 17 he writes that ''immediately inside the wall of the Haram, near the [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Moroccans' Gate|Moor’s Gate]], is a small mosque called Jami’ al-Burqa, commemorating the '''spot''' where al-Buraq was supposedly tethered.'' How this has been extended to the whole wall evades me.

Personally, I am of the opinion that &quot;Al-Buraq Wall&quot; is a 20th century [[Conversion of non-Muslim places of worship into mosques|conversion of a non-Muslim place of veneration into a Muslim place of veneration]]. [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 13:15, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

::Personally I have numerous proofs that a large part of the Israeli landscape is named after Biblical areas that assume by that naming a sacrality they never had in local Jewish-Palestinian tradition and thus constitute conversion of Muslim places into a place of Jewish veneration, as the Muslims did with the Christians and the Christians with the Biblical Jewish world.

::It is not proper to cite selectively. The full note I alluded to from Khalidi runs to runs:
:::&lt;blockquote&gt;(A) 'Moshe Gil writes in ''A History of Palestine, 640-1099'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992 pp.646-650, of a Jewish synagogue during the early Muslim period which he locates in the vicinity of the Western Wall, but his pinpointing of its location seems singularly vague. He does state (p.646) that '''in Jewish sources of that period, 'we find that the Western Wall is mentioned almost not at all,' while with regard to Bab al-Rahme (sometimes known as Bawabat al-Rahme,. Or Gates of mercy) on the eastern side of the Haram, he notes (p.643) that “the Jews of this period . . used to visit the gate and pray alongside it, and write about it, mentioning its name (in the singular or the plural) in letters'.''' Rashid Khalidi, ''Palestinian Identity' n.23 p.216&lt;/blockquote&gt;
::'''Comment''' Why is Moshe Gil's work not cited? It looks authoritative.
:::&lt;blockquote&gt; (B)n25.'Ben Dov claims (''In the Shadow'', p.286) that Muslim devotion to this site dates back only to the nineteenth century, and was a response to the growth of Jewish interest in the adjacent Wailing Wall. He refers to a fifteenth-sixteenth century work by the historian ‘Abd al-Rahman b.Mohammad al-‘Ulaymi, known as Mujir al-Din, to show that Muslims earlier connected  al-Buraq to bab al-Rahme on the eastern side of the Haram. Mujir al-Din (d.1521) does suggest this in ''al Uns al-jalil bi-tarikh al-Quds wal-Khalil'', (The glorious history of Jerusalem and hebron), 2 vols. (Amman: Maktabah al-Muhtasib, 1973( 2:28).  But a much earlier source, ''Ba’ith al-nufus ila ziyarat al-Quds al-mahrus'' (Inspiration to souls to visit protected Jerusalem) (Khalidi Library MS) by Ibrahim b.Ishaq al-Ansari, known as Ibn Furkah (d.1328) states (p.26) that al-Buraq was tethered outside Bab al-Nabi, an old name for a gate that both Gil himself (''A History'' p.645), and Mujir al-Din (al-Uns al-jalil 2:31) '''identify with the very site along the southwestern wall of the haram venerated by Muslims today!''' This dispute about the tethering place of an apocryphal winged horse shows that otherwise sober scholars risk getting carried away when religious claims in Jerusalem are concerned.’ p.216

== Mufti and Palestinians ==

In the British rule period, there is constant mention of the &quot;Mufti&quot; but no links to [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] which leads the uninformed reader to believe that [[Mohammed Tahir al-Husayni]] is the mufti being mentioned. His rule ended in 1908. Also there's no mention of Palestinian use of the site for worship. I am aware that Palestinians over a certain age are allowed to enter and pray at the wall. The former issue is an easy one to fix.

==Ummm...==
I was perusing through some of the Judaic pages to do some minor edits, and noticed something that made me do a double take in this article's lead. It states that the wall is known as the al'Buraq wall to Muslims. I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims, particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims. However, from everything that I've read, the name is of rather recent provenance, and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel. If memory serves, it didn't really have any circulation until the last two decades or so.  from the obscure claims of Mujir al'Din that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise, which itself is a legend derived from Sahih al'Bukhari, the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor; that's of little relevance here, though. I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing, and I don't advocate any necessity of removing it. However, the attribution itself is sixteenth century, and actual naming of it as the &quot;al'Buraq wall&quot; is incredibly recent. I think we should at the very least clarify this, add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name, and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this. I just skimmed it, but I'm not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title (nevermind, it does). For all I know, it may itself be the origin of the name, with this article helping to disseminate it. Since this, like every Jerusalem-related article, is contentious, I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything. [[User:Kaelus|Kaelus]] ([[User talk:Kaelus|talk]]) 05:26, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

==Jordanian occupation 1948–1967==
I was wondering, from whom did the Jordanian capture the old city of Al-Quds and the wall? and why was the Jordanian rule over it considered occupation, while Israeli rule is considered sovereignty? I don't find this neutral? This should be changed. [[User:Yamanam|Yamanam]] ([[User talk:Yamanam|talk]]) 13:01, 6 December 2008 (UTC)
:The answer is in the article.[[User:Pyrotec|Pyrotec]] ([[User talk:Pyrotec|talk]]) 14:33, 6 December 2008 (UTC)
::It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation, because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised, hence occupation. And while Israel's presence is also not recognised, (the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised), in reality, Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site. As this matter is disputed, I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site, but I could not find any good sources. [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 23:14, 8 December 2008 (UTC)
Jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it, i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation. The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if I'm not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank.

== Origin of &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; ==

The article says that the name &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; was introduced by the British in 1917.  If you go to the advanced search at books.google.com and search for the name &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; prior to 1917 you will find numerous disproofs.  For example, The Jewish Advocate for the Young by J.J. Reynolds, published in 1859 has it (p34).  Horatius Bonar, &quot;Days and Nights in the East&quot; published in 1866 has &quot;Jewish Wailing-Wall&quot; as a chapter running head (p191).  Similarly Memories of Olivet by John Ross Macduff published in 1868 has it. Prior to 1917 there are actually ''tons'' of examples.  So what can we do to fix our article?

Using the WB map would be like using the Hasmonean Kingdom map, using a map based on historic borders, but not a current entity. Meanwhile, the Israeli flag flies above the wall, showing that its in Israel. That Israeli presence is deemed illegitimate by the UN does not negate the reality.

Now I may be wrong, but the term O'''P'''T may not actually denote Palestine as in belonging to the PA, rather it quite innocently means territories occupied by Israel in historic Palestine, but given that the term PT connotes an association the PA, it cannot be used to define parts of Jerusalem which would give the impression that it forms part of land internationally recognised as legally belonging to the PA.

It is clear that the IC consider the status of Jerusalem as CS. It is not Israeli territory, nor Palestinian territory. EJ may be called &quot;Arab&quot;, but thats because its descibing what the area is in reality, just like the map should show whose control it is under in reality.

So the centralized discussion failed but it still seems like a problem having this image on ''this'' article. [[:File:Israel location map.svg]] can be used with the bottom not saying &quot;Israel&quot; but instead &quot;Jerusalem&quot; which appears correct regardless of the city's status in the eyes of the intl community. Highlighting &quot;Palestinian Territories&quot; seems inappropriate since &quot;Israel&quot; is also a possible location. Furthermore, it is not like the Gaza Strip is united with the other areas so why is it highlighted? The image I suggest is clear enough (there are disputed territories seen by the highlighting) but there is no confusion as to a lesser accepted and confusingly designated entity being the focus. Other solutions include: No map at all since it only serves to emphisise a particular viewpoint ([[WP:MOSFLAG|why we don't use flags]]), a map of the city, or a map with all areas highlighted but boundaries clearly defined. No one has presented a map of the city with a marker or a map of the region with a marker but without highlights so those seem like solutions that should not be considered unless someone plans on creating them.

After all, the purpose of the second figure is to show the location of the Wailing Wall, not to just show a map of Jerusalem. How about a nice arrow, or maybe increase the line weight of the Wailing Wall's lines, to make it more obvious. Something.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.237.168.167|184.237.168.167]] ([[User talk:184.237.168.167|talk]]) 03:15, 13 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== The name in Arabic ==

Why does the name in Arabic appear in the opening section while it's clear that the western wall is Jewish site?--[[User:Gilisa|Gilisa]] ([[User talk:Gilisa|talk]]) 18:23, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
:Because the site has significance in Islam. -[[User:Asad112|asad]] ([[User talk:Asad112|talk]]) 22:26, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
::Because Arabic is an offical language of Israel. [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 15:31, 16 August 2011 (UTC)

==Dates==
The dates are given in BCE &amp; CE, not because it is a &quot;Jewish&quot; site but because this type of dating was first used in http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Wall&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=4678536. It is therefore the &quot;prevailing style&quot; unless someone has since discussed changing it and received a consensus to do so.

'Its importance to Judaism is less ancient than is commonly thought. We know, for instance, from ancient Jewish pilgrims and travellers, that in 1481 the Mount of Olives (outside the Old City) and not the Wailing Wall was the place dedicated to the annual commemoration of the destruction of the Temple. F.E. Peters, in his comprehensive collection of travellers' and pilgrims' documents on Jerusalem, observes that it was only from the early sixteenth century that Jewish visitors described te Western Wall and connected it with the earlier tradition of the 'Presence of God'. Even the 'official' history of the wall by Ben-Dov ety al.openly states that for hundreds of years there has been no mention at all of the wall in the written sources.'
