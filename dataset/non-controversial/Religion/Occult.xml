{{pp-move-indef}}
The word '''''occult''''' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' (clandestine, hidden, secret), referring to &quot;knowledge of the hidden&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[medical]] sense it is used to refer to a structure or process that is hidden, e.g. an &quot;occult bleed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide. Harvard Medical School 2005. 1272 pages ISBN 0-684-86373-1&lt;/ref&gt; may be one detected indirectly by the presence of otherwise unexplained [[anemia]].

The word has many uses in the [[English language]], popularly meaning &quot;knowledge of the [[paranormal]]&quot;, as opposed to &quot;knowledge of the [[measurable]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, E. (1974). ''Mysticism'', Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icrcanada.org/kundandpara.html&lt;/ref&gt; usually referred to as [[science]]. The term is sometimes popularly taken to mean &quot;knowledge meant only for certain people&quot; or &quot;knowledge that must be kept hidden&quot;, but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond pure reason and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1897). ''Occultism of the secret doctrine''. [Whitefish, Mont.]: [[Kessinger Publishing]], LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can have a very similar meaning, and the three terms are often interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Houghton Mifflin Company. (2004). ''The American Heritage College Thesaurus''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. Page 530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, C. F. (1895). An outline of the principles of modern theosophy. Boston: New England Theosophical Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''occult'' is also used as a label given to a number of [[magical organization]]s or orders, the teachings and practices taught by them, and to a large body of current and historical literature and spiritual philosophy related to this subject.

==Occultism==
[[File:Holytable.jpg|thumb|200px|Reconstruction of the &quot;Holy Table&quot; as used by [[John Dee]].]]

Occultism is the term used to describe the study of occult practices including (but not limited to) [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[alchemy]], [[extra-sensory perception]], [[astrology]], [[spiritualism]], and [[divination]]. Interpretation of occultism and its concepts can be found in the belief structures of religions such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Theosophy]], [[Wicca]], [[Thelema]], [[Satanism]], and [[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopaganism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevill Drury., ''The Watkins Dictionary of Magic'', ISBN 1-84293-152-0. p. 03&lt;/ref&gt; A broad definition is offered by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]:

{{quote|OCCULTISM has its basis in a religious way of thinking, the roots of which stretch back into antiquity and which may be described as the Western esoteric tradition. Its principal ingredients have been identified as Gnosticism, the Hermetic treatises on alchemy and magic, [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonism]], and the Kabbalah, all originating in the eastern Mediterranean area during the first few centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodrick-Clarke|first=Nicholas|title=[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]|year=1985|page=17|isbn=0-85030-402-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the 15th to 17th century, these ideas that are alternatively described as [[Western esotericism]], which had a revival from about 1770 onwards, due to a renewed desire for mystery, an interest in the [[Middle Ages]] and a [[romanticism|romantic]] &quot;reaction to the [[rationalist]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&quot;&lt;ref name=GoodrickClarke18/&gt; [[Alchemy]] was common among highly important seventeenth-century scientists, such as [[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/alch-newman.html Newton's Dark Secrets].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kirjasto.sci.fi/leibnitz.htm Baron Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716)]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was even accused of introducing occult agencies into [[natural science]] when he postulated [[gravity]] as a force capable of [[Action at a distance (physics)|acting over vast distances]].&lt;ref&gt;Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', ISBN 0-940262-45-2. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;By the eighteenth century these unorthodox religious and philosophical concerns were well defined as 'occult', inasmuch as they lay on the outermost fringe of accepted forms of knowledge and discourse,&quot;&lt;ref name=GoodrickClarke18&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (1985): 18&lt;/ref&gt; They were, however, preserved by antiquarians and mystics.

Based on his research into the modern [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|German occult revival]] (1890–1910), Goodrick-Clarke puts forward a thesis on the driving force behind occultism. Behind its many varied forms apparently lies a uniform function, &quot;a strong desire to reconcile the findings of modern natural science with a religious view that could restore man to a position of centrality and dignity in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (1985): 29&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time many authors have emphasized a [[syncretism|syncretic]] approach by drawing parallels between different disciplines.&lt;ref name=IAO131&gt;[[IAO131]]. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hdbq111/JoTS/JoTS1-1.pdf&amp;date=2010-01-17+12:04:48 Thelema &amp; Buddhism] in ''[[Journal of Thelemic Studies]]'', Vol. 1, No. 1, Autumn 2007, pp. 18-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and the occult==
To the occultist, occultism is conceived of as the study of the inner nature of things, as opposed to the outer characteristics that are studied by science. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] designates this &quot;inner nature&quot; with the term ''Will'', and suggests that science and mathematics are unable to penetrate beyond the relationship between one thing and another in order to explain the &quot;inner nature&quot; of the thing itself, independent of any external causal relationships with other &quot;things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer, Arthur]]. ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Or|date=November 2008}} Schopenhauer also points towards this inherently relativistic nature of mathematics and conventional science in his formulation of the 'World as Will'. By defining a thing solely in terms of its external relationships or effects we only find its external, or explicit nature. Occultism, on the other hand, is concerned with the nature of the &quot;[[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]]&quot;. This is often accomplished through direct perceptual awareness, known as [[mysticism]].

From the scientific perspective, occultism is regarded as unscientific as it does not make use of the standard [[scientific method]] to obtain facts.

===Occult qualities===
Occult qualities are properties that have no rational explanation. In the [[Middle Ages]], [[magnetism]] was sometimes called an occult quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=jbLWJPca_zoC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=occult+qualities&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UPY2bsdAcp&amp;sig=pOwVAmv9XFFq_Qu6x5x3D97oeEU#PPA187,M1 Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S. Westfall], Margaret J. Osler, Paul Lawrence Farber, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002, ISBN 0-521-52493-8&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's contemporaries severely critiqued his theory that gravity was effected through &quot;action at a distance&quot; as occult.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Buchdahl, &quot;History of Science and Criteria of Choice&quot; p. 232. In ''Historical and philosophical perspectives of science'' v. 5 (ed. Roger H. Stuewer)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and the occult==
Some religions and sects enthusiastically embrace occultism as an integral esoteric aspect of mystical religious experience. This attitude is common within [[Wicca]] and many other [[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagan]] religions. Some other religious denominations disapprove of occultism in most or all forms. They may view the occult as being anything supernatural or paranormal which is not achieved by or through [[God]] (as defined by those religious denominations), and is therefore the work of an opposing and malevolent entity. The word has negative connotations for many people, and while certain practices considered by some to be &quot;occult&quot; are also found within mainstream religions, in this context the term &quot;occult&quot; is rarely used and is sometimes substituted with &quot;esoteric&quot;.

===Christian views===
Christian authorities have generally regarded occultism as heretical whenever they met this: from early Christian times, in the form of [[gnosticism]], to late Renaissance times, in the form of various occult philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbons|first=B. J.|title=Spirituality and the occult: from the Renaissance to the twentieth century|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is a Christian occult tradition that goes back at least to Renaissance times, when Marsilio Ficino developed a Christian [[Hermeticism]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]] developed a Christian form of [[Christian Kabbalah|Kabbalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yates|first=Frances Amelia|title=The occult philosophy in the Elizabethan age|year=1979|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainstream institutional Christianity has always resisted occult influences, which are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Surette|first=Leon|title=The birth of modernism: Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, W.B. Yeats, and the occult|year=1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[monistic]] in contrast to Christian [[dualistic]] beliefs of a separation between [[body]] and [[spirit]]; 
* generally not [[monotheistic]], frequently asserting a gradation of human souls between mortals and God; and 
* sometimes not even [[theistic]] in character.
Furthermore, there are heterodox branches of [[Esoteric Christianity]] that practice [[divination]], blessings, or appealing to angels for certain intervention, which they view as perfectly righteous, often supportable by gospel (for instance, claiming that the old commandment against divination was superseded by Christ's birth, and noting that the [[Magi]] used [[astrology]] to locate Bethlehem). [[Rosicrucian]]ism, one of the most celebrated of Christianity's mystical offshoots, has lent aspects of its philosophy to most Christian-based occultism since the 17th century.

===Hindu views===
[[Tantra]], literally meaning &quot;formula&quot;, &quot;method, or &quot;way&quot;, (parallel to the Chinese [[Tao]], which also means &quot;the way&quot; or &quot;the method&quot;), and also having the secondary meaning of &quot;loom&quot;, &quot;thread&quot; or &quot;warp and woof&quot; is the name scholars give to a style of religious ritual and meditation that arose in [[medieval India]] no later than the fifth century CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Einoo |first=Shingo (ed.) |year=2009 |page=45 |title=Genesis and Development of Tantrism |publisher=University of Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which came to influence all forms of Asian religious expression to a greater or lesser degree. Tantra is at the same time a method of psychoanalysis, a way of integrating the body, mind and spirit, and a way of using the mind or will to cause change in one's external situations and circumstances, hence &quot;magic&quot;. It includes amongst its various branches a variety of ritualistic practices ranging from visualisation exercises and the chanting of [[mantra]]s to elaborate rituals. Alchemy, astrology, herbalism, naturopathy, yogic practices, [[sex magic]], and [[trance]] also together form the multifaceted and multilevel nature of Tantra. [[Yantra]], literally: &quot;instrument&quot; or &quot;tool&quot; are geometric diagrams are considered to be the subtle or finer representation of the psychological or natural powers that are the deities, the proper use of which would result in the yantra becoming 'activated' and infused with the particular powers and capacities of the said deity, for the practitioner or adept to put to his/her use. 

Occult concepts have existed in the [[Vedic]] stream too. The [[Atharva Veda]], representing an independent tradition markedly different from the other three Vedas, is a rich source  parallel to the Vedic traditions of the Rig, Sam and Yajur Vedas,  containing detailed descriptions of various kinds of magical rituals for different results ranging from punishing enemies, to acquisition of wealth health, long life, or a good harvest.

===Religious Jewish views===
{{See also|Kabbalah}}
In [[Rabbinic Judaism]], an entire body of literature collectively known as [[Kabbalah]] has been dedicated to the content eventually defined by some as ''[[occult science]]''. The Kabbalah includes the tracts named [[Sefer Yetzirah]], the [[Zohar]], [[Pardes Rimonim]], and [[Arizal|Eitz Chaim]].

Although there is a popular myth that one must be a 40 year old Jewish man, and learned in the [[Talmud]] before one is allowed to delve into Kabbalah, [[Chaim Vital]] says exactly the opposite in his introduction to ''[[Kabbalah:_Primary_texts#Etz_Hayim_and_the_Eight_Gates|Etz Chaim]]''. There he argues that it is incumbent on everyone to learn Kabbalah - even those who are unable to understand the Talmud. Further, the father of the [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic School]] of Kabbalah, [[Isaac Luria]] (known as the ''Ari HaKadosh'', or the Holy Lion) was not yet 40 years old when he passed away.
