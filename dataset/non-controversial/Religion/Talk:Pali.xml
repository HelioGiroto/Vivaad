www.accesstoinsight.org is only intended to provide a small selection of Pali texts (see their home page) in English.

I'd like to see the Pali in the article put into Devanagari (or some other commonly used script). I'd do it myself, but I'm not sure whether Pali spelling conventions are the same as for Sanskrit... --[[User:Marnen|Marnen Laibow-Koser]] [[user_talk:Marnen|(talk)]] 19:23, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Changing the Pali terms in the article to be in Devanagari would not be reflective of either current or historical usage.  To my knowledge, the only time Pali has been written in Devanagari is during attempts by followers of Dr. Amdedkar to encourage the use of Pali among Indian converts to Buddhism.  For an English-language article, using the correct Romanizations (explained in the Pali Alphabet (Unicode) section) is both the most accesible and equally accurate.  Devanagari would mostly be of use to Sanskritists, I believe; Sinhala, Thai, or Burmese would be more helpful to students of Pali, and the Romanization probably has the widest accesibility.  --[[User:Spasemunki|Clay Collier]] 22:13, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I would agree with the usefulness of Sinhala, Thai, and Burmese along with Devanagari.  Below are the Pali terms from the article in Thai script.

::::Reasonable question with no reasonable answer.  Sri Lankan monks are astonished that I can read and write Pali in classical, literary Sinhalese script --and, yes, I can also type it on my computer.  &quot;Why don't you just use English?&quot;, they ask, meaning Romanized phonetics --and often going on to state that they assume the European standard is in some sense &quot;superior&quot; to the indigenous orthography (i.e., more authoritative or academic).  The Thai script is in a difficult situation, as it is vernacular, and Khom/Lanna are instead associated with the religion itself --yet are regional rather than national in their connotations.  I suppose that the orthography is least &quot;fraught&quot; in Cambodia and Burma --oh yeah, I do read and write Pali in all of those scripts, too.  So, my personal answer is: I make use of ''all'' of the scripts, and therefore have access to a wider variety of printed materials and manuscripts.  I encourage other students to do the same.  However, Romanization is the more common crutch.

== Why does this article get worse and worse? ==

I'm sorry to see that after my attempts to revise the information on the history of the language some months ago, it has been re-written to reflect the usual errors and lies.

This is a sad demonstration that the &quot;democratic method&quot; is not applicable to the process of writing an encyclopedia.

Seemingly nobody is interested in checking authoritative sources, or resolving conflicting accounts (that arise on the wiki) by reference to real scholarship; they just mimic what their &quot;Intro to Hindi&quot; teacher told them, or what their &quot;Intro to Sanskrit&quot; book vaguely suggested about Buddhist sources.

Instead of looking at a revision and thinking &quot;Hey, this isn't quite what my 'Intro to Hindi' book suggests ... maybe I'd better look into it&quot; it seems that the majority of the ill-informed just respond by reducing the text to their own level of ignorance.  &quot;Hey, this isn't what I already know --it must be wrong!&quot;

I don't know if anyone participates in this &quot;Wiki&quot; with an open mind that someone else might know more than they do; it really doesn't seem to be the case at all.

I notice that the article on Prakrit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit) has not been reduced to quite such stupidity as the article on Pali --probably because fewer people have edited it (...or read it) since I re-wrote it myself.

Depressing.

:It would be much easier to keep track of which edits you were talking about if you had a user account instead of just an IP, or if you could at least mention specifically which revisions you are talking about.  There are several origin theories for Pali; it's far from a settled issue.  Any claim that Pali was *never* a language spoken as something other than a literary language seems very difficult to prove conclusively- we don't know exactly what the differences between spoken and written language were in ancient times because we have no record of spoken language. I'll readily agree that I've seen references that indicate that Pali was an artificially constructed language never used as a vernacular- but I've also seen references that indicate that Pali developed out of a lingua franca used after the death of the Buddha. Drawing a line between the precursor language as used in daily life (which is known only through reconstruction) and the literary language seems a fairly thorny task. We can make hypotheses on the basis of differences between modern written vs. spoken usage, and patterns of language use in South Asia, but that is not the same as having direct proof.  References would be extremely helpful here for establishing what the positions are, and who is proposing them.  Do you have a reference for the claim that Pali was never a spoken language?  Similar references for the Prakrit article would be helpful as well.  I'll dig around and see what I can find. --[[User:Spasemunki|Clay Collier]] 07:58, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

:::The Devanagari does seem to have been fixed.  I still do not understand some of the symbols used in Romanized Pali.  The use of a j-n ligature ( {{Unicode|ɲ}} ) to represent the velar nasal seems very strange, since this is an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol for a palatal nasal.  
::::The conventional sign usually used is n with overdot: {{IAST|ṅ}}.  I ''have'' seen the n-j ligature ({{Unicode|ŋ}} ) used to represent anusvara, which has a certain amount of justification since in some of the traditional pronunciations of Pali, anusvara is pronounced as a velar nasal (which is what {{Unicode|ŋ}} stands for in IPA).  But the usual convention is {{IAST|ṃ}}. 
:::I also wonder why some of the other alphabets commonly used to write Pali, e.g. Thai, are not provided?[[User:RandomCritic|RandomCritic]] 03:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
::::Well, I visited here by chance. There is something that bothered me since a long time regarding romanized Pali. It is an adaptation of romanized Sanskrit. In the 1800s they did not have adequate letters to represent Indic sounds. It is the same problem that English faced twice in its history. That story might help to understand the problem better. At the time when Latin replaced Runic in England, Latin did not have anything to represent the dental t and d as well as a as in hat. So they added Thorn (þ), Edth (ð) and Ash (æ) to the new English alphabet (I can't find from where ð and æ came. May be they improvised them). 

::::This was all good as long as books were hand written. Then William Caxton came with the press. Caxton in his hurry to print indulgences and books for the rich and famous neglected to fix the problem of Latin not having types for the above three letters. Spelling and writing diverged ever since in English. Today we call þe ye as in &quot;Know ye by these presents...&quot;

::::Getting back to Pali, in the 1800s they only had hand operated or straddle presses and pages were hand composed with lead type and then hand bound. When it came to making accent letters for the alphabet, they had to take into consideration how Pali and Sanskrit were to be printed. Those days they used brass (strips) rules to print lines. The printers cut these rules into the width of the individual letters and placed them above the types to make macrons. And they only had to make them pointed to make dot accents. (Acute and grave accents would not have been easy to improvise this way). Recall that Indic languages have two pairs of t and d. One set corresponds with English t and d in Sri Lanka where Davids was romanizing Pali. (In India they are retroflex sounds). The other set, that occurs 10 times or more are the dentals corresponding to English digraph th, but as stops. So, to make things easier for the printers they decided to use the regular letters to represent the more numerous dentals and placed macron on t and d that represent the regular English sounds. The result: Accented or not, everyone reads both t and d just the same way!

::::Use of the m for anusvara (a ring or dot in Indic) makes one think that it is a close lip sound like m. It is not. It is exactly the same sound as the digraph ng as in dung, sing etc.

::::Both Pali and Sanskrit could be typed if the Old English letters are used and a few other commonly available European letters are added to the alphabet. (Use US-International keyboard). I used the following alphabet to completely transliterate Pali and Sanskrit found in the discourses found at www.metta.lk which seems to have the best version of Tripitaka. A Word macro converted the pages perfectly from the hack font used at the web site. It was proven to be flawless by displaying it in original Sinhala script using a smartfont.

There are a number of errors in the lengthy comment above. I'll just mention the important one. What is said about the pronunciation of anusvara is not correct.

'''I believe the above comment (from R.C.)is not correct,''' viz., both {{Unicode|ŋ}} and {{Unicode|ɲ}} are graphic combinations of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;g&quot; (the &quot;hook below&quot; is regularly interpreted as the bottom half of the letter &quot;g&quot;) --and these are variously used to indicate &quot;-ng&quot;/&quot;-gn&quot; sounds of some kind.  It should be kept in mind that IPA code comprises all sounds made by European languages, ''but certainly not'' all sounds to be found in Asia (have you looked at the range of [[Laotian]] vowel sounds lately?).  The French would generally interpret ''-gn-'' as what an English speaker might write out as &quot;-ny-&quot; or a Spaniard would write as an &quot;n&quot; with a tilde above.  Pali texts in Roman transliteration have struggled to distinguish the ''anuswara (niggahita)'' from the sound at the end of the first line of the alphabet.  With any of the systems used in textbooks, dictionaries, etc., one may simply say &quot;take it or leave it&quot; --this is mere transliteration after all.  The dream that the IPA could encompass the whole world with a single system of &quot;one-to-one phonetic correspondence&quot; ends at the Ural mountains.

Although well intentioned as a review of early crises faced by typesetters, this discussion now seems to present '''the misleading suggestion''' that þ or ð can (or should) be used in transliterating Pali.  As for the question of who transliterated what (first) and when, compare the [pratyeka.org/rask/ trailblazing work by Rasmus Rask].

: I don't see the relevance of all this. Wikipedia should add a link to these transliterations if and only if they are in fairly common use. The Handbook of the IPA clearly demonstrates phonetic transcriptions for quite a range of languages, including Hindi and Sindhi, but it's not designed to be a transliteration or even a viable alphabet for a language. In reality, the IPA uses diacritics for French and Irish.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 15:31, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

==Paragraphs removed==
I have removed the following paragraphs for lack of relevance to the article:

::This is demonstrably true (e.g.) in the instance of [[Asvaghosa|Ashvaghosa]], a Pāli-educated Buddhist monk, who became the first author of the Sanskrit [[kavya]] genre of poetry, highly influential on [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] poetics thereafter.  Likewise, in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] philosophy, post-Buddhist schools such as [[Sankara|Shankara's]] [[Vedanta]] have been directly influenced both by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Philosophy and argumentation, with concomitant effects in the use of the language itself.

::Within the context of religious writings, similar-sounding words to those found in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] can have significantly different meanings than those of Pāli. The active re-definition and re-invention of the religious meanings assigned to certain key terms (such as [[dharma]]/[[dhamma]]) was an active aspect of philosophic debate for many centuries, and the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Jainism|Jains]], and various schools of [[Hinduism]] all had competitive notions of the value and significance of these terms.

::The philosophy of early [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] found in [[Sanskrit]] and the [[Buddhism]] recorded in Pāli are, in many  respects, mutually opposed; however, historical sources indicate that these were not the only schools, nor the only languages, that participated in the debates within the Buddhist fold. There is no extant Buddhist literature of the Prakrit language [[Paisaci]], but this and other languages were associated with particular philosophical approaches to Buddhist doctrine (and particular sectarian affiliations) in recorded history.

These paragraphs fail to distinguish between ''a language'' and the philosophical ideas conveyed in that language.  While it may well be argued that the word '''buddháḥ''' means one thing in Hindu literature, '''buddhaḥ''' means another thing in Mahāyāna Buddhist literature, and '''buddho''' means yet a third thing in Theravāda literature (and may mean several different things ''within'' each of those literary and philosophical traditions), the differences in meaning are only accidentally linked to the differences in the dialect or language employed.  A Mahāyāna writer might polemicize against the Theravāda concept of '''nibbānaṃ''' (this is a hypothetical instance); but, writing in Sanskrit (Classical or Hybrid), he will call the concept '''nirvāṇam''' regardless of which concept is under discussion.  The choice of phonetic shape for the term is determined by linguistic context (i.e., what language the author is writing in), not by the definition of the word.  The value of a technical term will vary according to the point of view of the author using the term; it is poor scholarship to attempt to embed a philosophical definition, which will necessarily vary between schools and authors, into the fabric of the language.

The article should be about the Pāli language, a matter of primarily linguistic concern and only secondarily -- and not intrinsically -- of philosophical concern.  There is already an article on [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism; general characterizations of this nature belong in that article, not in an article on Pāli.

== Pali Wikipedia ==

This article includes a link to Pali Wikipedia. On following the link I find a main page in devanagari script, with no immediately obvious way to convert the display to other scripts. Why are Indians being allowed to take over Pali? Only a pretty small percentage of Pali users use nagari. If Serbo-Croat Wikipedia were confined to one script it would start a war. [[User:Peter jackson|Peter jackson]] 12:04, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
: I think the Pali wikipedia was previously in romanized script- but there wasn't really any content to speak of.  There seems to be a widely held belief among Buddhists in India that Pali is 'supposed' to be written in devanagari- witness the numerous attempts to introduce devanagari text into this article.  It's an accessibility issue that should be brought up at the Pali WP- fortunately, I think a war is pretty much out of the question. --[[User:Spasemunki|Clay Collier]] 23:10, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

::I don't think that the practice of using Devanagari as the script is entirely due to &quot;Indians being allowed to take over Pali&quot;, which is a rather divisive statement.  In Western academic literature, the texts are generally printed either in [[IAST]] as the romanization standard or in [[Devanagari]], which became the most common Indic script used by European Indologists who popularized the practice in the last century.

Political instability has scholarship of any kind in Cambodia, Burma, Sri Lanka, etc., for the past century, with conditions in Thailand not much better; so the relative &quot;stability&quot; offered by India and its national script has been an alternative --even if not a good one-- in part because the use of Devanagari neither slights Sri Lanka nor Thailand, etc.  (www.pali.pratyeka.org)  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/125.26.180.9|125.26.180.9]] ([[User talk:125.26.180.9|talk]]) 10:42, 6 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Thanks a lot for the discussion about Pali wikipedia. First of all, the opening statement is incorrect. Pali wikipedia has not been taken over by an Indian. I am the person who introduced Devnagari script in Pali wikipedia and I am no where close to being an Indian. Pali wikipedia was initially started in Latin. However, there were no significant attempts to improve it. Other Pali projects such as wiktionary have been closed due to lack of contribution. I know very less Pali. The only way in which I know Pali is written in Devnagari script. Those are my only sources. So, in order to preserve the pali wikipedia and contribute with the little knowledge of Pali that I had, I chose to contribute in Devnagari script. I dont know why other users look down upon Devnagari script but it is one of the many scripts in which Pali is written. Users who would like to contribute in other scripts are welcome in Pali wikipedia to contribute in their respective scripts. I had once written in Bugzilla to arrange system like in Chinese or Kazakh wikipedia where multiple scripts are enabled but nothing happened as none of the people were interested in contributing in other scripts in Pali. I even wrote to some pali forums and users in Thai wikipedia but no one showed up there. Ironically, even this debate is being held in English wikipedia in some Indo-phobe manner and not in Pali wikipedia. I think its more attitude and less action that is the real culprit here.

== Pali grammar ==

Any thought to adding a section on Pali grammar &amp;mdash; similar to that on other language pages such as [[Latin#Grammar]] (which is just a summary of larger articles) or even [[Greek_language#Characteristics]]?  

If I may add, it appears that this article has terrifically detailed information helpful to those who know Sanskrit; but for those who know only or primarily English, there's little information (e.g. on conjugation, declension, syntax).  Is this purposeful for some reason?  (For instance, as a parallel, I know the [[Buddhist meditation]] article has no instructions for actually meditating but this is because it attempts to systematize other WP articles that provide such information.)  

Basically just curious.  Thanks to all those whose hard efforts have created that excellent information that this article already contains.  Mettāya, [[User:Larry_Rosenfeld|Larry Rosenfeld]] ([[User_talk:Larry_Rosenfeld|talk]]) 05:36, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

And I think the problem is that I have little appreciation for the various nounal cases (nom., acc., gen., etc.).  I think I'm beginning to make headway but it's only because I've been reading about noun cases in my wife's Wheelock's Latin text (Latin seeming to have all but the instrumental and locative cases).  It then dawned on me that there might be a WP Pali article putting such in context ... but, alas :-)

==Pali script==
The Ashok pillar in Lumbini, Nepal was written in Brahmi script in Pali. It is one of the oldest remaining literature in Pali. None of the other scripts have been used before this. Besides, the script was used when the language was thriving. So, I think that it should be considered as the native script.--[[User:Eukesh|Eukesh]] 21:06, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

:::&quot;Native&quot; is not an applicable concept.  However, &quot;first script&quot; is less contentious.  We have Pali inscriptions in Sri Lanka older than Ashoka (but of the same period &amp; dynasty, viz., not much older) using an even cruder, but otherwise similar, script.  Thus, do not assume that because the writing took place in Sri Lanka, the orthography was so different than in contemporaneous mainland India.  The notion that no writing-down of Pali whatsoever took place prior to the systematic &quot;canonization&quot; (viz., re-organization) of the texts is historically absurd --albeit a common religious conceit, as the modern religion valorizes memorization.  K.R. Norman has argued that the first (viz., earliest) orthography used was of greater importance than scholars have heretofore supposed, and that this is demonstrable from changes made to certain poems when the orthography was &quot;modernized&quot;, and geminate clusters spelled out in full; the putative &quot;first&quot; script here alluded to would be broadly similar to Ashoka's, and, e.g., not write out geminate &quot;stacks&quot; in full.

== Emic vs. Etic vs. real scholarship ==


Some careful thinking should be done as to whether the opinions of Sanskrit texts (viz., Hindu or, in some cases, Mahayana) are to be counted as &quot;Emic&quot; or &quot;Etic&quot; in relation to the Pali canon.

It is quite evident that whoever wrote that section (as it is currently) is not working with the primary texts.

I do not mean to say that it is of zero value ... but it is both confusing and confused.

Sanskrit sources say various things about Pali, e.g., that (in the context of classical Indian theatre) it is only appropriate for the parts spoken by whores (cf., M. Deshpande's _Sanskrit &amp; Prakrit: Sociolinguistic Issues_) --but is this &quot;Emic&quot; or &quot;Etic&quot;?

As for what Pali sources themsleves say about the Pali language, that is quite another matter.

The current section needs to be re-thought --if not discarded and re-written.

The (often commented upon) notion that Pali is &quot;the original language of all beings&quot; does not mean that it is the language of &quot;reality&quot; in the vague sense suggested by the current article.  The specific claim made in one commentary that were a child to be abandoned in the woods without human parents (e.g., raised by wolves) he/she would naturally grow up to speak Pali, is currently badly (mis-)represented with the statement that Pali &quot;is the language of... wolf-children&quot;.  It would be impossible for a reader without prior knowledge of the specific anecdote to remotely understand what is meant by this section of the article, as it is now worded.

Thus, the text is now &quot;confused and confusing&quot;, as I say.

The notion that Pali nouns correspond to &quot;actual entities&quot; (viz., &quot;reality&quot;) relates to schools of philosophy first found in commentaries and sub-commentaries to the Abhidhamma --and these textual sources are chronologically and geographically far removed from the Buddha's own milieu.  The changing notion of the language over time could thus be commented upon, perhaps drawing on Dr. Aloysus Pieris' studies of the Abhidhamma commentaries.  (I must leave this to someone with access to a better library than I).

In Pali texts, the gods speak Pali; in Sanskrit texts, the gods speak Sanskrit, and so on.  This does not necessarily entail the tacit claim that the gods speak Pali all the time.  It is well worth noting precisely who makes such claims precisely when (viz., which period of the development of the language and tradition gives rise to which lingual conceits).  In modern Thailand, I have been informed that studying Pali will allow me to converse with birds; however, I am not aware of any special (religious) significance of birds, nor any claim about conversing with birds, in the classical Pali texts themselves.  Nor, for that matter, has a bird yet spoken to me in Pali.

Of course, I prefer the description of the language on my own website: www.pali.pratyeka.org  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/125.26.180.9|125.26.180.9]] ([[User talk:125.26.180.9|talk]]) 10:29, 6 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Pali is the language of Theravada Buddhism, &amp; essentially nothing else. It's therefore proper to give briefly the traditional Theavada views about the language. For the moment I've simply said &quot;by the time of the Pali commentaries&quot;, but bear in mind that most of the material in them is much older. Unfortunately, we can't usually tell which parts.

Magadha - Magadha - where was Magadha? Is there any epigraphic proof of Bihar being Magadha before the third century B.C. ? There is no such evidence. Ancient Magan was Magadha.

Did Gotama Buddha ever preach in Bihar or UP? He did not. Pali should have been a Nepalese dialect had Gotama been born at Lumbini as the thug Fuhrer[http://www.lumkap.org.uk] wrote. This article is just as bad as Fuhrer's theory.

There is no recognition of the affinity of Pali with Avestan, or of the fact that the names of Gotama and Tissa are there in the [[Persepolis_Fortification_Archive]].

Dear RandomCritic,

“The separation between the Indic and Iranic branches is prehistoric and long pre-dates the development of Pali.” Ah this is revelatory! 
“Pali arose in India and is a purely Indic idiom”;
“Avestan is likewise purely Iranic”. This is blissful.
It leads to other syllogisms such as 
1) Gotama was purely Indic,
2) Gomata was purely Iranic and
3) Zoroaster was purely Iranic. 
But RandomCritic, Alexander celebrated his victory over the Indians(impure?) at Kohnouj which is a Purely Iranic city and is near Patali.
For your information RandomCritic this Patali goes back to the 4th millennium and a new Bronze-age civilization at Jiroft and Kohnouj has been discovered recently.
Also RandomCritic Sir Charles Eliot who knew a little about Indian history warns against pure stuff :
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our geographical and political phraseology about India and Persia obscures the fact that in many periods the frontier between the two countries was uncertain or not drawn as now.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Your first sentence “There is absolutely no evidence to even remotely suggest that the historical Buddha was born, lived, or taught in any region other than north central India (including parts of Nepal).”, sounds, alas, like political propaganda. Well E. Conze did not quite think so. Have you, dear RandomCritic, heard of the Persepolis Fortification Tablets? If you have, are you aware that the name Tissa appears in the tablets? Does it 'remotely' suggest something to you? Dear friend, you seem to have lost your way after being fed large doses of Fuhrerisms. This reminds me of  a sentence in R. Thapar’s book on Ashoka and the decline of the Mauryas – “The identification of Pataliputra is beyond any doubt”. She may or may not have been awarded the $1mn Kluge prize for gems like this but it contrasts with the view of the learned archaeologist A. Ghosh, that there is no archaeological basis for Pataliputra. And your view that Pal’s theory has “no acceptance at all in any academic quarter” is also only partly true. Yes it is strongly detested by the ‘Dalits’ and ‘Brahmans’ but the late N. G. L. Hammond, editor of the Cambridge Ancient History, Oxford Classical Dictionary and the discoverer of Vergina, who was really not Thapar class, supported Pal. And here is this Upenn review[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2007/2007-12-39.html] which also acclaims Pal’s work. Another review[http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/05-19pal.htm] by an Oxford University scholar also seems to praise his approach. Bizarre isnt it RandomCritic? 
For your information RandomCritic, recently about ten thousand, yes ten thousand Buddhist ancient fragments have been discovered at Bamiyan which has been compared with the discovery of the Dead sea scrolls. Dear RandomCritic does this tell you anything? Why Bamiyan and not why not Nepal? RandomCritic why is it that nothing in the art, archaeology, history or literature of early Nepal has the faintest hint of Buddhism?
Scholars like R. Thapar are just sitting on a pile of stinking rubbish created by Fuhrer and Jones.

Dear RandomCritic,

I had found your statement “The separation between the Indic and Iranic branches is prehistoric and long pre-dates the development of Pali.”, revelatory but now I am having second thoughts. Al-beruni, who is considered to be the greatest scholar of his day, wrote that Zoroaster drove the Buddhists out of Iran. This seems to mean that the Indians and the Iranians had not separated completely by the sixth century B.C.. Gotama (or his Fuhrerian incarnation)is born in Nepal and (wow!) Zoroaster who was more than 2000 miles away turns against him. Surprisingly this is also indicated by Alexander's victory over the Indians at Kohnouj. He also gave the strange information that Gotama's name was Buddho-Dana. Now Dana-names are found in the Persepolis_Fortification_Archive. Hsuan Tsang also reported that Langka-lo in Persia had more than 100 monasteries and more than 6000 brethren. Dear RandomCritic if only you care to look into it you would also find many Shramanas (Sharamana) in the archive. The archive according to you is purely Iranic but take ten Pali proper names, it is likely that you will find at least two in the Persepolis_Fortification_Archive. This is of great importance in any study of Pali and just because R. Thapar does not write about it, RandomCritic you should not shut your eyes to it.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 02:51, 16 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Dear RandomCritic,

It may be easy to dismiss Al-beruni's information about Gotama's name Buddho-Dana as absurd but please note that his father and all his uncles also had Dana-names. You must be familiar with the 'M' to 'B' interplay in linguistics. PF2069 mentions a city Mandumatis which I think is Bandhumati of the Pali texts which was the abode of Vipassi Buddha. It is not easy to physically locate Mandumatis and as city-names get replicated, the abode of Vipassi could on paper be another city in Afghanistan. Only I have no doubt it was not in Nepal or Eastern UP.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 07:49, 16 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Mejda,

The Pataliputta of the Buddhist suttas was a city located (a) on the border between Magadha and the Vajjian confederacy (i.e., on the river Ganga) and (b) a walkable distance from Nalanda and Rajagaha.  Rajagaha is modern Rajgir, about 50 miles southeast of Patna.  The geography of the Buddhist texts is credible and consistent, and does not require revisionist editing.  The idea that the tiny desert town of Kahnuj could be Asoka's metropolis is absurd.  The Greek geographers who charted Pali(m)bothra unambiguously located it in India, on the southern bank of the Ganges -- not anywhere close to Kahnuj.  
Claims based on superficial similarity of names are not terribly impressive.  But I may note that the name ''Gomata'' is a _different_ name from ''Gotama'', and that Zarathushtra did not live at the time of the Buddha, but centuries earlier. Abu Rayhan Biruni lived in the 11th century CE and is not a reliable source for information about Buddhism, for which we have better primary texts as sources.

Your statement “Rajagaha is modern Rajgir, about 50 miles southeast of Patna.”, is certainly false though it is paraded as truth by writers such as R. Thapar of SOAS, London, and Dilip Chakrabarti of Cambridge University. There is nothing that has been found here by archaeology. Sir Mortimer Wheeler wrote in clear terms that the urbanization of Bihar area dates from the period of Bindusara or even later. So a Buddhist Council at Rajagaha near Patna six months after the death of Gotama is absurd. S. K. Saraswati writes about Rajagaha; `The Buddhist remains, except for stray and isolated images, are scanty'.. Even the identification of the Sattapani cave, the site of the first Council, is not beyond doubt' . You can find alternative suggestions for Rajagaha in Raychaudhuri’s book. Megasthenes’ Palibothra was on the Ganges yet Strabo wrote flatly that the Greeks `have seldom made a voyage as far as the Ganges' which agrees with the lack of Greek artifacts at Patna. Sir W. W. Tarn also wrote that the Ganges was unknown to the Greco-Macedonians under Alexander. Strabo recognized the contradictions and declared that “generally speaking, the men who have hitherto written on the affairs of India were a set of liars”. I would like that to add some women also in the ‘set of liars’. Strabo was not aware that many Iranian cities had Indian-names and that terms like ‘India’, ‘Magadha’, ‘Ganges’ etc. denoted different geographical entities in different periods. India of the 4th century BC reached up to southeast Iran. B. N. Mukherji, who edited Raychaudhuri’s book, notes that Xenophon’s India did not include the East. The same can be seen to be true of  Megasthenes’ Indica which was written a few years later. Please note that Megasthenes does not refer to the eastern cities. Please do not be carried away by references to Ganges like the ‘Dalits’ and ‘Brahmans’. Before Bhagiratha brought the Ganga to ‘India’ it must have been a river in Iran-Afghanistan. You can find the name Geng in Pal’s website. Furthermore, Curtius writes that the Ganges flows into the Arabian Sea. You wrote “The geography of the Buddhist texts is credible and consistent, and does not require revisionist editing.” This is a blanket statement to which I have nothing to add.
Your statement “The idea that the tiny desert town of Kahnuj could be Asoka's metropolis is absurd.”, again echoes ‘Dalit’ and ‘Brahman’ sentiments but is not logical. Splendid ruins have been unearthed at Jiroft which have startled scholars worldwide. You have written “The Greek geographers who charted Pali(m)bothra unambiguously located it in India, on the southern bank of the Ganges -- not anywhere close to Kahnuj.”. Dear RandomCritic, whenever you encounter the term “India” you should recite Eliot’s mantra as a charm. 
You have written “But I may note that the name Gomata is a _different_ name from Gotama, and that Zarathushtra did not live at the time of the Buddha, but centuries earlier.” Dear RandomCritic have you ever wondered about the etymology of the name Magadha? It makes no sense in Sanskrit or Dravidian. Pal gives a Sumerian etymology “Mah-Gud” which he says was accepted by Sukumar Sen, one of the greatest linguists of India who wrote one of the earliest books on Old Persian. Dear RandomCritic have your ever looked into the name Gotama? This also has a Sumerian etymology Gut-Ama (one whose mother is a Cow). The Sanskrit equivalent of Gotama is Gomata. Yes you are correct in stating that Al-beruni is a late author who should be used with caution but please exercise the same caution in case of the reports of the Chinese travellers. Martin Carver, editor of the journal Antiquity, unashamedly supports Dilip Chakrabarty’s view that the Chinese reports support Jones’ ‘discovery’ of Patna. Even though not a single artifact of the Nandas or the Mauryas have been found at Patna, M. Witzel of Harvard University supports Jones’ great ‘discovery’. Dilip Chakrabarti writes about the profusion of 2nd century B.C. inscriptions from Mathura but prefers to keep mum on the lack of any from Patna.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 00:37, 17 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Dear RandomCritic,

Al-beruni was a far greater scholar than Xuan Tsang and his statement about Zoroaster driving out the Buddhists from Iran can be independently supported from the history of Gomata who hangs like a ghost in Persian history. He is branded as a 'Maga' which may have something do with Magadha or the Maga priests mentioned in the Indian texts. His abode was Shakyavati which echoes Gotama's title Shakya. Are you aware that Shaman was a name of Gotama and later also of the Buddhists? The name Shaman appears in the Persepolis Tablets. Haman of the Book of Esther can be Gotama. Queen Vashti of the same book may be an echo of Kapilavastu. Pal's view about Kabil or Babil is available from the Wiki article on Babylon.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 02:26, 17 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Dear RandomCritic,

Your idea that Zoroaster was far older than Gotama may not be correct. Although M. Boyce, a leading authority on Zoroastrianism, places Zoroaster around 1700-1500 B.C., E. Herzfeld, T. C. Young Jr. and J. Duchesne-Guillemin put his date in the 6th century B.C. Incidentally this coincides with the rise of Buddhism and as both the religions were similar heresies  against old Vedic type creeds, there is the possibility of a link. This was suspected by Sir Charles Eliot but was soon forgotten. There were many Buddhas  before Gotama which implies that Buddhism was also as ancient as Zoroastrianism. In fact they can be seen to be sister religions which belonged to the same milieu but which later separated. At Merv and other sites Zoroastrian and Buddhist artifacts are found side by side.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 03:49, 17 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Dear RandomCritic,

The fact that Buddhism and Zoroastrianism were sister reliigions is of utmost importance in any discourse on Pali. This shows why the similarities between Pali and Avestan need to be considered with much greater care. Your statement that &quot;the separation between the Indic and Iranic branches is prehistoric and long pre-dates the development of Pali&quot; is very far from the truth and stems from the ignorance of the fact that early Magadha was not Bihar. Sadly, M. Witzel of Harvard who spent years in Nepal, does not have the insight to see through the terrible misdeeds of Fuhrer which all but ruined world history. Most of his ideas on Para-Munda are conjectural and have no epigraphic support. Only writers such as R Thapar and Dilip Chakrabarti can write about the Sishunagas, who were the kings of Magadha before the Mauryas, without bothering for a moment for archaeological proof. This is a golden tradition cherished by the 'Dalits' and 'Brahmans'. The Sishunagas can be seen to be the great Susinaks of Magan which was Magadha. The Wiki article on Magadha belongs to 'Dalit-Brahman' category and is full of fairy tales. The scholarship on Pali must be integrated with the vast body of authentic evidence available from the thousands of Bamiyan fragments.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 03:12, 18 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Dear RandomCritic,

Vedic scholars like Hillebrandt and Brunnhofer realised that in regard to the ancient era, the expression ‘Indo-Iranian’ is often preferable to terms such as ‘purely Indian’ or ‘purely Iranian’. The existence of an unbroken Buddhist community of Indians and Iranians of a much later period is clear from the paintings of Ajanta where a Persian king in depicted. Madeline Hallade writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;
Symbolic and decorative motifs adopted directly from the Iranian world, or transmitted through its agency, enriched the repertory of Indian art from its first inception; indeed its versatility is early attested by the Buddhist monuments of the 2nd century B.C. (balustrades at Sanchi and Bharhut).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead of interpreting it from a narrow nationalistic 'Dalit-Brahman' standpoint it is important to note that the ‘Iranian world’ of Hallade was in fact ‘India’. The world of Buddhism transcended the borders of India and Iran. This is also proved by the depiction of a Jataka story on a Sasanian silver plate ( G. Azarpay, Bulletin of the Asia Institute, vol. IX). Like the Jatakas, Pali-Avestan is also a common cultural heritage of both the Indian and Iranians. In my view to study the origin of Pali it is important to exclude Nepal and Bihar and turn instead to Ujjain, north-India, Bactria and also Fars where Shaman/Gomata was active. Pāli seems to be closely related to the Old Indo-Aryan Vedic and Sanskrit dialects but is apparently not directly descended from either of these. Both Sukumar Sen and Franklin Edgerton wrote that Pali was perhaps originally spoken in Ujjain. Edgerton pointed to the very extensive agreement in vocabulary between Pali and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit which he describes as a curious language. Thousands of words in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit are unknown in Sanskrit. G. Gnoli misses that Gomata was Gotama but places Zoroaster near Punjab and the Indian border (present-day). Pal writes that Devadatta of the Indian texts was Zoroaster which again links Avestan with Pali.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 01:26, 19 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Deletionist Perversions==

Why was the following clip
from the book &quot;South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India&quot;, by P. J. Claus, S. Diamond, M. A. Mills ;
&lt;blockquote&gt; The folk actors of Herat called themselves Magad and their private ethno-professional dialect (a patois of Persian with additional specialized vocabulary) Magadi. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

deleted? The book is written by learned scholars and is published by Routledge. The editor has as much right to true knowledge as the readers and should not behave as a brigand.   &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 10:40, 7 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
Would it also be wrong or immoral to read Dr. Hafizullah Baghban's pioneering work on Afghan folk art &quot;The context and concept of Humor in Magadi Theatre&quot; which has been published by Indiana University? Note the word Magadi which has nothing to do with Bihar.

:It was deleted because, regardless of the quality of the information, it has nothing to do with the Pali language.  It is completely irrelevant. If you want to start an article on &quot;the folk actors of Herat&quot;, be our guest. [[User:RandomCritic|RandomCritic]] ([[User talk:RandomCritic|talk]]) 09:40, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
Thanks for the invitation. But I do not understand why you are so scared to use the term Magadi. The article should be on &quot;Magadi Folk Actors of Herat&quot;. And dear Sir, was there not a reference to a dialect named Magadi? Yes, a dialect named Magadi. Pali, no Baghban does not mention Pali. I now recall what you wrote about the links between Avestan and Pali. Ezra refers to Sether who I think was Gotama Buddha. He read  from a book of Law which was illegible to both Hebrew and Aramaic speakers (Nehemiah Ch.VIII) which indicates that the language was either Avestan or Pali which is similar. And for the archaeologist who has not been brainwashed by phony Fuhrerized history of Nepali Buddhism, folk artists of Afghanistan have a special place as this was the true hinterland of Buddhism.

Dear RandomCritic,

I must say that I admire your child-like simplicity but you are, in fact, feeding your readers with chaff. Magadi near Bangalore is said to have been a town founded by the Chola kings around 11-12 AD. The name Magadi Kempe Gowda, founder of Bangalore, is said to be linked to Mahagani which may in fact be an echo of Magan in Sindh-Baluchistan-Karman. The ancient Dravidian language Brahvi was spoken in Seistan-Baluchistan.

Regards,

mejda

==Transliteration methods==
I am trying to determine if there are any manual of style guidelines on Wikipedia that deal with best practices for transliteration of Pali.  I am familiar with the transliteration methods for Sanskrit, and have very limited exposure to Pali.  For Sanskrit articles there is debate about how much transliteration to put in articles.  Is there a Pali guideline for English Wikipedia articles? [[User:Buddhipriya|Buddhipriya]] ([[User talk:Buddhipriya|talk]]) 00:48, 17 March 2010 (UTC)
:I don't believe so. it is somewhat ad hoc. I try to imitate the amount that I see scholars use. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 05:01, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

::Thank you for your reply.  Would you say that the majority of articles related to Pali use formal transliteration methods, or can you give samples of pages that show variation in how transliteration is done?  I am looking into the issue of how use of diacritical marks varies on Wikipedia. See: [[User:Buddhipriya/LanguageTransliterationStyleGuides]]. Since Pali uses essentially the same methods as Sanskrit it is of particular interest to me. [[User:Buddhipriya|Buddhipriya]] ([[User talk:Buddhipriya|talk]]) 05:10, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

== Myanmar (Burmese) Pali  ==

I think there could be a section on Mynmar or Burmese Pali.  I am not Myanmar/Burmese, but my first pali teacher was.  New students to pali might be interested to know that although the script is the same, the pronunciation is quite different.
I would also like to see a chart which shows the differences.  It should be noted that it is not just certain letters that change like 's,' 'c,' and 'j,' but letter combinations that change how things are pronounced too.  This is especially true with double consonants and also 'y,' and 'h' combinations. 

I remember someone telling me that they almost changed to International Pali during the 6th Buddhist Council, but there were some claims that Nepal had similar pronunciations.  I am not sure if this is really the case in Nepal though.

A topic like this might be useful for Myanmar people too. 

By the way, Myanmar people find &quot;Burmese&quot; or &quot;Burma&quot; offensive labels because it relates to a single race and not to a unified country despite the current conditions. (A Myanmar Venerable told me this.)

I can try to help, but it will take many months to write such an article however small.
