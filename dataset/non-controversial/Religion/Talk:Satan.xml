==Ha-satan==
I am working on updating the section labeled '''In the Hebrew Bible'''. I have currently finished up to my knowledge at this point in my Old Testament class at seminary. As I delve more into the Hebrew Bible I plan to add more information about the ideas of Ha-satan and of satan in both the noun form and the verb form.

==Fallen angel==
the bible did say that satan is a fallen angel. How ever I can not recall any where in the bible which states that Satan refused to bow while the other angels bow.

:Actually, it's interpretation to say that the Bible says Satan is a fallen angel.  It's a commonly accepted interpretation, but it is still an interpretation.  I do not believe the article says anything about the Bible telling the story where Satan refuses to bow.  If I'm not mistaken the Quran does tell that story, although that story was told before then. Also, please sign your posts with four tidles (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 22:03, 26 April 2010 (UTC)

:If you identify the fallen &quot;son of the dawn&quot; of Isaiah 14:12 with the &quot;accuser&quot; of other passages in the Old Testament (as mentioned in the article), then it's a reasonable conclusion to say that the Bible says that Satan is a fallen spirit of some kind (an angel if the words of Numbers 22:22 are interpreted literally).  If you don't, then probably not. [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 06:26, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

== merge with devil ==

I know this was suggested before but given that Devil, Satan and Shaitan are translations of the some words (adversary/slander/accuser) they are pretty much the some concepts, unless you mean the use of the term &quot;devil&quot; in plural. However the concept of ''the'' Devil is identical to Satan. [[Special:Contributions/174.124.182.76|174.124.182.76]] ([[User talk:174.124.182.76|talk]]) 02:36, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

:In English usage, &quot;Devil&quot; is as often a generic word as it is any kind of personal name (and is not always strictly tied to Judeo-Christian religious concepts), while Satan is always a name.  In the Greek New Testament, both the words ''diabolos'' and ''Satanas'' occur. In short, it sounds like a nice simplification in theory, but I don't know whether it would really clarify things in practice.  This article is fairly closely tied to the Bible and traditional theology, while the &quot;Devil&quot; article is more free-roaming...

== Unrepresented Satanic Groups ==

Whilst this article addresses in short detail a few theistic Satanic groups, it does not mention Spiritual Satanism. This group is often under represented in similar articles as their beliefs conflict with the Abrahmic views of Satan. I don't think it is necessary to go into large amounts of detail about the group in this particular forum however I might point out a few key differences from other more well represented Satanic groups.

Namely the largest stand out difference is Spiritual Satanism's non-conformance to Christian and Abrahmic views and doctrines about Satan (or the Devil). They do not believe him to be malignant, malevolent and inferior to any other God, nor condoning of the blood sacrifice, murder and pedophilia that has been otherwise ascribed. 

Spiritual Satanists are involved in occult knowledge and oppose not authority but oppression of basic human rights such as freedom to do sexual acts and freedom to pursue magic and practice their religion without being harassed for it. They do have somewhat of an anti-semitic view as a whole however this is not necessarily encouraged or necessary in all parts of the group the world over, most of which is internet based at the current time. 

I think to complete this article, all Satanic groups should be recognized just as the many sects of Christianity are represented elsewhere in wikipedia. There is a link where more information can be found and its addition to the main, locked page should be made. &lt;editsemiprotected&gt; www.joyofsatan.com &lt;editsemiprotected&gt;
:: If what you proport about these Spiritual Satanists is true, one would think that they worship a seperate entity that just happens to share the same name as the Abrahamic Satan, rather than the incarnation of evil outlined in the Bible and similar texts. [[Special:Contributions/173.180.74.39|173.180.74.39]] ([[User talk:173.180.74.39|talk]]) 02:07, 2 September 2010 (UTC)
Many may be evil perverts who conceal grave crimes as part of their initiation rites or ultimate practices.

== A god? ==

The Bible and other Abrahamic tomes do not call Satan a god, in part because they claim there is only one god.  If anything, they present him as being the antithesis of a god, a depraved lesser spirit driven mad with jealousy and hatred who attempts to usurp his master's place and is exiled as a result.  Nowhere, Satanism nonwithstanding, refers to the Devil as a god, so I suggest a review of his classification as such be conducted.

==&quot;Satan&quot; doesn't exist in religion==
Although it may sound unlogical, there doesn't exist an antagonist to God in the official religious scriptures of the Abrahamic religions. &quot;Satan&quot; was badly translated as being a single person, but was actually simply a person that acted as an accuser or adversary. See [[Henry Ansgar Kelly]]'s [[Satan. A biography]].&lt;ref&gt;Kijk magzine, nr 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/91.182.95.46|91.182.95.46]] ([[User talk:91.182.95.46|talk]]) 12:02, 7 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:There doesn't exist an ''equal'' antagonist (that would be dualism or Manichaeism), but there are antagonists, and generally also one principle antagonist.  This last idea is only partially developed or revealed within the canon of the Hebrew scriptures, but emerges fully in other ancient Jewish writings, as well as the New Testament. [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 17:26, 7 October 2010 (UTC)

== God? ==

Satan is a supernatural being, but by no means a 'God'; he would more accurately be called a 'Demon'. As Satan exists in the three main monotheistic religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam), it is innacurate to call him a 'God'. '''[[User:Toa Nidhiki05|''&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; face=&quot;Mistral&quot;&gt;Toa&lt;/font&gt;'']] [[User talk:Toa Nidhiki05|''&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; face=&quot;Mistral&quot;&gt;Nidhiki&lt;/font&gt;'']][[User:Toa Nidhiki05/Userboxes|''&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; face=&quot;Mistral&quot;&gt;05&lt;/font&gt;'']]''' 20:24, 12 October 2010 (UTC)

Church's teaching
The Catholic Church does not seem to ave an official doctrine on this but has however, through sermons announced the futility of helping one who is blow God and will be defeated and has also alerted it's believers to accepting his presence so that he does not use this to enter thier lives, thus by accepting his existanc they come closer to God.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Patrick 999777|Patrick 999777]] ([[User talk:Patrick 999777|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Patrick 999777|contribs]]) 00:03, 2 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

In this section it was stated originally that satan with the definite article was used in three places, indicating 1 Chronicles 21:1 as one such instance. I removed this, as 1 Chr 21:1 does not have satan with the definite article.

:::This really should be changed.  The article currently states that ''śaṭan'' שטן occurs with a definite article in Chronicles 21:1, but this is simply incorrect.  I have checked the Hebrew Masoretic Text (and a number of others), and I have not found any variants that include the definite article here.  There is no consensus on whether Chronicles 21:1 actually refers to a cosmic Satan, so I will not complain that the article cites this text as a reference to Satan.

== Satan's Identity Consistent In All Three Religions ==

The opening of this article implies that the concept of Satan as Lucifer, leader of the rebellion and of the fallen angels, does not come directly from Judaism but rather from the later Abrahamic faiths. This is misleading. Whatever concept of Satan Christianity understands is derived from the Jewish scriptures (the traditions of Europe notwithstanding). The same may be said of Islam's understanding of the Devil. In Judaism, &quot;Satan&quot; is not merely a term used to describe a generic tempter of men's faith, as this article implies; Satan is the same Devil in Jewish theology as this concept transfers unmodified into Christianity and Islam. I would revise this article, but there is always a moderator who undoes what I edit, so I won't bother.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.243.33.142|67.243.33.142]] ([[User talk:67.243.33.142|talk]]) 20:42, 8 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::The concept of Lucifer as Satan does not appear in any Jewish writings, it's only later Christian commentators, like Origen.

:Its a dangerous simplification to assume that the negative God/demon in one religion will be directly the same transposed to others. A good example of this is the assumption made by some Satanists that the Egyptian god Set is associated with Satan. - Apply a little bit of logic and if you can draw an analogy Set is more likely to be Jehovah - the evil snake that came in and attacked the Egyptian people and Gods with plagues and disasters. (how literally or not you read the tales is irrelevant) This universalising of Gods and demons across religions is just a more subtle form of indoctrination fascism - sneaking the conclusion cart of monotheism before the horse of truth or tested fact.

== Typo (Num 22.23) ==

Thought I'd mention the typo in the section listing the noun &quot;satan&quot; used in MT. The list has Num 22.22,23, but should be Num 22.22,32.

Also, use of the term in verse 32 might be better clarified with another translation. Rather than KJV translation: &quot;behold, I went out to withstand thee,&quot; to KJV translation note: {to...: Heb. to &quot;be an adversary unto thee&quot;}. Just a suggestion, thx!

== Satan in Religions other than the Abrahamic  ==

Satan is known in several indigenous religions as not only the accuser and tempter, but also as the trickster.  The most remarkable notion that separates the imperial Abrahamic traditions and most Native traditions that include fallen identities, is the ability of the devil to cause harm or human era that affect humanity directly.  It should be noted that all Christian, Islam, and Jewish text sited by the author of this article lead to a predestine state of humanity where all are guilty or to blame for the actions taken in relating to Satan.  This point grossly misleads people to believe that Satan or the Devil cause no physical harm therefore there is no fault in listening to the devil.  There are a thousand stories by the Algonquin Indians that explicitly explain that Satan and the Devil eat human flesh, pull hair while sleeping, and try to cause bodily harm or death.  The Buddha's experiences with the demon God Mara exhibit a devil that has demons that hit the flesh and soul like arrows made of flowers that perplex the individual's sense of righteousness.  The Talmudic references and Zohar references are not clearly presented in this article.  Satan's ability to harm others and accuse the innocent so that he can persecute and isolate them is clearly missing.  In fact this article should be taken down and completely rewritten by someone who actually knows what they're talking about.  You are doing the world a disservice by keeping this article up as is.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.173.53.119|68.173.53.119]] ([[User talk:68.173.53.119|talk]]) 05:58, 12 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

=== Glooskap Alogonquin Legends ===

Glooskap, the main protagonist in Alogonquin religion and known namely as the creator, has many dealings with a Sinful Serpent, a Mischief-Maker and namely a character named Lox who has been interpreted  as the devil that has risen from the dead.

== semi-protect? ==

A quick stroll through the article's history shows that it quite a target for vamdals.  Perhaps it is time for a semi-protect? [[User:Wickedjacob|Wickedjacob]] ([[User talk:Wickedjacob|talk]]) 05:10, 9 August 2011 (UTC)
:You can go ahead an request page protection, but usually unless there's a constant drumbeat of vandalism the request will probably be denied.  I do agree that it is a habitual target for vandals. [[User:Shearonink|Shearonink]] ([[User talk:Shearonink|talk]]) 05:23, 9 August 2011 (UTC)

I removed the link to Morgoth as this is a character in a literary work. I do not see how it is related to an article about Satan. --[[User:ZARguy|ZARguy]] ([[User talk:ZARguy|talk]]) 11:37, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
:Because Morgoth is part of the same &quot;source of all evil&quot; trope as the literary character Satan? [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 23:43, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
::Point noted, but just because there is an article about Morgoth or because he resembles Satan I don't think it merits a link. If I was reading an article about apples, I wouldn't expect a link to pears or nectarines at the bottom. They may be similar, but their not related, and besides, then the list of links would get ridiculously long if we were to try and link to any similar subject. Using my apple example, rather link to fruit and then under fruit there could be links to both apples and pears. So maybe the suggestion by John Carter below to have an article on the &quot;fallen-angel-vainly-trying-to-rival-God motif&quot; is a better idea, and then that article could have a see also section that includes Satan, Morgoth, Malak Taus, etc. --[[User:ZARguy|ZARguy]] ([[User talk:ZARguy|talk]]) 07:31, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

::Actually, a significant part of this article is about how in the Old Testament, Satan is '''not''' the &quot;source of all evil&quot;[sic].  Morgoth in any case actually most closely resembles the fallen-angel-vainly-attempting-to-rival-God motif... [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 01:11, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
:::And there may well be sufficient cause for a separate artcle on the &quot;fallen-angel-vainly-trying-to-rival-God motif&quot;. I think, based on some of the details I have seen elsewhere, [[Malak Taus]] qualifies as maybe a better example of that motif. Unfortunately, I haven't yet seen any sort of generally accepted version of his story, given that it seems to be primarily oral, so I'm not sure I can say that in any definitive way.

== Milton ==

Why is Milton not mentioned in this article?  In the English-speaking world, at least, Milton's version of Satan is probably the most famous and influential.  It deserves a paragraph somewhere, and probably other influential literary depictions are worth noting. [[User:John K|john k]] ([[User talk:John K|talk]]) 07:09, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

i would simply like to point out that this article claims that satan is the one responsible for eve eating the forbiden fruit and this is not true at no point in genesis does it say that the serpant is satan it simply states that it is a serpant and once god finds out that the serpant was the one that tempted eve he curses the to crawl in the dust for all his days. i apologize if some of the spelling here is wrong but my information is in-fact accurate  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.10.101.75|71.10.101.75]] ([[User talk:71.10.101.75|talk]]) 08:33, 5 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Ha-Satan is the name of the prosecuting attorney in the Hebraic justice system. This person is always presumed to be a liar until proof by two witnesses assures of the truth.

The Satan is clearly the Accuser in the Hebrew Scriptures (see Job), inciting God against His servant, Job. He was not &quot;appointed by God to test men's faith&quot;. No where is that written. Not in the Hebrew Scriptures. Not in the New Testament. You should stick to the Scripture references in supporting such statements!

:&quot;Jewish apocrypha&quot; includes ancient books well beyond those accepted in any version of the Bible.  The term &quot;Hebrew apocrypha&quot; might be a little confusing, because many of those works were not actually written in Hebrew, or the Hebrew version doesn't survive to the present day...

== Christian demonology ==

Hi. Nowhere in the article does it mention that Ha-Satan is one of the [[Seven princes of Hell]]. Lacking such information can mislead the reader into an incoherence about Satan's role in religion.[[Special:Contributions/69.146.144.86|69.146.144.86]] ([[User talk:69.146.144.86|talk]]) 03:03, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
:The concept of the seven princes of hell is pretty much Fr. Binsfield's original thinking, and not a common idea throughout Christianity or any of the other Abrahamic religions.  The absence of this information is not misleading, it is incomplete.  This incompleteness is less misleading than presenting the Binsfield's thinking as universal in , or even the way to understand the Bible.
:Demonology is inherently incoherent, everyone has their own view of how things are set up, even derivative works (such as the [[Lesser Key of Solomon]]) don't agree with their original sources (such as the [[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]).
