[[File:Day Pass down the Red Sea.ogv|thumb|300px|This video over the south-eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and down the coastline of the Red Sea was taken by the crew of Expedition 29 on board the [[International Space Station]].]]

The '''Red Sea''' is a [[seawater]] [[inlet]] of the [[Indian Ocean]], lying between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the [[Bab el Mandeb]] strait and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. In the north, there is the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], and the [[Gulf of Suez]] (leading to the [[Suez Canal]]). The Red Sea is a [[Global 200]] [[ecoregion]]. The sea is underlain by the [[Red Sea Rift]] which is part of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]].

The Red Sea has a surface area of roughly 438,000&amp;nbsp;km² (169,100&amp;nbsp;mi²).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/oceans-and-seas/the-red-sea.htm |title=The Red Sea |accessdate=6 January 2009 |work= |publisher= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emecs.or.jp/guidebook/eng/pdf/16redsea.pdf |format=PDF|title=Red Sea |accessdate=6 January 2009 |work= |publisher= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about 2250&amp;nbsp;km (1398&amp;nbsp;mi) long and, at its widest point, 355&amp;nbsp;km (220.6&amp;nbsp;mi) wide. It has a maximum depth of 2211&amp;nbsp;m (7254&amp;nbsp;ft) in the central median trench, and an average depth of 490&amp;nbsp;m (1,608&amp;nbsp;ft). However, there are also extensive shallow shelves, noted for their marine life and [[coral]]s. The sea is the habitat of over 1,000 [[invertebrate]] species, and 200 soft and hard corals. It is the world's northernmost [[Tropics|tropical]] sea.

==Name==
[[File:Tihama.jpg|thumb|[[Tihama]] on the Red Sea near Khaukha, [[Yemen]]]]
''Red Sea'' is a direct translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Erythra Thalassa'' ({{lang|grc|Ερυθρὰ Θάλασσα}}) and [[Latin]] ''Mare Rubrum'' (alternatively ''Sinus Arabicus'', literally &quot;Arabian Gulf&quot;), [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{Unicode|''Al-Baḥr Al-Aḥmar''}} (البحر الأحمر) or {{Unicode|''Baḥr Al-Qalzam''}}(بحر القلزم), [[Somali language|Somali]] ''Badda Cas'' and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] {{Unicode|''Qeyyiḥ bāḥrī''}} (ቀይሕ ባሕሪ). The name of the sea may signify the seasonal blooms of the red-coloured ''[[Trichodesmium|Trichodesmium erythraeum]]'' near the water's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-9106296 |title= Red Sea | accessdate=2008-01-14 | work= Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Some{{Who|date=October 2009}} suggest that it refers to the mineral-rich red [[mountain]]s nearby, which are called Harei Edom (הרי אדום). ''[[Edom]]'', meaning &quot;ruddy complexion&quot;, is also an alternative [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name for the red-faced biblical character [[Esau]] (brother of [[Jacob]]), and the nation descended from him, the [[Edomites]], which in turn provides yet another possible origin for ''Red Sea''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} --&gt; A theory favored by some modern scholars{{Who|date=October 2009}} is that the name ''red'' is referring to the direction South, just as the [[Black Sea]]'s name may refer to North. The basis of this theory is that some Asiatic languages used color words to refer to the [[Cardinal direction#Far East|cardinal directions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiTra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.colorsystem.com/projekte/engl/63chie.htm|title = Cardinal colors in Chinese tradition|accessdate = 2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] on one occasion uses Red Sea and Southern Sea interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient geographers called the Red Sea the Arabian Gulf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Exodus itinerary sites: their locations from the perspective of the biblical sources|author=Michael D.

The association of the Red Sea with the [[Bible|Biblical]] account of the Israelite [[Crossing the Red Sea]] is ancient, and was made explicit in the [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Book of Exodus]] from [[Hebrew]] to [[Koine|Koine Greek]] in approximately the third century B.C.  In that version, the Hebrew ''[[Yam Suph]]'' (ים סוף) is translated as ''Erythra Thalassa'' (Red Sea). (See also the more recent suggestion that the ''Yam Suph'' of the Exodus refers to a [[Sea of Reeds]]). The Red Sea is one of four seas named in English after common [[color term]]s &amp;mdash; the others being the [[Black Sea]], the [[White Sea]] and the [[Yellow Sea]]. The direct rendition of the Greek ''Erythra thalassa'' in Latin as [[Mare Erythraeum]] refers to the north-western part of the [[Indian Ocean]], and also to a region on [[Mars]].

==History==
[[File:C+B-Ship-Fig1-HatshepsuSailingBoat.PNG|thumb|right|250px|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian expedition to the [[Land of Punt]] on the Red Sea coast.]]
The earliest known exploration of the Red Sea was conducted by [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, as they attempted to establish commercial routes to [[Land of Punt|Punt]]. One such expedition took place around 2500 BC, and another around 1500 BC ( by [[Hatshepsut]] ). Both involved long voyages down the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn= 0-393-06259-7 |page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biblical [[Book of Exodus]] tells the story of the [[Israelites]]' miraculous [[Crossing the Red Sea|crossing of a body of water]], which the Hebrew text calls ''[[Yam Suph]]''. Yam Suph is traditionally identified as the Red Sea.  The account is part of the Israelites' [[The Exodus|escape from slavery in Egypt]]. ''Yam Suph'' can also been translated as [[Reed Sea|Sea of Reeds]].

In the 6th century BC, [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius the Great]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] sent reconnaissance missions to the Red Sea, improving and extending navigation by locating many hazardous rocks and currents. A canal was built between the [[Nile]] and the northern end of the Red Sea at [[Suez]]. In the late 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] sent Greek naval expeditions down the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. Greek navigators continued to explore and compile data on the Red Sea. [[Agatharchides]] collected information about the sea in the 2nd century BC. The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (&quot;Periplus of the Red Sea&quot;), a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[periplus]] written by an unknown author around the 1st century AD, contain a detailed description of the Red Sea's ports and sea routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn= 0-393-06259-7 |pages= 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Periplus also describes how [[Hippalus]] first discovered the direct route from the Red Sea to India.
[[File:Map of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.jpg|thumb|left|Settlements and commercial centers in the vicinity of the Red Sea involved in the [[spice trade]], as described in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''.]]
The Red Sea was favored for [[Roman trade with India]] starting with the reign of [[Augustus]], when the [[Roman Empire]] gained control over the Mediterranean, [[Egypt]], and the northern Red Sea. The route had been used by previous states but grew in the volume of traffic under the Romans. From Indian ports goods from [[China]] were introduced to the Roman world. Contact between Rome and China depended on the Red Sea, but the route was broken by the [[Aksumite Empire]] around the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= East |first= W. Gordon |title= The Geography behind History |year= 1965 |publisher= W.W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn= 0-393-00419-8 |pages= 174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Red Sea was an important part of the [[Spice trade]] route. In 1513, trying to secure that channel to Portugal, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] laid siege to [[Aden]].&lt;ref&gt;By M. D. D. Newitt, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vpteLQcx6J4C&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Red%20sea&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Red%20sea&amp;f=false &quot;A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400-1668&quot;], p.87, Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0-415-23979-6&lt;/ref&gt; but was forced to retreat. They cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], as the first European fleet to have sailed this waters. 

In 1798, [[France]] ordered General [[Bonaparte]] to invade Egypt and take control of the Red Sea. Although he failed in his mission, the engineer [[Jean-Baptiste Lepère]], who took part in it, revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged during the reign of the [[Pharaoh]]s. Several canals were built in ancient times from the Nile to the Red Sea along or near the line of the present [[Sweet Water Canal]], but none lasted for long. The [[Suez Canal]] was opened in November 1869. At the time, the British, French, and Italians shared the trading posts. The posts were gradually dismantled following the [[First World War]]. After the [[Second World War]], the Americans and Soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil tanker traffic intensified. However, the [[Six Day War]] culminated in the closure of the Suez Canal from 1967 to 1975. Today, in spite of patrols by the major maritime fleets in the waters of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal has never recovered its supremacy over the Cape route, which is believed to be less vulnerable.

==Oceanography==
[[File:Red Sea topographic map-en.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bathymetric map of the Red Sea]]
The Red Sea lies between arid land, [[desert]] and semi-desert. The main reasons for the better development of reef systems along the Red Sea is because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation pattern, The Red Sea water mass exchanges its water with the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Gulf of Aden]]. These physical factors reduce the effect of high salinity caused by evaporation  water in the north and relatively hot water in the south.  

The [[climate]] of the Red Sea is the result of two distinct monsoon seasons; a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon. Monsoon winds occur because of the differential heating between the land surface and sea. Very high surface temperatures coupled with high salinities makes this one of the hottest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world. The average surface water temperature of the Red Sea during the summer is about {{convert|26|C|F|0|lk=on}} in the north and {{convert|30|C|F|0|}} in the south, with only about 2&amp;nbsp;°C (3.6&amp;nbsp;°F) variation during the winter months. The overall average water temperature is {{convert|22|C|F|0|}}. 
Today surface water temperatures remain relatively constant at 21&amp;ndash;25&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;ndash;77&amp;nbsp;°F). Temperature and visibility remain good to around 200&amp;nbsp;m (656&amp;nbsp;ft). The sea is known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents. 

The [[rainfall]] over the Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low, averaging {{convert|0.06|m|in|2|abbr=on}} per year. The rain is mostly in the form of showers of short spells, often associated with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust [[storm]]s. The scarcity of rainfall and no major source of fresh water to the Red Sea result in the excess evaporation as high as {{convert|205|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation. A recent underwater expedition to the Red Sea offshore from [[Sudan]] and [[Eritrea]]&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC 2]] television program &quot;''Oceans 3/8 The Red Sea''&quot;, 8 pm - 9 pm Wednesday 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; found surface water temperatures 28&amp;nbsp;°C in winter and up to 34&amp;nbsp;°C in the summer, but despite that extreme heat the coral was healthy with much fish life with very little sign of [[coral bleaching]], with only 9% infected by thalassomonas loyana, the 'white plague' agent. [[Favia|''Favia favus'']] coral there harbours a virus, BA3, which kills T.loyana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528725.700-virus-power-harnessed-to-protect-red-sea-coral.html 'Virus protects coral from 'white plague','] at [[New Scientist]], 7 July 2012.p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Plans are afoot to use samples of these corals' apparently heat-adapted [[commensal]] [[algae]] to salvage bleached coral elsewhere.

===Salinity===
The Red Sea is one of the most saline bodies of water in the world, owing to high evaporation. [[Salinity]] ranges from between ~36&amp;nbsp;[[Per mil|‰]] in the southern part because of the effect of the [[Gulf of Aden]] water and reaches 41&amp;nbsp;‰ in the northern part, owing mainly to the [[Gulf of Suez]] water and the high evaporation. The average salinity is 40&amp;nbsp;‰.  (Average salinity for the world's [[seawater]] is ~35&amp;nbsp;‰ on the Practical Salinity Scale, or PPS; that translates to 3.5% actual dissolved salts.)

The [[salinity]] of the Red Sea is greater than the world average, approximately 4 percent. This is due to several factors:
# High rate of evaporation and very little precipitation.
# Lack of significant rivers or streams draining into the sea.
# Limited connection with the Indian Ocean, which has lower water salinity.

===Tidal range===
In general tide ranges between {{convert|0.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the north, near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez and {{convert|0.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the south near the Gulf of Aden but it fluctuates between {{convert|0.20|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|0.30|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} away from the nodal point. The central Red Sea (Jeddah area) is therefore almost tideless, and as such the annual water level changes are more significant. Because of the small tidal range the water during high tide inundates the coastal [[sabkha]]s as a thin sheet of water up to a few hundred metres rather than inundating the sabkhas through a network of channels. However, south of Jeddah in the Shoiaba area the water from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} whereas, north of Jeddah in the Al-kharrar area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water as far as {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. The prevailing north and northeastern winds influence the movement of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas, especially during storms. Winter mean sea level is {{convert|0.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} higher than in summer. Tidal velocities passing through constrictions caused by reefs, sand bars and low islands commonly exceed 1–2&amp;nbsp;m/s (3&amp;ndash;6.5&amp;nbsp;ft/s).
Coral reefs in the Red Sea are near Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Sudan.

===Current===
In the Red Sea detailed current data is lacking, partially because they are weak and variable both spatially and temporally. Temporal and spatial currents variation is as low as {{convert|0.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and are governed all by wind. During the summer, NW winds drive surface water south for about four months at a velocity of 15–20&amp;nbsp;cm/s (6&amp;ndash;8&amp;nbsp;in/s), whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in an overall drift to the northern end of the Red Sea. Generally, the velocity of the tidal current is between 50–60&amp;nbsp;cm/s (20&amp;ndash;23.6&amp;nbsp;in/s) with a maximum of {{convert|1|m/s|ft|1|abbr=on}} at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of the north-northeast current along the Saudi coast is 8–29&amp;nbsp;cm/s (3&amp;ndash;11.4&amp;nbsp;in/s).

===Wind regime===
With the exception of the northern part of the Red Sea, which is dominated by persistent north-west [[winds]], with speeds ranging between {{convert|7|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|km/h|mph|1|abbr=on}}, the rest of the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Aden]] are subjected to the influence of regular and seasonally reversible winds. The wind [[regime]] is characterized by both seasonal and regional variations in [[speed]] and [[direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] with average speed generally increasing northward. 

Wind is the driving force in the Red Sea for transporting the material either as suspension or as bedload. Wind induced currents play an important role in the Red Sea in initiating the process of resuspension of bottom sediments and transfer of materials from sites of dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition. Wind generated current [[measurement]] is therefore important in order to determine the sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds.

==Geology==
[[File:Dust red sea.jpg|thumb|[[Dust storm]] over the Red Sea]]

The Red Sea was formed by [[Arabia]] being split from Africa by movement of the [[Red Sea Rift]]. This split started in the [[Eocene]] and accelerated during the [[Oligocene]]. The sea is still widening, and it is considered that it will become an ocean in time (as proposed in the model of [[John Tuzo Wilson]]). In 1949, a deep water survey reported anomalously hot brines in the central portion of the Red Sea. Later work in the 1960s confirmed the presence of hot, 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F), saline brines and associated metalliferous muds. The hot solutions were emanating from an active subseafloor [[Rift (geology)|rift]]. The high salinity of the waters was not hospitable to living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Degens, Egon T. (ed.), 1969, ''Hot Brines and Recent Heavy Metal Deposits in the Red Sea,'' 600 pp, Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes during the [[Tertiary]] period the [[Bab el Mandeb]] closed and the Red Sea evaporated to an empty, hot, dry salt-floored sink. Effects causing this would have been:
*A &quot;race&quot; between the Red Sea widening and [[Perim Island]] [[volcano|erupting]] filling the Bab el Mandeb with [[lava]].
*The lowering of world [[sea level]] during the [[Ice Age]]s because of much water being locked up in the [[ice cap]]s.

A number of volcanic islands rise from the center of the sea. Most are dormant, but in 2007 [[Jabal al-Tair island]], in the Bab el Mandeb strait, erupted violently. An eruption among the nearby [[Zubair Group|Zubair islands]] followed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45807839/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.TvyIWCNWr5w link to msnbc.com (accessed 29 December 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mineral resources===

In terms of mineral resources the major constituents of the Red Sea sediments are as follows:
*Biogenic constituents:
:Nanofossils, [[foraminifera]], [[pteropod]]s, siliceous fossils
*Volcanogenic constituents:
:[[Tuff]]ites, [[volcanic ash]], [[montmorillonite]], [[cristobalite]], [[zeolite]]s
*Terrigenous constituents:

The Red Sea is a rich and diverse [[ecosystem]]. More than [[Fish of the Red Sea|1200 species of fish]]&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/TrophicEco/FishEcoList.php?ve_code=5|title=FishBase|last=Froese|first=Ranier|coauthors=Pauly, Daniel|accessdate=2009-03-12|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been recorded in the Red Sea, and around 10% of these are found nowhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siliotti|first=A.|title=Fishes of the red sea|editor=Verona, Geodia|year=2002|isbn=88-87177-42-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes 42 species of [[List of deep water fish of the Red Sea|deepwater fish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Anthia goldfish.JPG|thumb|Red Sea coral and marine fish]]
The rich diversity is in part due to the {{convert|2000|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of [[coral reef]] extending along its [[coastline]]; these [[fringing reef]]s are 5000–7000 years old and are largely formed of stony [[acropora]] and [[porites]] corals. The reefs form platforms and sometimes [[lagoon]]s along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders (such as the [[Blue Hole (Red Sea)]] at [[Dahab]]). These coastal reefs are also visited by [[pelagic]] species of red sea fish, including some of the [[List of red sea sharks|44 species of shark]].

The Red Sea also contains many offshore reefs including several true atolls.  Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic (i.e., Darwinian) coral reef classification schemes, and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area.

The special [[biodiversity]] of the area is recognized by the [[Egypt]]ian government, who set up the [[Ras Mohammed|Ras Mohammed National Park]] in 1983. The rules and regulations governing this area protect local marine life, which has become a major draw for  [[Scuba diving|diving]] enthusiasts.

[[Scuba diving|Divers]] and [[snorkeller]]s should be aware that although most Red Sea species are innocuous, a few are hazardous to humans: see [[Red Sea species hazardous to humans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book2&quot;&gt;Lieske, E. and Myers, R.F. (2004) ''Coral reef guide; Red Sea'' London, HarperCollins ISBN 0-00-715986-2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other marine habitats include [[sea grass]] beds, [[Dry lake|salt pans]], [[mangrove]]s and [[salt marsh]]es.

== Desalination plants ==
There is extensive demand of [[Desalination|desalinated]] water to meet the requirement of the population and the industries along the Red Sea.

There are at least 18 desalination plants along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia which discharge warm [[brine]] and treatment chemicals ([[chlorine]] and [[Fouling#Fouling_control|anti-scalants]]) that may cause [[bleach]]ing and mortality of [[coral]]s and diseases to the fish stocks. Although this is only a localized phenomenon, it may intensify with time and have a profound impact on the fishing industry.&lt;ref&gt;Mabrook, B. &quot;Environmental Impact of Waste Brine Disposal of Desalination Plants, Red Sea, Egypt&quot;, Desalination, 1994, Vol.97, pp.453-465.&lt;/ref&gt;

The water from the Red Sea is also utilized by [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[cement]] factories for cooling purposes. Used water drained back into the coastal zones may cause harm to the nearshore environment of the Red Sea.

==Security==
The Red Sea is part of the [[sea road]]s between [[Europe]], the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[East Asia]], and as such has heavy [[shipping|shipping traffic]].  [[Piracy in Somalia]] occurs principally near the area of the [[Gulf of Aden]] south of the sea.  Government-related bodies with responsibility to police the Red Sea area include the [[Port Said Port Authority]], [[Suez Canal Authority]] and [[Red Sea Ports Authority]] of Egypt, [[Jordan Maritime Authority]], [[Israel Port Authority]], [[Saudi Ports Authority]] and [[Sea Ports Corporation, Sudan|Sea Ports Corporation]] of Sudan.

==Tourism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
The sea is known for its spectacular [[recreational diving]] sites, such as [[Ras Mohammed]], [[SS Thistlegorm]] (shipwreck), [[Elphinstone, Egypt|Elphinstone]], [[The Brothers, Egypt|The Brothers]], [[Dolphin Reef]] and [[Rocky Island (Egypt)|Rocky Island]] in [[Egypt]] and less known sites in [[Sudan]] such as [[Sanganeb]], [[Abington, Sudan|Abington]], [[Angarosh]] and [[Shaab Rumi]].

The Red Sea became a sought-after diving destination after the expeditions of [[Hans Hass]] in the 1950s, and later by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]]. Popular tourist resorts include [[El Gouna]], [[Hurghada]], [[Safaga]], [[Marsa Alam]], on the western shore of the Red Sea, and [[Sharm-El-Sheikh]], [[Dahab]], and [[Taba, Egypt|Taba]] on the  [[Egypt]]ian side of [[Sinaï]], as well as [[Aqaba]] in [[Jordan]] and [[Eilat]] in [[Israel]] in an area known as the [[Red Sea Riviera]]. 

The popular tourist beach of Sharm el-Sheikh was closed to all swimming in December 2010 due to several serious shark attacks, including one fatality. As of December 2010, scientists are investigating the attacks and have identified, but not verified, several possible causes including over-fishing which causes large sharks to hunt closer to shore, tourist boat operators who chum offshore for shark-photo opportunities, and reports of ships throwing dead livestock overboard. The sea's narrow width, significant depth, and sharp drop-offs, all combine to form a geography where large deep-water sharks can roam in hundreds of meters of water, yet be within a hundred meters of swimming areas.

==Bordering countries==
The Red Sea may be geographically divided into three sections: the Red Sea proper, and in the north, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of Suez. The six countries bordering the Red Sea proper are:

* Eastern shore:
** {{SAU}}
** {{YEM}}
* Western shore:
** {{EGY}}
** {{SUD}}
** {{ERI}}
** {{DJI}}

The Gulf of Suez is entirely bordered by Egypt. The Gulf of Aqaba borders Egypt, [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and Saudi Arabia.

In addition to the standard geographical definition of the six countries bordering the Red Sea cited above, areas such as [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] are sometimes also described as Red Sea territories. This is primarily due to their proximity to and geological similarities with the nations facing the Red Sea and/or political ties with said areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barth&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Barth|first=Hans-Jörg|title=Sabkha ecosystems, Volume 2|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-0504-0|pages=148|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Makinda&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Makinda|first=Samuel M.|title=Superpower diplomacy in the Horn of Africa|year=1987|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7099-4662-7|pages=37|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=5cYOAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
