== The Pope or A Pope? ==

I think the title of the article should be changed.
It should either be 'The Catholic Pope' or 'A Pope'
The reason is that there is more than one pope and the current description favours the Catholic religion over the Discordian one.
The Discordians also have popes as part of their church's hierarchy  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/109.155.179.9|109.155.179.9]] ([[User talk:109.155.179.9|talk]]) 14:04, 29 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Not only that, but having &quot;Pope&quot; go here instead of to [[Pope (disambiguation)]] is biased against [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]].  &quot;Pope of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; would be a neutral title.

:I strongly agree that this is biased towards Catholic church, since there are other religions that have pope, too. Pope should lead to disambuguation, not here, and this should be called Catholic Pope or something like that. I believe that wikipedia should not prefer any religion, and that the fact that Catholic pope was historically first or is most well known is not important. It's similar to if &quot;Church&quot; led to Catholic Church article. I also think that the concept of Discordian Pope should be at least mentioned in &quot;Other Uses&quot; section. --[[Special:Contributions/88.100.98.122|88.100.98.122]] ([[User talk:88.100.98.122|talk]]) 16:46, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
:::The top of this article states &quot;This article is about the leader of the Catholic Church.&quot; I agree this shows a bias toward a single view point. The main page as of 3/19/2012 notes the death of the Pope of the Coptic Church. At minimum the lead to this article should refer the Pope discussed here as &quot;leader of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; to distinguish from Coptic, Anglican, Orthodox, and Episcopal churches that in some cases have their own Pope and in many cases do not recognize a superior status of the Bishop of Rome. [[User:DrTh0r|DrTh0r]] ([[User talk:DrTh0r|talk]]) 02:54, 20 March 2012 (UTC)

::::I did indeed read the article, and [[Pope (disambiguation)]], and [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]], and the discussion below this old thread. I arrived at this article after reading the article currently in the news section of the main page regarding the recent death of Pope Shenouda III. The second paragraph of the article points out the bishops of Alexandra have a far older claim to the title Pope. Consider this if you searched for the article “king” and it took you to an article on King George III of England and the lead to the article seemed to indicate he was the one true king. That would be biased against the King of France, King of the Hill, and all other kings.  Likewise I and others on this talk page were trying to express that having Pope lead to an article on Pope Benedict XVI indicates he is some how superior to Pope Shenouda III and other claimants. In understand WP:PRIMARYTOPIC but is not as important as WP Neutrality. Could we at least change the hat and the lead to note Roman Catholic Pope if not a neutrality flag needs to be placed on the article.

:::::The issue of [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]] is a subjective thing based on how we'd expect people to react when seeing the title. When a reliable source in English (be it The Times, the New York Times, or any other Fishwrap of Record) has a headline &quot;Pope to Visit Jerusalem&quot;, the vast, vast majority of English readers are going to assume they're talking about JoeyRatz (Benedict XVI, now), and not any of the other Popes. If there was a similiar article &quot;The King to Speak in Miami&quot;, it would be unclear if the article meant [[Carl XVI Gustaf]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Kenny Dalglish]], [[Richard Petty]] or any of the 14 other currently serving male monarchs with the title &quot;King&quot;. As such, [[King]] redirects to [[monarchy]]. [[User:Achowat|Achowat]] ([[User talk:Achowat|talk]]) 13:28, 22 March 2012 (UTC)

== Formed 33AD? ==

This article states that the possition of Pope was formed in 33AD, How on earth is that supposed to be possible? Being the head of the catholic church, which was founded by constantine through the Council of Nicaea in 325, How could the possition predate the church itself? Just because the catholics CLAIM a buch of people from prior to the churches formation as popes, doesn't change the fact they weren't. This article is too subjective, too much bias for catholicism. It's formatted to make it seem like the catholic church is the true christian church, founded by peter himself. It's Pathetic.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/210.185.8.237|210.185.8.237]] ([[User talk:210.185.8.237|talk]]) 03:18, 22 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The problem is not the date of 33 A.D., but rather the idea that Constantine created the Catholic Church.  I hear it a lot, but it is gibberish.  There is absolutely no historical documentation to support or imply in any way that Constantine created the Catholic Church.  In contrast, there is a long and historically well documented list of popes going back to far before Constantine was ever born.  The only real options for date of creation of the position of the pope would be either approximately 33A.D. - when Peter, considered by the CC to be the first pope, kind of took over after Jesus ascended to heaven, or &quot;by 110 A.D.&quot;, the earliest historical mention of the Catholic Church by name, or 3rd, the first mention of the position of pope.  I'm not sure when that is, but it's before 110 A.D.  Either way, all of the options are far before the time of Constantine.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 04:19, 22 June 2010 (UTC)
::Prior to constantine all the churches were independant, in no way united. He is the one who united them via their creeds, and the name &quot;catholic&quot;.

The problem with this article is that it is subtly biased in favor of the Roman Catholic Church, and, as such, violates Wikipedia policies. To claim that (unnamed) &quot;historians&quot; consider Peter to be the first pope suggests that all historians agree to this claim, which they (I among them) do not. It is anachronistic (and dishonest) to suggest otherwise. The fact that the papacy does not emerge until at least the fourth, if not the fifth century, has less to do with Constantine and more to do with the nature of the office and the claims of the bishops of Rome to supremacy, a position rejected from the beginning by most Orthodox Christians and later by most Protestants.  The term &quot;papa&quot; used as a sign of respect for early leaders of the church may be older, but when we use the term &quot;pope&quot; most moderns understand this to refer to the Bishop of Rome as supreme leader of the world's Christians, which, as I pointed out above, is simply not and has not been accepted from since the first time those claims were made. Paul certainly did not consider himself subject to Peter, nor did Peter behave as a &quot;pope&quot; toward Paul and the other apostles; rather, they consulted one another collegially, which is the position taken by most Orthodox and Protestant Christians, and reflected in the writings of the New Testament.[[User:Wrstewart|Wrstewart]] ([[User talk:Wrstewart|talk]]) 23:24, 20 September 2010 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wrstewart|Wrstewart]] ([[User talk:Wrstewart|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wrstewart|contribs]]) 23:17, 20 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::In what place, exactly, does it claim unnamed historians to consider Peter to be the first pope?  It claims the opposite, actually - some unnamed historians do NOT believe that he was the first pope.  Then it goes on to mention some ancient Church leaders by name and that they considered Peter the first pope. If you really want the ambiguity of unnamed historians removed, then that actually means removing the perspective you are promoting. So I really fail to see any merit in what you are saying.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]])
:::That question has nothing to do with what you're replying to and is, therefore, irrelevant. The correct question is 'In what place, exactly, did &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; (not &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, but &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;) claim unnamed historians to consider Peter to be the first pope?', since it's referring to you and your rather non-responsive comment: &lt;i&gt;We have the historical documents [to support the papacy extending back to c. AD33]&lt;/i&gt; (none of which documents were mentioned or cited in the comment) &lt;i&gt;and the experts&lt;/i&gt; (none of which were named in the comment). &lt;i&gt;We win, game over, you are, quite simply, wrong.&lt;/i&gt; (which is out of line and has no place in any adult conversation in this -- or any -- forum).
The entire problem is the term pope is not a biblical term the very idea of the office cuts against the commands of CHrist, therefore, taking the stand that all these leaders before the founding of the first papacy by whom ever it was is biased! There is no question about that! Also that rome is the center of the church cannot be proven.   &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Kyle.Mullaney|Kyle.Mullaney]] ([[User talk:Kyle.Mullaney|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kyle.Mullaney|contribs]]) 17:52, 20 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The idea that it is not biblical or that it is against the commands of Christ is entirely your personal opinion, and wikipedia is not a place for our opinions.  Furthermore, it doesn't even remotely matter where the center of the church is.  For some 70 years during the Avingnon papacy, the pope went nowhere near Rome.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 07:09, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

::It is set down in scripture! That is not that personal opinion. The argument being made is propagated on institutional opinion. I was simply adding roundness to the article! WHoleness as it is just being taken as a fact. If they believe it is such away then that is opinion and not fact so the argument must be maintained as it was cited heavily as the argument from the Protestant view point. This is not a forum for the catholic churches beliefs to be propagated. this is It is fact! More over the point that peter was never called a pope nor called the bishop of rome is extremly important as it is the argument on which the papacy is hinged and it is from scripture and the protestant view faulty. This is institutal editing of history and you are acting as a pawn in that battle![[User:Kyle.Mullaney|Kyle.Mullaney]] ([[User talk:Kyle.Mullaney|talk]]) 15:40, 21 October 2010 (UTC)
:::First, it would help the flow of the talk page if you would place your comments in the right places and indent them properly.  Now what you say is personal opinion.  You say it is set down in scripture, but it is not.  It is set down in YOUR interpretation of scripture, but over half of all Christians interpret it very differently.  For what reason need we accept your personal intrepretation of scripture over anyone else's?  This is why wikipedia has sourcing standards and a restriction against original research.  Studylight, for example, doesn't even come close to meeting [[WP:RS]], and frankly, has a complete and utter double standard about it after reading the links you added.  You are right that this is not a forum for the Church's beliefs to be propagated.  But the article should answer the question &quot;what is the pope?&quot;  That is the purpose of the article.  Blovating on and on about the pope being unbiblical (again, in your opinion) doesn't tell anyone what or who this &quot;pope&quot; is.  Check any other encyclopedia on the planet and I guarantee that they have not turned their article on the pope into some sort of scathing expose on how wrong the pope is as you were trying to do here.  In addition, as I already explained below, this is in no way the argument on which the papacy hinges.  No one particularly cares that the term &quot;pope&quot; didn't yet exist and the pope doesn't have to live in Rome.  Hence your entire argument was spurious and pointless in the first place.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 19:18, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

== Pastor Pastorum ==

Different explanation concerning the popes signature (Paulus PP. VI) between German and English Wikipedia:

English Version:
The best-known title of the Popes, that of &quot;Pope&quot;, does not appear in the official list, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures. Thus Pope Paul VI signed as &quot;Paulus PP. VI&quot;, the &quot;PP.&quot; standing for &quot;Papa&quot; (&quot;Pope&quot;).

German Version:
lateinisch Pastor Pastorum, deutsch „Hirte der Hirten“, als Abkürzung hinter dem lateinischen Papstnamen (z. B. Benedictus PP. XVI.)
(says that PP means Pastor Pastorum as opposed to the English explanation saying that PP stands for Papa)  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.117.86.245|88.117.86.245]] ([[User talk:88.117.86.245|talk]]) 00:32, 10 July 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:So who's right?  &quot;Pastor Pastorum&quot; would really be abbreviated as &quot;P.P.&quot;, not as &quot;PP.&quot; or as &quot;Pp.&quot; (see [http://duden-suche.de/suche/artikel.php?shortname=abklex&amp;artikel_id=202775&amp;verweis=1 Duden - Wörterbuch der Abkürzungen)] or as &quot;pp.&quot; (see [http://abkuerzungen.woxikon.de/abkuerzung/pp..php Abkürzungen für pp.).]  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 06:53, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

Do we really need the full statement of those extreme Missoury Synod, declaring the pope to be &quot;antichrist&quot;.

I propose remove the Statement 43, and instead add what Protestants in general, not extremists, think about the pope.

== Infallibility: not only in 1950 ==

Most theologians —among Catholics and those who support papal infallibility— agree that canonization, as noticed in the strength and solemnity of the formula used to canonize, is an act where the Pope makes use of his infallibility ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]). It is a widespread mistake to blindly affirm that the proclamation of the Dogma of the Assumption has been the only one. St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Robert Belarmine, among others, have stated Papal infallibility in the case of solemn canonizations [http://the-hermeneutic-of-continuity.blogspot.com/2007/05/canonisation-and-infallibilty.html]. I don't know if there are further cases where papal infallibility is used or may be discussed as to have been used, but at least there are these. In the formula for canonization, the Pope invokes the authority of Jesus Christ, St. Peter and himself, makes the definition in the name of the Trinity and states &quot;due deliberation&quot; and asking for &quot;divine assistance&quot;:

 Ad honorem Sanctæ et Individuæ Trinitatis, ad exaltationem fidei catholicæ et vitæ christianæ incrementum,
 auctoritate Domini nostri Iesu Christi, baetorum Apostolorum Petri et Pauli ac Nostra, matura deliberatione
 præhabita et divina ope sæpius implorata, ac de plurimorum Fratrum Nostrorum consilio,
 Beatum N. Sanctum esse decernimus et definimus, ad Sanctorum Catalogo adscribimus,
 statuentes eum in universa Ecclesia inter Sanctos pia devotione recoli debere.
 In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

 For the honour of the Blessed Trinity, the exaltation of the Catholic faith and the fostering of the
 Christian life, by the auhtority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul,

== History ==

I don't like the way the History section of the article is reading. It sounds more like a debate than an encyclopedia article to me. For example: &quot;The study of the New Testament offers no proof that Jesus established the papacy nor even that he established Peter as the first bishop of Rome&quot;. How is that a way to begin that paragraph? Why is that even in there? First off, that Jesus didn't establish the Papacy is a debatable claim and who cares that he didn't establish him as the Bishop of Rome. Catholics don't claim that in the first place. My point is that there should be a line to be followed instead a sequence of rebuttals. The usage of words like &quot;many scholars&quot; or &quot;some scholars&quot; doesn't help the reading neither. Why not present the claim of the Catholic Church on its own history and have a separate section or paragraph or even lead to another article which explains the counterclaims. Otherwise it just becomes a little insane.[[User:Yullover|Yullover]] ([[User talk:Yullover|talk]]) 19:48, 23 September 2010 (UTC)

I'm annoyed at the History section as well. I tried editing it a bit, but I think I just muddied the waters even more. It needs a working over, to present a History of the papacy, starting with what Biblical scholarship knows about Peter, then quoting patristics on the Bishop of Rome and the Pope. Then let the reader understand what history tells us about how the terminology began, and how the office of Pope developed. Should do it, right?  Then we can have a separate section for debates and flamewars and whatnot. [[User:Washi|Washi]] ([[User talk:Washi|talk]]) 17:54, 4 November 2011 (UTC)

== &quot;Vicar of Christ&quot; ==

The following site [http://www.homolaicus.com/storia/medioevo/pentarchia/pentarchia.htm] brings affirmation: Papa Giovanni VIII (872-82) s’era proclamato “vicario di Cristo”, cioè suo unico rappresentante sulla terra e considerava Roma “caput” di tutta la cristianità e dell’impero. (Pope John VIII (872-82) had designated as the &quot;vicar of Christ, &quot; that is his sole representative on earth and saw Rome &quot;caput&quot; of all Christendom and empire.) Leaving clear therefore that since the time of John VII, shortly after the declaration of Gregory II as vicar of Peter, the vicar of Christ term was also used as a demonstration of papal primacy (that is his sole representative on earth and saw Rome &quot;caput&quot; of all Christendom and empire.) My issue is so authentic and well referenced. [[User:Kaiser Guilherme II|Kaiser Guilherme II]] ([[User talk:Kaiser Guilherme II|talk]]) 17:29, 17 December 2010 (UTC)
:You are right and I was wrong with regard to the antiquity of &quot;vicar of Christ&quot;.  However, I must add some limitations.  The oath of Saint Boniface did not use the phrase &quot;vicar of Christ&quot;.  Instead, the oath spoke of the pope as Peter's vicar.  Another correction is also necessary.  I will insert it, together with the correction about Boniface's oath, when I have more satisfactory citations to quote.

== Pope Leader of Worldwide Catholic Church? ==
Can someone provide a footnote showing that the Pope is the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church?

::Well in seeking an answer to your question I found the answer to my own as well.  Encyclopedia Britannica defines Eastern Rite Churches as: any of a group of Eastern Christian churches that trace their origins to various ancient national or ethnic Christian bodies in the East but have established union (hence Eastern rite churches were in the past often called Uniates) or canonical communion with the Roman Apostolic See and, thus, with the Roman Catholic church. In this union they accept the Roman Catholic faith, keep the seven sacraments, and '''recognize the pope of Rome as supreme head of the church'''. They retain, however, all other characteristics—e.g., liturgy, spirituality, sacred art, and especially organization—proper to themselves.

== Rewrite The Section ==Saint Peter and the origin of the office== ==

Catholics believe that this passage shows Jesus establishing his church on the shoulders of Simon son of John (Peter). Some authorities have previously asserted that the &quot;rock&quot; Jesus referred to was Jesus himself or was Peter's faith.  The general scholarly consensus is that this account is accurate, and one modern scholar agrees with the straightforward interpretation that the &quot;rock&quot; Jesus refers to in this passage is Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Daniel William | last = O'Connor | contribution= Saint Peter the Apostle | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | date = 27 November 2009 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453832/Saint-Peter-the-Apostle | quote = the consensus of the great majority of scholars today}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This section is more than SLIGHTLY biased. It makes it sound like no one challenges this position and as though the CATHOLIC consensus is the only consensus on the topic. This is not the consensus of ANY PROTESTANTS, which are a much larger portion of the world than catholics. One citation does not cover the general consensus. Nor does one citation represent a stout and unified objection by a mass of people which does form a consensus.

::(Copied from Esoglou's talk page where I first saw this discussion).

According to the LA Archdiocese it should only be capitalized when used as a title[http://www.archdiocese.la/webmanual/style.html], Archdiocese of Milwaukee[http://www.archmil.org/ArchMil/Resources/COMM/FinalMilwArchStyleGuide2011.pdf], University of Loyola &quot;Lowercase unless it immediately precedes the name of the individual who holds the position&quot;[http://advancement.loyno.edu/marketing/editorial-style-guide], etc

::Basically, what I discovered is that I think I was wrong in my interpretation.  I always thought pope should be capitalized if it was in reference to a specific individual (ala Stark).

Based on what I found, it isn't..  The only time job/roles of a person, even when speaking of a specific individual filling a specific role, is when the title immediately preceeds the users name (and is not separated via a comma/period...

:Based upon the response that I've gotten and what I've read on the subject, it seems as if the use of capitalization for specific individuals such as the pope varies by sources/style guidelines.  There is no uniform consensus on whether high level public figures should be capitalized (although it is apparently more common to do so in the U.S.)  They key is to be consistent in which method is used.  That being said, the MOS for Wikipedia has sided with the use of lower case for titles that are not immediately preceeding the individuals name.  Thus, IMO, we should follow that style guideline.
:The question that then remains, is does Pope when referring to the Office of the Pope deserve to be capitalized?  From what I can tell, the guideline is to capitalize when using the official name of the office, but not the informal name.  Eg The Department of Civil Engineering is correct, but Civil Engineering Department is not.  Thus, the usage of &quot;pope&quot; to designate the Office of the Pope (or whichever title we use for the pope) is an informal title and should not be capitalized.
:Thus, while I initially thought it should be capitalized when used to reference specific popes or as an office, my LIMITED research says otherwise---I am open to being pursuaded otherwise if somebody can show that it should be.

:::::::You are wrong---in part.  Properly speaking, if we are using the Office of the President or President of the United States then it would be capitalized.  But if we were to talk about the United States president or more generically the president, then they are lower case.  Titles are lower case, specific jobs are upper case when it is the official title, but lower case when it is not.  When I was looking into this yesterday, there was an example related to the Chicago Manual of Style.  According to the CMOS, president should be lower case unless it is used before a name or is the formal title.  First Lady is always capitalized.  The CMOS was asked about the phrase &quot;the president and First Lady&quot; because it looked weird.  The editors at CMOS responded by agreeing that it looked weird, but that the solution wasn't to IAR and capitalize president, but rather to rewrite it as &quot;President Obama and the First Lady&quot; or &quot;the President of the United States and the First Lady.&quot;

:::::Yes, the Titles section of the Capitalization page of the MOS is the governing language for capitalizing &quot;Pope/pope&quot;. However, the MOS does not ban anything. It's just a guideline and there's flexibility when it's needed.

:::::I don't see a problem with down-casing pope when it refers to the non-specific officeholder, e.g. &quot;In Catholic teaching, the ''pope'' is the successor of Saint Peter&quot;. The guideline is clear and, as you say, there is no consistent usage in sources that would suggest we need to go outside the guidelines.

To me, &quot;The Congress can impeach the president&quot; seems fine since we're just talking about a generic process not a specific event involving a specific person. I think it's the same as saying &quot;The legislature can impeach the president&quot; or &quot;The judiciary can strike down laws passed by the legislature.&quot; Likewise, I don't see the problem with &quot;In Catholic teaching, the pope is the successor of Saint Peter.&quot; &lt;font color=&quot;#500000&quot;&gt;[[User:Jojalozzo|Joja]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#005000&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Jojalozzo|lozzo]]&lt;/font&gt; 05:55, 11 December 2011 (UTC)

:::Read [[WP:OR]] and see if you can find reliable sources for what you claim to be &quot;historical FACTS&quot;.

[[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 11:57, 25 May 2012 (UTC)
Pope is a title that is derived from the older title “Pontifex Maximus”, if you don’t know what that is then look it up right here on Wiki. At the time of Peters death, Nero was the Pontifex Maximus (aka Pope). The very idea that Peter would have accepted the title of the man who was the greatest enemy of the Church of his time, is absolutely absurd Roman Catholic twisting of historical FACTS… 

The idea that the title does not apply to Nero, as it does to modern Pontiffs, is historically inaccurate. The title has NOTHING to do with Christianity, and was rejected by Christian Emperor Gratian, as “unbefitting a Christian”, then was taken up by Damasus I. Later RCC decrees would attempt to cover up this fact, and legitimize the title by fictionalizing history to claim that the Peter was the first man to hold the title. The RCC had to do this because much of their power was dependant on Peters being “the rock” that the church was founded on. 

As to his election by the college of cardinals, the answer is yes. The Roman Empire also selected its Pope according to the vote of its College of Pontiffs, the Collegium Pontificum.

Historically, the TRUE line of popes does NOT go back to peter, it historically goes back through the line of emperors starting with Gratian and going backwards. The Roman Catholic Church has made up a fictionalized version of events to help cover up this fact from the common man who would never bother to look up the real source and meaning of the title. 

And so that brings us back to my original question.

:Your baseless conspiracy theories really have no place in the article.  Wikipedia is about stating historical facts, but what you got, ain't.  There is historical record of popes going back to Peter.  The second pope was Linus, who is also mentioned in the bible.  Now the title Pontifes Maximus passed through Roman emperors for centuries until one such emperor gave the title to the pope as a gift.  From there it changed hands.  And the title pope?  Derived from the Latin word for father.  You can't assume that it came from Pontifes Maximus just because they both start with a P.

Talk about a fail...

Fail... 

Despite RCC apologists trying to muddy the water on the Pontifex Maximus page:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_Maximus#Roman_Catholic_use_of_the_title

“In 382, the Emperor Gratian, at the urging of Ambrose, removed the Altar of Victory from the Forum, withdrew the state subsidies that funded many pagan activities and formally renounced the title of Pontifex Maximus.[22] It is said that Pope Damasus I was the first Bishop of Rome to assume the title,[23] Other sources say that the use of such titles by bishops, including the Bishop of Rome, came later.”

Certainly is not a conspiracy theory, its historical fact, regardless of the RCC trying to change history.
Nice try on changing this WIKI article as well. But lets cut right to the meat...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratian#Suppression_of_Paganism

“Gratian refused to wear the insignia of the Pontifex Maximus as unbefitting a Christian, renouncing the title and office of Pontifex Maximus under the influence of Ambrose, declaring that it was unsuitable for a Christian to hold this office. Gratian was quickly faced with a revolt from Magnus Maximus to the throne because he was more sympathetic to the Pagan cause.”

Nice job in removing it from Damasus I page and replacing it with it with a cut&amp;paste from the above page that fails to mention him taking the title...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Damasus_I#Emperor_Gratian

Again though, no conspiracy theory, Peter was a Bishop, he was not the Pope. Nero was the Pope during the time that Peter was put to death.

BTW...

Did you even bother to read this article itself:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope#Pontiff

“Pontiff

Oh no conspiracy theory here, I've watched it happen over years of sourcing said articles.
 
For example, in 2007 the Damasus I article read:

“Many in both Pagan and Christian society saw in Damasus a man whose worldly ambitions outweighed his pastoral concerns. His entertainments were infamous for their lavishness. Praetextatus, a wealthy aristocrat and a high priest in the cults of numerous gods, reportedly joked to Damasus, &quot;Make me bishop of Rome and I will become a Christian&quot;. Some of his critics called him &quot;the ladies' ear-tickler.&quot; 

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, &quot;An accusation of adultery was laid against him (378) in the imperial court, but he was exonerated by Emperor Gratian himself (J. D. Mansi, Coll. Conc., III, 628) and soon after by a Roman synod of forty-four bishops (Liber Pontificalis, ed. Duchesne, s.v.; Mansi, op. cit., III, 419) which also excommunicated his accusers.&quot;

All removed since then with an excuse that the accusations were unfounded. 

BTW, your list is wrong in not including Nero, he even had coinage minted with his title of Pontifex Maximus on it...
 
In 2007 the List of Emperors read:

“October 54 to 11 June 68 NERO CLAVDIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS 55: Pontifex Maximus; later Pater Patriae;”

Now also removed:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_Emperors

Notice the cleaver editing of the Pontifex maximus page to cast doubt on how the position came into being:

2007:

“The Pontifex Maximus was the high priest of the Ancient Roman College of Pontiffs. This was the most important position in the Ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians, until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. It was last held by the Christian Roman Emperor Gratian until the title passed over to the Bishop of Rome.[1][2] 
Today, &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; is one of the titles of the Bishop of Rome as Pope of the Catholic Church. As a papal title, the translation Supreme Pontiff is customary when writing in English, in which the Latin term Pontifex Maximus refers to the former pagan Roman post.”

Today:

“The Pontifex Maximus (Latin, literally: &quot;greatest pontiff&quot;) was the high priest of the College of Pontiffs (Collegium Pontificum) in ancient Rome. This was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian[1] (reigned 375–383) who, however, then decided to omit the words &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; from his title.[2][3]

The word &quot;pontifex&quot; later became a term used for Christian bishops,[4] including the Bishop of Rome,[5] and the title of &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; was applied within the Roman Catholic Church to the Pope as its chief bishop. It is not included in the Pope's official titles,[6] but appears on buildings, monuments and coins of popes of Renaissance and modern times.”

I can show many such edits in a brazen attempt to publish the Official Roman Catholic cover story vs the reality of history. I'd be very interested to know how many of these sourced documents being used to convey doubt on the topic, are in fact publications from Rome itself. 

BTW...
There is no “conspiracy theory” about these attempts to “cover up”, its a well known part of Romes Counter-Reformation tactics. The facts are that Peter is not a Pope, and he, as well as Paul, were both put to death by the sitting Pope of their day, Nero.
:Roman Catholic popes certainly hold the title of Pontifex Maximus, but it does not operate the other way around - the holders of that title in the ancient Roman Empire, such as those before Christ, were not popes. If you can find a good source that gives Nero the title of Pope, i would be astonished. Astonish me, if you can. --[[User:Skyring|Pete]] ([[User talk:Skyring|talk]]) 09:27, 28 May 2012 (UTC)
::Precisely. The OP seems to be operating under the logical fallacy that, because all popes are Pontifex Maximi, all Pontifex Maximi are popes. The title has a long and storied history, and wasn't even adopted by the bishop of Rome until (if I'm not mistaken) the early fifth century; its use prior to the establishment of the papal office (and indeed Christianity itself) is no argument for its claimants having some status as head of a then-future organization (the Roman Catholic Church).

Does Columbia university press count as source enough, or does it only have to be a Catholic source?

http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/pontifex
“pontifex maximus 
(pŏn´tĭfĕks măk´sĭms) , highest priest of Roman religion and official head of the college of pontifices. As the chief administrator of religious affairs he regulated the conduct of religious ceremonies, consecrated temples and other holy places, and controlled the calendar. During the time of the empire, and until Christianity became firmly established, the emperor was designated pontifex maximus. After the supremacy of Christianity, the popes assumed the title.”

After all its not like the RCC is above using their scholars to write source info in attempts to hide their actual history. 

How about this list, which though incomplete, is more accurate then those coming from Roman Sources:

{{facepalm}}Your own source says the title was used until the middle of the fourth century by Roman Emperors and not until the end of the sixth century was it used by Popes.  Nobody is doubting that.  But according to your logic, the lineage of popes goes back to 712 BCE---Long before Jesus or any institute vaguely resembling the Catholic Church.

== Date of possible beginning of Peter's 'term' as Pope ==

Quite separate from the debate over whether the position of Pope existed at the time of Peter (see Talk above), it appears that the proposed date of his ascension (29AD) is several years too soon (predating Jesus's death).  The Saint Peter article itself reports no such date, and in fact one of the only relevant references suggests a term of 25 years (consistent with a mid-30s beginning date).  Indeed, the Saint Peter article mentions how little we know of Peter.
:This is Wikipedia, not Sunday School class. We use reliable sources, or we don't put it in the article. There is dispute about the exact year of Jesus' death. See [[Jesus]]. I removed the dates altogether. [[User:Cresix|Cresix]] ([[User talk:Cresix|talk]]) 15:37, 16 June 2012 (UTC)
::The traditional account is that Peter was for 25 years ''in Rome'' (cf., for instance, [http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Hastings+%2225+years%27+episcopate%22 Hastings]), so that, if governing directly the church in Rome is considered essential for being Pope, that is the period assigned to him.  (It is said that the ceremony of coronation of a Pope included the phrase &quot;Annos Petri non superabis&quot; (You will not surpass the years of Peter), and that, at his coronation, Pope Pius IX, who as things turned out did reign for more than 25 years, remarked aloud: &quot;That's no dogma of the faith&quot;; but that story is doubtless a ''post factum'' joke.)  The generally accepted date for Peter's death is AD 64 or 67.  This is reflected in the [[Annuario Pontificio]], which makes no statement of its own about the beginning of Peter's position as Pope, merely reporting the document of 354 that says Peter was in Rome for 25 years and adding that Peter resided earlier in Antioch. Whoever put AD 29 or 30 or 33 as the beginning date must be linking it with &quot;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven&quot; or with &quot;Feed my sheep&quot;.  Whatever date is given should be sourced.  At present it isn't.  I don't know what source says Peter was Pope for about 30 years, as now stated in the article.  I haven't searched for one.

:::It would be nice to have a source for &quot;about 30 years&quot;, but the phrase is vague enough that I personally don't think it needs a citation. If Peter was pope at the time of Jesus' death (if you assume that Jesus made Peter the pope rather than when specifically Peter was ''in Rome''), and you look at the range of estimates for death dates of Jesus and Peter, 30 years as a rough estimate is not unreasonable.

It's well sourced that, according to Catholicism, Jesus' &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot; statement instituted the papacy, which (perhaps) conflicts with &quot;Peter's time in Rome&quot;.

Why does the protestant perspective exist at all here?  An article should answer the question &quot;What/who is (article title)?&quot;  This article's purpose is to explain what the pope is - the history of him, where the idea came from, what his purpose is, etc.  Yes, an article should include criticism, but this is more than criticism.  It is presented as a declaration of irrefutable fact.  It is, as I have explained multiple times already, and which Cresix has repeatedly chosen to ignore, presented argumentatively, it uses questionable sources, lacks sources for some statements, and thus includes synthesis as well.

And please tell us ''specifically'' what is &quot;questionable&quot; about the sources besides the fact that it is not a Catholic perspective; please refer us to the specific parts of [[WP:RS]] that you use to determine that the sources are &quot;questionable&quot;. And by the way, thanks for finally acknowledging that you don't think a Protestant perspective belongs in the article. (FWiW for anyone interested, I am a faithful Catholic but I don't think my personal perspective should dictate what belongs in a Wikipedia article.)

* '''Comment''' The RFC is an attempt to inveigle other editors in an edit war. The Protestant point of view on the term &quot;Pope&quot; is an abberant point of view, since the Protestant Churches separated from Rome. The rule of Vincent of Lerins (What is held to be true by all people in all times and places) should apply to the use of the term &quot;Pope&quot;. &quot;Pope&quot; in common parlance and everyday usage refers to the Bishop of Rome, and, in ecclesiastical usage, refers to leaders of churches who are in communion with Rome, e.g., Pope Shenouda of the Coptic Church. Usage of Pontifex Maximus to imply Nero was a Pope in today's usage is ephemeral sophistry.  Nero is only remembered in infamy.

::Please stop [[WP:AGF|assuming bad faith]] by attributing &quot;an attempt to inveigle other editors&quot; to me. Comment on the issue, not editors. You may consider the Protestant point of view &quot;abberant&quot;. The Catholic Church may consider it &quot;abberant&quot;. I, as a Catholic, even might consider it &quot;abberant&quot;. Fortunately the contents of Wikipedia is not confined to your, or my, or the Catholic Church's points of view. Please carefully read [[WP:NPOV]]. ''Any'' major point of view about ''any'' topic is appropriate for Wikipedia, as it is for any encyclopedia. And the Protestant point of view is a major point of view. Do you think Encyclopedia Brittanica refuses to include a point of view simply because the Catholic Church disagrees with it? If you do, I have some land in the Florida Everglades to sell you real cheap. This is an encyclopedia, not anyone's [[WP:SOAP|personal soapbox]]. Your approach to editing might work on a Catholic website, but if you think different points of view are unacceptable on Wikipedia, this is not the place for you. And if you wouldn't mind, please explain your sentence: &quot;Usage of Pontifex Maximus to imply Nero was a Pope in today's usage is ephemeral sophistry&quot;.

::::{{ec}} Uhm, Pope Shenouda was (he died this year) the head of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] which is in the [[Oriental Orthodox]] communion, not the [[Catholic Church]] communion. The Catholic Church has but one Pope who has the primacy of rule. The heads of the other 22 Catholic Churches are known as Patriarchs or Major Archbishops and are never called Pope. And not to mention the schismatic, sedevacantist Catholic churches which have elected their own popes. So the topic of Pope in common parlance is a bit more widespread than just the Catholic Church.

:::::Yes, most major Christian religions have a perspective on the term &quot;pope&quot;, all of which are appropriate for this article if someone wishes to do the research and add to the article. [[User:Cresix|Cresix]] ([[User talk:Cresix|talk]]) 00:57, 1 July 2012 (UTC)

== Mussolini ==

I am not sure how much quality [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pope&amp;diff=504996315&amp;oldid=504984516 this edit] lends to the article. It is poorly written and seems to be intended to make some kind of point about Italy or its relation to the Church, as well as being [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] given to the topic. I feel that the linked [[Lateran Treaty]] article adequately describes the state of Italy in 1929, and the sentence as it was before adequately described the event in relation to the office of Pope. If it is desired to include the leaders of those nations, then my counterproposal is the following sentence: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;In 1929, the [[Lateran Treaty]] between Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] and the Holy See under [[Pope Pius XI]] established the [[Vatican City State]], guaranteeing papal independence from secular rule.&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 21:55, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
:&quot;Poorly written&quot; is an understatement. I agree that the statement has no value for the article. My personal opinion is to revert back to the previous version, although I could accept your suggestion if others feel that it is important enough to name leaders. [[User:Cresix|Cresix]] ([[User talk:Cresix|talk]]) 22:57, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
::The text of the Treaty explicitly says it is a treaty between Italy (without additional qualification) and the Holy See (without additional qualification).  Both sides consider the Treaty to be still in force, not a treaty between a defunct &quot;fascistic Italy&quot; and a still existing Holy See.  The Treaty expressly says that the signatories, Benito Mussolini and Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, were acting on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III and Pope Pius IX, who were the heads of state who ratified the Treaty.

== Silver hammer ==

This snopes article&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/religion/hammer.asp&lt;/ref&gt; states that the silver hammer to the dead Pope's head is undetermined to be true. Guardian later published a correction to the original (and disseminated article) in which it stated that according to the Vatican, it is a myth. And according to a later AP report, there ised to be such a practice until 2 Vatican.

== the establishment of canon law.[56] under the heading Medieval... ==

the establishment of canon law, although canon law is mentioned even earlier in for instance the canons of the Council of Gangra specifically as previous ecclesiastical canons by that mid fourth century council held in the Galatian region:  Epilogue relates &quot;These things we write, not to cut off those who wish to lead in the Church of God an ascetic life, according to the Scriptures; but those who carry the pretence of asceticism to superciliousness; both exalting themselves above those who live more simply, and introducing novelties contrary to the Scriptures and the ecclesiastical Canons.&quot;
