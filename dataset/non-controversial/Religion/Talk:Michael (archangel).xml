Michael is the highest [[archangel]], for example as seen in the [[War in Heaven]], also check the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] and [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] entries. How does this not qualify for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Superlatives_in_religion Category:Superlatives in religion]? [[User:History2007]] claims this category has been overapplied? There are currently 32 entries in this category, how is this in any sense &quot;over application&quot;? Why do I feel that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_%28archangel%29&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=469773366&amp;oldid=469771995 I'm just being pushed around] because I choose to remain an anonymous editor?

:P1. Michael is an archangel.
:P2. Archangels are lower than seraphim.
:C. Any seraph is higher than Michael.
:That solves the issue of this page being in the category. But aside from that, I wholeheartedly agree with History that this category has been overapplied in the last couple days. [[User:Carl.bunderson|carl bunderson]] [[User talk:Carl.bunderson|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Carl.bunderson|(contributions)]] 20:23, 5 January 2012 (UTC)

::I had not thought of the seraph issue, and do not recall the details. But you probably know that topic better, so that should settle the issue on this page. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 20:37, 5 January 2012 (UTC)

Here are two references that should settle the issue of whether or not Michael is considered superlative:

[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10275b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Michael the Archangel]: &quot;Regarding his rank in the celestial hierarchy opinions vary; St. Basil (Hom. de angelis) and other Greek Fathers, also Salmeron, Bellarmine, etc., place St. Michael over all the angels; they say he is called &quot;archangel&quot; because he is the prince of the other angels; others (cf. P. Bonaventura, op. cit.) believe that he is the prince of the seraphim, the first of the nine angelic orders. But, according to St. Thomas (Summa Ia.113.3) he is the prince of the last and lowest choir, the angels. The Roman Liturgy seems to follow the Greek Fathers; it calls him &quot;Princeps militiae coelestis quem honorificant angelorum cives&quot;. The hymn of the Mozarabic Breviary places St. Michael even above the Twenty-four Elders. The Greek Liturgy styles him Archistrategos, &quot;highest general&quot; (cf. Menaea, 8 Nov. and 6 Sept.). &quot;

[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10779-michael#anchor8 Jewish Encyclopedia: MICHAEL: Michael and Gabriel]: &quot;It is quite natural that, owing to his position with regard to the Jews, Michael should be represented in the Haggadah as the most prominent of the archangels. He is called by Daniel (Dan. xii. 1) &quot;the great prince,&quot; and his greatness is described at length in later Jewish writings. He was one of the seven archangels first created (Enoch, xc. 21-22; Targ. Yer. to Deut. xxxiv. 6 gives only six), but among these seven four excel, and Michael is the chief of the four. Both he and Gabriel are called &quot;great princes&quot;; but Michael is higher in rank thanGabriel (Ber. 4b; Yoma 37a). He is the viceroy of God, who rules over the world (Enoch, lxix. 14 et seq.), and wherever Michael appears the Shekinah also is to be found (Ex. R. ii. 8). Michael is on the right of God's throne, while Gabriel is on the left (&quot;Haggadat Shema' Yisrael,&quot; in Jellinek, l.c. v. 166; Targ. to Job xxv. 2; Enoch, xl. 9). Four armies of angels sing in praise of the Lord, the first being that of Michael at the right hand of God (Pirḳe R. El. iv.; &quot;Hekalot,&quot; in Jellinek, l.c. ii. 43-44). A similar tradition is given in &quot;Seder Gan 'Eden&quot; (l.c. p. 138): Michael's place is by the first river, Pison, while Gabriel's is by the second, Gihon. It is Michael who, on account of his occupying the first place near God, receives the prayers of men from the angels and presents them to God (Baruch Apoc. Slavonic, xii.). His position makes him the companion of Meṭaṭron (Zohar, i. 149b).&quot;

Where it says &quot;Protestant denominations generally recognize only two archangels, Michael and Gabriel,&quot;- I understand that Gabriel is mentioned in the Bible only as a messanger and not an archangel.

Hello History, yes, I see that. One question though, is the Eastern Orthodox view of Michael so much different than the Roman Catholic Church's?  And even so, the way the section was before had BOTH, as you know now, and so why couldn't the section simply say both in the name?   Or if not, why couldn't there now be a separate section of &quot;Eastern Orthodoxy&quot;.  There isn't any now.     And really, there should be.   If you want to make Roman Catholicism section alone, I do understand that actually.  But wouldn't it be good and necessary now to at least have Eastern Orthodoxy with its own section in this article?  I mean, it's a major church.  [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 20:18, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

:Yes, what would be nice is if you could write a section on EO. I do not know EO that well, but I do know that in many cases they differ from RC. So a section on EO is a good idea if you have time to write it. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 20:26, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

::Ok, yeah, I'll try.  But again, my point is that the way the section was before, the contents made clear mention of both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox.  My question is why was Eastern Orthodox even mentioned also in the section to begin with?      I would presume that whoever put it originally way back knew that that was the view of the Eastern Orthodox also. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 21:21, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

:::I rewrote that section some time ago, and it was my error not to remove EO as I cleaned it up. That was all. If you can write an EO section that will be nice. I will not have the time for several more months. So help will be appreciated. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 21:31, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

== Eastern Orthodoxy section for Michael article ==

To Esoglou.  Hi.  If you notice, in this Michael Archangel article, there is no clear section for Eastern Orthodoxy.  But for everything else there is, basically.  Since you're very well-versed, it seems, in the differences between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, and probably their views in the area of Michael also, I was wondering if you could maybe make a new section on the Michael article for Eastern Orthodoxy, since one is lacking.  I'm sure RC and EO views on Michael are similar, but probably not 100% exactly the same.  So I would think this Archangel Michael article warrants an EO section. What do you think? Regards. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 05:23, 13 April 2012 (UTC)
:In return for an assurance by another editor that he would cease inserting attacks on the Catholic Church based on hostile comments by non-Catholics, I have undertaken to avoid inserting information based on faithful Eastern Orthodox sources about the Eastern Orthodox Church, for which I have the highest respect and affection.  The most I will do in response to your request it to place some information here for you or others to select from and elaborate on for insertion in the article by you or by other, not by me.

====Eastern Orthodox====
Eastern Orthodox calls Michael the &quot;Archistrategos&quot;, or &quot;Supreme Commander of the Heavenly Hosts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Baun+%22Michael+Archistrategos%22&amp;btnG= Jane Baun, ''Tales from Another Byzantium'' (Cambridge University Press 2007 ISBN 9780521823951), p. 391 et passim]&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this Eastern Orthodox interpretation, Michael first appears in the [[Old Testament]] in the book of Joshua's account of the fall of Jericho. Though Michael is not mentioned by name in the text, it is said that Joshua &quot;looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand&quot;. When the still unaware Joshua asks which side of the fight the Archangel is on, Michael responds, &quot;neither...but as commander of the army of the Lord I have now come&quot; ({{bibleverse||Joshua|5:13-14}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smg.org.au/saints_michaelgabriel.htm St Michael and Other Heavenly Hosts]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book of Daniel, Michael appears first to help the [[Archangel Gabriel]] defeat the Persians (10:13). In a later vision it is revealed to Daniel that &quot;at that time [the end times] Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then...&quot; (Ch. 12). Michael thus plays an important role as the protector of Israel and later of his chosen people, the [[Church]].

The [[Church Fathers]] also ascribe to Michael the following events: During the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt he went before them in the form of a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night; the power of the great Chief Commander of God was manifest in the annihilation of the 185 thousand soldiers of the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:35}}); also in the smiting of the impious leader Heliodorus ({{bibleverse|2|Maccabees|3:24-26); and in the protection of the Three Holy Youths: Ananias, Azarias and Misail, thrown into the fiery furnace for their refusal to worship an idol ({{bibleverse||Daniel|3:22-25}}). Through the will of God, the Chief Commander Michael transported the Prophet Habbakuk from Judea to Babylon, to give food to Daniel in the lions' den ({{bibleverse||Daniel|14:33-37}}). The Archangel Michael disputed with the devil over the body of the holy Prophet Moses ({{bibleverse|Jude|1:9}}). 

In later times, according to a story found in the Athonite Paterikon, and in the Life of St Neophytus of Docheiariou, Michael miraculously saved a young man cast into the sea by robbers with a stone about his neck on the shores of Mt Athos.

Perhaps his most famous miracle was saving the church at Colossae, which a number of pagans tried to destroy by diverting the flow of two rivers directly into its path. However, the Archangel appeared amongst the waters, and, carrying a cross, channeled the rivers underground so that the ground the church stood on would not be destroyed. The spring which came forth after this event is said to have special healing powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Cadwallader+Michael+Chonai&amp;btnG= Alan H. Cadwallader, Michael Trainor, ''Colossae in Space and Time'' (Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht 2011 ISBN 9783525533970), p. 323}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael also has been associated with healing in other cases, as well as his primary role as leader of the Church Militant. He has been said to appear to Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] (d. 337) at Constantinople, to have intervened in assorted battles, and appeared, sword in hand, over the mausoleum of Hadrian, in apparent answer to the prayers of Pope St. Gregory I the Great (590-604) that a plague in Rome should cease. 

Russians in particular have a special veneration to Michael, along with the [[Theotokos]]. According to [[OCA]], &quot;Intercession for Russian cities by the Most Holy Queen of Heaven always involved Her appearances with the Heavenly Hosts, under the leadership of the Archangel Michael. Grateful Rus acclaimed the Most Pure Mother of God and the Archangel Michael in church hymns. Many monasteries, cathedrals, court and merchant churches are dedicated to the Chief Commander Michael. In Rus there was not a city where there was not a church or chapel dedicated to the Archangel Michael.&quot;

=====Iconography=====
There are three icons of the Archangel Michael in whose composition he is said to have personally intervened: Archangel Michael of Mantamados in [[Mytilene]], Archangel Michael of [[Panormitis]] and Archangel Michael of [[Nenita]]. Each of these icons are different.

More typically, he is represented as the Chief Commander of the Heavenly hosts, holding a sword in one hand; in the other he often carries either a shield, a date-tree branch, a spear, or a white banner (possibly with a scarlet cross). Some icons show him holding an orb in one hand and a staff in the other. Inside the orb are often the superimposed Greek letters ΧΡ, the [[ChiRho]] symbol for Christ.

Michael is also represented in icons as standing on a horizontal body and with his left arm held high, holding a small image of a &quot;baby&quot;. The body represents a human being at the time of his death and the image of the &quot;baby&quot; represents the soul of the deceased. This icon came about since the belief that the Archangel Michael takes the souls of the dead to heaven. This is typical of the miraculous and wonder-working Archangel Michael of Panormitis, in Symi of Greece.

In Russian iconography he is most likely to be wearing red. In many instances, Michael tramples the devil under his feet, which may be depicted as a dragon. This comes from the tradition that Michael was the main opponent of Satan in the battle for Heaven. Satan, previously called Samael, was always looking to discredit Israel, while Michael was its main protector. In the end, Satan attempted to drag Michael down in his fall from the heights, but Michael was rescued by God.

=====Hymns=====
[[Troparion]] ([[Tone]] 4) [http://www.oca.org/FStropars.asp?SID=13&amp;ID=103244]
:Commanders of the heavenly hosts,
:we who are unworthy beseech you,
:by your prayers encompass us beneath the wings of your immaterial glory,
:and faithfully preserve us who fall down and cry to you:
:&quot;Deliver us from all harm, for you are the commanders of the powers on high!&quot;

[[Kontakion]] (Tone 2) [http://www.oca.org/FStropars.asp?SID=13&amp;ID=103244]
:Commanders of God's armies and ministers of the divine glory,
:princes of the bodiless angels and guides of mankind,
:ask for what is good for us, and for great mercy,
:supreme commanders of the Bodiless Hosts.

====Oriental Orthodoxy====

The place of Michael in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] is comparable to that of the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/cce/id/1331/rv/singleitem Coptic Encyclopedia, &quot;Michael the Archangel, Saint&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He is seen as the one who presents to God the prayers of the just, who accompanies the souls of the dead to heaven, who defeats the devil. He is celebrated liturgically on the 12th of each month. In Alexandria, a church was dedicated to him in the early fourth century on the 12th of the month of Ba'unah. On the 12th of the month of Hatur is the celebration of Michael's investiture in heaven as a replacement for Satan, whereupon Michael became the chief of the angels.

The Eastern Orthodox material you added is actually enough for a new article, not a section. So I think we can turn what you entered here into an article, add a few more refs and then have a section here that points to it via a Main.

As I was cleaning up refs etc. it turned out that it was verbatim from a website, so would have been copyvio. The iconography was similar.

:We can't always use &quot;not reliable sources&quot; as the convenient cop-out or alibi against putting material that you may not personally LIKE to come out.   (It becomes clear real soon that that's really what's going on here.)  Because I do become perceptive. Are you gonna say that Webster's Online Dictionary is so &quot;unreliable?  You're mentioning &quot;wordpress&quot; now though.   I mean, yes, it's true, not all &quot;sources&quot; are as solid or &quot;reliable&quot; as others.   But the problem with your position is that Spurgeon said these clear things IN HIS OWN BOOKS.  To say that Spurgeon only believed Michael was a &quot;higer angel of higher status&quot; is a JOKE of an edit, and completely inaccurate.  Of course many Baptists and Spurgeon supporters in supposedly &quot;reliable sources&quot; are gonna white-wash that.   Because they don't like the idea of Spurgeon believing Jesus was Michael, even in a Trinitarian sense.  But that's not what we're supposed to be doing, or catering to (unless you're personally in sympathy with covering up that fact).  Especially when those clear statements are in Spurgeon's own writings.

:Wikipedia is not supposed to be about hiding or suppressing points or facts, simply because some editors might find some of those (fairly clear and supported) facts a bit distasteful or surprising.

Stop trying to suppress clear facts that you don't like. (I would never put up with it.)  WordPress quotes Spurgeon's own books, as you know.  The point again (the over-riding point) is that Spurgeon unquestionably called Jesus &quot;Michael&quot; (in a Trinitarian sense though).  And there's enough sourcing to prove that.  It's not hard to get ISBN and page numbers, by the way.   So instead of removing, tag it maybe, or find the pages.  Thank you.

::::We will discuss other sources later. This thread is about Wordpress. I will say no more until other users comment on Wordpress. I claim that &quot;nothing&quot; from Wordpress should enter Wikipedia, in this or any other instance. Period. Now we await further comments. Thanks.

:::::Ok, I got rid of the WordPress.  Since it seems to be problematic.   I now put in VERY RELIABLE UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES.  The book pdfs themselves, of Spurgeon's sermons, that state the points and quotes.   There's no WP valid anything against refs like that.   They're [http://www.spurgeongems.org/vols34-36/chs2043.pdf here] and [http://www.spurgeongems.org/vols13-15/chs842.pdf here].   Ok, so there's no real excuse anymore.  The point again is that Spurgeon said (clearly) what he said.  He explicitly (not even something to inference, but unambiguously) said Jesus is Michael.   (In a Trinitarian sense though.) And that fact should not be down-played or watered down or suppressed.   But now better refs are there.   Regards. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 19:10, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

I never cared what Spurgeon said, but I was not going to accept wordpres. It is not WP:RS. Now:

:* Do not use wordpress again, anywhere on Wikipedia.  
:* You do not need to put messages on my talk page every few minutes.
:* Read the fine print at the bottom of the Webster site. It is adapted from sources such as Wikipedia by who knows... It is totally Non-WP:RS. Need to delete that until you find other sources for Matthew Henry and the other quotes.

So just use WP:RS sources. That is all. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 19:16, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::Ok, well I hope that's the case.   The reason, by the way, I put it on your Talk is because I wasn't sure if you were coming back to this specific thread just now.  But anyway, Wordpress seems to be an issue for various reasons, and the Webster thing you said got from this or that (but you can't really compare the Webster dictionary to Wordpress, I would think.)   

::The point though is that what you did was ''not'' find better sources to support what I had put in, but totally GOT RID of what I put in, and watered it down to something that wasn't even really accurate anymore.  Spurgeon did NOT just think Michael was a higher angel, case closed.  It went beyond that, as those PDF book sources prove unquestionably.   So put yourself in my shoes for a minute.  To see a total down-playing of the facts, just because the sources were a bit questionable?  My point (that you didn't address) is why didn't you maybe remove the sources, but leave the statement, and find BETTER sources, or at the very least tag the statements for better sources?  You can't escape ''that'' point...with the constant &quot;don't ever use wordpress&quot; again.  You could have found better refs yourself, to support those previous statements, like I just did.

:::[[WP:Burden]]. Everyone does their own homework. Else I will be cleaning up after people 72 hours a day. Now, do not use wordpress or that Webster site again. End of story. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 19:52, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::::No, that's a dodge, sir.  And dishonest.  Because you did &quot;homework&quot; that was INCORRECT.  You watered the statements down to garbage, basically, ''into things that were no longer accurate.''  You had time to do THAT kind of &quot;homework&quot;.  So spare me the cop-out excuses. (Yes, I'm annoyed with you now...for your evasions and dishonesties.)  You took plenty of time and effort to re-work it into something not true anymore, and did &quot;homework&quot; for finding watered-down but &quot;reliable&quot; sources.   When you could have easily found the PDFs that I found.  So don't hand me that nonsense now, sir.  

::::You disrespected and removed my edits, and put in dribbled down nonsense that was no longer accurate, put in refs to support the watered-down nonsense, instead of leaving the edits as they were (which were accurate), and instead of finding better sources to support THOSE previous statements.  (Or at the very least tagging it.) You didn't.  When you could have.  

::::And you're just dodging that point again, with again repeating &quot;don't use wordpress again&quot;.  If you took time and effort to butcher the accurate statements, to watered-down untrue versions, you could taken the time and effort to simply find those PDFs that I found. End of story. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 19:59, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::I will not respond to those statements for they achieve nothing. And again do not use wordpress or that webster site again. Now replace Websters or I ask if it is WP:RS. Simple. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 20:09, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::Of course you won't, because you have no valid answer for that.   Just being honest.  I mean, I do (and have expressed) my appreciation for your work and time to all these pages, but I don't agree with you on this matter, obviously.   Because you were trying to have it BOTH WAYS.  Saying rude stuff like &quot;I don't have 72 hours to clean up after people&quot; (disrespecting my hard work as something that needs to be &quot;cleaned up&quot;), when you had (lol) plenty of time ''to remove the statements, put in watered-down junk that was no longer accurate, and find lots of &quot;reliable sources&quot; to support the watered down (but untrue) versions.''  THAT you had time and energy for. That's all I'm saying.   

::::::Spurgeon in his own clear writings, called Jesus &quot;Michael&quot; (in a Trinitarian sense.)   If you took the time and energy to do what you did (&quot;72 hours&quot; huh?) then you could have theoretically found those PDF links that I found to support the previous statements.   That's my only point.   

::::::As far as &quot;Webster Dictionary&quot; there, by the way, can you tell me how exactly that is so &quot;unreliable&quot;?    I can remove that, no problem, as the statements are sourced now with the PDFs.  But still not totally sure what's wrong with the Webster source.   You mentioned something about &quot;quoting this or that&quot;.  But is that enough to dis-qualify it as a RS?? [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 20:19, 15 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::::Read [[WP:RS]]. It is a website compiled by some fellow... [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 20:35, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::::Well, ok, but you didn't really elaborate much.  You said &quot;a website compiled by some fellow...&quot; The problem though is aren't all websites basically &quot;compiled&quot; by some fellow or someone?    The question is is it reliable?  All websites and sources are obviously put together by &quot;fellows&quot; etc.  So I was hoping for a bit more detail on what makes you think that Webster Dictionary thing was so unreliable or questionable.

::::::::The &quot;fellow&quot; that you mention is this guy:

::::::::--------Philip M. Parker is the instigator behind Webster's Online Dictionary: The Rosetta Edition (www.websters-online-dictionary.org). Phil is an avid collector of dictionaries and encyclopedias with a special interest in those published during the French Enlightenment. In addition to being a bibliophile, he is the author of the Cross Cultural Statistical Encyclopedia (which includes Linguistic Cultures of the World: A Statistical Reference, Greenwood Press), and Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth  (MIT Press). He is currently the Eli Lilly Chair Professor of Innovation, Business and Society at INSEAD (Fontainebleau, France &amp; Singapore). He has taught courses and been a visiting scholar at Stanford University, MIT, Harvard University, UCLA, UCSD and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He received his Ph.D. from the Wharton School of Business and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania.--------

::::::::Now, I'll ask, in all sincerity, what the hell makes that &quot;fellow&quot; so &quot;unreliable&quot; in your mind??     He has enough credentials it seems.  Again, the argument seems a bit weak that because the site is &quot;compiled by some fellow&quot; that that disqualifies the site.  All sites are compiled by someone.   So what?    I'm not totally convinced that that Webster Dictionary page warranted removal.  There is such a thing as being uptight and over-scrupulous much on Wikipedia.  Telling me to to &quot;Read [[WP:RS]]&quot; is just a rude arrogant evasion, questioning my knowledge as if I never read WP:RS before in my life (which I have plenty of times), and is not addressing SPECIFICALLY what's so wrong or unreliable about that website.  

::::::::I mean, this is a DICTIONARY...for goodness' sake.  NOT some blog or something.

::::::::If you fail to give me convincing evidence or facts, I might just put the ref back.   Otherwise I'll wait for consensus.  Simply because &quot;you don't like it&quot; is not enough of a reason.  You can't say in circular reasoning &quot;it's not reliable because I say it's not reliable, because it was compiled by 'some fellow'&quot;.   There has to be deeper grounds than that.  Regards.

websters-online-dictionary.org appears to use Wikipedia as a source. It seems not to be a good source for us to use. [[User:Tom harrison|Tom Harrison]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tom harrison|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:02, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:You said &quot;appears to use Wikipedia as a source&quot;.  That sounds ambiguous or unsure.   My point, again, is that that site is a DICTIONARY, for God's sake.  NOT a blog or something.  This is Webster's Dictionary Online.  Also, the statements in question, from that website, were definitely NOT gotten from Wikipedia.

::I was being polite. It's not a dictionary; it's a website. It uses Wikipedia as a source, and it's utterly unsuitable. Please don't try to cite anything to it. [[User:Tom harrison|Tom Harrison]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tom harrison|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:10, 15 April 2012 (UTC)


:::Polite?  That's why you reverted without settling it totally first in talk? And &quot;not a dictionary&quot;?  That's why it's called Webster's Online Dictionary???    It's an ONLINE dictionary.  All sites are put together by someone. So what?    All sites ''that are'' considered &quot;reliable sources&quot; on Wikipedia are &quot;websites&quot;.   And compiled by &quot;someone&quot;.    My question is you said &quot;appears to use Wikipedia as a source&quot;.  Where do you see that exactly?    And if it does, the policy is that that totally negates the source or site overall? Even if other parts are ''not'' quoting &quot;Wikipedia&quot;? [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 21:14, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::::I agree with Tom Harrison. That website says it uses Wikipedia, which opens the door to circular references. Per [[WP:RS]], end of story. And please do not cross [[WP:3RR]] Hashem. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 21:18, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::If it does, then ok, but the point is that that specific statement was NOT quoting from Wikipedia.  But are you saying that ''if'' a site quotes or uses even a little bit of WP that that negates the whole site.  My point is why is it an online &quot;dictionary&quot; then, with the word &quot;Webster's&quot;?   Hence the confusion. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 21:16, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::I know the rules. It is miles from WP:RS. He could call it Act of Congress if he wanted. Enough of this. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 21:20, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::::I know you know the rules.  I never questioned that.  I even said above that I appreciate all the stuff you've done over the months.  And we got along fine for months, if you remember.   I was thinking that maybe there was an over-application of it in some cases.  (That does happen.)   

:::::::And I said I was not really against removing the ref if it could be talked out a bit in Discussion first.   Because I was making the point that that guy seemed to be credentialed, and that it was called &quot;Webster's Dictionary&quot;.   It wasn't called &quot;Philip M. Parker's blog&quot; or something.  Or &quot;Parker's discussion forum&quot; or talk board.   That was why I was a bit confused.   

:::::::Not sure why an online dictionary would quote Wikipedia.  I guess Wikipedia is being considered a solid source by many lately.  But if WP policy is against using that kind of thing, etc, then I understand. Regards. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 21:25, 15 April 2012 (UTC)
