There was a Yiddish song about a Shabbos goy. Any links to the lyrics?:)

== Elvis Presley : Shabbos Goy ==

There are many references to a teenaged Elvis Presley performing Shabbos tasks for his upstairs neighbors.  However he might not have been a Shabbos '''Goy''' because there is evidence that he would be considered Jewish under Jewish law through is maternal lineage.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jny|Jny]] ([[User talk:Jny|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jny|contribs]]) 02:24, 30 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Ancestry is irrelevant. You belong to a religion if you believe in its creeds, follow its rituals, and regard yourself as belonging to it. Elvis had a wild mix of beliefs, but was mainly a Pentecostal Christian[http://www.adherents.com/people/pp/Elvis_Presley.html]. -- [[User:Stormwatch|Stormwatch]] ([[User talk:Stormwatch|talk]]) 11:07, 3 November 2009 (UTC)

:Ancestry is relevant. If according to Jewish law Elvis was Jewish, a religiously observant Jew would not be allowed to use his services, and would never do so as it would defeat the whole purpose. But of course, if the neighbours were unaware of his having Jewish ancestry,they might have asked him to give a hand as Shabbos Goy.

::I agree it is relavant, Elvis was hallakhally Jewish in every way according to every branch/movement of Judaism. --[[User:Teacherbrock|Teacherbrock]] ([[User talk:Teacherbrock|talk]]) 14:41, 9 March 2011 (UTC)

== Article presents no inline citation ==
Many of the statements in the article are subject to interpretation.

For example....It is absolutely forbidden to ask explicitly for a non-Jew to do any Melacha.  If however a person is sick to the extent that he cannot move out of his bed, then certain Rabbinic restrictions fall away - such as taking medication.

If however, the situation is potentially life threatening or life threatening, the Torah-prohibitions are subject to leniency, depending.  For example, it is better to hire a non-Jewish taxi driver to take a woman in labor to the hospital.

In general therefore, we see that Generally you cannot explicitly ask a non-Jew to do any Melacha.  Only in exceptional circunmstances.  Hinting, itself is a problem, and only may be performed on certain Melachos....for example, you cannot hint to a non-Jew to turn on a light, if he doesn't benefit from it, however, only in specific circumstances.

In short, the article needs to have proper citations.

:I agree, but it is not that easy to find good citations in English, and I would appreciate any help. Also, I wouldn't like to get into &quot;hidden corners&quot;. There are a lot of rules and rabbinical instructions about how to keep the Sabbath, but we are talking here about a specific issue of hiring a &quot;goy&quot; to provide services to Jews on the Sabbath.

== &quot;Shabbos goy&quot; as an anti-semitic epithet. ==

Hasn't the term been used quite frequently as an anti-semitic epithet directed at non-Jewish people thought to be &quot;too nice&quot; to Jews? If this is so, it should be mentioned here. -- [[Special:Contributions/77.7.162.131|77.7.162.131]] ([[User talk:77.7.162.131|talk]]) 00:22, 23 February 2011 (UTC)

:Do you have a [[wp:rs|source]]? [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] ([[User talk:Bus stop|talk]]) 00:27, 23 February 2011 (UTC)

If Wikipedia administrators consider the Anti-Defamation League a &quot;reliable source&quot;, there's a recent article they did on [[Gilad Atzmon]] [http://www.adl.org/main_Anti_Semitism_International/gilad-atzmon-anti-semite.htm posted on January 30th, 2012] where he uses the term as an anti-semitic epithet of which I quote the relevant text:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Gilad Atzmon has directly accused Jews of excessive control regarding various arenas of public life and responsibility for a range of incidents.


In an opinion piece shortly after the Norway massacre in July 2011 he alleged it was possible that the terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had been sent by the Israeli Mossad.  '''''Atzmon claimed it was plausible that Breivik is a &quot;Shabbos goy,&quot; commissioned by Israel because many children in the camp had anti-Zionist leanings.'''''

Seems pretty clear it's used by anti-semites as a derogatory term for people who are perceived to be &quot;suck-ups&quot; to Jews for &quot;brownie points&quot; (whatever the hell that's suppose to mean).
