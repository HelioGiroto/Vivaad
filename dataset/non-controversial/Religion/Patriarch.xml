Originally, a '''patriarch''' was a man who exercised [[Autocracy|autocratic]] authority as a [[pater familias]] over an [[extended family]]. The system of such rule of families by senior males is termed '''[[patriarchy]]'''. This is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word, a compound of πατριά (''patria''), &quot;lineage, progeny&quot;, esp. by the father's side&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2F πατριά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (which derives from the word {{lang|grc|πατήρ}} – ''patēr'' meaning &quot;father&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpath%2Fr πατήρ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) and {{lang|grc|ἄρχων}} (''[[archon]]'') meaning &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxwn ἄρχων], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2Frxhs πατριάρχης], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0610420#DWS-M_EN_GB-047375 patriarch], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] are referred to as the three [[patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] of the [[Israelite|people of Israel]], and the period during which they lived is termed the [[Patriarchal Age]]. It originally acquired its religious meaning in the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Patriarch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has acquired specific ecclesiastical meanings.  In particular, the highest-ranking [[bishop]]s in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (above [[Major Archbishop]] and [[Primate (religion)|Primate]]), and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] are termed ''Patriarchs'' (and in certain cases also ''[[Pope (word)|popes]]'').  The office and ecclesiastical circumscription (comprising one or more provinces, though outside his own (arch)diocese he is often without enforceable jurisdiction) of such a Patriarch is termed a ''[[Patriarchate]]''. Historically, a Patriarch may often be the logical choice to act as [[Ethnarch]], representing the community that is identified with his religious confession within a state or empire of a different creed (as Christians within the [[Ottoman Empire]]).

===Patriarchate of the West (not extant)===
[[File:1800 Wilkinson Map of the 4 Eastern Churches rectified.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Map of Justinian's Pentarchy, with almost all of modern Greece under Rome.]]
In the [[Pentarchy]] formulated by [[Justinian I]] (527–565), the emperor assigned as a patriarchate to the Bishop of Rome the whole of Christianized Europe (including almost all of modern [[Greece]]), except for a small area near Constantinople and along the coast of the Black Sea. He included in this patriarchate also the western part of North Africa. Justinian's system was given formal ecclesiastical recognition by the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692, which the [[Holy See|see of Rome]] has, however, not recognized.

Popes have in the past occasionally used the title ''Patriarch of the West'', without defining it. Beginning 1863, this title appeared in the annual reference publication, ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', which during 1885 became a semi-official publication of the Holy See. This publication suppressed the title in its 2006 edition. The [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] explained the decision in a press release issued later that year. It stated that the title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; had become &quot;obsolete and practically unusable&quot; and that it was &quot;pointless to insist on maintaining it&quot;. Since the [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[Latin Church]], with which the title could be consider associated, is now organized as a number of [[episcopal conference]]s and their international groupings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lumenchristischool.org/files/TitlePatriarchWestDropped.pdf Communiqué on the suppression of the title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other historical Latin Rite patriarchates===
*The [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch]] – title abolished during 1964.
*The [[Latin Patriarch of Alexandria]] – title abolished during 1964.
*The [[List of Bishops and Patriarchs of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquileia]] – dissolved during 1752.
*The [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]] - title abolished during 1964.
*The [[Patriarch of Grado]] – During 1451 merged with the Bishopric of Castello and Venice to form the Archdiocese of Venice.
*The [[Patriarch of the West Indies]] a titular patriarchal see, vacant since 1963.

===Extant Latin Rite patriarchates===
*The [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]]
*The [[Patriarch of the East Indies]] a titular patriarchal see, united to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman|Goa and Daman]].
*The [[Patriarch of Lisbon]].
*The [[Patriarch of Venice]].

===Eastern Catholic patriarchates===
Six of the particular [[Eastern Catholic Church]]es are headed by a [[Patriarchs of the East|patriarch]] with a claim to one (or more) of the ancient patriarchal sees:
*The [[List of Coptic Catholic Patriarchs of Alexandria|Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria]] and head of the [[Coptic Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and all the East, of Alexandria, and of Jerusalem]] and the head of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Syrian Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Syrian Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and all the East]] and head of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Maronite Catholic Patriarchs|Maronite Catholic Patriarch of Antioch and all the East]], head of the [[Maronite Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Chaldean Catholic Patriarch of Babylon]] and head of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Armenian Catholic Patriarchs of Cilicia|Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]] and head of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]

====Major archbishoprics====
Four more of the [[Eastern Catholic Church]]es are headed by a prelate known as a &quot;[[Major Archbishop]],&quot; a title created during 1963 and essentially equivalent to that of Patriarch:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P48.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[List of Major Archbishops of Kiev-Galicia|Major Archbishop of Kiev-Halych]] and head of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Major Archbishops of Ernakulam-Angamaly|Major Archbishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly]] and head of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Major Archbishops of Trivandrum|Major Archbishop of Trivandrum]] and head of the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]
*The [[List of Major Archbishops of Făgăraş and Alba Iulia|Major Archbishop of Făgăraş and Alba Iulia]] and head of the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic]]

==Independent Patriarchs==
These Patriarchs are not part of traditional ecclesiastical communions of either the Eastern or the Catholic variety. Their sects were generally initiated since about 1900 and reject many of the teachings of traditional apostolic Christian faith, for example [[Ordination of women#Christianity in general|by allowing women to attempt ordination]] or [[Clerical celibacy|by allowing priests to marry ''after'' ordination]].

*The Patriarch of the [[Catholic Apostolic National Church of Brazil]].
*The Patriarch of the International Communion of the [[Charismatic Episcopal Church]].
*The Patriarch of the [[Apostolic Catholic Church]].
*The Patriarch of the [[Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;When a woman was elected head of this Church, she was styled [[Matriarch]]. [http://www.churchofantioch.org/coa/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=45]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Patriarch of the [[American Orthodox Catholic Church]].
*The Patriarch of the [[Assembly of Jerusalem]].

==Mormonism==
{{Main|Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)}}
According to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], a [[Patriarch (Mormonism)|patriarch]] is one who has been ordained to the office of Patriarch in the [[Melchizedek Priesthood]]. The term is considered synonymous with the term [[Evangelist (Latter Day Saints)|evangelist]]. One of the patriarch's primary responsibilities is to give [[patriarchal blessing]]s, as Jacob did to his twelve sons according to the Old Testament. Patriarchs are typically assigned in each [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]] (district; the name derives from Isaiah 54:2 &quot;[e]nlarge the place of thy tent, ... and strengthen thy stakes&quot;) and possess the title for life.
