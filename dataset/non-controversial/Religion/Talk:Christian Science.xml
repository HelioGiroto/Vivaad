== Very large over-reliance on primary sources ==

There is a spectacularly large over-reliance on primary sources in this article including over 40 citations to &quot;science and health&quot; alone, and there are other books etc which are primary. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 15:07, 14 September 2012 (UTC)

Depends on what you mean by primary sources. There are about 25 independent sources cited in the article, depending on how you define them. Since &quot;Science and Health&quot; is the CS textbook, it seems reasonable for citations to appear from it. (NB I had a look at the entry on &quot;Darwin&quot;, and there are more than 40 references to writings by Darwin, from a quick count of the footnotes.)[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 19:11, 14 September 2012 (UTC)

Christian Science has a complex theology and to give a fair outline of what Christian Scientists believe, quite a lot of their primary sources need to be cited. However, plenty of dissenting literature is cited as well. I don't know what IRWolfie means by 'spectacularly large'. If (s)he bases his/her opinion on numbers of citations, that falls to be rejected on the grounds that numbers of citations are a very poor measure of the article's 'reliance on primary literature'. To test this properly, we need to ask what the article aims to do. To me few recent editors have tried to do anything else but present an unbiased picture of what Christian Science is and what its adherents believe. The article does that, and does not rely on primary sources to do that; especially on the well-covered dissenting side. [[User:Michael J. Mullany|Michael J. Mullany]] ([[User talk:Michael J. Mullany|talk]]) 21:50, 14 September 2012 (UTC)
::Here is a counter-proposal to demonstrate the reliance on primary sources. If I was to remove all primary sourced content we would be missing a chunk out of the article; do you agree or disagree? [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 21:29, 15 September 2012 (UTC)

Also, it's an unfortunate fact that many &quot;secondary,&quot; &quot;objective,&quot; &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;critical&quot; sources actually distort the theology of Christian Science. One example is the &quot;politically correct&quot; habit of substituting &quot;human&quot; (or &quot;human being&quot;) for &quot;man&quot; as used by Mary Baker Eddy (in the normal 19th century usage to denote members of both sexes). As &quot;human&quot; means something quite different from &quot;man&quot; for MBE, this distorts the meaning of the original. Is an inaccurate secondary source preferable to an accurate primary source? I don't think so.[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 22:35, 14 September 2012 (UTC)

See the following:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources
Under the definition of &quot;Secondary Sources&quot; it's by no means clear that Science and Health is in fact a primary source. According to this defiinition, it may in fact be a mixture of primary and secondary sources (eg when MBE writes about her own experiences it may be a primary source, when she writes about some other matters it may be a secondary source). Furthermore, it is accepted in these guidelines that primary sources may be used, and there is no specified limit as to their use.[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 19:40, 15 September 2012 (UTC)

::Sorry but no, it is completely a primary source; you can confirm this at [[WP:RSN]]. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 21:29, 15 September 2012 (UTC)

There is a lot of material in the link you give, IRWolfie. I'm not sure what you're referring to in particular. Is a Bible commentary, or a Bible dictionary, a primary source? If not, the point can be made that considerable parts of Science and Health are in fact a kind of Bible commentary (eg the Chapters on Genesis and The Apocalypse, also the Glossary) and consequently a secondary source, at least insofar as the Bible is concerned. The point could therefore be made (admittedly from a CS perspective) that the Bible is the primary source and the CS textbook is a secondary source. Anyway, leaving that aside, the central point remains that there is no limit set by Wikipedia on the use of primary sources, apart from the point that an article should not consist purely of primary sources, which this one does not. Your point about an over-reliance on primary sources is consequently a purely subjective one.[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 22:12, 15 September 2012 (UTC)
::My link is a noticeboard. It is where you can confirm that it's a primary source. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 22:58, 15 September 2012 (UTC)

Do you mean that one should post something there and wait for reactions? There are complicated and often inconclusive discussions on that board. And the possibility of coming across many people familiar with S&amp;H seems somewhat remote. BTW, even in academia there is no conclusive definition of &quot;primary source&quot; since this differs from discipline to discipline. In philosophy, Kant's Critique of Judgement would be regarded as a primary source. In history, it could be a personal letter, an interview, or a newspaper report contemporary to the event. (E.g. Marx's &quot;18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&quot; might be regarded both as a primary and a secondary source, since it deals with both philosophy and history.) The issue is by no means as clear as you seem to believe. And to get back to the matter at hand, in this particular case (the entry on &quot;Christian Science&quot;) replacing much of the primary material with secondary or tertiary material would arguably be a distinct disimprovement, since much of the secondary material is tendentious (on both sides) and often substantially inaccurate (particularly  that in the &quot;neutral&quot; category).[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 08:42, 16 September 2012 (UTC)

I just had a look at a couple of comparable articles, on &quot;Lutheranism&quot; and &quot;Islam&quot;. There are numerous citations from Luther in the former, and from the Quran in the latter (both, presumably, primary sources). So there appears to be no recognized quota of desirable primary sources on Wikipedia, either in theory or practice. [[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 14:47, 16 September 2012 (UTC)
:It's easy to identify a primary source, and this is one by the founder of the religion; [[WP:RSN]] is very capable, I'll post myself later. I doubt the Islam article is based primarly on the Quran; the primary sources are only meant to support the secondary. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 09:42, 17 September 2012 (UTC)

OK, here are my main points again: (a) there is already a substantial body of secondary material referenced in the article; (b) there is no specified limit by Wikipedia to the number of primary sources that may be used in an article, or specific guidelines re the relative balance of primary/secondary sources; (c) even if it is desirable that the use of secondary sources be maximised vis a vis primary sources, the inaccurate nature of many of the secondary sources available in this area means that they are difficult to rely on, and must be constantly corrected with reference to the primary sources. However, there can (of course) be no objection to contributors entering material based on secondary/tertiary sources, and if anyone feels there should be more of them, they are free to enter them.[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 07:45, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
::It's not the number of sources that is the issue, it specifically is the over-reliance on the primary source, and that is a problem with [[WP:DUE]] weight and [[WP:FRINGE]]. Ideally, primary sources only ever augment the secondary sources, they do not form the basis of the text. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 12:33, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

I think your statement that &quot;Ideally, primary sources only ever augment the secondary sources, they do not form the basis of the text&quot; is dead on, but maybe not the way you think it is.  Both Islam and Lutheranism, the examples that have been brought up, are far older religions than Christian Science and thus have a larger number of secondary analytic sources.   Christian Science is relatively new and secondary sources tend to be advocative (on one side or the another) and not analytic which makes NPOV a bit of a problem.  The effort has been -- for better or for worse -- to explicate Christian Science by going to the primary sources in lieu of sources which might advocate.  

Too, your statement of &quot;too much reliance&quot; really is subjective.   I don't think there is any metric of reliance that would apply to every article on Wikipedia.  You have to evaluate each article on its own and not make unilateral decisions based on your subjective impression.  By your own admission you're not an expert here.

That being said this article can certainly use help.  There is way to much &quot;Christian Scientese&quot; here (which you have noted without realizing it) for it to be accessible to someone coming to the page for information.  I would hope we could clear that up in a cooperative rather than contentious manner. [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 18:45, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

::I disagree with ignoring the secondary sources, and relying on the primary sources; as that leads to original research. Not sure why expertise is relevant, I can identify reliable sources and work from them and so should everyone else. If the reliable secondary sources don't exist on some aspect, don't write about it, specifically see [[WP:PRIMARY]] and [[WP:FRINGE]]: &quot;The no original research policy strongly encourages the collection and organization of information from existing secondary sources&quot;. 100 years is plenty of time for sources to exist; and I've already seen many. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 18:51, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

Expertise is relevant because it allows you to place a secondary source with respect to both the history and ideology of the subject matter.  For Christian Science, as for almost any subject matter, there are many secondary sources which are advocacy sources parading under the banner of neutrality.  It takes some experience and expertise to discern that.  We can certainly see that issue with respect to Islam today.  Again, your statement of &quot;enough time&quot; is a subjective evaluation of your own and not based on any metric. On what do you base it other than that you think 100 years is a long time (but not as long as 500 or 1300 years?)  That's pretty arbitrary. Too, I suspect all the rule-play here has nothing to do with actually producing an informative article which ought to be our objective.  [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 19:07, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
::No, it doesn't take expertise to place sources; it sounds like you wish to engage in OR by selecting your sources according to preconceived ideas, that is not how wikipedia operates, we find the points most prevalent amongst the ''reliable'' secondary sources, giving particular weight to the most reliable sources such as secondary literature in scientific publications. In essence, wikipedia represents mainstream thought, see [[WP:FRINGE]], as summarized in the nutshell: &quot;the proper contextual relationship between minority and majority viewpoints must be clear&quot;. Here is a suitable quote from your userpage to mull over: &quot;I try to stay away from contributing to articles about which I know nothing or, worse, know enough to have a specific point of view. It's important here to be aware of your own blind spots.&quot; [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 19:16, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
I'll stand by the statement on the user page.  I think you ought to as well given that you've decided Christian Science is a fringe science.  How do you decide what is a &quot;reliable&quot; secondary source.  That takes expertise which you (and possibly I) don't have.  What is mainstream thought?  Who decides that?  These are all very subjective interpretations which are certainly only tenuously applied to religion.  What is mainstream thought about Islam?  What is mainstream thought about Lutheranism?  These are not useful metrics for writing articles. [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 19:30, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

::To add to what Dominus has stated, Don't speculate on what my opinions are as I have disclosed none. I didn't think or know much of anything about Christian Science before I saw this article. Also, Are you kidding? Deciding on reliability is precisely what we can do on wikipedia. Go tell the people at [[WP:RSN]] they can't judge what's reliable. It doesn't take an expert to realise that secondary sources in [[Nature (Journal)]] are reliable for science, or that secondary sources in the [[Lancet]] are reliable for medicine. And you certainly don't need a degree in Physics to spot the most reliable sources for physics; relevant well respected journals and academic publishers. What is mainstream or not is very easily decided; what viewpoint is most prevalent in reliable sources. I suggest reading [[WP:RS]] thoroughly, and particularly [[WP:IRS]]. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 19:39, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

All of your examples -- which are good by the way -- apply to areas of hard science.  It's a little more difficult when you get to the soft sciences (psychology, sociology, economics, political science) and the like to discern reliability.  In the case of religion (and do we agree that despite the use of Science in the name that Christian Science, like Religious Science, is a religion) I suspect it's almost impossible.  We're not dealing with fact here, but entirely interpretation.  Trust me, I have read the relevent sections of WP and while they are good guidelines they aren't written in stone. [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 19:59, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

:No sorry, there is always methods of finding reliable secondary sources on a topic; it's a requirement of notability. Articles without reliable secondary sources with significant coverage get deleted per [[WP:GNG]]; they do exist. Read the guidelines, ask at [[WP:RSN]] if you aren't convinced. Also a religion can be pseudoscientific, there is nothing that precludes that. Astrology is a pseudoscience though some practitioners say it is a religion. Something which makes falsifiable claims but does not use the scientific method can be pseudoscientific. Much of this article only needs [[WP:MEDRS]] sources, and scientific sources. There is only some parts, such as the theology section which require suitable sources which are most likely neither of these. There are [[religious studies]] texts which are reliable etc etc. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 20:07, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

This is an interesting discussion :-) I think part of the problem is the term &quot;Christian Science&quot; itself, which I've never been comfortable with btw and which leaves it open to misunderstanding and to attacks from skeptical sources. (See the discussion above in this section.) Anyway, that's the name and we are stuck with it. It should be noted that Mary Baker Eddy called it &quot;Christian Science&quot; at a time long before modern discussions in the philosophy of science (Popper, Kuhn, Feyerabend etc.) and it clearly does not conform to the criteria of modern science in terms of falsifiability, testing, prediction etc (though there is a question as to whether other thought-systems that claim scientificity always do so either). It seems to be the name &quot;Christian Science&quot; that raises skeptical hackles more than anything else, and one can understand that. However, one should historically contextualize the title of a movement or institution before arguing that it makes inappropriate claims. I'm trying to think of an example to illustrate my point, but let's think for a moment of one of the illustrious colleges in Cambridge, England: Jesus College. It presumably acquired its name at a time when Christian teachings were mainstream in the academic community (indeed enforced in many cases with fire and sword). But I don't suppose there is much agitation out there by Christians that Jesus College is making inappropriate claims to Christianity, even if some--or perhaps even all--of the faculty/students there may not be Christians. Similarly, it is incorrect to charge Christian Science (or Christian Scientists) as not being in accordance with modern definitions of &quot;science&quot; simply because of the name, which was given by Mary Baker Eddy at a time when the term &quot;science&quot; had quite a different meaning from what it has today. Nobody, whether a Christian Scientist or not, believes that Christian Science healing can be subjected to the same kind of rigor that the physical sciences aspire to (though it is indeed common to come across the observation that medicine is more of an art than a science). Christian Science is more accurately described as a metaphysical system with (arguably) practical implications than as a &quot;science&quot; in any contemporary sense of the word. (As an afterthought, Feyerabend notoriously argued that there was no philosophically defensible way to distinguish astrology from mainstream science, but that's a whole other discussion!) BTW, could I suggest that anyone who wants to edit the article on Christian Science should at least read the CS textbook--for example if someone were going to edit the article on Islam, I imagine they would first familiarize themselves with the Quran![[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 23:01, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

::No sorry, but that is utterly wrong; editors of [[Islam]] probably don't read the quran, and it's stupid to require or expect it as it has little to do with editing the article.

89.100.155.6: Do not feed the trolls.  There is little dialog going on here.  I had hoped there would be, but mostly what I see is rulemongering and proof through vigorous handwaving.

::OK, let's take another angle on all of this. Sometimes there are only 'primary sources' for certain pieces of information. I imagine, IRWolfie, that as a physics Ph. D. student, you are familiar with the contributions of Marie Curie, the discoverer or co-discoverer of polonium and radium. Of course, all her scientific work, as well as that of her husband Pierre, is well covered in credible scientific literature and has been for the best part of a century. However, what is not so widely known, are details of her life: her childhood, her up-bringing, her family, early adult-hood and a description of her as a wife and mother. In fact, we have little more than one primary source for such deep family detail, and that is the account given by her daughter Eve in her classic novel, ‘Marie Curie’. Would you therefore consider it proper for the Wiki article on Marie Curie to omit all such detail because it comes mainly from a primary source for the Curie and Sklodowska families? I think not. So long as the article clearly specifies that the information comes from a primary source because we have few other, that would be fine.

{{od}} I'm not sure what you mean. On the subject of Myths and legends, they are also covered in secondary sources. We don't need to source to the [[Táin Bó Cúailnge]] to describe the cattle raid of Cooley, we have plenty of secondary sources.

:True, but there are many instances where they are not documented by secondary sources, but are of high significance. For example, the Zulu belief in witchcraft was successfully employed as an extenuating circumstance for murder and other crimes by courts long before such beliefs were anything more than verbal evidence. However, let's not get side-tracked in that direction. As I said, I was not the originator of the Christian Science article, but have merely sporadically edited it along with you and many others. I actually have looked for secondary sources that are credible, with little success. One example of a source I don't find credible, is the essay by Zindler entitled, “Mary &quot;Faker&quot; Eddy and the Cult of Christian Science”. The link to this article is: [[http://atheists.org/content/mary-faker-eddy-christian-science]]. It seems to me that this is typical of non-Christian Science literature on Christian Science.  As a fellow academic, I think you would agree that the writing is far too emotive to be credible from a scholarly point of view. However, this link has been kept in the article by all the editors; or at least ever since I took an interest several months ago now. This would hardly be the case if all of them prior to you, were Christian Scientists, or somehow pro Christian Science. They certainly are not.

The source is wrong, as anyone familiar with the Christian Science textbook will confirm. It's not my own personal interpretation. A secondary source should be assessed with reference to a primary source, not the other way around. That's one of the problems with secondary sources. If a secondary source said that Darwin believed in angels, and Darwin specifically denied that he believed in angels (eg in The Origin of Species, a primary source) then the secondary source is wrong, not Darwin[[Special:Contributions/193.1.217.20|193.1.217.20]] ([[User talk:193.1.217.20|talk]]) 14:40, 21 September 2012 (UTC)

::Nope, we defer to secondary sources. Also, &quot;The highest attenuation  of homoeopathy and the most potent rises above matter into mind. This discovery leads to more light.

It's your opinion that it constitutes OR. In fact, the quote you give from S&amp;H is a clear refutation of the secondary source. Although MBE is using the &quot;dematerialisation&quot; process within homeopathy to support the argument that drugs have no efficacy (apart from human belief), the concept of a divine Mind has nothing to do with homeopathy afaik. (Admittedly, it may may be difficult to grasp the subtleties involved if you haven't read the CS textbook)[[Special:Contributions/193.1.217.20|193.1.217.20]] ([[User talk:193.1.217.20|talk]]) 15:27, 21 September 2012 (UTC)

This becomes more and more twisted:  You are saying, for the record, that when any secondary source contradicts a primary source that the secondary source is to be preferred even if the primary is clear and unequivocal?   As far as OR is concerned, the difference between Original Research and Undocumented Assertion is a fine line, one which I don't believe has been crossed yet.  It's easy enough to use either of these as a cudgel to hammer things you don't like.  My Original Research may be your assertion of well-known fact.  Ultimately, we get into the discussion of what is the word &quot;is&quot; without documentation.

My understanding of the various WP:* is that they are guidelines rather than a rulebook.  We drag them out when there is a dispute in an effort to help resolve that dispute, not use them to bully a contributor into doing things the way we want.  I may be wrong about this.

== Odd Sourcing ==

The paragraph:

&quot;In &quot;Mind Underlies Spacetime: An Idealistic Model of Reality,&quot; Daniel A. Cowan offers a philosophical explication of some Christian Science teachings.[7]&quot;

...is completely without context.  Who is this Daniel Cowan fellow and why does someone looking for information about Christian Science care that he wrote a book?  How is this person or his book notable?  Is he a critic?  Is he a member of the religion?  What does the book say about the religion?  What are some of the 'philosophical explications' it offers...?

== Article POV ==

Truly bizarre.  This whole article is muddled and disorganized.  Half of the short &quot;Theology&quot; section is about criticism of CS rather than beliefs, which makes it hard to follow.

Yes, reliable from your POV. The article is mostly POV. It needs a complete re-editing, and a lot more neutrality. I did read it btw, and its not very informative about Christian Science. Its informative about what some people, who are not Christian Scientists, think that Christian Science is. But a lot of the time such people get it wrong.

I also very much agree with [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie]] that the article should not simply be about Christian Science by Christian Scientists.  Surely there is a way that we can find of improving the neutrality of POV and making the article more informative in a factual way about Christian Science without violating Wikipedia's primary source guidelines.

::::::Primary sources can only be used to support and illustrate what reliable independent sources say. we can't use them to &quot;balance&quot; the article.
::::::We bump into two problems with primary sources, not only with Christian Science, but with any religion. The first is that they are often in-universe, that is, they are not considered authoratative, significant or reliable outside of the movement. The second is apologetics. Sources like these are not useful for creation an encyclopedia where original research is not allowed. Material in primary sources has to be evaluated and interpreted by independent scholars. We rely on them to separate the wheat from the chaff. We can't do that ourselves.
::::::An independent source could be written by someone who is a member of the movement, and would be reliable if it has passed real-world academic review. The constraits of academic review ensure that the writer is acting as a scholar, and not as a advocate of the religion. All the more so if the material mentioned in the source has been cited by other independent scholars in reliable sources.
::::::As far as material pertaining to history, science and medicine, the sourcing should be of the highest quality possible. An exception of sorts for fringe and pseudoscience material is [[WP:PARITY]], which allows us to present the material in the context of mainstream scholarship when high quality sources don't exist for this purpose.
::::::So, in order for a primary source ro be used, we have to determine whether indepedent scholars evaluated the source in the past and have used it in their own discussion of the material in question. We must rely on their judgement and interpretation of the material. The problem with the article until recently is that it was essentially original research based on primary sources, the reliability of which we could not determine.

They may have merit in themselves (as an ideal to aim for) but there is no justification for imposing them as absolute rules, either here or anywhere else. They are your own interpretations of the Wikipedia rules. They are not the rules themselves (as far as I can make out). In othere words, they are original research on your part. One example is, that you are setting more stringent rules for religion than for most other areas, since Wikipedia articles on other areas frequently have primary sources, of one kind or another. So you start off from the basis that the religious perspective must be, by definition, more questionable that others. That may well be true, but it's simply your opinion. The main point I want to make here is: if original research should not be in the article, it should also not be applied to interpreting the Wikipedia rules by editors. BTW, there are about dozen sources remaining in the article, that are not peer reviewed in the conventional sense, or probably not anyway. Should these be removed as well? In any case the definition of peer review is by no means clear-cut. Peer review may be double-blind by referee. It may be by an editorial panel. It may be by an editor who is expert on the subject, and also there are new forms of &quot;public&quot; peer review appearing. Indeed, peer review itself is not always agreed by the academic community to be useful, either in keeping garbage out or letting good stuff in. Sometimes, one has to actually cut out good stuff, and put in useless and irrelevant material, to get an article through the double-blind peer review process, simply because some anonymous reviewer has a bee in his or her bonnet about something or other.

I did not say that &quot;only Christian Scientists and ex-members can edit.&quot; What I said was, that what is needed is &quot;a basic knowledge of the Christian Science theology/philosophy at first hand.&quot; One can obtain that, admittedly, by being a Christian Scientist (or an ex-Christian Scientist). But one can also obtain it simply by reading the Christian Science textbook and the rest of the Christian Science literature, whether one ends up agreeing with it or not. Whether one is (or was) a Christian Scientist is not the point. One can read the CS textbook without agreeing with it, and without even thinking about joining an organization. Let me give an analogy to substantiate the argument, that people should first become familiar with Christian Science (or anything else) before intervening as editors. The analogy is as follows. I personally wouldn't attempt to edit the Wikipedia article on quantum mechanics. There are a number of reasons for that. One is that I don't have enough of a maths/physics background. Another is because I'm not familiar enough with the primary sources (eg the writings of Heisenberg, Schroedinger etc. and the details of the experimental literature). It's true that I've read a considerable amount of &quot;secondary&quot; literature on quantum mechanics (sometimes written by reputable scientists like Paul Davies and David Bohm--though maybe that makes it &quot;primary&quot; by some definition??) Anyway, the point I'm getting at is that I don't personally know enough about qm to distinguish as clearly as I would want to, between  useful scholarly interpretations on the one hand, and nonsense on the other hand. (This is the case, whether the nonsense might consist of weird flights of new age fancy; or at the opposite extreme, hidebound resistance to anything new.) Nor would I consider myself capable of saying, with any convincing voice, whether (eg) the Copenhagen interpretation, or the many-worlds interpretation, of qm is correct. (I have my own personal views on that, but modesty--not to mention lack of a strong scientific background--would forbid me from airing them on Wikipedia.) If I were to attempt to edit the article on quantum mechanics, I would probably end up making a mess of it, because I simply don't know enough about the subject to contribute anything very useful. The article would probably end up worse than it was, so I wouldn't even start. On the other hand, it would be possible, though difficult, for me to learn enough about qm (eg by taking courses in maths/physics, doing a lot of reading and becoming familiar with the basic texts, so that I could cast aside my modesty and intervene on the editorial side, being at that point in a position to make an informed judgement, regarding the relative merits of the secondary literature. And I might not even agree with quantum mechanics after doing all that reading. (Btw I believe Einstein had a serious problem with qm at one point.) But I would know enough about it in order to be able to contribute constructively to an article on the topic. Anyway, I'm probably laboring the point, but I hope I have made it clearly enough. Of course, one does not need anything like the same amount of technical knowledge to understand Christian Science theology/philosophy than one needs to understand quantum mechanics. (That is, of course, if anyone really understands qm). But the principle is the same.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 21:23, 5 October 2012 (UTC)
:If you are improving the quantum mechanics article and you rely on primary sources by Schrodinger and Dirac etc, then you aren't doing it right. Scientists don't rely on original works because scientific progress makes them not reflect the current progress, and it's much more effective to get the information from a textbook, which can often explain it in a better way than the other scientists originally did. There is not necessarily anything special about the original paper.  Any reasonably intelligent adult can easily read the Christian Science article with few prerequisites, while the quantum mechanics article has numerous prerequisites in some parts. That said, there are plenty of sections any editor can edit easily, such as [[Quantum_Mechanics#Interactions_with_other_scientific_theories]], [[Quantum_Mechanics#History]], [[Quantum_Mechanics#Philosophical_implications]] and [[Quantum_Mechanics#Applications]]. Editors can also edit the other sections providing they are careful and stick to the reliable secondary sources. On wikipedia we assume the readers are intelligent but ignorant (lacking in knowledge), the same can apply to editors, as long as you are intelligent, even if ignorant, there is no issue with editing most articles. &lt;small&gt;You can't read a book which describes quantum mechanics and decide if you agree with quantum mechanics, it's a scientific theory; it is only by looking at the evidence or by performing independent experimental verification that you can decide. A part of any physics course is doing experiments and testing the theories. &lt;/small&gt; [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 00:15, 6 October 2012 (UTC)

Whether they gain the knowledge from primary or secondary (or tertiary) sources is not the issue. Anyone trying to make a root-and-branch overhaul of the article on quantum mechanics, without a broadly accurate understanding of what quantum mechanics is (however they have acquired the knowledge) would, almost inevitably, make a mess of it. Similarly, anyone attempting to make a root-and-branch overhaul of the article on Christian Science, without a broadly accurate understanding of what Christian Science is (however they have acquired the knowledge) would almost inevitably make a mess of it as well. You state: &quot;Any reasonably intelligent adult can easily read the Christian Science article with few prerequisites, while the quantum mechanics article has numerous prerequisites in some parts.&quot; That's not the point: the point is whether the person understands either of them well enough to be able to make radical editorial interventions that would add to the reader's understanding, rather than detracting from the reader's understanding. If much of the secondary literature on quantum mechanics were, as much of the secondary literature on Christian Science is, either in-house apologia by entrenched interests, or hostile (and often biased and inaccurate) attacks by scientific skeptics (at one end of the scale) and Christian fundamentalists (at the other), in that case one would have no alternative but to go to the primary sources in order to be able to evaluate fairly the secondary/tertiary sources.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 09:32, 6 October 2012 (UTC)

::Firstly, comparing Christian Science to Quantum Mechanics is not a good comparison, it's apples and oranges. A better comparison is to [[Scientology]].

It's your opinion that it's apples and oranges. You have made the a priori decision--apparently without any first-hand knowledge of Christian Science--that (perhaps because of the name) it is, ipso facto, in a different category from some other topics, and therefore that a particular editorial policy may apply to Christian Science, but not to other kinds of article. And in fact, I don't know enough about Scientology, to attempt a radical overhaul of the Wikipedia article on Scientology either. I certainly wouldn't attempt to do so without familiarizing myself, not only with the secondary/tertiary material on Scientology, but also with the writings of the founder. (As a matter of fact, in the interest of open-mindedness I have actually read some of the writings of Mr Hubbard, and found them somewhat more interesting than the secondary material I had come across might suggest. Even so, my fairly basic knowledge of Scientology means that I am in no way competent to do a radical overhaul of the Wikipedia article on the subject.) I think we are down to a discussion, not of editing per se, but of degrees of editing. Because, when I come to think of it, and maybe this contradicts something I said before but it's really just clarifying the basic point I'm trying to get across: I might indeed do a bit of editing on the QM article (or the Scientology article) maybe add a link here or a comma there, or straighten out a bit of grammar or whatever. But in no way would I have the presumption to do a radical overhaul of an article on a topic I knew little or nothing about, whether it was QM, Scientology or anything else.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 22:27, 6 October 2012 (UTC)

::I have knowledge of Christian Science both from Ms Eddy's writings and some further CoC,S published works, and some secondary literature (encyclopedias and compendia of Christianity, theology, religions, etc.), although I've never known it &quot;at first hand&quot;, and I've worked (more accurately, debated or argued) with IRWolfie before, and I found myself here correcting the error in substitutionary atonement (which is absent from Eastern Christianity, and prevalent only in Protestantism, Catholicism going with satisfactionary atonement, which, while superficially similar, is different, and has much different implications for soteriology as a whole) to the broader &quot;general historic Christian ideas of the atonement (wl:Atonement in Christianity)&quot; or something similar, so I'd be willing to lend a hand here, with all aspects, fact-checking/doctrine, referencing, other views, flow of thought, etc. Also, Wolfie is pretty much right on editing.

==Some Serious Weirdness in Article==

&quot;Typically these testimonies, which include nothing but a vague description, are done by non-doctors making the diagnosis.&quot; I have no idea what that's supposed to mean. A testimony is normally &quot;given&quot;, not &quot;done&quot;, in any parlance that I'm familiar with. And is there any serious reason to believe that a testimony would normally be given by a doctor, as this wording seems to imply? Is the sentence supposed to mean that the testimonies are typically checked by non-doctors who make the diagnosis? (I presume that's the intended meaning, but if so, why doesn't it say that?) There are some other weird formulations in the article but I haven't time to correct them now--and it's sometimes not clear whether they are in the original text cited (to which I don't have access) or merely a misinterpretation by an editor of this article--so it's hard to know how to make a correction.

== Use of the term Science ==
{{collapse top|[[WP:NOT#FORUM]] This off topic conversation doesn't belong here.}}
These comments are at this point OR and/or undocumented, so take it all with a grain of salt.  I am not at this point arguing against the term ''pseudoscience'' as an appellation for Christian Science, but simply pointing out that the term Christian Science can be in some sense interpreted in at least two ways.

Even Wikipedia's own article on science documents at least two ways in which the term can be used.  First as the study of cause and effect with application of some form of scientific method as in Physical Science or Chemical Science.  Second as the study of a systematized body of knowledge such as Library Science or Political Science (to be fair modern political science and the other  social sciences at least give lip service to the notion of testable hypothesis.  Library Science and Information Science are a bit different.)  The assertion that Christian Science claims to be a science, which is accurate, has different meaning depending on which ''kind'' of science Christian Science claims to be.  Again, this is only conjecture without documentation.  Can, however, Library Science or Information Sciences be classified as pseudosciences?

That Christian Science's use of the term &quot;science&quot; in its own name is an effort to claim the legitimacy of science is not in dispute.  The question is what ''kind'' of science is it claiming to be: the modern hypothesis testing form of science or the older aggretaive form.  The rigorous discipline of what we now know as science was still in development during the 19th century when Christian Science was founded and named.  Is it incumbent on the religion to rename itself (as Religious Science has done) in the face of the evolution of the scientific method?  Should it be held accountable for having ''not'' renamed itself?  Did Christian Science start out as simply the study of an accumulated body of knowledge and then evolve into a pseudoscience as modern science developed?  Certainly, in its time, in reacting to the growth of Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism (terms still used in Christian Science parlance) it was more mainstream than it is today.

Christian Science, unlike Scientology which -- if I understand it correctly -- is a purely invented system of belief, grew out of a 19th century intellectual soup of science and what would today be called pseudoscience.  Most of the advocacy going on here loses track of that historical background. Medicine in the 19th century was not that far removed from the theories [[Humorism]] and Medicine of [[Paracelsus]].  Is it accurate, in the historical sense, to so label it?  [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 13:38, 8 October 2012 (UTC)

I don't believe that Christian Science is a science, certainly in the present-day sense of the term--it's a metaphysical system with (claimed) practical implications, not a science like biology or physics, that have rigorous experimental procedures. I think Digitalican hits the nail on the head: the term &quot;science&quot; has changed in popular parlance, while the term &quot;Christian Science&quot; has remained unchanged. The application of the term &quot;pseudoscience&quot; to Christian Science, consequently involves a purely synchronic take on the situation, ignoring the diachronic/historical perspective. Christian Science is not a pseudoscience any more than Methodism or Roman Catholicism is a pseudoscience--it's the name of a particular religion, a name that needs to be understood in its 19th C historical context, not judged according to today's standards where the definitions of science have evolved. A Christian Scientist working in biology would have no problem with the theory of evolution, and a Christian Scientist working in geology would have no problem with the possibility that the earth may be billions of years old. I am sure adherents of Christian Science working in the natural sciences, are as capable of sticking rigorously to approved norms of scientific method in their work, as anyone else is. To imply that Christian Scientists must be adherents, or proponents, of pseudoscience because they belong to a religion with a particular name, is absurd. To give an analogy, the area of inquiry that is now called &quot;science&quot; used to be encompassed under &quot;philosophy.&quot; There may be organizations still extant (though I can't think of any offhand) that do science, but that describe themselves as philosophical rather than scientific. Would it be appropriate for philosophers to call them pseudo-philosophical, because they are not doing what it says in the name, as the latter is currently understood? Is a person a pseudo-Protestant because they are not currently protesting against anything? Is an atheist a pseudo-Christian because they are a member of a college with a Christian title? I don't think so. What is needed is a more historical and a less literalist perspective.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 18:51, 8 October 2012 (UTC)

:The above is also my analysis of the situation. I certainly wouldn't try and brand the Catholic practice of verifying miracles before canonising  a dead person as a saint, as a pseudoscience. Likewise, Methodists believe in healing through prayer, and I wouldn't brand that a pseudoscience either: not even if I believed such things to be scientifically impossible. Christian Science is, and has always claimed itself to be, a religion. Also, we are probably not getting more practicing Christian Scientists involved in the debate because Mary Baker Eddy's 'Manual of the Mother Church' explicitly forbids their membership from publically debating Christian Science. Some of us need to take cogniscence of this a bit more in our deliberations, and understand that they are not likely to react publically to harsher criticisms of their faith. [[User:Michael J.

== Accuracy of References ==

I am finding it is important to fact check the reliable sources used to document this page.  The actual statements in the sources are often subtly different than implied in their reference.  For example, The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience says that Mary Baker Eddy compared herself to Columbus and Copernicus, implying she thought of herself as a pioneer and explorer but the citation only refers to the comparison to Copernicus, allowing the reader to infer that she thought of herself as a groundbreaking scientist.  (To be fair, she may have, but that's not what the original source implies.) [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 13:29, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

:Read the very next sentence, and the preceding sentence  in the source. They are specifically talking about the history of science. They then mention a list of scientists, including Copernicus. You are inferring about explorers, when the context doesn't support that.

:Be careful with going to close to a source, it can be plagiarism. You copy and pasted in &quot;as illusory, and thus relatively unimportant&quot;. I paraphrased the text to be different for that reason. Not sure where you are reading about &quot;hard science&quot; at. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 15:33, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

It is not plagiarism if a sentence fragment and attributed (as you have,) the specific sentence is &quot;the Christian Science church has rejected physics and other sciences as illusory, and thus relatively unimportant.&quot;  I can put it in quotes if you like, which makes it a more acceptable reference.

You aren't accurate on the second part of the reference either.  It reads:  &quot;Eddy often compared herself to Columbus and Copernicus and [Dr. Lawrence] Doyle follows in this vein.  After discussing the discoveries of Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein, Doyle (1992) states&quot;...  Your reference specifically points to those Mary Baker Eddy compared herself with, not who Lawrence Doyle (who never even knew Eddy) says she should be compared with.   Are you asking to admit Doyle (a known Christian Scientist and visiting lecturer at The Principia) as a verifiable source? [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 16:08, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

:Seriously, don't add sentence fragments to articles as you did, close paraphrasing of this sort is plagiarism.

As I said on my talk page:  &quot;Understood.&quot;   While I don't agree technically that it is plagarism, we can put it in quotes if you like to avoid that problem.  I think my original observations stands.  I refuse to get into an edit war with you.  You are more experienced and I am more mature than to get into that.

::It's not clear who is being quoted. It's unnecessary quotations and wouldn't fit with the [[WP:MOS]]. Adding attribution would effectively reduce neutrality by unnecessarily attributing something which doesn't need to be, and make the mainstream position is only held by one author instead. The current text is fine. Quotes should only be used when they are relevant; if we were quoting a famous person about Christian Science for example, we may want to include his or her actual words. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 21:39, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

The attribution is already in place, was not added (and has not been removed.)  ''You'' put it there.  You cited it as evidence for the mainstream position.  I only checked ''your'' reference and found that there was a possible misinterpretation, or at least that it didn't say exactly what you reported.  The close wording to the original citation was within the guidelines of [[WP:PARAPHRASE]] (if the attribution was retained) and seemed appropriate, but the original citation was yours.

It is the same with Eddy's comparing herself to Columbus and Copernicus.  Searle gets that from S&amp;H pp 120-121 (I'm not sure that's &quot;often&quot; but I'm not here to impeach Searle. The statement is essentially factual.)  Searle goes on to report that Doyle compared Mary Baker Eddy to other scientists, but what Doyle said is not at issue here.  Now, if we were to extract from Searle that Mary Baker Eddy would compare herself to Columbus it lends itself to a different interpretation that saying that Mary Baker Eddy compared herself to Copernicus.  It seems to me that the way to more accurately reflect what Searle says is to include them both.  [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 15:58, 10 October 2012 (UTC)

I think Dr. Schrager would be very surprised to find herself quoted in this context, but it stands.

Some of my edits have been undone as &quot;weasel words.&quot; I wasn't very familiar with this term so I looked it up,  and I don't see how it applies to my edits. If, in writing an academic paper, I write &quot;the nineteenth century was a highly civilized period&quot; referencing Bloggs, it is not weasel words if, on reflection, I insert &quot;according to one source, the nineteenth century was a highly civilized period&quot; (still referencing Bloggs, of course.) In fact the latter is better scholarship, because (a) it distances me from the text, with which I might not necessarily agree; and (b) it distances the text from any claim to unshakable authority. (Other sources might describe the nineteenth century as a time of slavery, colonialism, exploitation etc., rather than a time of civilization, while yet other sources might describe the period in both positive and negative terms.) Even if the predominant view, or perhaps the overwhelmingly predominant view,  were that the nineteenth century was a civilized period, it is not the universal view of scholars, and thus any statement to that effect needs to be qualified. Not weasel words--just normal scholarly writing.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 19:57, 10 October 2012 (UTC)

The following is a quote from the introduction to the Wikipedia article on &quot;Creation Science&quot;: &quot;The overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science is a religious, not a scientific view, and that creation science does not qualify as science because it lacks empirical support, supplies no tentative hypotheses, and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes.[7][8] Creation science has been characterized as a pseudo-scientific attempt to map the Bible into scientific facts.[9][10]&quot; Note that the intro does not say &quot;Creation Science is a pseudoscience.&quot; It says &quot;Creation science has been characterized as a pseudo-scientific attempt to map the Bible into scientific facts&quot; and gives references for this. Is the phrase &quot;has been characterized&quot; in the Creation Science article a form of &quot;weasel words&quot;? If not, what is the problem with such formulations in the article on Christian Science?[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 21:41, 10 October 2012 (UTC)

OK we're getting to the nub of the matter here, and perhaps it's just down to a misunderstanding. There was no attempt on my part to suggest that &quot;in the view of critics&quot; is in the source. (I think I put it in the way I did, ie in the middle of the sentence, to avoid some semantic clumsiness that would have resulted had I put it at the start of that particular citation.) But you are right if you're pointing out that &quot;in the view of critics&quot; should probably have been inserted in the beginning rather than the middle of the text cited, to avoid any confusion as to whether it was in the original text, or not. I will endeavor to do that in future. However, if it's the phrase itself that you're objecting to (rather than its placing in the text) I should point out that a phrase such as &quot;in the view of critics&quot; is an introduction of a perspective, in the normal academic way. That is the norm in academic writing, in the disciplines with which I'm familiar at any rate (philosophy, sociology etc) whether one is a &quot;realist&quot; on the one hand, or a &quot;relativist&quot; (or postmodernist) on the other. (I write peer-reviewed academic articles that get published in academic journals and books, and that's how it's done in that context.) You write that I've tried to undermine the mainstream positions. First of all, I can assure you that I haven't tried to do that, and I guess I'm the best person to understand my subjective motives. Secondly, I don't think I've done it (bracketing the question of whether I tried to do it or not). However, if you want something to go in about a particular perspective being the view of mainstream critics, I don't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with, is the article giving the impression that something that some writer has said on a complex social/historical/ideological issue is the case, as if it's some kind of unquestioned and unquestionable truth--like the statement &quot;there is a moon&quot; (though even that last statement could be questioned by some radical constructivists lol).

OK, I concede you have a point there, though it hangs on definitions of terms like &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;attributable,&quot; and &quot;neglect&quot; is as much opinion as fact. But let that pass for the moment. Even if a qualifying phrase may be inappropriate in this particular context, it is not so in the case of some of the other qualifying phrases that were deleted. And as an overall point, I'm quite sure that the Wikipedia entry on &quot;Medicine&quot; is not dominated by references to iatrogenic illnesses and deaths, concerns about the effects of vaccines, animal experimentation, issues raised by placebos, the huge cost of the medical health care system, and negative issues about the drug industry, commercialisation, medical malpractice, etc etc. The fact that there are now so many negative comments in the entry on Christian Science--even if the comments may be &quot;factual&quot; in some cases (whatever that means)--gives an overall distorted and unbalanced view of the subject.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 12:38, 11 October 2012 (UTC)

The current Encyclopedia Britannica article on Christian Science, which is an undeniable secondary source, certainly entertains claims that it works; at least on occasion.

I think what Michael J. Mullany was getting at is the designation of Christian Science as a &quot;pseudoscience.&quot; (But he can speak for himself, no doubt.) As I pointed out already, &quot;Christian Science&quot; is the name of a religion. It is not a pseudoscience, nor is it a science as science is understood today. It was named in the nineteenth century, long before Popper et al. It does not do science as science is currently understood, nor should it reasonably be expected to, nor would it want to. (It is not a pseudoscience any more than modern protestantism is pseudo-protestantism because it may not be currently protesting about something or other.) In regard to Michael's point re members of FCCS being prohibited from public debate of CS, I think it's straining the interpretation to apply it to a forum like this. The relevant text (Article X of the Church Manual) reads: &quot;A member of this Church shall not debate on Christian Science in public debating assemblies, without the consent of the Board of Directors.&quot; It's a big stretch to regard the Talk page as a public debating assembly. In any case its function, if I understand it correctly, is to discuss the article on CS, rather  than the substantive issue of CS itself. In recent times, members of FCCS have been encouraged by the church to act individually to correct public misconceptions of CS, rather than sole reliance being placed on dedicated &quot;Committees on Publication.&quot; One can't really do that properly on Wikipedia without contributing to the Talk page.  In regard to another of Michael's points; I am a member, I have complained about the dogmatic designation of CS as a &quot;pseudoscience&quot; (as if that statement were in the same category as the statement that the earth is round) and it hasn't done any good. In terms of the current state of the article: there is no problem with secondary material being added to the article (insofar as it's correctly quoted/paraphrased of course). The article needed a lot more secondary material. The problem arises (a) from statements in secondary material being regarded as fact rather than interpretation; and (b) from the fact that, due to an extremely narrow, and one-sided, interpretation of the Wikipedia guidelines on primary sources, much valuable, informative and accurate material was removed--rather than being simply supplemented/balanced with secondary material as appropriate, which could only have improved the article. In the end it's the people with the most time and persistence who tend to win out in these edit wars. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time at the moment. However, I will continue to correct the misinterpretations of CS in the article whenever I have the opportunity, doing my best--of course--to do so in accordance with the Wikipedia conventions (though not in accordance with some random interpretation of them).[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 22:27, 12 October 2012 (UTC)

:[[WP:TLDR]]. The scientific method was formulated by that time. Science didn't just come into existence once popper came around.

Read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method. Scientific method, as we know it, was only developing at the time of the nineteenth century. You ask a question as to ask whether some doctrine about Popper is part of Christian Science teaching. Christian Science teaching is found exclusively in the Bible and the writings of Mary Baker Eddy--there are no groups or individuals that have any remit to modify it, add to it, or subtract from it. (Anyone who was familiar with Christian Science would know this, btw.) Since Popper was eight years old at the time of MBE's death, I don't see how she, or Christian Science teaching, would have anything to say about him, one way or another.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 08:28, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

==''Science'', redux==

The term ''science'' is either ambiguous, or used in multiple ways at the same time today, even on Wikipedia.  Not only does [[Library science|Library Science]] not qualify as a science through the litmus  of scientific method use, but there also exists [[Religious Science]], [[Divine Science]], and [[Jewish Science]] (none of which have been labelled ''pseudoscience'').  These last three are religions in the [[New Thought]] movement who assert a concept called [[Affirmative prayer|Affirmative Prayer]] which is similar, if not identical, in concept and execution to Christian Science prayer.  William James, in [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]] (certainly a reliable and verifiable source by Wikipedia standards) describes the benefits of such prayer, mentioning Christian Science specifically, ''despite'' its inability to heal disease.  He also asserts that Christian Science is a religion, important in this discussion. [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 02:55, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

:What makes the &quot;science&quot; part of Christian Science is that it makes specific claims about what it can do. When tested, it does not fulfill said claims. Had Christian Science acknowledged that the original statements are wrong, they would fall under the heading of science. Since they don't, the correct label is &quot;pseudoscience&quot;. I don't know if the other &quot;scienceses&quot; makes similar testable predictions, but even if they do, it would not in itself make Christian Science a proper science. [[User:Thimbleweed|Thimbleweed]] ([[User talk:Thimbleweed|talk]]) 08:07, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

&quot;When tested, it does not fulfill said claims.&quot; Logically, this could indeed be a problem with Christian Science, or with the inability of scientific method to set up an experiment where the expectations of the experimenters did not influence the result, or with the fact that CS healing sometimes works and sometimes doesn't (because it depends inter alia on the mental state of the patient, which is difficult or impossible to measure). From personal experience--and this is admittedly &quot;anecdotal&quot; but it's my anecdote--I have relied on CS for most of my life without any medical intervention (except in the case of dental/optical work, compulsory medical examinations, and one other minor situation to do with an ear problem). I am in generally good health, and have sufficient experience of rapid healing after Christian Science treatment not to have any serious questions re its efficacy. (I've also saved a lot of money lol). However, I accept that it would be difficult or impossible for any of my experiences to feed into scientific experiments, not because they didn't happen (though logically it could indeed have been a remarkable chain of coincidences) but because the scientific method doesn't accommodate them. Consequently, I'm happy enough to admit that CS is not a science as science is presently defined. But it's not a pseudoscience either. It's a metaphysical system with (claimed) practical implications.[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 08:49, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

:I have no problem with CSists use the word &quot;science&quot;, nor that they prefer to credit CS whenever they heal on their own. The only reason CS is a pseudoscience and should very clearly be labeled as such is because they make scientific claims about medicine. If they had not, I don't think anyone would care.

:You may also want to read [[Scientific control]]. This is not something that is excluded from science ''a priori''.

Thimbleweed: I don't know what you mean by the phrase &quot;because they make scientific claims about medicine.&quot; As a (practical) metaphysical system whose teachings fall within the category of philosophical idealism, Christian Science teaches that, in the last analysis, everything (including medicine) works mentally, because everything is mental. The claim is metaphysical rather than scientific, in the modern sense of the term anyway. It offers a meta-analysis of how the world works, rather than a series of hypotheses to be tested. It needs to be assessed, in consequence, in philosophical terms of logicality, coherence, consistency, explanatory ability (etc.), rather than in scientific terms of susceptibility to experimental proof (or disproof). According to its own teaching, Christian Science could not fall within the category of the natural sciences, which in practical terms operate on the basis that there is a world &quot;out there&quot; to be measured, on which the consciousness of those making the measurements can have no appreciable effect. Strictly within its own terms and in terms of what it claims, Christian Science does not, could not, and would not want to, fall within the category of the natural sciences, insofar as the latter are materialistic in both ontological and epistemological terms. (The above is of course a simplistic analysis of the natural sciences, since it says nothing about modern physics from Heisenberg onwards, which, in some interpretations at least, problematize materialism in either ontological or epistemological terms, or both. BTW I'm putting this comment in parentheses to avoid invoking the mantra of &quot;quantum mysticism&quot;)[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 10:10, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

Additionally, the human fields of learning have largely abandonned empirical testing of hypotheses (namely, the scientific method) in favour of case studies; which are entirely anecdotal. Many of these fields call themselves sciences; social science, information science, management science, and so on. Should we brand all of these as pseudosciences as well? Michael J. Mullany (talk) 10:14, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

:GruessGott, you are absolutely correct in CS not falling under natural science. Had they stuck to making claims about the afterlife or other metaphysical questions, no one would have have minded. The problem is that CS makes claims about the nature of deceases, and use the word &quot;science&quot; to add authority to their claims. When they do that, they will be judged by the same standards as others claiming things about e.g. gangrene using science. It really is that simple.

:Mullany, that &quot;the human fields of learning have largely abandonned empirical testing of hypotheses&quot; is an extraordinary claim and requires proof. At least within any field relevant to this discussion (i.e medicine) rigorous scientific testing is very much the accepted standard. [[User:Thimbleweed|Thimbleweed]] ([[User talk:Thimbleweed|talk]]) 12:12, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

I don't find any of these defensible (or accurate) positions.  I agree with [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie]] and friends that Christian Science fails the litmus test of mainstream science as it is conducted today because it makes predictions about the real world which fail experimental tests.  That is a matter of proven statistical fact.  The ''pseudoscience'' appellation, however, requires more.  Most (but certainly not all) religions (is anyone here arguing that Christian Science is ''not'' a religion?) predict real world effects from proper application of their methods. This ranges from praying for world peace, for the demise of political figures, for the defeat of nations in war or even for relief from plague.  Some of these even include the term ''science'' in their names.  The question to me is, does Christian Science ''explicitly'' claim to be a science in any sense beyond being a systemic approach to its own particular version of knowledge similar to Library Science or claiming that it's metaphysical methods work?  Does it purposefully adopt the trappings of science to seem what it is not as does, for example, &quot;The Law of Attraction&quot;.  Is it, in that sense, &quot;pseudoscience&quot; or &quot;fringe science&quot; any more than any similar belief set?

The problem with this article as it is shaping up is that it is intemperate.  It looks like no other tertiary source on Christian Science save those coming entirely out of the Skeptics corner or out of the Fundamentalist corner.  It looks unencyclopedic.  That, in itself, makes it a appear to be form of OR (though admittedly not WP:OR) and gives it the ''appearance'' of POV.  Should the idea of Christian Science as pseudoscience be included?  Absolutely.  I would expect that is the mainstream ''scientific'' view.  Is that the mainstream ''theologic'' view?  Is that the mainstream ''philosophic'' view?  It is certainly possible to find assertions of almost anything in secondary sources.  (The use of an article on contrasting approaches to black social advancement from a social historian to ''prove'' that Christian Science considers itself a science is a bit flabbergasting and certainly disingenuous.  Not encyclopedic.)  The attempt to synthesize these various assertions into some kind of &quot;mainstream&quot; opinion is, I think, misbegotten.  All of this does not make Wikipedia a better encylopedia.  [[User:Digitalican|Digitalican]] ([[User talk:Digitalican|talk]]) 12:42, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

:Your thoughts goes to the heart of the question of what goes into this article.

There's a conundrum here I don't know how to resolve within the context of Wikipedia policies and I would like constructive help rather than recitation of policy.  I have read all of the Wikipedia policy pages that have been suggested to me, and more.  I am not insensitive to the issues:

External views of Christian Science certainly focus on its relation to medicine.  That is, and always has been, it's most salient characteristic to the general public.  &quot;Christian Scientists don't go to doctors&quot; (not true, but that's the conventional wisdom.)  That aspect may, in fact, be the dominant characteristic of religion and, if so, should be weighted as such -- but not to the exclusion of all else.  At its heart Christian Science is a religion and -- it is my position -- needs to be treated in that context rather than in the context of a pretender to science.  To the extent, and only to the extent and in the context of, Christian Science portraying itself as a scientific alternative to Medical Science, can it be called pseudoscience.  Within that context I think categorizing it as such is entirely legitimate.  What I need is a way, without referring to secondary sources published within the community of the Christian Science Church, to explicate -- without advocacy -- why Christian Scientists believe what they do and what they think.  That tempers the article and makes it more informative in an encyclopedic sense.     

I categorically reject Dr. Cynthia Shrager (see the article) as a legitimate source documenting Christian Sciences assertions that it is a science (in the modern sense.)  She is not an expert on Christian Science, science, medicine or pseudoscience and the quote is taken from an incidental aside in the article.  Whatever we do here, I would like it to reflect a more scholarly approach to research, not simply cherry-picking quotes obtained through ''search engine of your choice''.  It isn't just ''verifiability'' and ''reliability'' to be used as yardsticks, it's also relevance and expertise.  These too need to be considered in supporting Wikipedia as an encyclopedia.

:As has already been discussed, ''no''. We don't things which can be regarded as facts. This isn't a postmodernist paper. There are things which are uncontroversially regarded as simple statements of facts from the sources and written in the wikipedia tone. &quot;The sun is not the moon&quot; is a fact, &quot;I believe the sun is the moon&quot; is an opinion. By saying &quot;John says the sun is not the moon&quot;, you are casting doubt on the sun not being the moon. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 10:41, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

As I said before, Wolfie, you are confusing two kinds of statements. In the literature that I'm familiar with, there is a crucial distinction between &quot;first order&quot; statements and &quot;second order&quot; statements. A statement like  &quot;I have a pen in my hand&quot; is a first order statement. It is uncontroversially true (ignoring some issues that I won't go into) because I can prove it by displaying the pen. Similarly, &quot;the sun is not the moon&quot; is a first order statement because we can validate it empirically through simple observation (though there may be occasions when we may mistake the one for the other; in which case, what we thought was the sun might, in fact, turn out to be the moon--nevertheless, it is true to say something like &quot;the object to which the term 'sun' refers is a distinct object from the object to which the term &quot;moon&quot; refers&quot; assuming we are agreed on what an &quot;object&quot; is, and on the relationship between the word &quot;object&quot; and whatever it may, or may not, refer to.) Anyway, these kinds of statements are quite different from statements such as &quot;The Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct&quot; or &quot;we live in one of a multitude of parallel worlds&quot; or &quot;scientific materialism is correct&quot; or &quot;the nineteenth century was a highly civilized era&quot; or of &quot;God exists/does not exist&quot; or whatever.  To make the point more specifically, it would not be appropriate to say that the CI interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct (unless one proposed to demonstrate how it was correct, in which case that would be OR, surely). It would, however, be correct to say that it is the predominant contemporary consensus as to how QM should be interpreted, (assuming that that is the case, which I believe it is at the moment).[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 11:23, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

:Why are you talking about quantum mechanics? It's a secondary source statement of fact, this isn't your research paper so stop treating it like it is. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 11:54, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

IRWolfie, could I suggest you acquaint yourself with the *fact* that the term &quot;fact&quot; is deeply problematic in contemporary academic discourse? But I'll compress what I was trying to say (admittedly in a long-winded way) as follows. To say that &quot;the sun is not the moon&quot; is a different kind of statement from the statement &quot;The CI interpretation of QM is correct&quot; (or from the statement &quot;Christian Science is a pseudoscience&quot;). The first fact is simple, obvious, and more-or-less universally agreed. The latter &quot;facts&quot; are none of these things[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 12:23, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

::If I may: When two authorities say the opposite, and where it would be WP:OR to favour the one over the other, both should be cited and the scientific disagreement shown. Where a small minority maintain a position in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus, the minority view can be mentioned where relevant, but giving it equal weight goes against WP:FRINGE. In this case, giving CS equal weight in cases regarding natural science (medicine), would go against WP:FRINGE, WP:SOAP and WP:ADVOCACY, i.e. it's not done. [[User:Thimbleweed|Thimbleweed]] ([[User talk:Thimbleweed|talk]]) 11:56, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

Yes, that seems about right. Agreed. But one would still mention the fact that it's the consensus, or the overwhelming consensus, or whatever. (Not that its a &quot;fact&quot; like the fact that the sun is not the moon.)[[User:GruessGott|GruessGott]] ([[User talk:GruessGott|talk]]) 12:23, 13 October 2012 (UTC)

::I agree, [[User:Thimbleweed|Thimbleweed]], but this whole discussion has had a history of personal attacks, derision and innuendo from the beginning -- on both sides (I am not free of guilt in this respect, but have since calmed down.)

OK, thanks for the reminder on etiquette, Thimbleweed. You are, of course, right. I apologize if I've stepped on anyone's toes--or paws ;-) At this point, unfortunately, I'm going to have to clear off the editing page and this discussion, because my commitments in RL are pressing at the moment, and I've been spending too much time discussing things on these pages, interesting though the discussion has often been. Whatever our differences, you all seem to be highly intelligent and well-informed people, and you are all committed to your viewpoints, as am I, and that's fair enough.

::I'll comment here because I have a theory - the mentioning of James Randi as a Sceptic is an obvious attempt to bypass the fact the vast majority of scientific analysis of CS classes it as Pseudo-science. Using Randi is deceptive because although he is someone commonly involved with critical analysis of stuff like this, he is generally classed as a ''Sceptic'' rather than a scientist.

== Theology ==

In response to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEditor_review%2FIRWolfie-&amp;diff=522341648&amp;oldid=522054563] (this should have gone on my talk page which you can find here: [[User_talk:IRWolfie-]] not my editor review page. The comment was: 
:''&quot;The trouble with the article on Christian Science is that it gives little idea to the reader as to what Christian Science is really about, what it's theology is, what it's Christology is, what it's eschatology is, what it's view of atonement really is, how the word &quot;science&quot; is used in Christian Science (this alone would eliminate the need to call it a pseudoscience). It seems to me that in the case of religion, since &quot;faith&quot; is a departure from standard material reasoning, some basic reliable primary sources should be tolerated in order to give the reader an accurate idea of what Christian Science actually says. I placed the tenets under the theology section because they explain exactly what Christian Scientists actually believe. It seems to me that this could be tolerated in order to be fair to the reader. The article is so unbalanced the way it is, and seems to give only the negative opinions. Is it proper or fair to the reader to only reference negative sources? Does it raise the standard of Wikipedia to use the rules of Wikipedia to prevent any clear idea of the subject of the article to come forth when people are willing to make edits to contribute to the fairness and balance, and frankly, intelligence of the article? I would be willing to make edits, and to use secondary reliable sources, but I have to make sure that you do not have an ax to grind, because I don't want to waste my time. But honestly, this article is one of the worst things I have ever seen on Wikipedia. I truly believe it lowers the standard of Wikipedia in it's present form because it mostly reads as an attack on Christian Science instead of an enlightened explanation. My opinion is that if you tell the truth about something, it will stand on it's own merits, or fall by it's own demerits. But that opportunity is not being given here.''&quot;

This is something you can freely write about in the theology section. Just make sure to use reliable secondary sources to source the material. This is an encyclopedia, write a good summary of Christian Science theology and source it to some secondary sources. Try to avoid copying and pasting large lists of tenents etc from primary sources, because it's missing the kind of analysis that secondary sources can give and it has the potential for [[WP:NOR|original research]] which isn't what we want on wikipedia. I did request help from wikiproject christianity in trying to flesh out the theology section with reliable secondary sources. The first three paragraphs are not critical of christian science. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 15:51, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

The article as it stands is seriously flawed (that's putting it politely). It was a reasonably informative and well-balanced article until a couple of months ago. BTW, it's not true that a Wikipedia article cannot have primary sources - there is nothing in the policies that prohibits them (though they say, rightly, that they should be used with care.)[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 18:31, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

::Primary sources should be used with care, not as the basis for an entire article. The article as it stands now is much closer to the actual secondary sources than the previous wording. The article is as it is now is actually in a fairly decent state, though the theology section falls short. [[User:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie-]] ([[User talk:IRWolfie-|talk]]) 19:08, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

The article gives a staccato impression. It features passages with no apparent connection to the preceding text. In parts, it is theologically inaccurate. It is one-sided and dogmatic. It is singularly uninformative about Christian Science itself, as distinct from what its enemies think it is. It contains errors of syntax. There are citation deficiencies. It might pass as a first year undergraduate term paper (just about). And I didn't even get as far as the section on the Church of Christ Scientist.[[Special:Contributions/89.100.155.6|89.100.155.6]] ([[User talk:89.100.155.6|talk]]) 01:12, 11 November 2012 (UTC)

:This is also my impression. However, if you are a Christian Scientist, perhaps you can explain something to me: why do you think that so few Christian Scientists are participating in the editing discussion? [[User:Michael J.
