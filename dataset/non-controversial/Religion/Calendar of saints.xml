The '''calendar of saints''' is a traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] method of organizing a [[liturgical year]] by associating each day with one or more [[saint]]s and referring to the '''feast day''' of said saint. The system arose from the early Christian custom of annual commemoration of [[martyr]]s on the dates of their deaths, or birth into heaven, and is thus referred to in [[Latin language|Latin]] as '''''dies natalis''''' (&quot;''day of birth''&quot;). In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], it is called a ''[[Menologion]]''.&lt;ref name=Colum/&gt; Menologion may also refer to a set of icons on which saints are depicted along the order of dates of their feasts, often made in two panels.

==History==
As the number of recognized saints increased during [[Late Antiquity]] and the first half of the [[Middle Ages]], eventually every day of the year had at least one saint who was commemorated on that date. To deal with this increase, some saints were moved to alternate days in some traditions or completely removed, with the result that some saints have different feast days in different calendars. For example, Ss. [[Perpetua and Felicity]] died on 7 March, but this date was later assigned to St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], allowing them only a commemoration (see [[Tridentine Calendar]]), so in 1908 they were moved one day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; When the 1969 reform of the Catholic calendar moved him to 28 January, they were moved back to 7 March (see [[General Roman Calendar]]). Both days can thus be said to be their feast day, in different traditions. The Roman Catholic calendars of saints in their various forms, which list those saints celebrated in the entire church, contains only a selection of the saints for each of its days. A fuller list is found in the [[Roman Martyrology]], and some of the saints there may be celebrated locally.

The earliest feast days of saints were those of martyrs, venerated as having shown for Christ the greatest form of love, in accordance with the teaching: &quot;Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|15:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Martin of Tours]] is said to be the first&lt;ref&gt;[http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic/saints/martin.html Commemoration of St. Martin of Tours]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-371434.html Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt; or at least one of the first non-martyrs to be venerated as a saint. The title &quot;[[confessor]]&quot; was used for such saints, who had confessed their faith in Christ by their lives rather than by their deaths. Martyrs are regarded as dying in the service of the Lord, and confessors are people who died natural deaths. A broader range of titles was used later, such as: [[Virgin (title)|Virgin]], [[Pastor]], [[Bishop]], [[Monk]], [[Priest]], Founder, [[Abbot]], Apostle, [[Doctor of the Church]].

The [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Missal]] has [[common (liturgy)|common formulas]] for Masses of Martyrs, Confessors who were bishops, Doctors of the Church, Confessors who were not Bishops, Abbots, Virgins, Non-Virgins, Dedication of Churches, and Feast Days of the Blessed Virgin Mary. [[Pope Pius XII]] added a common formula for Popes. The [[General Roman Calendar of 1962|1962 Roman Missal of Pope John XXIII]] omitted the common of Apostles, assigning a proper Mass to every feast day of an Apostle. The present [[Roman Missal]] has common formulas for the Dedication of Churches, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Martyrs (with special formulas for missionary martyrs and virgin martyrs), Pastors (subdivided into bishops, generic pastors, founders of churches, and missionaries), Doctors of the Church, Virgins, and (generic) Saints (with special formulas for abbots, monks, nuns, religious, those noted for works of mercy, educators, and [generically] women saints).

This [[calendar]] system, when combined with major [[church (building)|church]] festivals and movable and immovable feasts, constructs a very human and personalised yet often localized way of organizing the year and identifying dates. Some Christians continue the tradition of dating by saints' days: their works may appear &quot;dated&quot; as &quot;The Feast of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]]&quot;. Poets such as [[John Keats]] commemorate the importance of ''The Eve of [[Saint Agnes]]''.

As different denominations of Christianity developed, differing lists of saints began as the same individual may be considered (as an extreme) a saint or doctor by one denomination and a heretic by another, as in the case of [[Nestorius]].

As the [[ecumenical]] movement has sought to converge each denominational [[lectionary]] into a unified [[Revised Common Lectionary]], Dr. Philip Pfatteicher sought to unify different saints calendars (among Protestants) by authoring the ''New Book of Festivals and Commemorations: A Proposed Common Calendar of Saints'', August 1, 2008.

==Ranking of feast days==
{{main|Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite}}
Feast days are ranked in accordance with their importance.

In what is now the ordinary form of the [[Roman Rite]], feast days are ranked (in descending order of importance) as [[Solemnity|solemnities]], feasts or [[memorial (liturgy)|memorials]] (obligatory or optional).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/litcal.htm General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar], 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 1962 version, whose use is authorized by the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], divides liturgical days into I, II, III, and IV class days, as decreed by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1960. Those who use even earlier forms of the Roman Rite rank feast days as Doubles (of three or four kinds), Semidoubles, and Simples. See [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite#Feast days|Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite]].

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the ranking of feasts varies from church to church. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] they are: [[Great Feasts]], middle, and minor feasts. Each portion of such feasts may also be called feasts as follows: [[All-Night Vigil]]s, [[Polyeleos]], [[Great Doxology]], Sextuple (&quot;sixfold&quot;, having six [[stichera]] at [[Vespers]] and six [[troparia]] at the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of [[Matins]]). There are also distinctions between Simple feasts and Double (i.e., two simple feasts celebrated together). In Double Feasts the order of hymns and readings for each feast are rigidly instructed in [[Typikon]], the liturgy book.

In the [[Church of England]], there are [[Principal Feast]]s and [[Principal Holy Day]]s, [[Festival (Church of England)|Festival]]s, [[Lesser Festival]]s, and [[Commemoration (observance)|Commemoration]]s.
