== Pics ==

This article needs appropriate pics. See [[Commons:Category:Rabbis]]. &amp;ndash; [[User:Quadell|Quadell]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Quadell|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 23:02, 10 May 2009 (UTC)
 
==Recognition of who is a Jew==

I removed the following from the page:

&quot;Likewise, the North American Reform rabbinate does not accept the offspring of a Jewish mother and Gentile father to be Jewish unless raised unambiguously as Jews.&quot;

I am not a member of a reform rabninate, but this just seems to be a mistake - every denomination would consider a person to be born to a Jewish mother as 100% Jewish. If the Reform rabbinate does have such a policy, please provide a citation.[[User:Romabers|Romabers]] ([[User talk:Romabers|talk]]) 02:59, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

==Female rabbis==

Is there a title for a female rabbi, like ''Rabbein'' maybe? --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 15:10, 26 June 2009 (UTC)
:Don't think so. Not in English, anyway.

==Conflict of interest insertion==
{{user|JoeCarter888}} recently inserted two links here[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rabbi&amp;diff=318589674&amp;oldid=318573914] during a spree of adding links to &quot;First Things,&quot; a site he edits.[http://www.firstthings.com/masthead] This is clearly a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] and inappropriate use of Wikipedia to promote a website. I removed the links, but {{user|Zsero}} finds value in them.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rabbi&amp;diff=319355784&amp;oldid=318976972] I moved the links to the external links section because the references section is reserved for works that were actually used for building the article. My preference is for the links to be removed completely, not only because of their origin but also because they are off topic for this article ([[Women in Judaism]] is a separate article). &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;✤&lt;/font&gt; [[User:JonHarder|JonHarder]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JonHarder|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:05, 18 October 2009 (UTC)

==Israeli Rabbi and abortion==

This [[Israel]]i site: [[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1263147878219&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull JP]] writes the opinion from Chief Rabbinate of [[Israel]] about abortion. In the article, we can read:&quot;There is nothing more important than encouraging births - according to the commentaries - and it is our role to raise the awareness on the subject of abortions,&quot; [[Rabbi]] [[Yehudah Deri]], a member of the [[Chief Rabbinical Council]], said during the committee hearing. &quot;'''Women must be aware - many women don't know that the significance of abortion is murder.''' The information that we distributed was a rabbinic ruling that '''abortion is murder, the [[halacha]] sees a fetus as a living person'''&quot;.

The '''black''' letters are mine, not from the article itself.[[User:Agre22|Agre22]] ([[User talk:Agre22|talk]]) 14:28, 13 January 2010 (UTC)agre22

== Quality? ==

hello. Is there a reason, why this article is so bad? Or is it just lack of interest? If the latter, I may do some editing, eventually, but not, if the substandard quality of the article is the result of POV and worse. With thanks for an explanation, [[User:Ajnem|ajnem]] ([[User talk:Ajnem|talk]]) 10:42, 6 August 2010 (UTC)

== Section &quot;Honor&quot; is Repeated ==

The top-level &quot;Honor&quot; section should be eliminated. The subsection &quot;Honor&quot; should be combined or grouped with section &quot;Authority&quot;, IMO. [[Special:Contributions/77.126.46.34|77.126.46.34]] ([[User talk:77.126.46.34|talk]]) 06:50, 1 September 2010 (UTC)

== Pronunciation ==

How does one pronounce this thing? Is it pronounced like 'rabbit' with the 't' assumed to be silent?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/122.172.251.185|122.172.251.185]] ([[User talk:122.172.251.185|talk]]) 08:00, 23 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: No, it is pronounced like &quot;rabbay&quot; (like &quot;I&quot;). What you suggested is close to the pronunciation of &quot;[[rebbe]]&quot;, but not precisely. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 10:18, 23 December 2011 (UTC)

== The word ==

I have undo [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rabbi&amp;diff=470179932&amp;oldid=466955657 Wavelength's] removal of the word &quot;The&quot; in the header &quot;The word 'rabbi' &quot; because &quot;Word 'rabbi' &quot; sounds unclear to me. In addition please notice that the cited guideline [[WP:MOS#Article titles]] doesn't necessarily apply to headers as well.

== Question: Does a Rabbi have to be Married? ==

Does being a Rabbi automatically mean that the Rabbi MUST be married, in order to have fulfilled the doctrines of the beliefs?
Should he be married BEFORE becoming a Rabbi, otherwise he cannot get married, similar to some christian traditions, or is this irrelevant and they can get married after becoming a Rabbi?

Moreover, shouldn't there be a section mentioning the specific &quot;characteristics&quot; or qualities/qualifications/achievements (i.e. specific knowledge, mastery of scriptures, etc), among other things that someone must have fulfilled before being ordained as Rabbi? 

Please send me a personal message as answer to this question as well.

: Any male Jew should have children. This is a Divine commandment (be fruitful and multiply). So he would have be married at least once in his lifetime, since one is not supposed to have children outside marriage. Rabbis are in no aspect different in all of this. In short, in Judaism there is no connection between being a rabbi and one's marital status, in whatever way.
