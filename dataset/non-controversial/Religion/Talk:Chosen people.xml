==&quot;Chosen People&quot; = &quot;Master Race&quot;? ==

It's pretty much the same notion, eh? They both fall under the rather narrow category of &quot;ethnocentric superiority complex&quot;... The parallels should at least be mentioned.
[[Special:Contributions/71.247.177.135|71.247.177.135]] ([[User talk:71.247.177.135|talk]]) 20:08, 5 March 2008 (UTC)
:I suggest that you read the section regarding that issue under http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen_people#Ethnocentrism . Groups that hold an idea of a chosen people typically regard it as being something very, very different from the notion of a &quot;master race&quot;. [[User:Asarelah|Asarelah]] ([[User talk:Asarelah|talk]]) 04:53, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

::In fact, I would suggest that different groups have different definitions of what &quot;chosen people&quot; really means. Some might define it similar to a master race; some might define it in terms that only their religion or group can achieve salvation or heaven. Still others might define it to mean that anyone joining their religion is accepted into the &quot;chosen people&quot;; and still others might see it as any who believe certain ideas, no matter what religious affiliation, are &quot;chosen.&quot; Of course, this is a very short list and isn't complete. And then defining &quot;chosen&quot; is also varied. Chosen for heaven or salvation after this life, chosen for a better place in this life, chosen to have certain beliefs, chosen to accomplish certain things in the world, etc. Depending on a person's religious beliefs, the definitions can be drastically different. We need to be careful in how concepts and ideas are worded in these articles. It is important to define a religion in terms that it's followers agree with for it to appear legitimate.--[[User:Truecolors|Truecolors]] ([[User talk:Truecolors|talk]]) 16:23, 16 April 2009 (UTC)

&quot;Chosen People&quot; does indeed mean &quot;Master Race&quot;, that is why the [[Herrenrasse]] ideology of the Nazis should be  mentioned in this article. Whether a group of people think themselves better and above the rest of humankind due to a proximity to god (as in Judaism) or due to some grand destiny (as with Nazis) does not matter. The underlying idea of superiority of one's own group is the same. It is the very lowest form of intellectual tribalism.

Um, it is what Muslims believe. No religion's beliefs are NPOV! But this statement ''is'' presented in an NPOV fashion. It would be a ''violation'' of NPOV to say that &quot;Muslims are the only people chosen to carry the true word of God.&quot; To make this statement NPOV, we must rewrite this not as a fact, but rather as a statement which makes it clear that this is what Muslims happen to believe. &quot;Islamic supersessionism retroactively rewrites the role of Abraham, and presents Muslims as the only people chosen to carry the true word of God.&quot;  [[User:RK|RK]] 14:52, Jul 7, 2004 (UTC)

Is the link to Americentrism NPOV?  It should be changed to [[Ethnocentrism]], as the link suggests Americentrism is stronger than other kinds of ethnocentrism.

== Purposes of Being Chosen ==

I'm removing this section. This has nothing to do with the definition of exclusivism. It seems more like a straw man against exclusivism being smuggled in.

==Big QUESTION? ==

Why does exclusivism link to &quot;Chosen People&quot;. Being chosen in not a necessary inference to exclusivism. Exclusivism is simply a belief that certain ones adhering to a particular religion will be saved or blessed. (In Christianity, go to heaven) 

This does not necessitate being chosen. Some would argue exclusivism based upon free will. Some one needs to change this link.

== NPOV issue in Hitler/Nazism statement ==

I'm opening a serious can of worms here...

:''The Nazis considered the Aryan race to be superior, and believed it was their mission to eliminate all races they considered &quot;inferior&quot; in the name of secular human evolution''

This statement seems to come from a creationist/anti-evolution POV. One of creationism's key arguments against evolution is that it's the &quot;basis&quot; of Nazism, Communism, &quot;moral relativism,&quot; etc. As [[skepticism|skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]] has pointed out, that's like arguing that the printing press is responsible for ''Mein Kampf''. Evolution was no doubt (mis)used to justify Hitler's ideology, but so were genetics and other sciences. Hitler's genocides weren't &quot;in the name of&quot; evolution, they were in the name of racism, white supremacism and Hitler's own perverted megalomania. [[User:Szyslak|Szyslak]] 00:11, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:And the only race they ''did'' try to wipe out was Jews, chosen not because of theories of evolution but because of longstanding ''Christian'' antipathy. Nothing in evolutionary theory, even of the most racist variety, would rationalise singling out Jews. You find it used in the late nineteenth century to justify the elimination of [[Khoisan]] peoples and [[Australian Aborigines]] as &quot;inferior&quot;, but not Jews. The Nazis never had any plans to eliminate all races other than the Aryan (however you define Aryan). [[User:Paul Barlow|Paul B]] 11:45, 20 June 2005 (UTC)

== Excised section ==
This paragraph doesn't seem to add any new information, and parts of it are unclear in their meaning. Precisely what does it mean for a movement to be &quot;untrue&quot;? The assertion that movements of all types consider themselves to be &quot;'chosen' in one way or another&quot; is also very debatable. What of atheist movements?&lt;BR&gt;
''However, it is important to distinguish between the self-importance of a movement and the truth of its message.  Movements of all types consider themselves to be &quot;chosen&quot; in one way or another to change the course of history.  Some movements may prove to be true, and some movements may prove to be false.  The truth of their message and their confidence in their message are entirely separate questions.''&lt;BR&gt;

==Jewish &quot;salvation&quot;?==
I have a problem with this part of the article: &quot;This belief is primarily rooted in the understanding that gentiles can achieve salvation just as Jews.&quot;  The problem is, &quot;salvation&quot; is a primarily Christian concept that doesn't exist in Judaism. Can someone who knows more about this topic fix this section and remove the salvation reference?  --[[User:D Monack|D Monack]] 03:33, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Salvation DOES exist in Judaism as a concept, as it says: Isaiah 43:3 &quot;For I the L-RD am your G-d, the Holy One of Israel, YOUR SAVIOR. I gave Egypt as a ransom for you, Ethiopia and Saba in exchange for you.&quot; (JPS). Christians interpret this savior as being Jesus, while traditional Jewish thinking refeers to god as the savior.
The same applies to Redeemer: Isaiah 60:16 says &quot;...And you shall know that I the L-RD [ie, HaShem] am your Saviour, I The Mighty One of Jacob, am your Redeemer.&quot;  

Salvation in the sense that a person can &quot;achieve salvation&quot; is NOT a Jewish concept. As I understand it, that kind of salvation is needed by Christians because of original sin, another concept not shared by Jews. The Israelites did not &quot;achieve salvation&quot; at the Red Sea, they were saved from the Egyptian army. 

EMV  Dec 2005

::::Some mention needs to be made that this term almost always, in American English, is slang for Jewish people.  It is such a well-known slang synonym that born-again Christians and other fundamentalist Christians even routinely joke back, &quot;No, we are the real chosen people, you guys abandoned G_D (Jesus).&quot;  This is anecdotal context and story, but the point should be clear.

== This second paragraph under Roman Catholicism ==

Jesus has never mentioned being the son of God.
&quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life, No one comes to the Father except through Me&quot;
Relation to God was established by man, we can refer to God as the creator, the father, and everything he created deserves respect. There is one simple rule everybody should practice &quot;never do to others what you do not want them to do to you&quot;
There is no chosen people, nobody has the right to pretend so, each one of us must find his own path. Life on earth is a bridge, all we have to do is cross that bridge leaving things behind as clean as possible.
Man is capable of the best and the worst, we all should focus on best and better.

== Islam ==

The treatment of Islam throughout the Wikipedia is problematic and especially so where contested topics are under discussion.

One major source of error is the failure to distinguish between &quot;Islam&quot; (more an ideal way of life, based on the Qur'an and sunnah, than a system of beliefs or philosophy) from &quot;Muslims&quot; (whose behavior exhibits great variation, in response to multiple factors that go into the making of their passions and interests). Another, to squeeze out &quot;Islamic&quot; or &quot;Muslim&quot; answers to essentially extra-Islamic questions; questions that are often phrased in terminology that defies any valid translation in the Muslim much less Islamic context.

The statement on this page that: &quot;Some Muslims believe Islam is Exclusive [sic. -- why capitalised?], and some do not&quot; needs review (as does this entire entry). Even if true, this is misleading; for Islam is no more defined by what &quot;some&quot; (how many?) Muslims believe than Judaism, Christianity, or Budhism by what some Jews, Christians, or Budhists believe. The near unanimous consensus of Muslims would be that &quot;Islam is not exclusive&quot; - in the sense that anyone can be a full and equal member of the Muslim community if she so wishes. In other words, any one who by a simple proclamation renounces all gods other than the One-God and accepts Mohammad as the messenger of the One-God -- and nothing else, becomes a full and equal member of the Muslim community.
  
    Your full and equal member of the Muslim community has several exclusivistic conditions attached. So. you have conceded that Islam is exclusivistic. Why should one renounce one's version of God handed to him/her by generations of tradition? Why should one accept Mohammed as &quot;the messenger&quot;?   &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.19.134.114|75.19.134.114]] ([[User talk:75.19.134.114|talk]]) 07:26, 30 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

In Islam there is no concept of Muslims as a chosen people (in fact, like Christianity, Islam  holds that the people of Moses, historically, were the Chosen People); instead the Qur'an speaks of &quot;mankind&quot; as a chosen creation. Unlike prophets before him, Mohammad did not address his congregation as &quot;O people of Quraysh [the tribe to which he belonged]&quot; or &quot;O people of Makkah [the city to which he belonged]&quot; but as &quot;ya ayyuha al-naas&quot; (or O members of the human race). In my view therefore all references to Islam could be deleted from this article; it doesn't belong here. No Muslim would object to this and I do not see why anyone else would!

Digression: Wiki: &quot;Exclusive - Excluding items or members that do not meet certain conditions&quot;. Thus, to say that Bolivians shall be excluded from being considered Brazilians, is not being exclusive; but to say that Bolivians shall not be eligible to become Brazilians is being exclusive. (So, the definition above should really be: &quot;Exclusive - Excluding items or members that do not meet certain conditions, that they can meet.&quot;) Two further refinements are possible. First, the conditions should not be onerous (a club that requires a million dollars as membership fee would be called exclusive, just as one with a &quot;whites only&quot; policy. Second, the membership should be full and equal (if new members are not eligible for the same privileges as old members then -- at least until they become so eligible -- then we would call this exclusion, or if they are eligible for all privileges but only in a subsidiary position to some other members then again we would call this exclusion). If this is accepted, then the definition would be: &quot;Exclusive - Excluding from full and equal inclusion items or members that do not meet certain conditions, that they can easily meet.&quot; Or some such thing.

If this is accepted, the rest of the entry (on Islam, and other statements about Islam in this article) needs to be deleted (or if you must, re-written). Also, once we agree on this meaning of exclusion, some of the statements about other religions may need further review.

:This same issue occurs throughout Wikipedia for the term Jew.  I suggest you read some of the dsicussions there as we have made changes and suggestions that seem to help.  One helpful thing is to refer to the sub groups by specific name, instead of making a hasty generalization, like stating adherents of Islam, or something like that.  At the same time, certain groups do contain macro-principles that all adherents believe.  For example, all adherents of Islam, would probably agree that Mohammed was prophet of A__ah.

==People==

Why does this article talk about groups in general? Somehow, I usually encounter the concept of &quot;chosen people&quot; as using &quot;people&quot; in reference to racial or ethnic groups, not just groups of people.  I think it is not fitting to address just about any group that thinks it is superior in some way, such as the Christian and Islamic groups considering themselves as chosen to carry the truth.  This non-ethnic religious aspect is definitely worth mention, but I feel that it does not match the meaning of the phrase very well, and such should receive mention elsewhere.  Of course, the mention of Christian-Nazi-Aryan mixes and other times where the racial aspect is tied to the religiously chosen notion should still be mentioned, since this identifies one 'people' out of the 'peoples' for some sort of divine selection.

Including all groups that feel chosen(and happen to be composed of people) makes the scope of the article wider than that of &quot;chosen people&quot; as it is commonly used.  Thus, I suggest that the parts with an indisputable ethnic/racial tie should be included, but other types(such as a religion considering itself truthful) should be relegated to another article.  So I think it just that the sections regarding Jewish, Nazi-Aryan, Christian Identity, and be kept under this name. (About LDS, I think it should also be kept since the usage is really beyond that of a general Christian group, in that it seems to imitate the original Jewish notion in many ways, such as identification of followers with tribes of Israel, and using &quot;Gentile&quot; to describe non-Mormons.)  But the inter-religious rivalry over truth alone should not be part of this article.  In my opinion, of course.

What do you all think of this proposal?

:: My responce to this anon user from over a year ago is this.  Your proposal is highly offensive and absolutely POV (see [[WP:NPOV]]) (and at the same time incorrect).  The belief in Jewish &quot;chosenness&quot; is religiously based, like Christianity and Islam, and not racial or ethnic as you try to group it as, like White Supremacists.  In case you are unaware, '''anyone''' can be come Jewish through conversion, just like any other religion, at which point they are a full Jew in every way.

==Could someone please paraphrase the following sentence, for correction of wrong translation?==

Could someone please paraphrase the following sentence, as I think there is a mistake in translation in the Japanese version of the article &quot;[http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%81%B8%E6%B0%91&amp;diff=4747454&amp;oldid=4746954 Chosen people]&quot;.

The question is that in the sentence shown at the bottom, the word &quot;nor&quot; is used to negage the noun phrase &quot;the possibility of asking to be baptized&quot;; then, what is the first instance of negation which introduded the word &quot;nor&quot;?

The paragraph in question is as follows:

&quot;Roman Catholicism had traditionally taught that all non-Christians would not be saved. Today many within the Roman Catholic Church teach that salvation is not ruled out for those who have not had the Gospel proclaimed to them, nor the possibility of asking to be baptized.&quot;

:The answer is that the negation is a reiterated one. &quot;Nor&quot; reiterates the lack of possibility of being Christianized. You shouldn't expect too much logical precision in the use of language in this arena. The common thing negated as I stated is the possibility of receiving the gospel of Jesus Christ, which apparently it is being stated that RC doctrine then does not say those who nonetheless live lives in accordance with Christian principles, though they may have lived in times and places where christian evangelism could not reach them, would still nonetheless receive salvation. I don't know if it's still the case but I believe the doctrine was that they would still have to cool their heels in purgatory while all the proper Christians were processed first. So the paraphrase would be:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Roman Catholicism had traditionally taught that all non-Christians would not be saved. Today many within the Roman Catholic Church teach that salvation is not ruled out for those who have lived in accord with the teachings of Jesus Christ whether or not they had the Gospel proclaimed to them, or had the possibility of asking to be baptized.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also it should be made clear that the RC is a monolithic top-down organization and its doctrine is not determined by what some faction believes or teaches. So the weasel wording probably can be replaced by a reference to an encyclical or bull or refuted by same.
