==Anglicanism==
Should it be mentioned in the Anglican section that the Church of England formally canonized [[St. Charles Stuart]]? I also was thinking of mentioning the [[Anglican Rosary]], [[Our Lady of Walsingham]], etc. Objections? --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 16:53, 21 July 2011 (UTC)

==Conflicting Articles==
I believe that the article concering [[Saint William of Vercelli]] and [[Saint William of Maleval]] are conflicting. They may be discussing the same person under different names as both refrence the Catholic Encyclopedia which has a tendancy to do just that. Both claim that these Saints founded the congregation of [[Mount Vergine]] or the [[Williamites]]. Furthermore when trying to access the page on Mount Vergine or the Williamites it disambiguates while the page on the Williamites states that Albert (No Surname) founded the order. [[User:Sovereignlance|Sovereignlance]] ([[User talk:Sovereignlance|talk]]) 02:58, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

==Historical Process==
The article almost completely lacks it and needs more. The original venerated saints were called martyrs because they were martyrs, not because the term changed meanings. When and under what justification did other Confessors' veneration become accepted? Until 1056, the Orthodox and Catholic churches were united. What was the practice (/were the practices) regarding saints at that time? Similarly the current Catholic policy involved for 'recognizing' saints (that theology could use a gloss of its own) has not been the historical practice at all. Previous to the High Middle Ages, canonization was administered by local bishops; the pope gradually expropriated that authority from them; but various cults have continued to be recognized on the basis of their 'antiquity' despite falling outside the guidelines. We could use some details here about how all of this has happened. -[[Special:Contributions/114.91.66.18|114.91.66.18]] ([[User talk:114.91.66.18|talk]]) 16:30, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

==Saints and justification==
The article should maybe explain the relationship between sainthood and [[justification (theology)|justification]]. The traditional belief on the subject is that saints are the ones who have received a very favourable [[particular judgement]] upon their death, and who will remain in the presence of God until judgement day. People who are not saints will not remain in the presence of God and will wander the Earth until Christ decides that it is time for the world to come to an end. Hence, only the saints have really been justified ahead of their time. [[User:ADM|ADM]] ([[User talk:ADM|talk]]) 20:31, 8 May 2009 (UTC)
:The article ''cannot'' explain the relationship between sainthood and justification, simply because both concepts which fail the Wikipedia criteria for verifiability. Belief, faith etc are no substitute for verifiability. Cite the verifiable sources for justification, the existence of saints, God, favorable judgement etc. and then all of this can be included. Otherwise it is just speculation. Faith is fine at a personal level but not in an encyclopedia which hopes to be taken seriously.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.54.27.49|78.54.27.49]] ([[User talk:78.54.27.49|talk]]) 22:56, 22 June 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:ADM, please do add this material, but when you do so remember (1) to discuss it as theology rather than fact and (2) to reference authoritative sources discussing the belief. &quot;Traditional&quot; really doesn't cut it for something that has been redefined so many times even within one faith. Ideally, find the theologian(s) responsible for the origination of the doctrine. Even if it is The Truth, it generally takes man quite a while to figure out what that is. =) -[[Special:Contributions/114.91.66.18|114.91.66.18]] ([[User talk:114.91.66.18|talk]]) 16:35, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

== Point of view ==

This article is written from a religious point of view, Since there is no evidence for the existence of God it should be written from an atheistic point of view
[[Special:Contributions/219.90.233.80|219.90.233.80]] ([[User talk:219.90.233.80|talk]]) 13:18, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

The article on capitalism should also be written from a Marxist point of view. [[User:Cfortunato|Carlo]] ([[User talk:Cfortunato|talk]]) 13:24, 29 May 2009 (UTC)
:The article is of course written, at least in part, from a religious point of view, considering the subject is a religious one, dealing with a specifically religious point of view, that being the naming of individuals as saints. It would be possibly be counterproductive to write it from an atheistic point of view, if a specific atheistic point of view could be decided upon, as doing so would very likely make it harder to understand the subject. However, if there are sufficient notable and verifiable sources regarding the subject of saints from an atheistic point of view, I can well imagine that material could be added regarding that. I would urge the IP editor in question to indicate what sources he would use for that purposes, if he wants such material to be included.

:: atheists dont necessarily believe there are no saints, just that there is no god. many atheists would say that holiness resides ENTIRELY in fellow man, not in some power above. so a section on atheism and sainthood would be a complex topic, not addressed in a single line. [[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 20:24, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

:::Which might be why you can't do it.  There is no single thing called &quot;atheism&quot; anymore than there is a single thing called &quot;theism.&quot;  It really isn't a category for this sort of article at all.  If you wanted to discuss the subject as approached by non-theistic Buddhists or secular humanists (assuming they ''have'' such an approach), that ''might'' make some sense.  But most atheists probably don't even belong to ANY definable group.  And if belief (or non-belief) groups simply ignore the subject entirely - which I think is the case with MOST atheists - there is really simply nothing to say.  

:::And in addition there is also the problem that atheists are not a religion at all.  I don't know if they can be &quot;not a religion&quot; and still treated as a defined group when discussing religions.  [[User:Cfortunato|Carlo]] ([[User talk:Cfortunato|talk]]) 22:55, 29 May 2009 (UTC)


::I think the guy was trying to make a point, and he made it poorly. His point is that the article is written from a religious point of view, and this is a bad thing because articles are meant to be factual only, and they are not meant to be written from the point of view of a belief system. His assertion that it should be written from &quot;an atheistic point of view&quot; is clearly invalid, as atheism is also a belief system.

::However, we should not lose sight of the fact that his initial point is valid: the article should not be written from the point of view that the Christian god (or Hindu gods, in the Hindu section) exist.

There is no such process in other religion, so that today's Saints are Christians. However, any human born can become a Saint by living a holy life. I strongly believe that there are many unknown Saints in other religion too. They are not revealed as there is no such process to proclaim them as Saints in their religion.

== All Christians are saints ==

In order to maintain the neutrality of Wikipedia, the article should not be biased toward the Roman Catholic view.

The Bible clearly does not say that some are saints because they were elected, and Paul's writings clearly imply that all true believers are saints.  

To check me on this, do a search on the word &quot;saint&quot; at http://www.biblegateway.com, NASB, King James, and NIV.

::The Catholic (and Orthodox, incidentally) practice of declaring  some individuals to be &quot;saints&quot; does not mean that others are not.  &quot;Saint&quot; is really an adjective - it means &quot;holy.&quot;  &quot;Hagios&quot; in Greek.  That it can be used as a title and a proper noun does not mean that it has no use as a common noun.  Like many words, it has more than a single meaning. The fact that Catholics choose to refer to (say) Paul the Apostle as &quot;The Holy Paul&quot; or &quot;Saint Paul&quot; (Hagios Paulos) does not mean that the word &quot;holy&quot; cannot also be applied, less formally, to all of the sanctified.

Please help me as I am new to all this.  Can you show me in the article where it says something like:  Many or some or all Protestants believe the Bible says all true believers are saints.

:::Under the Section headed &quot;Protestant&quot;: &quot;In many Protestant churches, the word &quot;Saint&quot; is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar in usage to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this sense, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (i.e., a professing Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Jesus.&quot; [[User:Cfortunato|Carlo]] ([[User talk:Cfortunato|talk]]) 03:41, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

== Verification needed to avoid heavy deletion ==

I have tagged a few sections which are totally without reliable sources. This makes most of the article look like a personal essay or, at best, original research [[WP:OR]] which, of course, has no place in Wikipedia. If anyone is serious about making this stuff encyclopedic, now is the time to get to work on it, otherwise the unsourced staff can and must be immediately deleted. I also tried to clean up some of the citations which '''do''' exist, eg, in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox sections. Alas, the ones I saw were not very authoritative, coming from American religious promotional sites, like Catholic Online. Oh, dear. . . They need to be replaced with something a bit better and more neutral. Cheers [[User:Bjenks|Bjenks]] ([[User talk:Bjenks|talk]]) 16:42, 1 November 2009 (UTC)
:I agree that these citations are not very good, but good Roman Catholic sources are (e.g. Catholic Encyclopedia), I think, probably acceptable for saints in the Roman Catholic church. Ditto for Orthodox sources. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 12:33, 2 November 2009 (UTC)
::Agreed.  I also think that this is the sort of article where &quot;authoritative&quot; sources are more important to find, and the issue of neutral sources is not AS important as in other articles.  Official church cites would be where to get info on the procedure for sainthood, who is considered a saint, etc., even though in other circumstances these same sources would need to be balanced.  For instance, an article on the history of a specific church should not rely on official church sources alone, or too heavily.  But here, the topic lends itself a little more to reliance on official sources.  There are parts where POV may be an issue, certainly, but not as much of a risk for most of the article.  Let's start getting reliable sources and we can bring in balance where it seems necessary and lacking.  --[[User:Anietor|anietor]] ([[User talk:Anietor|talk]]) 14:52, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

== some questions ==

I was going to specify that a person had to be dead to be a saint in the Anglican tradition, but then I became unsure if this is so. If living people may legitimately be called saints in Anglicanism, that should be made clear in the article. Where living people are sometimes referred to as saints, it should be made clear if this is simply a figure of speech, or if there is more to it than that. 

There are a quite a number of other points I think need clarification, including the difference between &quot;intercession&quot; and &quot;mediation&quot;. [[User:Myles325a|Myles325a]] ([[User talk:Myles325a|talk]]) 11:07, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

:There are two different meanings to the term &quot;saint&quot; in Anglicanism. &quot;Saint&quot; (capitol s) refers to someone who is in Heaven, whereest &quot;saints&quot;(lowercase s) are ALL Christians. The [[Low Church]] Anglicans typically only use to term to refer to christians and people on their liturgical calenders like Martin Luther King Jr. and John Wesley, but [[High Church]] Anglicans, [[Anglo-Catholics]], and members of the [[Anglican Use]] use the term to reffer to cannonized persons. --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 16:00, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

== Outline questions ==
I thought I saved this question before, so if it's a duplicate my apologies.  My question is, why are Anglicans listed at the same outline level as Protestants, incorrectly implying that they are not Protestants themselves?
Additionally, shouldn't the short general statement about some Protestant groups be put under &quot;Protestantism&quot; rather than &quot;Other Christian Groups&quot;?
I would make these edits myself, but I'm rather new to Wikipedia, and when it comes to changing the organization of an article itself (as opposed to simple correction of factual errors), I'd rather defer to more experienced editors.

:False, Anglicanism is not Protestant. The church itself declares itself &quot;Reformed Catholic&quot; and a &quot;Via Media&quot; or Midway between Catholic and Protestant. While certain members of the Anglican Communion (especially in the Episcopal Church of the United States) may identify as protestant, the church itself official holds that it is not protestant. --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 20:49, 17 October 2010 (UTC)

::I see now that I was mistaken, that the Anglican Church describes itself as not Protestant, so thank you for that clarification.  But care should be taken on your second point: Oriental Orthodox churches are NOT the same as the Eastern Orthodox Church, and if the standard is mere similarity, then the Eastern Orthodox Church has much more in common with Catholicism - all Catholics, not just Eastern rite Catholics (who anyway, are in communion with Roman Catholicism).  The member churches of the Oriental Orthodox communion do not accept the outsome of the VERY important Council of Chalcedon, while the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Churches do.

::And I have not suggested that the Church of Latter Day Saints should be included under Protestantism - in fact, I would strongly object if it was.

== Mormons ==

Mormons have been included under &quot;Other Christian groups;&quot; I fixed this, and then it was switched back. Frankly, I find that offensive.

Although Mormons claim to be Christian (indeed, to be the only Christians; all others are &quot;anathema,&quot; according to their leaders), they are very far in their beliefs from Christianity as it has been understood for the last two millennia. Their decidedly non-Christian teachings include the beliefs that men can become gods with their own planets (which makes them polytheists); that these gods are just &quot;organizers&quot; of worlds, not creators as understood by Christians; that our God was once a man; that he has a harem of wives with whom he has sex to create &quot;spirit children&quot;; that the Mormon god of this earth had sex with the Virgin Mary, from which Jesus Christ was born; that Jesus and Satan are physical brothers; that there are different heavens for different groups of people; that men - not God - decide whether or not their wives can be resurrected; and much more that is not remotely Christian. 

Christians disagree on a lot of things, but there are some basics, basics which the Mormons deny.

Mormonism may be accepted in Wikipedia under &quot;Christians,&quot; but I submit that it is due only to intense pressure from its LDS contributors, who refuse to allow corrections of any kind (even the most factual) to articles about their religion. It would be helpful if an impartial jury were to weigh the claims and beliefs of traditional Christianity with Mormonism and then make an honest decision, instead of just accepting the Mormons' word for it.

:Your opinion is merely that- an opinion. As a practicing Roman Catholic, I do not view Mormon's as Christians. However, the denomination refers to itself as Christian, and by wikipedia's policies it is to be included as part of Christianity. --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 20:57, 6 November 2010 (UTC)
:Also, keep in mind ALL the different beliefs of Christianity. It is not simply &quot;Catholic&quot;, &quot;Mormon&quot;, and &quot;Protestant&quot;. There are many different branches of [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodoxy]], [[New Age]], [[Evangelical]], etc.. all with different beliefs. Wikipedia views ALL these as Christian, regardless of what the different churches think of each other. For example, the [[Unity Church]] and [[Jehova's Witnesses]] have doctrines that are contradictory to the doctrines of say, the Lutheran, Catholic, or Baptist churches, but they are also considered Christian on Wikipedia. --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 21:00, 6 November 2010 (UTC)
::Thank you for the response, Willthacheerleader18. I know that there are many &quot;different beliefs of Christianity;&quot; I am an Anglican who doesn't much care to be classified as a Protestant! But really, there are still basic beliefs that all Christians, from Roman Catholics to Baptists, recognize and share - and that's not just an opinion. I would start with the fundamental Christian belief in ONE God in Three Persons (not a &quot;plurality of gods&quot;) who is the Creator of heaven and Earth, and, indeed, of all things. You really can't be a polytheist and be a Christian, and Wikipedia is taking the easy - but wrong - way out by allowing Mormons to force their way into inclusion.

:There are three senses of the word Christian that seem relevant to this conversation.
:#One is that of being based on the teachings of Christ (e.g. Christian teachings, Christian theology, Christian belief), something which is hard for a neutral encyclopedia to decide.  '''This can be documented and sourced, but only with reference to a Christian group's [[WP:POV|POV]]'''.  In order to do this, we could assert a [[WP:N|notable]] group's opinion about the subject of the article, but to avoid [[WP:UNDUE]] that has to be balanced against other notable POVs and cannot be asserted as fact by the encyclopedia.  {{see also|Christian denomination#Differences of opinion regarding the definition of Christianity}}
:#Another is the adjective sense of having a character or quality similar to or derived from Christianity (e.g. a Christian name, a Christian architecture, a Christian culture) which is easier to do without controversy.  It may help to view their inclusion here as an indication of having been ''influenced'' by Christianity, or of having been an offshoot thereof.  '''As a matter of historical record, this can generally be documented and sourced without regard to POV.'''  However, there are cases where we may have to simply source the subject group when it says it was inspired by something related to Christianity.  
:#A third sense would be that given above, that is, self-identity; anyone who says they are a Christian would be Christian.  While it may be the easiest of the three to document, it does reflect a POV - the person's view of themselves.  It also provides the least amount of information to the reader.  Alas, I cannot make myself a [[|House of Windsor|Windsor]] by saying I am such, nor can I become an [[Orthodox Jew]] by proclaiming, however stubbornly, that I am -- they would not accept that I had anything to do with them and I show nothing of having been influenced by them.  [[Idi Amin]] could not make himself the [[Last King of Scotland]], and no one reputable is about to assert that he was anything more than a pretender.  Hence, I don't believe that self-identity really tells the reader anything meaningful other than the subject's view of themselves, ''which certainly merits inclusion in an article about that subject'', but to avoid [[WP:UNDUE]] we would also have to balance it with others' view of the subject person/group/denomination.  '''The only way to document and source the third sense is in reference to the subject's POV of themselves''' which is generally not that objective.
:In my opinion, to some extent Wikipedia '''should''' be taking '''all three approaches''', as each provides distinct information to the reader.  Articles about subjects ARE allowed (indeed encouraged) to document both the group's POV about themselves, and other notable POVs about the group.  However, if forced to choose between senses (e.g. in the case of a category or section heading) the second sense may be the best combination of easy to cite, NPOV, and informative to the reader.  I would support possibly renaming such categories (e.g. &quot;Christianity-influenced&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;Christian-umbrella&quot;) to make it clear which sense is being used.
:I'd be curious as to whether there are any existing consensus or Wikipedia policies that help us to travel the narrow road between a meaningless definition and a [[No True Scotsman]] fallacy.

::Thank you, Joren. I would definitely agree with Mormonism being &quot;Christianity-influenced,&quot; as Christianity and Islam are Jewish-influenced. But Christians and Muslims would be subject to severe correction if they claimed to be Jews on that basis. Mormons should be equally subject to correction when they claim to be Christian.
::FyzixFighter, the problem with your so-called &quot;non-partisan/neutral reliable sources&quot; is that they are all simply relying on the Mormons' POV of themselves, and, no doubt, the usual high-powered objections from Mormons if they're put into a non-Christian category.. (I do note that ARS has diplomatically placed Mormonism between the Christian groups and the non-Christian same.) Therefore, as a determinant of whether or not Mormons can legitimately claim to be Christians, they are pretty much worthless.

:::&quot;as a determinant of whether or not Mormons can legitimately claim to be Christians&quot;...  that's the thing.  As an encyclopedia, we're not really in a good place to make that determination.  All we can do is report on what others have said about the topic, and decide for our own project how best to organize these religions (e.g. what section to put them under).  I prefer #2 as a solution that might be more defensible, informative, and less prone to controversy, but others have other opinions.  We are (thankfully) not the decider of what is and isn't true.

They may only worship the god of this planet, but they believe that many, many other gods exist, just as ancient pagans acknowledged lots of different gods but usually only worshipped the deities specific to their own districts.

== Afro-American Religion ==
Should ''Afro-American Religion'' be considered a sect of Christianity/offshoot of Christianity or not? I know it includes tribal African rituals and beliefs, but it has combined them with Christian (particularly Catholic) beliefs.

== Japanese use of the term ==

Originally the term &quot;Saint&quot; comes from Latin and was exclusively used by the Catholic Church; then later other Christian churches. There emerged a disconnect when its use was extended to other religions, and another when the word is used as a [[calque]] and shoved back to the countries that still primarily maintain the Judeo-Christian use. 

The Japanese have a different concept of gods and of their servants, and their story-telling practices are patterned on this unconscious paradigm. Japanese gods are supernatural immortals who do not have absolute power over a domain of nature such as Neptune purportedly had over the sea (and horses and earthquakes); their servants have super-powers and battle demons and each other similarly as in the Chinese WUXIA martial-arts movies (running up the sides of buildings and jumping from roof to roof). The proper term for these combatants is &quot;heroes&quot;; they're actually demigods like the literal hero Hercules, who do things like the twelve labors of Hercules; they're not role-models or persons to pray to. 

Thus one Japanese anime literally was given the name [[Saint Seiya]] and the officials of various European countries (France, Italy) could not stand the immediate word-for-word translation and had to call this &quot;Knights of Olympus&quot;.

== Alphabetical order? ==
I do not think the exact alphabetical order is a good idea. &quot;Other Christian Beliefs&quot; should be at the end of the list.

:Alphabetical order is for the sake of neutrality. It minimizes the issue of undue weight. To treat &quot;Other&quot; as less important nullifies the reason for neutral alphabetical order.

[[File:Saints of the Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|File:Saints of the Catholic Church.jpg]]
The creator doubtless meant well. But this collection of old images from Wikimedia has a clumsy layout. There is no key to identify who's who. With maybe one or two exceptions the artists had no idea what the saints looked like, and were just drawing from imagination or a model. The image just doesn't have any informational value. If folks want more pictures I suggest using photographs or paintings from life of saints. There have been enough saints in the past 200 years that there are no lack of actual images.

== Saint? ==

I'm starting to wonder if this article should even be titled &quot;saint&quot;.  Dictionary.com defines a saint as such:

saint   [seynt]  Show IPA
noun
1.
any of certain persons of exceptional holiness of life, formally recognized as such by the Christian Church, especially by canonization.
2.
a person of great holiness, virtue, or benevolence.
3.
a founder, sponsor, or patron, as of a movement or organization.
4.
(in certain religious groups) a designation applied by the members to themselves.

��–(http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/saint)

This article defines a saint as &quot;a holy person, who becomes a religious hero by exemplifying a virtue or virtues of his or her religion&quot;.  This definition is extremely broad and is closest in meaning to dictionary.com's second definition but in a religious context.  This is misleading, because I'm certainly not the only one who thinks of a saint as either a Christian saint or as someone who is very virtuous NOT in a Christian (or any other religious) context.

I think this article should be split or its title revised to maintain neutrality and avoid confusion.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Blocky1OOO|Blocky1OOO]] ([[User talk:Blocky1OOO|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Blocky1OOO|contribs]]) 19:13, 12 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Aaron as a &quot;saint&quot;. ==

The article quotes the Christian Bible as saying: &quot;They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the Lord.&quot;  Though this is true, the translation itself is misleading.  The '''original''' (Hebrew) text reads: 'ויקנאו למשה במחנה לאהרן קדוש ה, meaning, &quot;They envied Moses in the camp and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.&quot;  This merely refers to Aaron being the High Priest, not, as this translation may, in the context of this article, lead people to believe, to him being someone deemed a saint by the Church or someone often referred to as a saint, neither of which he is.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Blocky1OOO|Blocky1OOO]] ([[User talk:Blocky1OOO|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Blocky1OOO|contribs]]) 19:36, 12 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Not sure where to ask this question, but... ==

I noticed in almost every article on Wikipedia about a saint (exs: [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Patrick of Ireland]]) the title of the article does not use the designation &quot;Saint&quot; or &quot;St.&quot; I know it was (sort of) discussed on [[Talk:Thomas Aquinas]], but I never found a resolution to the discussion. Is giving the title &quot;Saint&quot; to someone really that big a deal? We don't ask people on the page [[Buddha]] to rename it Siddhartha Gautama, even though Buddha is also an honorific title; yet because it is the name by which people know Siddhartha, we retain the name Buddha. A lot of these saints are always referred to as Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], or Saint [[Augustine]]; and never by just their names alone. Isn't it odd that we consider it POV just to use the common title of these people? Or (sort of related to the topic) referring to &quot;Mahatma&quot; Gandhi as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]; why on earth would we not just use Mahatma, the title everyone has heard of? Does it mean &quot;Great Soul&quot;? Yes. Does that technically give the title a POV? Yes, but does that mean we should avoid the common usage? I would say no. If anyone could direct me to the debate about this, it would be much appreciated.
