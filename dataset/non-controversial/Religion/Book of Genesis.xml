{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Genesis''' (from the Latin [[Vulgate]], in turn borrowed or transliterated from [[Greek language|Greek]] γένεσις, meaning &quot;origin&quot;; {{lang-he|בְּרֵאשִׁית}}, ''Bereʾšyt'', &quot;In [the] beginning&quot;), is the first book of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the [[Tanakh]]) and the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (1990), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic [[narrative]] expresses the central theme: God [[Creation according to Genesis|creates]] the world and appoints man as his regent, but man proves disobedient and God destroys his world through the Flood. The new post-Flood world is equally corrupt, but God does not destroy it, instead calling one man, Abraham, to be the seed of its salvation. At God's command Abraham descends from his home into the land of Canaan, given to him by God, where he dwells as a sojourner, as does his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and through the agency of his son Joseph, the [[children of Israel]] descend into Egypt, 70 people in all with their households, and God promises them a future of greatness. Genesis ends with Israel in Egypt, ready for the coming of [[Moses]] and [[the Exodus]]. The narrative is punctuated by a series of covenants with God, successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the covenant with Noah) to a special relationship with one people alone (Abraham and his descendants through Isaac and Jacob).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bandstra28-29&quot;/&gt;

The book's author or authors appear to have structured it around ten &quot;[[toledot]]&quot; sections (the &quot;these are the generations of...&quot; phrases), but many modern commentators see it in terms of a &quot;primeval history&quot; (chapters 1–11) followed by the cycle of Patriarchal stories (chapters 12–50).&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Deurloo (2004), pp.3–7&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] alike, the theological importance of Genesis centers on the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenants]] linking [[God]] to his [[Chosen People]] and the people to the [[Promised Land]]. Christianity has interpreted Genesis as the prefiguration of certain cardinal Christian beliefs, primarily the need for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] (the hope or [[Assurance (theology)|assurance]] of all Christians) and the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redemptive act]] of [[Christ]] on the Cross as the [[Supersessionism|fulfillment]] of covenant promises as the [[Son of God]]. Tradition credits [[Moses]] as the author of Genesis, [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[book of Numbers|Numbers]] and most of [[Deuteronomy]], but modern scholars increasingly see it as a product of the 6th and 5th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Van Seters (1998), p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies37&quot;&gt;Davies (1998), p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Genesis appears to be structured around the recurring phrase ''elleh toledot'', meaning &quot;these are the generations,&quot; with the first use of the phrase referring to the &quot;generations of heaven and earth&quot; and the remainder marking individuals—Noah, the &quot;sons of Noah&quot;, Shem, etc., down to Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (1990), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear, however, what this meant to the original authors, and most modern commentators divide it into two parts based on subject matter, a &quot;primeval history&quot; (chapters 1–11) and a &quot;patriarchal history&quot; (chapters 12–50).&lt;ref&gt;Whybray (1998), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; While the first is far shorter than the second, it sets out the basic themes and provides an interpretive key for understanding the entire book.&lt;ref&gt;McKeown (2008), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;primeval history&quot; has a symmetrical structure hinged around chapter 6–9, the flood story, with the events before the flood mirrored by the events after.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2001), p.112&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;patriarchal history&quot; recounts the events of the major patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to whom God reveals himself and to whom the promise of descendants and land is made, while the story of Joseph serves to take the Israelites into Egypt in preparation for the next book, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].

==Summary==
[[God in Judaism|God]] creates the world in six days and consecrates the seventh after giving mankind his first commandment: &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot;. God pronounces the world &quot;very good&quot;, but it becomes corrupted by the sin of man and God sends a [[Deluge myth|deluge]] (a great flood) to destroy it, saving only the righteous ([[Noah]]) and his family, from whose seed the world is repopulated. Man sins again, but God has promised that he will not destroy the world a second time with water.

God instructs Abram (the future [[Abraham]]) to travel from his home in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) to the land of [[Canaan]]. There God makes a covenant with Abram promising that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars in the heavens, but that they shall suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years, after which they shall inherit the land &quot;from the [[river of Egypt]] to the great river, the river [[Euphrates]].&quot; Abram's name is changed to Abraham and that of his wife Sarai to Sarah, and [[circumcision]] of all males is instituted as the sign of the covenant.

Sarah is barren, and tells Abraham to take her Egyptian handmaiden, [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], as a concubine. Through Hagar, Abraham becomes the father of [[Ishmael]]. Abraham asks God that Ishmael &quot;might live in Thy sight,&quot; (that is, be favored), but God replies that Sarah will bear a son, who will be named [[Isaac]], through whom the covenant will be established. At Sarah's insistence Ishmael and his mother Hagar are driven out into the wilderness, but God saves them and promises to make Ishmael a great nation.

God resolves to destroy the city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] for the sins of its people. Abraham protests that it is not just &quot;to slay the righteous with the wicked,&quot; and asks if the whole city can be spared if even ten righteous men are found there. God replies: &quot;For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.&quot; Abraham's nephew [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] is saved from the destruction of Sodom, and through incest with his daughters becomes the ancestor of the [[Moabites]] and [[Ammon (nation)|Ammonites]].

God tests Abraham by demanding that he [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice Isaac]]. As Abraham is about to lay the knife upon his son, God restrains him, promising him numberless descendants. On the death of Sarah, Abraham purchases [[Machpelah]] (modern [[Hebron]]) for a family tomb and sends his servant to Mesopotamia to find among his relations a wife for Isaac, and Rebekah is chosen. Other children are born to Abraham by another wife, Keturah, among whose descendants are the Midianites, and he dies in a prosperous old age and is buried in his tomb at [[Hebron]].

Isaac's wife [[Rebekah]] is barren, but Isaac prays to God and she gives birth to the twins [[Esau]], father of the [[Edom]]ites, and [[Jacob]].  Through deception, Jacob becomes the heir instead of Esau and gains his father's blessing.  He flees to his uncle where he prospers and earns his two wives.   Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and by his wives [[Rachel]] and [[Leah]] and their handmaidens he has twelve sons, the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel.

Joseph, Jacob's favourite son, is sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers. But Joseph prospers, and when famine comes he brings his father and his brothers and their households, seventy persons in all, to Egypt, where Pharaoh assigns to them the [[land of Goshen]]. Jacob calls his sons to his bedside and reveals their future to them before he dies and is interred in the family tomb at Machpelah. Joseph lives to see his great-grandchildren, and on his death-bed he exhorts his brethren, if God should remember them and lead them out of the country, to take his bones with them. The book ends with Joseph's remains being &quot;put in a coffin in Egypt.&quot;

==Composition==
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Abram's Journey from Ur to Canaan (József Molnár, 1850)]]

===Origins===
For much of the 20th century most scholars agreed that the five books of the [[Pentateuch]]—Genesis, [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]—came from four sources, the [[Yahwist]], the [[Elohist]], the [[Deuteronomist]] and the [[Priestly source]], each telling the same basic story, and joined together by various editors.&lt;ref&gt;Gooder (2000), pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s there has been a revolution in scholarship: the Elohist source is now widely regarded as no more than a variation on the Yahwist, while the Priestly source is increasingly seen not as a document but as a body of revisions and expansions to the Yahwist (or &quot;non-Priestly&quot;) material. (The Deuteronomistic source does not appear in Genesis).&lt;ref&gt;Van Seters (2004), pp. 30–86&lt;/ref&gt;

In composing the Patriarchal history the Yahwist drew on four separate blocks of traditional stories about Abraham, Jacob, Judah and Joseph, combining them with genealogies, itineraries and the &quot;promise&quot; theme to create a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Van Seters (1998), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when composing the &quot;primeval history&quot; he drew on Greek and Mesopotamian sources, editing and adding to them to create a unified work that fit his theological agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Van Seters (1992), pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; The Yahwistic work was then revised and expanded into the final edition by the authors of the Priestly source.&lt;ref&gt;Van Seters (2004) p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

This leaves the question of when these works were created. Scholars in the first half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that the Yahwist was produced in the monarchic period, specifically at the court of Solomon, and the Priestly work in the middle of the 5th century BC (the author was even identified as [[Ezra]]), but more recent thinking is that the Yahwist was written either just before or during the [[Babylonian exile]] of the 6th century, and the Priestly final edition was made late in the Exilic period or soon after.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies37&quot;/&gt;

As for why the book was created, a theory which has gained considerable interest, although still controversial is &quot;Persian imperial authorisation&quot;. This proposes that the Persians, after their conquest of Babylon in 538&amp;nbsp;BC, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single law code accepted by the entire community. The two powerful groups making up the community—the priestly families who controlled the Temple and who traced their foundation-myth to Moses and the wilderness wanderings, and the major landowning families who made up the &quot;elders&quot; and who traced their own origins to Abraham, who had &quot;given&quot; them the land—were in conflict over many issues, and each had its own &quot;history of origins&quot;, but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text.&lt;ref&gt;Ska (2006), pp.169, 217–218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genre===
Genesis is perhaps best seen as an example of &quot;antiquarian history&quot;, a type of literature telling of the first appearance of humans, the stories of ancestors and heroes, and the origins of culture, cities and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Van Seters (2004) pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable examples are found in the work of Greek historians of the 6th century BC: their intention was to connect notable families of their own day to a distant and heroic past, and in doing so they did not distinguish between myth, legend, and facts.&lt;ref&gt;Whybray (2001), p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Jean-Louis Ska of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] calls the basic rule of the antiquarian historian the &quot;law of conservation&quot;: everything old is valuable, nothing is eliminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ska169&quot;&gt;Ska (2006), p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Ska also points out the purpose behind such antiquarian histories: antiquity is needed to prove the worth of Israel's traditions to the nations (the neighbours of the Jews in early Persian Palestine), and to reconcile and unite the various factions within Israel itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ska169&quot;/&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Bourgeois Joseph recognized by his brothers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joseph recognized by his brothers (Léon Pierre Urbain Bourgeois, 1863)]]

===Promises to the ancestors===
In 1978 David Clines published his influential ''The Theme of the Pentateuch'' – influential because he was one of the first to take up the question of the theme of the entire five books. Clines' conclusion was that the overall theme is &quot;the partial fulfillment – which implies also the partial nonfulfillment – of the promise to or blessing of the Patriarchs.&quot; (By calling the fulfillment &quot;partial&quot; Clines was drawing attention to the fact that at the end of Deuteronomy the people are still outside Canaan).&lt;ref&gt;Clines (1997), p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]], or ancestors, are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, with their wives (Joseph is normally excluded).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton50&quot;&gt;Hamilton (1990), p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Through the patriarchs God announces the election of Israel, meaning that he has chosen Israel to be his special people and committed himself to their future.&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann (2002), p.61&lt;/ref&gt; God tells the patriarchs that he will be faithful to their descendants (i.e. to Israel), and Israel is expected to have faith in God and his promise. (&quot;Faith&quot; in the context of Genesis and the Hebrew bible means agreement to the promissory relationship, not a body of belief).&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann (2002), p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

The promise itself has three parts: offspring, blessings, and land.&lt;ref&gt;McKeown (2008), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The fulfilment of the promise to each patriarch depends on having a male heir, and the story is constantly complicated by the fact that each prospective mother – [[Sarah]], [[Rebekah]] and [[Rachel]] – is barren. The ancestors, however, retain their faith in God and God in each case gives a son – in Jacob's case, twelve sons, the foundation of the chosen [[Israelites]]. All three promises are more richly fulfilled in each succeeding generation, until through Joseph &quot;all the world&quot; is saved from famine,&lt;ref&gt;Wenham (2003), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; and by bringing the children of Israel down to Egypt he becomes the means through which the promise can be fulfilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton50&quot;/&gt;

===God's chosen people===
Scholars generally agree that the theme of divine promise unites the patriarchal cycles, but many would dispute the idea that a single theme (or theology) runs through Genesis – a theology of the Abraham cycle or the Jacob cycle or the Joseph cycle might be possible, or a theology of the [[Yahwist]] or the [[Priestly source]], but not a single theology or overarching theme for all of Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (1990), pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; The problem lies in finding a way to unite the patriarchal theme of divine promise to the primeval history, with its theme of God's continuing mercy in the face of man's sinful nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;KuglerHartin9&quot;&gt;Kugler, Hartin (2009), p.9&lt;/ref&gt; One solution is to see the patriarchal stories as resulting from God's decision not to remain alienated from mankind:&lt;ref name=&quot;KuglerHartin9&quot;/&gt; God creates the world and mankind, mankind rebels, and God &quot;elects&quot; (chooses) Abraham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bandstra28-29&quot;&gt;Bandstra (2004), pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

To this basic plot (which comes from the [[Yahwist]]) the [[Priestly source]] has added a series of [[covenant (biblical)|covenants]] dividing history into stages, each with its own distinctive &quot;sign&quot;. The [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|first covenant]] is between God and all living creatures, and is marked by the sign of the rainbow; the second is with the descendants of Abraham ([[Ishmaelites]] and others as well as Israelites), and its sign is [[Brit milah|circumcision]]; and the last, which doesn't appear until the [[book of Exodus]], is with Israel alone, and its sign is [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]. Each covenant is mediated by a great leader ([[Noah]], Abraham, [[Moses]]), and at each stage God progressively reveals himself by his name ([[Elohim]] with Noah, [[El Shaddai]] with Abraham, [[Yahweh]] with Moses).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bandstra28-29&quot;/&gt;
