The Iyanjfa do not exist, it is a mistake, a woman cannot have the IFA knowledge because only Orunmila received it and he got it from Odu itself. As it was explained before the woman have a womb so it cannot be a babalawo because she cannot receive Odu. Baba Eyiogbe Ito Lesese.


== Deleting Relevant Link to Ifa page==
We have re-added the link which was deleted to the &quot;''Afa in Mami Wata Yeveh Vodoun'' page.&quot; It was listed under &quot;''External References''.&quot; We do not understand why our link was omitted. It is we who have contributed the crucial information on the Ewe global aspects of Afa/Ifa, as well as the chart on Afa of the Ewe. The Ewe have a different legitimate historical perspective on the origins of Afa which is important to include if we are to finally gain a full understanding of this important system of divination. Our house consist of native Africa Ewe priest and Bokonos who know their own history. Please do not just accept our contributions to this article, but omit our resource as an important reference.

== Deleting changes made to Ifa page==
We have made what we believe are important contributions to the Ifa page, yet they are 
automatically deleted (reverted) without cause. 

The Ewe of Togo, West Africa and Southern Ghana and Benin also practice the '''same system''' known as Afa or AFÁ-DU, in which the vodou dieites and ancestors speak. Divination is performed by  specialized priests or priestesses of Afa  known as ''Bokonos'' or ''Afavis''. Afa is inextricably tied to the West African &amp; Diaspora Vodoun religion. This historical fact is crucial in understanding that this system of divination (of whom the Ewe possess their own mythology 
of its origins), is utilized by many West African groups in which their own gods speak, and are not exclusive to only the ''Orisha''. The references below support this historical fact, and should not be excluded.  ''In the spirit of historical accuracy '' Anagossii --MWHS 13:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

Should [[hexadecimal]] be mentioned?

==Names==
The names of the different numbers of shells should be checked.  This website is saying something different than what we have: http://www.geocities.com/revhyperion/growth_diloggun.html

:The names were originally taken directly from the Bascom book.  In a subject like this, variations are perhaps to be expected.  [[User:Ihcoyc|Smerdis of Tlön]] 22:34, 30 April 2006 (UTC)


In response to your discovery, it should be noted that some of the names for the meridilogun and the odu ifa are different, but the corresponding odu for the name differences are the same.
Also, for the cuban diloggun, when the odu 13-16 (i have to look up the names) fall, the client is told to consult ifa because no more information can be yielded from the meridilogun.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.184.95.57|74.184.95.57]] ([[User talk:74.184.95.57|talk]]) 22:45, 2 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Babalawo Training ==

It is very important to discuss Ifa divination from a post-structural view.  The traditions and cultural practices associated with this world view have changed over time, and acknowledgment of the transformations is essential when defining and contextualizing Ifa divination.  For example, the training of babalawo is not necessarily the same in all geographical and/or cultural contexts.  From some points of view, training is only fulfilled when the trainee memorizes all ese (i.e., verses) associated with all 256 Odu.  This may take up to sixteen years of rigorous training during which the trainee must pass a series of oral exams.  

There is also a difference between a trained babalawo and a diviner through inheritance.  A son of a babalawo may inherit the opele (divining chain).  Because of his lack of training, he is only supposed to divine for his immediate family members.  

The concept of ignorance and humble wisdom are both important traits of a babalawo, but, again, this depends on the specific time and place where Ifa divination is being practiced.

For more information, see Bade Ajayi, ''Ifa Divination: Its Practice Among the Yoruba of Nigeria'' (Illorin, Nigeria: UNILORIN Press, 1996).

== About deleting links to West African Ifa Tradition sites as well as those representatives of Afa and Fa and the misinformation about iyanifa ==

It is shocking that Mami Wata's contribution was deleted. It is equally disgusting that only Lucumi practitioners seem to have the &quot;authority&quot; to post and edit on this section about Ifa. This shows a completely biased presentation of a world-wide spiritual tradition to only favor the Lucumi or cuban expression of Ifa. Then the other expressions of Ifa divination and spiritual practice from other parts of West Africa that are non-Yoruba are also omitted and/or deleted as if they don't exist. This is deplorable behavior.

The topic of iyanifa is again used as a weapon to create oneupmanship.  The Lucumi tradition does not have nor believe in the existence of iyanifa.  That is fine and it is well accepted.  But the Lucumi community has no jurisdiction in judging the practices of Ifa of West African Orisa Tradition.  Even the views of the Araba of Ode Remo with regards to women's supposed exclusion in Ifa has been disproven, at least in other neighboring towns, in other parts of Ijebuland.  And in fact there are written references to female Ifa priests for about a century of ethnographic writings in West Africa.  Its not only unwise to cherry-pick in this instance, but it is a twisting of the truth.

ALL of the external sites direct one to personal websites, without exception. So why the double standard with sites that represent West African Ifa tradition by folks that are actually initiated and trained in West Africa? Why is it that those sites that can provide a great service by educating our communities about Fa of Benin Republic and Afa of Togo are not allowed to post. This is clear bigotry and ethnocentrism. Again, reprehensible conduct.
