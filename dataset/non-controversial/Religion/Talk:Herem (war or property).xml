'''No consensus''' to move. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 03:43, 19 November 2011 (UTC)

[[Herem]] → [[suitable English term]] - options include &quot;genocide&quot; &quot;total destruction&quot; &quot;total war&quot; etc – not sure what may not be the best final English destination, but per [[WP:EN]] and [[WP:RS]] has for the time being to be better than 3 forks on 3 variant spellings of 1 Hebrew noun. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 18:22, 11 November 2011 (UTC)
:::Evidently it's true to recognise that the Hebrew word, under the spelling ''herem'', has some currency as a [[terminus technicus]] in many scholarly sources [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=herem+deuteronomy&amp;num=10&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_sdt=1.&amp;as_sdtp=on&amp;as_sdtf=&amp;as_sdts=5&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;hl=en input ''herem'' + deuteronomy into Google Scholar for example]. But when we get down to a broader selection of WP:RS, i.e. the bottom end of Google Scholar and more of Google Books, the discussion of the topic defaults to more normal English terms [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22men+and+women%2C+children+and+infants%22+bible+-herem&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 such as illustrated by &quot;men and women, children and infant&quot; +Bible -herem  in Google Scholar] or [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22do+not+spare+them%22+bible+-herem&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 &quot;do not spare them&quot; in G S] or indeed something simple like [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=genocide+canaanite&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 genocide +canaanite in Google Scholar]. 
:::Back to Google Books, to establish how common the Hebrew term ''herem'' is, is fairly simple:
:::*[http://www.google.co.uk/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22to+death+men+and+women%22+bible&amp;num=10 &quot;to death men and women&quot; +Bible ] = 565
:::*[http://www.google.co.uk/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22to+death+men+and+women%22+bible+-herem&amp;num=10 &quot;to death men and women&quot; +Bible -herem] = 558
:::565 -558 = 7, or 1.5% of references use &quot;herem&quot; in explanation of &quot;to death men and women&quot; + Bible. And this 1.5% includes many examples of &quot;in the Hebrew the word is ''herem'' which means...&quot; which cannot be counted as an English word, even as a terminus technicus.
:::For another example:
:::*[http://www.google.co.uk/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=amalekites+herem&amp;num=10 Amalekites + herem] =&quot;abut 3,700&quot;
:::*[http://www.google.co.uk/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=amalekites+destruction+OR+extermination+OR+genocide&amp;num=10 Amalekites +extermination OR genocide OR destruction] =&quot;about 51,800&quot;
:::It's really this, the 3,700 vs 51,800 (and yes these are long tail estimates) which indicate that English words such as &quot;extermination&quot; &quot;genocide&quot; &quot;destruction&quot; are 10x more common than the Hebrew term in reference to the Amalekites, and again, these sources include a large number of &quot;in the Hebrew the term is ''herem'', which cannot be counted.
:::Per [[WP:EN]] the default should be to use an English term where one is available. Here several English options are available, not least that English language general practice - including modern scholarly translations such as NRSV NJB NJPS do not [[transliterate]] herem but [[translate]]. Fiddling around with the &quot;version&quot; key [http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2764&amp;t=KJV linked to Gesenius' Lexicon entry for herem on this website] shows the noun form being translated into English, not transliterated. Same for [http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2763&amp;t=KJV the verb form].[[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 03:32, 12 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. It's all very well to say &quot;per [[WP:RS]]&quot;, but what are these sources? The phrase &quot;total war&quot; doesn't even appear in the article. But ''herem'' is the word consistently used in scholarly articles, such as 
**Lilley, J. P. U. &quot;Understanding the herem,&quot; ''[[Tyndale Bulletin]]'' 44 [1993] 171-173.
**Monroe, Lauren. &quot;Israelite, Moabite and Sabaean war-hērem traditions and the forging of national identity: reconsidering the Sabaean text RES 3945 in light of biblical and Moabite evidence,&quot; ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'', 57 no 3 2007, p 318-341. 
**Wiley, Henriette L. &quot;The war hērem as martial ritual service and sacrifice,&quot; in ''Proceedings - Eastern Great Lakes and Midwest Biblical Societies'', 25 2005, p 69-76.  
**Gangloff, Frédéric. &quot;Joshua 6: Holy war or extermination by divine command (herem),&quot; ''Theological Review'', 25 no 1 Ap 2004, p 3-23.

::It might have been better if these moves had been proposed using [[WP:RM]]. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 05:55, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
::: There was discussion at [[Talk:Herem (priestly gift)]], and [[WT:JUDAISM]] also mentioned the subject. There was no reason to seek input from outside WikiProject Judaism, and Lisa was justified and correct in making the moves she did. In addition, there is a saying that says: do not wave your fist after the fight. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 15:57, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
::::Hi Debresser, no I'm not making a fuss (do you see me reverting?), and this actually seems to a be a reasonable set of moves, but at the very least it could have been at least hinted at on the Talk pages - before or after - given a series of merge/RM discussions on all 3 of these. 
::::Btw I'm curious, I've never heard of [http://www.google.com/search?q=do+not+wave+your+fist+after+the+fight&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=YTv&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB%3Aofficial&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22do+not+wave+your+fist+after+the+fight%22&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=%22wave+your+fist+after+the+fight%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=15395l18788l0l19100l2l2l0l0l0l0l149l291l0.2l2l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=269758b386fe387a&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=739 do not wave your fist after the fight], where does this saying originate from and what does it mean? :) [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 03:11, 11 December 2011 (UTC)
::::: It is a Russian saying, после драки кулаками не машут (as referred to in the third link in that search). Meaning that it is bad style to argue post factum. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 03:18, 11 December 2011 (UTC)
:::::: For what it is worth, I agree that Lisa was quite bold in making those mo0ves, and they surprised me as well. But she made the right choices, and applied WP:BOLD a the right time and in the right situation, and I for one agree with her on this one. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 04:00, 11 December 2011 (UTC)
:::::::Re the Russian phrase, searches show up differently depending on Google users. I hear what you're saying and you're welcome to agree, still in view of the recent merge/RM discussions on these 3 articles I stand by the observation &quot;It might have been better if these moves had been proposed using [[WP:RM]].&quot; Or at least mentioned on Talk. It's an observation. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 04:07, 11 December 2011 (UTC)</text>
