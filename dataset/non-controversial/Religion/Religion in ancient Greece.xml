{{Ancient Greek religion}}
'''Greek religion''' encompasses the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in [[ancient Greece]] in the form of both popular public religion and [[cult (religion)|cult practices]]. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of ''Greek religions'' or &quot;cults&quot; in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to other islands.

Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hades]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Ares]], [[Dionysus]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Athena]], [[Hermes]], [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]] and [[Hera]] though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with [[epithet]]s that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

The religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of [[Ionia]] in [[Asia Minor]], to [[Magna Graecia]] (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as [[Massalia]] (Marseille). Greek religion was tempered by [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan cult and belief]] to form much of the later [[Ancient Roman religion]].

==Beliefs==
[[File:Bust of Zeus.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Zeus, the king of the gods, and controller of thunder and the sky.]]
While there were few concepts universal to all the Greek peoples, there were common beliefs shared by many.

===Theology===
Ancient Greek [[theology]] was based on [[polytheism]]; that is, the assumption that there were many gods and goddesses. There was a hierarchy of deities, with [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, having a level of control over all the others, although he was not omnipotent. Some deities had dominion over certain aspects of [[nature]]. For instance, Zeus was the sky-god, sending thunder and lightning, [[Poseidon]] ruled over the [[sea]] and [[earthquakes]], Hades projected his remarkable power throughout the realms of death and the Underworld, and [[Helios]] controlled the [[sun]]. Other deities ruled over an abstract concept; for instance [[Aphrodite]] controlled [[love]].

While being immortal, the gods were not [[omnipotence|all powerful]]. They had to obey [[destiny|fate]], which overrode all. For instance, in mythology, it was [[Odysseus]]' fate to return home to [[Ithaca]] after the [[Trojan War]], and the gods could only lengthen his journey and make it harder for him, but they could not stop him.
[[File:Aphrodite swan BM D2.jpg|thumb|left|Aphrodite riding a swan: Attic white-ground red-figured ''[[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'', ca. 460, found at Kameiros (Rhodes)]]
The gods acted like humans, and had human [[vice]]s. They would interact with humans, sometimes even spawning children with them. At times certain gods would be opposed to others, and they would try to outdo each other. In the [[Iliad]] Zeus, Aphrodite, Ares and Apollo support the Trojan side in the [[Trojan War]], while Hera, Athena and Poseidon support the Greeks (see [[theomachy]]).

Some gods were specifically associated with a certain city. Athena was associated with the city of [[Athens]], Apollo with [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], Zeus with [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and Aphrodite with [[Corinth]]. Other deities were associated with nations outside of Greece; Poseidon was associated with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Troy]], and Ares with [[Thrace]].

Identity of names was not a guarantee of a similar [[cult]]us; the Greeks themselves were well aware that the Artemis worshipped at Sparta, the virgin huntress, was a very different deity from the Artemis who was a many-breasted [[fertility rite|fertility goddess]] at [[Ephesus]]. When literary works such as the ''[[Iliad]]'' related conflicts among the gods these conflicts were because their followers were at war on earth and were a celestial reflection of the earthly pattern of local deities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Though the worship of the major deities spread from one locality to another, and though most larger cities boasted temples to several major gods, the identification of different gods with different places remained strong to the end.

===Afterlife===
:''See [[Greek Underworld]]''
The Greeks believed in an [[underworld]] where the spirits of the dead went after death. It was commonly supposed that unless the proper funeral rituals were performed, the deceased person's spirit would never reach the underworld and so would haunt the upper world as a ghost forever. There were various views of the underworld, and the idea changed over time.

One of the most widespread areas of the underworld was known as [[Hades]]. This was ruled over by a god, a brother of Zeus, who was called Hades (his realm was originally called 'the place of Hades'). Another realm, called [[Tartarus]], was the place where the damned were thought to go, a place of torment. A third realm, [[Elysium]], was a pleasant place where the virtuous dead and initiates in the mystery cults were said to dwell. In the early Mycenean religion all the dead went to Hades, just as in early Judaism all the dead went to [[Sheol]]. When Odysseus visits Hades in ''Odyssey'' 11, Achilles tells him he would rather be a farmer's servant on the face of the earth than king of Hades. The rise of mystery cults in the Archaic age led to the development of places such as Tartarus and Elysium.
[[File:Mosaico Trabajos Hércules (M.A.N. Madrid) 12.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A mosaic depicting the hero Herakles with [[Cerberus]], a three headed dog, who, according to mythology, guarded Hades.]]
A few, like [[Achilles]], [[Alcmene]], [[Amphiaraus]] [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Melicertes]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, were considered to have been physically immortalized and brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean, or literally right under the ground. Such beliefs are found in the most ancient Greek sources, such as [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. This belief held strong even into the Christian era. For most people at the moment of death there was, however, no hope of anything but continued existence as a disembodied soul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York: Harper &amp; Row 1925 [1921]; [[Dag Øistein Endsjø]]. ''Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Greeks, such as the philosophers [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]], also espoused the idea of [[reincarnation]], though this was only accepted by a few. [[Epicurus]] taught that the soul was simply atoms which dissolved at death, so there was no existence after death.

===Mythology===
:''See [[Greek mythology]]''

[[File:Rubens - Judgement of Paris.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''The Judgment of Paris'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], depicting the three goddesses, Hera, Aphrodite and Athena, in a competition that causes the Trojan War. This is a post-Renaissance painting illustrating the fascination that the nobility in Christian Europe had for the mythology of the ancient Polytheistic Greeks.]]

Greek religion had an extensive [[mythology]]. It consisted largely of stories of the gods and of how they affected humans on Earth. Myths often revolved around heroes and their actions, such as [[Heracles]] and his twelve labors, [[Odysseus]] and his voyage home, [[Jason]] and the quest for the [[Golden Fleece]] and [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]].

Many different species existed in Greek mythology. Chief among these were the gods and humans, though the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] also frequently appeared in Greek myths. They predated the Olympian gods, and were hated by them. Lesser species included the half-man, half-horse [[centaurs]], the nature based [[nymph]]s (tree nymphs were [[dryads]], sea nymphs were [[Nereid]]s) and the half man, half goat [[satyrs]]. Some creatures in Greek mythology were monstrous, such as the one-eyed giant [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], the sea beast [[Scylla]], whirlpool [[Charybdis]], Gorgons, and the half-man, half-bull [[Minotaur]].

Many of the myths revolved around the [[Trojan war]] between [[Greece]] and [[Troy]]. For instance, the epic poem, ''[[The Iliad]]'', by [[Homer]], is based on the war. Many other tales are based on the aftermath of the war, such as the murder of King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Argos]], and the adventures of Odysseus on his return to [[Ithaca]].

There was no one set Greek [[cosmogony]], or creation myth. Different religious groups believed that the world had been created in different ways. One Greek creation myth was told in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]''. It stated that at first there was only a primordial deity called [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], who gave birth to various other primordial gods, such as Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, who then gave birth to more gods, the Titans, who then gave birth to the first Olympians.

The mythology largely survived and was added to in order to form the later [[Roman mythology]]. The Greeks and Romans had been literate societies, and much mythology was written down in the forms of [[epic poetry]] (such as ''The Iliad'', ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Argonautica]]'') and plays (such as [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and [[Aristophones]]' ''[[The Frogs]]''). The mythology became popular in [[Christianity|Christian]] post-[[Renaissance]] Europe, where it was often used as a basis for the works of artists like [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Rubens]].

===Festivals===
Various religious festivals were held in ancient Greece. Many were specific only to a particular deity or city-state. For example, the festival of [[Lycaea]] was celebrated in [[Arcadia]] in Greece, which was dedicated to the pastoral god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. There were also the Games held each year in different locations, culminating in the [[Olympic Games]], which were held every 4 years. These celebrated Zeus.

===Morality===
One of the most important moral concepts to the Greeks was a fear of committing [[hubris]], which constituted many things, from rape to desecration of a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Omitowoju, P.36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge, Millet &amp; Todd, P.126&lt;/ref&gt; It was a crime in the city-state of Athens. Although pride and vanity were not considered sins themselves, the Greeks emphasized moderation. Pride only became hubris when it went to extremes, like any other vice. The same was thought of eating and drinking. Anything done to excess was not considered proper. Ancient Greeks placed, for example, importance on athletics and intellect equally. In fact many of their competitions included both. Pride was not evil until it became all-consuming or hurtful to others.

===Sacred Texts===
[[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]] and [[Works and Days]], [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]] and [[Pindar]]'s [[Odes]] are included as sacred texts&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=uvtebmqZZDYC&amp;pg=PA634&amp;dq=odyssey+sacred+text&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=odyssey%20sacred%20text&amp;f=false Religions of the ancient world: a guide]&lt;/ref&gt; as are other works of classical antiquity. These are the core texts that were considered inspired and usually include an invocation to the Muses for inspiration at the beginning of the work. Such texts, however, were not considered inspired in the sense that they had to be believed by everyone. Plato even wanted to exclude the myths from his ideal state described in the ''Republic'' because of their low moral tone.

==Practices==

===Ceremonies===
[[File:CireneTempioZeus1999.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ruins of a temple devoted to Zeus. Whilst these have not been used for ancient Greek polytheism worship for many centuries, in recent years [[Greek neo-Polytheists]] have begun to use them again. They are also popular sites for tourists.]]

Greek ceremonies and rituals were mainly performed at [[altar]]s. These typically were devoted to one, or a few, gods, and contained a statue of the particular deity upon it. [[Votive deposit]]s would be left at the altar, such as food, drinks, as well as precious objects. Sometimes [[animal sacrifice]]s would be performed here, with most of the flesh eaten, and the [[offal]] burnt as an offering to the gods. [[Libations]], often of wine, would be offered to the gods as well, not only at shrines, but also in everyday life, such as during a [[symposium]].

One ceremony was [[pharmakos]], a ritual involving expelling a symbolic scapegoat such as a slave or an animal, from a city or village in a time of hardship. It was hoped that by casting out the ritual scapegoat, the hardship would go with it.

===Sacrifice===
Worship in Greece typically consisted of sacrificing domestic animals at the altar with hymn and prayer. Parts of the animal were then burned for the gods; the worshippers would eat the rest. The evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient Greek literature, especially in Homer’s epics. Throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the favor of the gods. For example, in Homer’s [[The Odyssey]] (circa 725 B.C.) [[Eumaeus]] sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master [[Odysseus]]. In Homer’s [[The Iliad]] (circa 750 B.C.), which may describe Greek civilization centuries earlier, every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice and prayer. These sacrificial practices, described in these pre-Homeric eras, share commonalities to the 8th century forms of sacrificial rituals. Furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war. Before setting out for Troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. Odysseus offers Zeus a sacrificial ram in vain. The occasions of sacrifice in Homer’s epic poems may shed some light onto the view of the gods as members of society, rather than as external entities, indicating social ties. Sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Meuli 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rites of passage====
One rite of passage was the [[amphidromia]], celebrated on the fifth or seventh day after the birth of a child. Childbirth was extremely significant to Athenians, especially if the baby was a boy.

==Mystery religions==

Those who were not satisfied by the public cult of the gods could turn to various [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] which operated as [[cult]]s into which members had to be initiated in order to learn their secrets.

Here, they could find religious consolations that traditional religion could not provide: a chance at mystical awakening, a systematic religious doctrine, a map to the [[afterlife]], a communal worship, and a band of spiritual fellowship.

Some of these mysteries, like the mysteries of [[Eleusis]] and [[Samothrace]], were ancient and local. Others were spread from place to place, like the mysteries of [[Dionysus]]. During the [[Hellenistic]] period and the [[Roman Empire]], exotic mystery religions became widespread, not only in Greece, but all across the empire. Some of these were new creations, such as [[Mithras]], while others had been practiced for hundreds of years before, like the Egyptian mysteries of [[Osiris]].

==History==

===Origins===

Mainstream Greek religion appears to have evolved from the earlier [[Mycenaean Greece#Religion|Mycenaean religion]] from the [[Mycenaean civilization]] of [[Bronze Age]] Greece. The Mycenaeans, according to archaeological discoveries, seemed to treat [[Poseidon]] as the chief deity. It may also have absorbed the beliefs and practices of earlier, nearby cultures, such as [[Minoan religion]]. [[Herodotus]] traced many Greek religious practices to Egypt.

===Classical antiquity===
The mainstream religion of the Greeks did not go unchallenged from persons within Greece. Several notable philosophers criticised a belief in the gods. The earliest of these was [[Xenophanes]], who chastised the human vices of the gods as well as their anthropomorphic depiction. [[Plato]] did not believe in many polythiestic deities, but instead believed that there was one supreme god, whom he called the [[Form of the good]], and which he believed was the emanation of perfection in the universe. Plato's disciple, [[Aristotle]], also disagreed that polythiestic deities existed, because he could not find enough empirical evidence for it. He believed in a [[Primum movens|Prime Mover]], which had set creation going, but was not connected to or interested in the universe.

===Roman Empire===
When the [[Roman Republic]] conquered Greece in 146 BC, it took much of Greek religion (along with many other aspects of Greek culture such as literary and architectural styles) and incorporated it into its own. The Greek gods were equated with the ancient Roman deities; Zeus with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Hera with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], Poseidon with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], Aphrodite with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], Ares with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], Artemis with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], Athena with [[Minerva]], Hermes with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], Hephaestus with [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], Hestia with [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], Demeter with [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], Hades with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], Tyche with [[Fortuna]], and Pan with [[Faunus]]. Some of the gods, such as Apollo and Bacchus, had earlier been adopted by the Romans. There were also many deities that existed in the Roman religion before its interaction with Greece that weren't associated with a Greek deity, including [[Janus]] and [[Quirinus]].

===Greek Polytheism revivals===
{{Main|Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism}}
[[File:YSEE ritual.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A ceremony at the annual Prometheia festival of the Greek polytheistic group [[Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes]], June 2006.]]
Greek religion has experienced a number of revivals, in the arts, humanities and spirituality of the [[Renaissance]] as well as with the contemporary [[Hellenic Reconstructionism]], or &quot;[[Hellenismos]]&quot; as it is sometimes called (a term first used by the last pagan Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]). Many [[neo-pagan]] religious paths, such as [[Wicca]], use aspects of ancient Greek religions in their practice; [[Hellenic Reconstructionism]] focuses exclusively thereon, as far as the nature of the surviving source material allows. It reflects [[neo-Platonic]]/[[Plato]]nic speculation (which is represented in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Libanius]], [[Proclus]], and [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]), as well as Classical cult practice. The overwhelming majority of modern Greeks are followers of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]]. According to estimates reported by the [[U.S. State Department]], there are perhaps as many as 2,000 followers of the ancient Greek religion out of a total Greek population of 11 million,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71383.htm&lt;/ref&gt; however ''Hellenismos'' leaders place that figure at 100,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=617qc8gmta8&lt;/ref&gt;
