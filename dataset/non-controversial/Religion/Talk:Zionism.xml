== Edit request re: location of Jewish homeland according to Zionism, 12 October 2012 ==

&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
The article currently claims that Zionism &quot;supports a Jewish nation state in territory defined as the Land of Israel.&quot; However, it is only after the creation of the state of Israel that Zionism came to be popularly associated exclusively with this region as the single possible location for the Jewish homeland. Theodor Herzl, one of the founders of Zionism, stated of the possible site of the Jewish homeland he envisioned: 
&quot;We shall take what is given us, and what is selected by public opinion.&quot; 
http://www.mideastweb.org/jewishstate.pdf (see p. 2 of document)
Another source, citing the definition of Zionism in various English-language dictionaries from the 1890s and early 20th century, as well the the periodical the &lt;i&gt;Jewish Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; from 1896, demonstrates that &quot;[...]these dictionaries, then, reflect the fact that, while there was a preference for Palestine on religious and historical grounds, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that this would be the location of the future Jewish state.&quot; Indeed, Chambers's 20th Century Dictionary maintained a definition of Zionism not restricted to a specific territory (Zionism defined as &quot;a movement for securing national privileges and territory (esp. in Palestine) for the Jews”) through 1964. For its part, the &lt;i&gt;Jewish Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; in 1896 stated that &quot;Zionism does not necessarily aim at the formation of a Jewish State in Palestine.&quot;
http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/journal/volumes/06/meijs_blackwell/
Currently there is a brief reference further down in the article to Herzl's consideration of East Africa as a site for a Jewish homeland (actually it was Uganda specifically, on offer from the British)--his proposal to settle in Uganda was actually passed by the Sixth Zionist Congress but not seriously pursued after Herzl's death in 1904. http://www.mideastweb.org/jewishstate.pdf (see p. 2) This existing reference in the article contradicts the very definition of Zionism given at the start of the article relying on territory &quot;defined as the Land of Israel.&quot; According to this definition in the current Wikipedia entry for Zionism, Theodor Herzl--defined as &quot;the father of modern political Zionism&quot; in his own Wikipedia entry--was not a Zionist because he did not consider it essential that the Jewish homeland be located in the biblical &quot;Land of Israel&quot;. To eliminate this contradiction from the entry, the initial definition of Zionism should be rewritten to say something like &quot;Zionism is a form of nationalism of Jews and Jewish culture that supports a Jewish nation state with its own territory.&quot; Such a definition would incorporate both the original historical understandings of Zionism as well as present-day associations with the state of Israel. Further clarification could be provided in this article as to how the definition of the word Zionism has evolved over time.

== book reference to no book in critisisms of zionism ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zionism had also been opposed by some Jews for other reasons even before the establishment of the state of Israel because &quot;Zionism constitutes a danger, spiritual and physical, to the existence of our people.'.&quot;[77]. The book also states &quot;The booklet which we are publishing here, 'Serufay. Ha Kivshbnim Maashimim' ('The Holocaust Victims Accuse'), serves as an attempt to show, by means of testimonies., documents and reports, how Zionism and its high-level organizations brought a catastrophe upon our people during the era of the Nazi holocaust.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== support for Jewish demographic majority is not clearly racist ==

The section on &quot;Zionism as racism&quot; used to end with a statement by Herzog asserting that Zionism was not racist, followed by a supposedly counterbalancing statement from Netanyahu expressing preference for a Jewish majority in Israel, with the clear implication that Netanyahu's statement is racist.  To me this is not clear at all, and putting this in is a clear case of disallowed [[WP:SYNTH]].  If you want to make such a point, you need to find a reliable secondary source that asserts that preference for a Jewish majority is racist, and clearly indicate the source with an &quot;XXX claims that ...&quot; etc.  Many politicians in many parts of the world want to see their own ethnic groups preserved, but somehow no one claims that this is racism unless it's specifically tied in with Israel.  To me, talk of a demographic threat is coming from the fears of people who have seen the strong hostility to Israel and Jews coming from the Arab world and do not think that Jews can remain safe if they don't maintain an electoral majority; i.e. it's a security issue not racism.  More generally, support for one's own ethnic group is hardly racism, otherwise we'd have to declare every nationalist movement (Polish nationalism, Kurdish nationalism, Kosovo nationalism, Tibetan nationalism, etc. etc.) as racist. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 01:29, 27 June 2012 (UTC)
:The [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/netanyahu-israel-s-arabs-are-the-real-demographic-threat-1.109045 Haaretz source] that was cited contained a number of reactions to Netanyahu's statements that regarded them as racist, so I don't think [[WP:SYNTH]] would apply if this were the [[Racism in Israel]] article. The content could probably be rewritten so that it reflects the views expressed in the source. However, this article is about Zionism so I'm not sure that the content belongs here. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;Sean.hoyland&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 18:56, 27 June 2012 (UTC)
:: Benwing, this isn't a forum to discuss the issue at large beyond what is necessary for editing the article, but you seem to be a bti confused as to what racism is. Polish nationalism isn't racist, but Polish nationalism that wants to exclude those Poles who are coloured, or Protestants, from Poland is racist. Similarly if, say, the Republicans in the US would endorse a policy to maintain a white majority in the United States, that would correctly be denounced as racism. Cheers, --[[User:Dailycare|Dailycare]] ([[User talk:Dailycare|talk]]) 19:54, 27 June 2012 (UTC)

&quot; Polish nationalism that wants to exclude those Poles who are coloured, or Protestants, from Poland is racist&quot;
if thats true, then by simular logic if the Republicans in the US would endorse a white majority and white nationalism, then aslong as it does not &quot;exclude those non whites&quot; then it wouldnt be racist. aslong as the majority and its cultural identity is white and rule then its fine. but it must remain a white country like africa is an african black country, china is a asian ruled country. they would never agree to let non-asians rule or non-blacks rule.

thus jews should have equal rights like european white countries have now that anti-immigrant parties have been on the rise and the majority of the people decided to vote for the majority.whites that is, and being against racist-anti whites.
so yes, jewish people should have the same right means that the content of this article must be equal to other nationalist and patriotic movements about nationalism.

== Edit request on 8 November 2012 ==

{{edit semi-protected|answered=yes}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;

On the topic of Zionism and its support for a Jewish state:

The definition of Zionism in Wikipedia is given as &quot;a form of nationalism of Jews and Jewish culture that supports a Jewish nation state in territory defined as the Land of Israel&quot;. 
Also, in the article's section &quot;Particularities of Zionist beliefs&quot;, it is stated that &quot;Zionism was established with the goal of creating a Jewish state&quot;.
However, renowned scholar Noam Chomsky disputes this assertion. In an interview on November 7, 2011, he pointed out that &quot;it's not too well known, but until 1942 there was no official commitment of Zionist organizations to a Jewish state. And even that was in the middle of World War II. It was a decision made in the Hotel Biltmore in New York, where there was the first official call for a Jewish state&quot;.

The full interview can be found here: http://chomsky.info/interviews/20111107.htm

So a way of incorporating this in the definition may be as follows:
Zionism (Hebrew: ציונות‎, Tsiyonut) is a form of nationalism of Jews and Jewish culture that supports a Jewish nation state in territory defined as the Land of Israel, &quot;although until 1942 there was no official commitment of Zionist organizations to a Jewish state&quot;(Chomsky*).
In the article's section &quot;Particularities of Zionist beliefs&quot;, an addition to the text may be as follows:
Zionism was established with the goal of creating a Jewish state, &quot;&quot;although until 1942 there was no official commitment of Zionist organizations to a Jewish state&quot;(Chomsky*).

Chomsky*: http://chomsky.info/interviews/20111107.htm
