==Politician cardinals==
I have added a paragraph about the politician cardinals - Wolsey, Richelieu and Mazarin. Its not meant to be a criticism 
of the office but I think the article needs an explanation of why three of the most famous cardinals in history were
politicians more than churchmen. [[User:Edmilne|Edmilne]] 07:21, Nov 27, 2003 (UTC)


==Cardinals from bishops only, did the people ever elect the Pope?==
A couple questions. Are cardinals restricted to being drawn ftom the ranks of bishops by law or only by custom? Did the &quot;people&quot; of Rome really once elect the Pope or only a small select group such as priests, or politicians? I didn't know the common folk every had a vote in Rome.   --rmhermen 
: In Eastern Orthodoxy and I believe in early Church history, the ordination of any bishop would require at least three other bishops; I think the number was reduced to two in later years. A single bishop could ordain a priest or deacon. But with all three offices, the consent of the people is also required; a bishop cannot be ordained without the people's &quot;Amen&quot;; it's an essential part of the liturgy. On a related note, I believe there was a time in the 1400's just before the Byzantine Empire fell to the turks, that some Byzantine bishops went to Rome to ask for military aid. In exchange, they agreed to adopt the [[:filioque clause|filioque clause]] and submit themselves to the Pope. By the time those bishops returned home, the people had learned what happened and wouldn't let them off the boat, the agreement never went into effect, and Constantinople fell to the Turks instead of falling to Rome. --[[User:Wesley|Wesley]]
::Requiring the Amen for validity and requiring the actual approval of a vote of the people are, of course, different things.  In the the Roman Empire there was often an ''acclamatio'' for public events - the arrival of an emperor, the appointment of an emperor, etc.  We can treat that as a vote or as a public gesture under duress (sometimes we know it was that - soldiers standing around with weapons).  There is a similar acclamation remaining in the Western ordination liturgies for priests and bishops, but no one pretends that the candidates are actually elected by local congregations.  Liturgy and ecclesiastical organization are closely related but not identical. Unless we can find cases where men dressed for the ordination ceremony are regretfully sent back to the monastery while someone ''else'' is ordained, I think it's better to understand this 'requirement' as ''acclamatio'' and not ''electio''.   --MichaelTinkler 

:There is some debate about the role of lay election.  Traditionally, the first 4 or 5 popes named their successors in their will.  Election then followed, but was not initially limited to cardinals.  Again, because of time marching on, it is hard to know preciesely how the early diocese of Rome functioned.[[User:DaveTroy|DaveTroy]] 10:37, 9 December 2005 (UTC)


Well, as I understand it some Pope announced that all later cardinals would be bishops, and all later Popes have followed him by only appointing bishops as Popes; but there is nothing to stop the Pope changing his mind tomorrow and appointing a plain priest or a layperson a cardinal instead. The distinction between 'law' and 'custom' doesn't always make that much sense, especially I think in cases like this.

As to who could vote for the Pope before the cardinals could, I'm not to sure. Someone should do some research on the topic. -- [[User:SJK|Simon J Kissane]]


Not exactly a vote, but as a pressure group (rioting outside wherever the electors were, stoning electors as they left, etc.) they certainly had influence.  I think that under the new code of canon law --voting-- cardinals may be formally restricted to being bishops.  John Paul II has appointed several aging theologians to cardinalates who were not previously bishops (Jean Danielou, a Frenchman, is an example), and I'm not sure if he created them titular bishops along with cardinals to make up for it.  In the case of these men they were controversial enough that the fact they were over 80 mattered. --MichaelTinkler


I think today whenever the Pope appoints a non-bishop to be a cardinal he has them consecrated a bishop first, but I'm not completely sure. -- [[User:SJK|Simon J Kissane]]

:yep, just ran and checked online (  http://www.prairienet.org/nrpcatholic/e204-459.html#2  )

::Canon 351 §1 Those to be promoted Cardinals are men freely selected by the Roman Pontiff, who are at least in the order of priesthood and are truly outstanding in doctrine, virtue, piety and prudence in practical matters; those who are not already Bishops must receive episcopal consecration. 

by the way, the Pope doesn't have to be a bishop on election, either (which I knew, but had forgotten):

:Canon 355 §1 It belongs to the Cardinal Dean to ordain the elected Roman Pontiff a Bishop, if he is not already ordained. If the Dean is prevented from doing so, the same right belongs to the sub-Dean or, if he is prevented, to the senior Cardinal of the episcopal order. 

you are right that Canon 351 §1 states that non-bishops must receive episcopal consecration, but the Pope has the right to dispense someone from receiving it. Examples: Cardinal Dulles and Cardinal Scheffczyk asked the pope to excuse them from receiving the episcopal consecration because of advanced age. The pope accepted it. Thus those 2 are cardinals without being bishops. [[User:143.50.212.195|143.50.212.195]] 15:04, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Terminology ==
If, say, the Archbishop of Boston is a Cardinal, is it then correct to refer to him as &quot;the Cardinal of Boston&quot;?

S.
:No. The office of Cardinal does not entail responsibilities over any particular geographic area, unlike (in most cases) the office of Bishop; hence he is not the &quot;Cardinal of Boston&quot;. -- [[user:SJK|SJK]].

::You can refer to Jean-Claude Cardinal Turcotte, the Archbishop of Montreal; but not the Cardinal of Montreal. - [[User:Montrealais|Montréalais]]

:: in fact the Archbishop of Boston is the Cardinal Priest of (the church of) St Mary della Victoria.  It would be acceptable, though, to refer to him as the Cardinal Archbishop of Boston, as mentioned elsewhere on this page.

==List of notable cardinals?==
If it doesn't already exist, would a [[List of notable cardinals]] be of any use? --[[User:KF|KF]] 18:07, 22 Oct 2003 (UTC)

==Naming conventions==
The syntactic construction used once on this page, e.g. Jean-Claude Cardinal Turcotte, is not widely understood, and IMO worth a paragraph.  I'm pretty sure i've heard the expression &quot;cardinal archbishop&quot; without a name; is that an error?  Is &quot;Archbishop Jean-Claude Cardinal Turcotte&quot; better or worse than &quot;Archbishop Jean-Claude Turcotte&quot;?  

Also, i changed a listing to 
*Thich [[Nhat Hanh]] (''Thich'' is a title, not a name) (b. 1926) expatriate Vietnamese Buddhist religious leader and spirituality author
in [[List of people by name: Tf-Th#Thf - Thi]] and intend in [[List of people by name: Nh]], to have
*[[Nhat Hanh]], Thich (''Thich'' is a title, not a name) (b. 1926) expatriate Vietnamese Buddhist religious leader and spirituality author
By analogy with that 
[[List of people by name: Mas-Maz#Maz]] lists
*[[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin, Cardinal]], (1602 - 1661), [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and [[chief minister]] of [[France]]
which i'm inclined to change to 
*[[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin, Jules]] Cardinal (&quot;Cardinal&quot; is a title not a name, but appears just before the surname, whether with or without the given name), (1602 - 1661), [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and [[chief minister]] of [[France]]
(Note he is the only Mazarin, so there is no need for a duplicate entry for people who don't know about &quot;jules&quot;.)

The article [[Cardinal Mazarin]] begins
:Jules Mazarin, born Giulio Mazarini; but best known as Cardinal Mazarin (1602 - 1661)
but am i right that 
:Jules Mazarin, born Giulio Mazarini; but best known as Cardinal Mazarin (or with full formality Jules Cardinal Mazarin) (1602 - 1661)
would be accurate and more thorough? --[[User:Jerzy|Jerzy]] 07:41, 2004 Jan 21 (UTC)


Neither &quot;Archbishop Jean-Claude Cardinal Turcotte&quot; or &quot;Archbishop Jean-Claude Turcotte&quot; would be correct; archbishop refers to the individual's position, while Cardinal is his title (unlike, for example, the Archbishop of Louisville, Kentucky, who would correctly be addressed as &quot;Archbishop Thomas C. Kelly&quot; because his title is Archbishop and his position is Archbishop). It would be correct  to refer to the individual as &quot;Cardinal Turcotte,&quot; or as &quot;Jean-Claude Cardinal Turcotte, Archbishop of Montreal,&quot; but it would be an insult to demote him to &quot;Archbishop Turcotte.&quot; It is, however, acceptable to refer to him as the &quot;Cardinal Archbishop of Montreal&quot; or as a &quot;Cardinal Archbishop,&quot; because those terms signify that the individual is a Cardinal who is in charge of an Archdiocese. (All Cardinals are not assigned a diocese to govern.)
--[[User:Essjay|Essjay]] 03:24, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)Essjay


&quot;Not all Cardinals are assigned a diocese&quot; - however I understand that all Cardinals are also appointed to a parish within the diocese of Rome. Thus although they are &quot;princes of the church&quot; they are also humble servants of a parish. (IANARC) [[User:Albatross2147|Albatross2147]] 11:15, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:While Cardinals are all ceremonially tied to particular churches or dioceses, they play virtually no role in those areas besides offering their prayers. When I made the statement &quot;Not all Cardinals are assigned to a diocese&quot; the context was: Not all Cardinals serve as diocean bishops, responsible for the daily functioning of a diocese. Many Cardinals, including the former Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, served in the Roman Curia, the Vatican offices of the church. Thus, in the discussion of Archbishop v. Cardinal, this becomes important. Some Cardinals are archbishops of a particular diocese, but others are not, and you would not refer to a Cardinal as bishop or archbishop of their titular diocese. I was not in any way attempting to suggest that the Cardinals are not &quot;humble servants.&quot; It was merely a deliniation of which titles apply to which individuals. --[[User:Essjay|Essjay]] 22:40, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)


== Some cardinals are not archbishops ==
Some cardinals are not [[archbishop]]s due to the fact that they do not lead [[archdiocese]]s, either residential or [[titular see|titular]].  [[Karl Cardinal Lehmann]] and [[Paul Cardinal Shan Kuo-hsi]] are examples, as they are respectively the [[Bishop of Mainz]] and the Bishop of [[Kaohsiung]].  Mainz was an archdiocese but was demoted in 1801; currently, its [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] is the Archbishop of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]].  The Diocese of Kaohsiung was erected in 1961 and hasn't been elevated yet; its metropolitan is the Archbishop of [[Taipei]]. [[User:Pmadrid|Pmadrid]] 18:50, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

:Additionally, [[Avery Cardinal Dulles]] is a priest, not even a [[bishop]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:26, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
*Terribly sorry to have made such an egregious mistake; while I was aware (and argued above) that many Cardinals do not serve as the prelate of ANY diocese (arch or otherwise), and thus are not bishops or archbishops in the diocean sense (although still of the episcopal rank), and that some of them are not of the episcopal rank, I was unaware of any Cardinals who served as bishops rather than archbishops. My peculiar experience is with the US, and there are no cardinal bishops in the US, only cardinal archbishops. (Although, there are Cardinals in/from the US who do not serve as diocean prelates.)

== Use of &quot;His Eminence&quot; for deceased cardinals? ==
I am unclear on the appropriateness of forms of address for deceased cardinals.  I know while living, they are refered to as [[His Eminence]], and when I have edited a cardinal article, I usually begin it:
:His Eminence '''John Cardinal Smith''' (born February 30, 1950) is a...
But should articles about deceased cardinals begin the same way?  I guess this is a bigger question about the retension of forms of address after death — should [[George VI of the United Kingdom]] begin with &quot;His Magesty&quot;?  The article [[Style (manner of address)]] was not totally clear on the issue.

--[[User:Eoghanacht|Eoghanacht]] 17:00, 2005 August 15 (UTC)

:I'd say a form of address is for, well, addressing an individual, and you can't easily do that when they're dead.  Go with the title:  &quot;Cardinal John Dearden [or, for the more traditionally minded, John Cardinal Dearden], who was archbishop of Detroit...&quot; &quot;King George VI was the younger brother of King Edward VIII...&quot; —[[User:OtherDave|OtherDave]] 22:05, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

== Origin of the term ==


Actually, I've heard a different etymological explanation for &quot;cardinal.&quot;  Cardo does not only mean 'hinge' in Latin, but also &quot;wedge.&quot;  Some scholars say that prior to 11th century spin, the term originally had a negative connotation.  Cardinals were priests who were &quot;wedged&quot; or stuck into an appointment from the outside--a priest the Vatican appointed to a high rank in a diocese which was not originally his, for example.  This is the explanation given by Diarmaid MacColloch in The Reformation, and in Princes of the Church: A History of the English Cardinals by Dominic Aidan Bellenger and Stella Fletcher (see https://www.thetablet.co.uk/cgi-bin/book_review.cgi?past-00042 ) [[User:Makrina|Makrina]] 03:07, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

== Cardinal John Doe ==

James-Charles Noonan writes that &quot;it is improper to refer to a cardinal in any other form than John Cardinal Doe. The recent practice of Cardinal John Doe is improper and has no foundation in law.&quot;  How recent is &quot;recent&quot;. The order &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot; is found in the early-twentieth-century ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', e.g. &quot;Cardinal Giovanni Battista Caprara&quot; in the article [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09118a.htm ''Legate'',] and doubtless long before. Those who drew up the index of the electronic copy chose the form &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot;.  It is surely they who are recent, not the encyclopedia.  I am quite unfamiliar with the name &quot;James-Charles Noonan&quot;.  How authoritative is he?  What law is he referring to?  A Church law governing English usage in the matter?  I don't believe there is such a law.  [[User:Lima|Lima]] 04:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

: Noonan is a yank, and the book is used by some Catholic colleges in the U.S. No idea what he is referring to in the second sentence, which I included in the quote hoping someone else would have an idea. Anyway, this is a reference replacing the former vague &quot;some authors&quot; - is there any official authority for the &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot; form either? (Both forms can be found on the Vatican site.) [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 05:20, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

::Sorry, I have failed to find the form &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot; as a way of referring to cardinals anywhere on the Vatican website.  Without examining sublinks, I have gone through the links for each department of the Roman Curia listed in [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/index.htm this section] of the site, and have only found the &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot; form (Secretariat of State: Cardinal Angelo Sodano (twice); Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: Card. Joseph Ratzinger; Congregation  for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments: Card. Francis Arinze (three times), and Card. Jorge Arturo Medina Estévez (once); Congregation for the Causes of Saints: Card. José Saraiva Martins (35 times!); etc.)  Where does the site use the &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot; form?  Perhaps it quotes something prepared in English elsewhere, but I have failed to find any example.  Is Gimmetrow perhaps thinking of the ''signatures'' appended to the end of documents?  As stated, Cardinals sign as &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot; or &quot;John Card. Doe&quot; (adding a cross only if they are in charge of a suburbicarian see or - I think, but cannot guarantee - any see).  Of that there is no doubt.  The only question is whether cardinals should be ''referred to'' as &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot; or as &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot;.
::That Noonan is a Yank is evident from his use of the Americanism &quot;John Doe&quot;, in place of the &quot;John Smith&quot; of other English-speaking countries.

I do not have a copy of the [http://www.catholicnews.com/stylebook.htm Catholic News Service stylebook,] but I presume it gives the &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot; rule.  I, for my part, would consider that book  more authoritative for correct usage in this matter than Noonan, whose idea is probably based on no more than the style for signatures.  See what the US Bishops Conference Office of Media Relations [http://www.nccbuscc.org/comm/archives/2005/05-276.shtml says] of the stylebook.

On brief inspection the last link appears to use both forms for Card. Hoyos on the same page. A general google search for &quot;Bernard Cardinal Law&quot; is informative: while most news articles say &quot;Cardinal Bernard Law&quot;, the other form can be found in the [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/bernard_f_law/index.html?s=oldest&amp; New York Times] (Dionne, 26 May 1985), the [http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/02187944.htm Boston Phoenix], and even [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9389594?tocId=9389594 Britannica].

::As usual, trow must be given to Gimmetrow.  Only one of his citations (No. 8) is clearly invalid: it has the &quot;John Card. Doe&quot; order only in the signature of the document.  The other four French and Italian citations all refer to just one and the same document, and have the &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot; order only in the title that has been added on the website (by an English-speaker who believes in the Noonan order? or, perhaps more likely, by someone who moved to the top the signature that should be at the bottom?).  The document itself (as distinct from the added title) does not have it in either language.  No wonder, since &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot; would sound very strange in those languages.  There remain Gimmetrow's English citations, and he is perfectly right in saying that the &quot;John Card. Doe&quot; order does appear, even if only in a very few cases, on the Vatican website.  Citation 1 has it only in the website title.  But the December 1999 English document of the International Theological Commission (2) does have &quot;Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger&quot; in its body (unlike, of course, the other [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_index.htm language versions] of the same document). &quot;John Cardinal O'Connor&quot; has been added to the internal title of document 3 (he is, of course, referred to as &quot;Cardinal John O'Connor&quot; on the [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_21061996_dvatican_fr.html page] that gives the French version of the same document).  And whoever wrote the English version of the Jubilee programme for catechists and religion teachers on 9-10 December 2000 (4) was certainly a believer in the Noonan order.  So Gimmetrow is right: the Vatican website does sometimes allow &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot;, even if by no means on a par with &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot;.
::'''Does any reader of this page have access to the Catholic News Service Stylebook?'''  Gimmetrow does not.  Neither do I.  There can be no doubt that it supports the &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot; practice of Catholic News Service itself.  But it would be good to know how exactly it phrases its judgement.  And I think it can be counted on to have made its judgement after wider consultation than Noonan.  [[User:Lima|Lima]] 16:16, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

:The problem with the way some edits to articles relating to cardinals have been worded is that they imply, or say straight out, that the &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot; form is incorrect. It's not &quot;incorrect.&quot; One might argue that it is obsolete or that it is becoming less common, but it's clearly not &quot;incorrect&quot; as it's been used for hundreds of years and is still perfectly common today. (For example, the last time I was in Chicago, the cathedral had a sign listing Francis Cardinal George, in that order, as the archbishop. The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington regularly noted, until his recent retirement, when Theodore Cardinal McCarrick, in that order, would be celebrating Mass.) The real issue is that an article purporting to be encyclopedic in nature should not take a position in an argumentative form. It's better to acknowledge the issue without condemning one side or the other, and indeed I think it's quite commendable to note that the difference exists. For example, the article providing a list of cardinals contained a statement about the traditional form being an &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; usage, and a former version of that article said that &quot;[t]he correct order&quot; is the &quot;Cardinal John Doe&quot; order notwithstanding the &quot;John Cardinal Doe&quot; order used throughout that article. But Wikipedia's credibility suffers if an article states (or even clearly implies) that the content of the article is wrong. Why would anyone place value on a purported encyclopedia that questions the accuracy of its own content? I realize that my comments here relate to two articles, but the two are so closely related, and the same matter was at issue in both, that the concern is valid. My other thought is that usage in other languages is irrelevant to English usage. The French put the adjective last: &quot;transport super-sonique&quot; rather than &quot;supersonic transport&quot; (referring to Concorde) or &quot;Boulevard Rene-Levesque&quot; rather than &quot;Rene-Levesque Boulevard&quot; (a street in Montreal). That doesn't mean that Wikipedia articles written in English need concern themselves with the French usage. I don't see why the usage referring to a cardinal need be subject to a different standard.

:I suppose there is always the proclamation made on 19 April 2005 at the Vatican: &quot;Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam: Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum Josephum Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem Ratzinger qui sibi nomen imposuit Benedictum XVI.&quot; They don't say: &quot;Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam: Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum Sanctae Romane Ecclesiae Cardinalem Josephum Ratzinger qui sibi nomen imposuit Benedictum XVI.&quot; Of course, above I did indeed make the point that the order of the wording in other languages need not and should not govern the convention used in English, but the Papal Proclamation does, in my view, constitute strong support for the argument that &quot;Cardinal&quot; goes immediately prior to the surname, and constitutes far stronger support than media usage. One particular reason why I believe this is that we know that there have been many other changes in the procedures surrounding the selection and inauguration of a new pope--for example, John Paul I refusing a coronation and his two successors continuing that tradition; the most recent conclave not requiring that the cardinal electors remain locked in the vicinity of the Sistine Chapel for the duration; the ringing of the bells in 2005 to confirm the white smoke--yet this custom was not changed.

== Incorrect date given on Stigmata movie and wrong link ==

&quot;Jonathan Pryce played the fictional Cardinal Houseman in Stigmata (1995).&quot;

The movie was released in 1999 not 1995 and also the link to &quot;Stigmata&quot; links to the act of stigmata rather than the movie &quot;Stigmata&quot;

Though the movie is about a woman who has stigmata if someone was trying to follow the link for the movie they'd get the article on the affliction (or gift if you so desire) of stigmata.

I was checking the caption I used for an image in [[medieval cuisine]], and I became a bit unsure of a guess I made.  The person sitting to the left of the duke (in blue robe and fur hat) seems to be a man of the cloth, but is he a cardinal or a bishop, or, in fact, neither?

==JP2's In pectore cardinal==
I've deleted this. Something of such an apparently speculative nature and tone, I think, would have to be sourced to be taken seriously.

==Red's origin==

The article says &quot;a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments because &quot;the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal's willingness to die for his faith&quot;.  However, Voltaire, in the '''Dictionnaire philosophique''' (1764) has the 'blood'/'red' part quite differently.  At the Council of Lyons in 1245, at which Innocent IV excommunicated the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, he says the Pope gave the Cardinals red hats as a reminder that they were to 'bathe in the blood of the supporters of the Emperor'.  I must say this sounds more realistic. Some Cardinals, then, could indeed arrange for much blood-letting: such as in 1243 when Cardinal Ranieri of Viterbo had Rome's Imperial garrison slaughtered.  And Cardinal Pietro Capocci who invaded Sicily with the Papal Army in 1250 (albeit entirely routed at the Battle of Cingoli.)

== Cardinal v. Bishop ==

The article is still not clear about the difference between Cardinal v. Bishop. Is the cardinal referring to the Bishop who is member of the college? Are not, technically, all Archbishops of the same &quot;credo&quot; entitled to elect their Pope? Why not the Archbishop of a major city like Paris is not automatically a member of the college?--[[User:Connection|Connection]] 12:31, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

::Is there a particular part of the article which is confusing? &quot;Cardinal&quot; and &quot;Bishop&quot; are two different roles within the Catholic Church (although, obviously, most Cardinals are also Bishops).

::Archbishops that are not Cardinals are _not_ entitled to a vote in a conclave. No archbishop or bishop has a right to become a Cardinal. It is a privledge granted solely by the Pope.--[[User:Dcheney|Dcheney]] 17:44, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

== When does a Cardinal become a Cardinal? ==

It seems that every time the Pope announces his intention to held a consistory to create new cardinals there arises the question of when does a Cardinal-Designate become a Cardinal (i.e., could vote in a conclave should it be needed, etc.)

According to Canon Law (351 §2): &quot;Cardinals are created by a decree of the Roman Pontiff, which in fact is published in the presence of the College of Cardinals. From the moment of publication, they are bound by the obligations and they enjoy the rights defined in the law.&quot;

So the question becomes, does the announcement (such as on Wednesday 17 October 2007) constitute &quot;publication&quot;?

The Holy Father indirectly made this clear in his introduction to the announcement. He mentions that he is abrogating “by one” the rule of 120 Cardinal Electors. The key point there is “by one”. For today there are 104 Cardinals under the age of 80 and thus Cardinal Electors.

He named 18 new Cardinal Electors. Thus giving us 122 Cardinal Electors if he intended the announcement as the official publication.

It should be noted that Cardinal Sodano turns 80 and loses the right to vote on 23 November.

So, if the Holy Father intends to aborgate the rule “by one” as he clearly stated, then the official publication can not occur before 23 November. (And, of course, 24 November is the stated date for the Consistory itself.)

Thus it becomes clear that the announcement is not &quot;publication&quot; - and so the Cardinal-Designates remain Cardinal-Designates until the consistory.--[[User:Dcheney|Dcheney]] 18:27, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. As the disambiguation page says, the general meaning of the word cardinal has nothing to do with the Catholic church.

*'''Oppose'''. Look, if it's seriously disputed whether a topic is primary, then it's ''not'' primary. The claim that no one would link to &quot;cardinal&quot; when intending &quot;cardinal bird&quot; is just false -- personally I never heard of a &quot;cardinal bird&quot;; it's just called a &quot;cardinal&quot;. Similarly for cardinals in set theory -- rarely are they called &quot;cardinal numbers&quot;, partly because not everyone agrees that the infinite ones ''are'' &quot;numbers&quot;. If you add a link forgetting there are other meanings and the link takes you to a disambig page, well, the reader has to make one extra mouse click; if the link takes you to a ''wrong'' meaning, that's much worse. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 16:55, 4 December 2007 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.

*'''Oppose''' per many of the above points, the main one being that there is no clear primary usage. Additionally, the category for the religious leaders is at [[:Category:Roman Catholic cardinals]], and [[:Category:Cardinals]] is a DAB category. Changing the article name will also require renaming the categories (again) if we want consistency between article names and category names. [[User:Snocrates|Snocrates]] 21:45, 6 December 2007 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. I'm mostly repeating what's been said before, but in this case, I don't think online links demonstrate much. Online, it doesn't surprise me that the world &quot;cardinal&quot; meaning the clergyman is used more often, for the simple reason that Catholic Cardinals are in the news far more often than the bird (and googling for &quot;cardinal bird&quot; in fact brings up very few examples outside of phrases like &quot;cardinal bird feeder&quot; and so on; if that specific phrase is more common globally, personally I'd like to see some sources). By the same token, you'd probably find more links for the &quot;St. Louis Cardinals&quot; than the bird. As for the bird issue, admittedly it is native to the US and seems to be most common here, but I still don't think that's a good enough reason to change things (I haven't really looked, but by the same token, species indiginous to Europe or Asia should, in my opinion, be titled and addressed primarily by what they're called there, with other terms used in other regions noted). Even so, googling &quot;Cardinal&quot; followed by bird (rather than &quot;cardinal bird&quot;) yields 1,460,000 results. Googling &quot;Cardinal&quot; and Catholic yields 1.650,000. Granted the latter is higher, but I'm not convinced it's not that huge a lead to prove primacy (and also granted this excludes other search combinations like Cardinal and church and so on). Plus, it's not as if &quot;Cardinal (bird)&quot; was being privileged. Via the disambig, both are presented equally, which is as it should be, and that strikes me as fair and most useful for everyone. I don't feel it's unduly biased this way (which I would if the bird became the main article, and would thus also oppose). -- [[User:Aleal|Aleal]] ([[User talk:Aleal|talk]]) 22:01, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

* I find your new wording to be fine. The clause you quote was not present before. My problem with your prior version is that it claimed that the sources definitively establish that the &quot;proper&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; form is the &quot;Cardinal John Smith&quot; form. I found that claim to be quite overstated, and I think the mere fact of the common usage of both forms indicates that terms like &quot;usual&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; are inappropriate. Indeed, even Wikipedia's conventions for referring to the clergy indicate that the &quot;John Cardinal Smith&quot; form is completely acceptable, although because of the way Wikipedia's internal linking system operates it does present certain difficulties. Regarding deleting the &quot;sourced edit,&quot; my problem wasn't with the sources, but rather with the conclusion that had drawn from those sources. Your newly-revised version is considerably more neutral and I have no problem with it. My beef was with the article taking the position, whether express or implied, that &quot;John Cardinal Smith&quot; is WRONG or non-standard.

::: It was kind of interesting on Saturday watching Sen. Kennedy's funeral Mass on TV. The program repeatedly referred to &quot;Sean P.

Several times, immediately afterwards, the CBS commentator referred to &quot;Cardinal Sean O'Malley.&quot; I suppose it's somewhat understandable why the media use the less-formal form, given the number of non-Catholic viewers who wouldn't understand it and also given the American media's obsession with using middle initials, even for people who never use middle initials themselves (e.g., Virginia's governor always goes by &quot;Tim Kaine&quot; but the Washington Post insists that he's &quot;Timothy M. Kaine&quot;). The use of the middle initial in the &quot;Sean P. Cardinal O'Malley&quot; form does sound a bit more awkward to me than &quot;Sean Cardinal O'Malley,&quot; although I'm not really sure why!

::::I agree with 1995hoo that ''&quot;'John Cardinal Smith' is [neither] WRONG [nor] non-standard.&quot;'' It is traditional usage and completely acceptable. The use of the modern form (Cardinal John Smith) is a sign of the increasingly secular nature of our society, especially since the 1960s. Traditionally, when addressing a bishop (or cardinal), one (even non-Catholics) would say &quot;Your Excellency&quot; (or &quot;Your Eminence&quot; for cardinals). (Apparently, in Europe, people address archbishops as &quot;Your Grace&quot;.) Today most people just addess them as &quot;Bishop&quot;, &quot;Archbishop&quot;, or &quot;Cardinal&quot; (a la &quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;Senator&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;). Interestingly, some newspapers -- in their obituaries -- omit any ecclesiastical honorific. I have seen obits that refer to the deceased priest, bishop, or cardinal as &quot;Mister&quot;, e.g., &quot;In 2000, Mr. Smith was appointed ....&quot; (instead of Fr./Rev./Bishop/Cardinal Smith). Then again, a rose by any other name is still .... Also, some people (if they are very humble) will say (to avoid being offended) &quot;Just don't call me late for dinner.&quot; [[User:Eagle4000|Eagle4000]] ([[User talk:Eagle4000|talk]]) 17:25, 31 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::You are quite right in saying it isn't &quot;wrong&quot; - in the abstract - to use &quot;John Cardinal Smith&quot;.  It appears, however, that in some contexts (in particular, reports for Reuters and Associated Press, publications for the Franciscan Holy Name Province) it is wrong.

::::::I think the issue you raise is separate from the issue of what this article ought to say. Wikipedia already has an entry somewhere in the manual of style regarding use of the two forms in articles when referring to individual clergymen. (I'll find it and edit this comment to link to it.) Wikipedia's policy expressly notes that both forms are allowed, although as I note above the &quot;Cardinal John Smith&quot; form is recommended because it's easier to link to the correct articles when that form is used (as the articles on individual cardinals do not include the word &quot;Cardinal&quot; in the article titles, regardless of where &quot;Cardinal&quot; is placed; the easiest way around this is to use a piped link). THIS article is a different matter because the paragraphs in question are addressing how cardinals are addressed or referred to, and that's not a matter of Wikipedia policy. Put differently, I think it's beyond dispute that both forms (&quot;John Cardinal Smith&quot; and &quot;Cardinal John Smith&quot;) are in regular usage. An article included in something purporting to be an encyclopedia (which is what Wikipedia is) ought to reflect the fact of both forms, simply because that's the fact of the matter. Wikipedia is not itself a manual of style and it's not really appropriate for a site that purports to be neutral to say that one form or another is &quot;the&quot; correct form when there are multiple styles in regular use. In other words, in an article that discusses a topic that itself may be addressed multiple ways, it's desirable, to ensure complete coverage, to address both sides of the issue, or both conventions as it were. Does that make sense? [[User:1995hoo|1995hoo]] ([[User talk:1995hoo|talk]]) 20:49, 31 August 2009 (UTC)
:::::::Following on my prior comment, the Wikipedia style guide in question may be found at [[WP:Naming conventions (Clergy)]]. The relevant section reads as follows: 

:::::::''In the titles of articles, cardinals generally go by their full name (both first name and surname) alone, without the title &quot;Cardinal&quot;, as &quot;Ascanio Sforza&quot;, not &quot;Cardinal Ascanio Sforza&quot;, nor &quot;Ascanio Cardinal Sforza&quot;. Exceptions are cardinals who are identifiable only by the cardinalitial title (as in the case of a hypothetical Cardinal John Smith), those best known by the title &quot;Cardinal&quot; followed by a surname (as Cardinal Richelieu), and those of the period before the introduction of surnames. (For many of the latter, however, their place of origin will serve the same function as a surname.)''

:::::::''When it is necessary to add the title &quot;Cardinal&quot;, it will usually be sufficient to prefix it to the surname of the cardinal, especially in the body of an article, as &quot;Cardinal Sforza&quot;. If both name and surname are used, wikilinking is straightforward if the title is prefixed to the name, as in &quot;Cardinal Ascanio Sforza&quot;. However, those who prefer the form &quot;Ascanio Cardinal Sforza&quot; should take care to ensure there is a redirect to the form used in the title of the article on the cardinal in question, or use a piped link.''

:::::::The second paragraph makes sense when you consider the first paragraph. The article about Cardinal McCarrick, for example, is titled [[Theodore Edgar McCarrick]]. It's not guaranteed, as to any particular cardinal, that a link using EITHER form of &quot;Theodore Cardinal McCarrick&quot; or &quot;Cardinal Theodore McCarrick&quot; (or, for that matter, either form with his middle initial &quot;E.&quot; included) would work. In Cardinal McCarrick's case, &quot;Theodore Cardinal McCarrick&quot; happens to work as a link because someone set up a redirect. &quot;Cardinal Theodore McCarrick&quot; does not work properly, however, because there's no redirect (although it's a minor problem since the article about him shows up as the first one on the resulting search page). I'm not about to try sorting through all the articles about cardinals on this site, but I don't doubt that somewhere there's an article without a redirect from the &quot;John Cardinal Smith&quot; form. That's why for internal Wikipedia usage the form &quot;Cardinal [[Theodore McCarrick]]&quot; (where &quot;Cardinal&quot; is not part of the link) is the most reliable way to ensure proper linking, assuming of course that the target article is named in compliance with Wikipedia standards. Note, however, that the use of the form &quot;Theodore Cardinal McCarrick&quot; is expressly allowed in editing articles per the policy quoted above, but in order to ensure proper linking the best way to do that is to set up the link in the form &quot;Theodore McCarrick|Theodore Cardinal McCarrick&quot; with the whole thing (except the quotation marks, of course) wrapped in double-brackets. 

:::::::BUT, as I said in my previous comment, all this has nothing to do with what should be said in a paragraph that addresses the form of address or style, as that's a separate question. [[User:1995hoo|1995hoo]] ([[User talk:1995hoo|talk]]) 21:02, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

==Retirement age and eligibility for papacy==
I need some help sorting this out.  I understand that Pope Paul VI introduced a mandatory retirement age of 70 for priests and 75 for bishops and archbishops.  But what about cardinals?  Do they just go on forever?  Or, all being at least bishops these days before their elevation to cardinal, are they subject to the 75-year rule for bishops?  Ratzinger was over 75 when elected pope, and he had certainly not retired.  

Then, there's the rule about who can take part in the conclave: cardinals over the age of 80 are ineligible to vote.  That suggests that at least those cardinals over 75, but not yet 80, are still working.  So it looks like the mandatory retirement age does not apply to cardinals, or if there is one, it doesn't cut in till at least 80.  But this is just about voting in the conclave, not about whether they maintain their duties generally speaking.  Further, I've seen nothing that says a cardinal aged over 80 is ineligible to be elected as pope, just ineligible to take part in the voting. 

Can someone clarify all this for me?  Thanks.  --  [[User:JackofOz|&lt;font face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;Jack of Oz&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|&lt;font face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'' ... speak! ... ''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:05, 29 May 2010 (UTC)
:Upon reaching the age of 75, ordinaries are required to submit their resignation, which may be accepted or not by the Pope as he sees fit.(Canon 401 §1). This applies whether the ordinary is a bishop, archbishop, or cardinal. Canon 411 extends the above to coadjutor and auxiliary bishops as well. Canon 354 covers Cardinals that are the head curial departments with the same requirement of presenting their resignation upon reaching the age of 75. Bishops and Cardinals that have retired usually remain active, depending on their abilities and the needs of the Church. There is no age limit on who can be elected to the papacy, and there is no requirement that he be a cardinal. The requirement is that he is eligible to be consecrated a bishop (if not one already).--[[User:Dcheney|Dcheney]] ([[User talk:Dcheney|talk]]) 03:39, 30 May 2010 (UTC)

::::OK.  So, take a cardinal who reaches 75, submits his resignation, and it's accepted by the pope.  He's now officially retired but is still &quot;active&quot; in the sense you describe.  Then the pope dies and they have a conclave.  This retired cardinal may still attend and vote (maybe he's ''required'' to attend and vote?) so long as he has not yet reached 80.  Correct?  Cardinal Ratzinger was 78 when JP2 died, and he was far from retired, so presumably he had submitted his resignation at 75 as required, but it was refused.  Correct?   What's the likelihood of a cardinal who had resigned at 75, and it was accepted, being later elected pope?  --  [[User:JackofOz|&lt;font face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;Jack of Oz&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|&lt;font face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'' ... speak! ...

:::::I would say that it depends on the man.  One can easily imagine that a particular cardinal, actually retired from either his diocese or a post in the Curia, would have a personality that would make him far more likely to win the votes of his colleagues than most of the cardinals still in charge of dioceses or curial departments.  But if you mean what is the ''statistical'' likelihood of that happening, you must put into your calculations the fact that, at any time, only a small minority of the under-80 cardinals are in the position of not only having offered their resignation, but having had it publicly accepted.  Acceptance does not usually happen on the 75th birthday, unless the cardinal explicitly asks for this and sends in his resignation well ahead of the date on which he is obliged to offer it.  Cardinal Thomas Williams of Wellington is an example of a cardinal who actually did that.
:::::Remaining in office does not necessarily mean refusal of an offer of resignation.  It can simply mean a delay in deciding.  Or it can follow an actual decision to accept but with effect from a later date.   Perhaps to allow time to search for and choose a successor.  This can sometimes be a long process.

==Cardinal John Doe v. John Cardinal Doe==
The traditional form of a cardinal's title has been established for centuries upon centuries. Some editors have made unconvincing arguments for why we ought to depart from that form in favor of a novel form advanced (primarily by secular stylebooks and modernist clergy) over the last few decades. It is obvious that we should not. Nor is BRD is a useful model here, because the debate has already played itself out ad nauseum over several years; a glance at the talk page above will show that. I see nothing to be gained from another round of that argument, another round in which those who want to depart from the traditional usage will advance the same tired arguments which those who prefer to get it right will continue to find unpersuasive. Those arguments do not become more attractive with the passage of time; in fact, to some extent, it's just the opposite. Tradition is the yardstick by which &quot;correct&quot; is measured, not the house style of the associated press, and the traditional form is clear.  We should stick with it. (Nor, by the way, was the revert performed appropriate since it threw ought both changes you didn't like and unobjectionable changes. I urge you to work granularly if you must work at all.) &lt;font face=&quot;palatino linotype&quot; color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;- Simon Dodd&lt;/font&gt; &lt;small&gt;{ [[User:Simon Dodd|U]]·[[User talk:Simon Dodd|T]]·[[Special:Contributions/Simon_Dodd|C]]·[[WP:LAW]] }&lt;/small&gt; 01:25, 12 February 2011 (UTC)

What's the best way to handle the wording here?

Increasing the size of the college to one elector above the maximum (setting aside the canonical questions such a point raises) for an exceedingly brief period with a definite and proximate expiry is quite different to an open-ended increase. Even if Benedict had died on November 21, a conclave wouldn't have begun until mid-December (''Universi Dominici Gregis'', no. 49 (John Paul II, 1996)), so the window of potential controversy is incredibly narrow, about five weeks.
