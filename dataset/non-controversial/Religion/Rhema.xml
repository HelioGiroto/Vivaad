'''Rhema''' (ῥῆμα in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]) literally means an &quot;utterance&quot; or &quot;thing said&quot; in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of linguistics'' by Mark Aronoff, Janie Rees-Miller 2003 ISBN 1-4051-0252-7 page 83 [http://books.google.com/books?id=rl8LDiR11nYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sophists (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3, Part 1)'' by W. K. C. Guthrie 1977 ISBN 0-521-09666-9 page 220 [http://books.google.com/books?id=pDOqZfQ5tqUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvF4TLqoCoaG4Qb9zr27Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy, it was used by both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to refer to propositions or sentences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinneen&quot;/&gt; 

In Christianity, it is used in reference to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou''; Jesus Christ's sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun [[wikt:ῥῆμα|ῥῆμα]] &quot;saying, utterance, verb, word&quot; is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) &quot;say&quot; (cf. [[wikt:εἴρω|εἴρω]] &quot;I say&quot;; ἐρῶ &quot;I will say&quot;) and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.  
In the [[New Testament]], this noun is used in such instances as [[1 Peter]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Peter|1:25|NIV}}: “τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα Κυρίου μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα” i.e. “the Lord's utterance/saying remains forever”, or more commonly, &quot;the word of the Lord endureth for ever&quot;.

==Greek philosophers==

| LOGIC || ARISTOTLE || GRAMMAR
|-
| subject || onoma || noun
|-
| predicate || rhema || verb
|-
| proposition || logos || sentence 
|-
|}&lt;/small&gt;

Both [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) used the terms ''logos'', ''rhema'' and ''onoma''. In Plato's usage, a logos (often translatable as a ''sentence'') is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema ''which denotes actions'' and onoma a ''mark set on those who do the actions''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinneen&quot;&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 ISBN 0-87840-278-0 page 118 [http://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: ''onoma'', ''rhema'' and ''logos''. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion - grammar or logic, as in the table on the right. But it was only in the 12th century that grammarians began to think in terms of units we understand as ''subject'' and ''predicate''.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 ISBN 0-521-56532-4 page 29 [http://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema and Logos in Christianity==
In Christianity, ''rhema'' is used in Bible study to signify Jesus Christ's utterance. The Greek word ''rhema'' is useful to distinguish between two meanings of ''word''. While both ''rhema'' and ''logos'' are translated into the English ''word'', in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction. ''Rhema'' is Christ's utterance, while ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'' refers to Christ himself.

===Septuagint usage===
The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms Rhema and [[Logos]] as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew]] word [[Dabar]], as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 ISBN 0-8028-2404-8 page 508 [http://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1995 ISBN 0-8028-3784-0 page 1102 [http://books.google.com/books?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&amp;pg=PA1102&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Old Testament Theology'' by Horst Dietrich Preuss, Leo G. Perdue 1996 ISBN 0-664-21843-1 page 81 [http://books.google.com/books?id=aL6ahptzNiIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=dabar+word&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2wx5TPePJpKA4AammYWFBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20word&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
Some modern usage distinguishes Rhema from Logos in [[Christian Theology]], with Rhema at times called &quot;a word from the Word,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;/&gt; referring to the revelation received by the reader from the [[Holy Spirit]] when the Word (Logos) is read.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;&gt;''What Every Christian Ought to Know'' by Adrian Rogers 2005 ISBN 0-8054-2692-2 page 162 [http://books.google.com/books?id=W0os7ZiHsf0C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Identified Life of Christ'' by Joe Norvell 2006 ISBN 1-59781-294-3 page [http://books.google.com/books?id=3FAhz_eshkMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this usage, &quot;Logos&quot; refers to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian controversy'' by William G. Rusch 1980 ISBN 0-8006-1410-0 page 4 [http://books.google.com/books?id=IZ0lrSi9McYC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=christ+logos+word&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vah5TKiOJYnIswbG_qiyDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=christ%20logos%20word&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this modern usage, Logos is the &quot;Word of God&quot; Jesus Christ, the subject from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. Rhema is the revealed word of God, as an utterance from God to the heart of the reader via the [[Holy Spirit]], as in [[Gospel of John|John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|14:26|NIV}}
&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=zzHMhw7Ty2cC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FUp4TIfyENHGOPTltOcG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false ''Holy Spirit, Teach Me'' by Brenda Boggs 2008 ISBN 1-60477-425-8 page 80]&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;... the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this usage Rhema refers to &quot;a word that is spoken&quot;, when the Holy Spirit delivers a message to the heart as in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|10:17|NIV}}:&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gnWKWYkBwMcC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false ''The Fight of Every Believer'' by Terry Law ISBN 1-57794-580-8 page 45]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ. (rhematos Christou)&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|4:4|NIV}}: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word (rhema) that comes from the mouth of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Use in the New Testament==
===In reference to ''Rhematos Christou''===
From ''[[Strong's Concordance|Strong's Concordance of the Bible]]'' (Greek word #4487) Rhema can be found in the following (non exhaustive) [[New Testament]] passages to refer to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou'':

*Romans 10:17-18 &quot;But it is in that way faith comes, from hearing, and that means hearing the word (rhematos) of Christ. Well then, I say, is it possible that they have not heard? Indeed they have: in the entire earth their voice stands out, their message (rhemata) reaches the whole world.&quot;
*2 Corinthians 12:4 &quot;That he was caught up into Paradise and heard words (rhemata) said that cannot and may not be spoken by any human being.&quot;
*2 Corinthians 13:1 &quot;This third time I come to you. By the mouth of two witnesses and three every saying (rhema) is established.&quot;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Not in reference to ''Rhamtus Christou'' but simply to ''anybody's uttering''===
