      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5000">The '''episcopate''' is the collective body of all [[bishop]]s of a church. The term is also used to refer to the status or term in office of an individual bishop.

In the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Eastern-rite Catholic|Eastern Rite Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Old Catholic Church|Old-Catholic]], [[Moravian Church]], and [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]] churches as well as in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], it is held that only a person in [[Apostolic Succession]], a line of succession of bishops dating back to the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]]s, can be a [[bishop]], and only such a person can validly [[ordination|ordain]] Christian clergy. The succession must be transmitted from each bishop to a successor by the rite of [[Holy Orders]]. Bishops in valid [[Apostolic Succession]] compose the '''historical episcopate'''. Bishops of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] also claim to be ordained through the [[laying on of hands]] of bishops in the apostolic succession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/fullcommunion/episcopal/ccmresources/text.html#C Called to Common Mission Text, paragraph 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] holds that a bishop's consecration is valid if the [[sacrament]] of Holy Orders is validly administered with the intention of doing what the Church does by ordination and according to a valid sacramental form, and if the consecrating bishop's orders are valid, regardless of whether the rite takes place within or outside of the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, Roman Catholics recognize the validity of the episcopacy of Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East and Old Catholic bishops, but the situation is less clear regarding Anglican bishops and Independent Catholic bishops (see [[Episcopi vagantes]]).

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s view has been summarised as follows: &quot;While accepting the canonical possibility of recognising the existence (υποστατόν) of sacraments performed outside herself, (the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]) questions their validity (έγκυρον) and certainly rejects their efficacy (ενεργόν)&quot;; and it sees &quot;the canonical recognition (αναγνώρισις) of the validity of sacraments performed outside the Orthodox Church (as referring) to the validity of the sacraments only of those who join the Orthodox Church (individually or as a body).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/pheidas_limits_2.html Professor Dr. Vlassios Pheidas: ''Τhe limits of the church in an orthodox perspective'']&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to the validity and efficacy of the ordination of bishops and the other sacraments, not only of the [[Independent Catholic Churches]], but also of all other Christian Churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. 

The Eastern Orthodox position on Anglican orders (in the hypothesis of Anglican bishops joining the Orthodox Church individually or as a body) is controversial, involving disagreements among national churches, theologians, and bishops. Because of changes in the Ordinal (the rites of Holy Orders) under [[King Edward VI]], the Roman Catholic Church does not fully recognize all Anglican Holy Orders as valid, but the latter are recognized (and participated in) by Old Catholics, whose Holy Orders are considered valid by Rome.

Lutheran and other episcopally ordered [[Protestant]] successions are not recognized by Roman Catholics. The Anglican Church does not recognise the orders of non-episcopal denominations.

More than 91% of the world's more than 5,000 living Western bishops trace their [[Apostolic Succession|episcopal lineage]] back to 16th century bishop [[Scipione Rebiba|Scipione Cardinal Rebiba]].  In the early 18th century, [[Pope Benedict XIII]], whose orders descended from Rebiba, personally consecrated at least 139 bishops for various important European sees, including those in [[Germany]], [[France]], [[England]] and the [[New World]]. These bishops in turn largely consecrated new bishops only in their respective countries, effectively erasing other episcopal lines.&lt;ref&gt;Bransom, Charles.'Ordinations of U. S.
