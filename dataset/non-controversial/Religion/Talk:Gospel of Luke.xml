== EBO ==

Leadwind, what about 'the author is unknown' makes you think the proper context is 'the majority of scholars agree that the author is unknown'? EBO is making a non-controversial statement that we ultimately don't know who the author is. You are framing it in a way that suggests scholars mostly reject Lukan authorship. What about this don't you understand?[[User:RomanHistorian|RomanHistorian]] ([[User talk:RomanHistorian|talk]]) 15:46, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

:For those of you following along at home, this is what EBO says about who wrote Luke:
::''The author has been identified with Luke, “the beloved physician,” Paul’s companion on his journeys, presumably a Gentile (Col. 4:14 and 11; cf. II Tim. 4:11, Philem. 24). There is no Papias fragment concerning Luke, and only late-2nd-century traditions claim (somewhat ambiguously) that Paul was the guarantor of Luke’s Gospel traditions. The Muratorian Canon refers to Luke, the physician, Paul’s companion; Irenaeus depicts Luke as a follower of Paul’s gospel. Eusebius has Luke as an Antiochene physician who was with Paul in order to give the Gospel apostolic authority. References are often made to Luke’s medical language, but there is no evidence of such language beyond that to which any educated Greek might have been exposed. Of more import is the fact that in the writings of Luke specifically Pauline ideas are significantly missing; while Paul speaks of the death of Christ, Luke speaks rather of the suffering, and there are other differing and discrepant ideas on Law and eschatology. In short, the author of this gospel remains unknown.''&lt;br /&gt;
:Roman would like this paragraph to mean that &quot;Ultimately, of course, we can't really be certain who wrote the book.&quot; Considered as a whole, the paragraph actually says something more like, &quot;The evidence weighs against the traditional view.&quot; Since WP policy is to identify the viewpoint found in commonly accepted references as the &quot;viewpoint of the majority,&quot; we call this viewpoint the majority viewpoint.

'''Inane''' Of course the traditional view is mainstream. It is the view held by the vast majority of NT scholars - we are putting undue weight on the &quot;historical Jesus&quot; folk who make their living by being controversial. 

The Gospel according to Luke has been known by this name since antiquity and there is no good reason to doubt Luke wrote it anymore than there is doubt about Shakespearean authorship of Hamlet.

Deleting this explicit scholarly source, and replacing it with an out-of-context quote from an online encyclopedia is blatant POV pushing. Sources should not be deleted, let alone so many at once.

Here are some sources people might consider using. Johnson in ABDY.

* &quot;Luke apparently accompanied Paul on his journey to Rome, and is the reputed author of the gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. See LUKE-ACTS, BOOK OF. This entry consists of two articles assessing Luke’s accomplishments as an historian and as a theologian.&quot;, Luke Timothy Johnson, 'Luke-Acts, Books of', in Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 4: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (397). New York: Doubleday.
* &quot;Any discussion of the circumstances accompanying the production of Luke-Acts is inevitably circular. There are few external guideposts, so conclusions must be based on internal evidence, which can—notoriously—be construed in quite different ways. The issues of dating and authorship, for example, mutually impinge; and to a remarkable degree, each depends on a reader’s overall conception of the writing.&quot;, Luke Timothy Johnson, 'Luke-Acts, Books of', in Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 4: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (404). New York: Doubleday.
* &quot;The ancient manuscripts attribute the gospel to a certain Luke, whom patristic writers unanimously identify as the companion of Paul (Philemon 24; Col 4:14; 2 Tim 4:11), a supposition apparently supported by the so-called “we passages” of Acts (cf. 16:10–17; 20:5–15; 21:8–18; 27:1–28:16) in which the narrator suddenly shifts from third-person to first-person narration, suggesting the presence of an eyewitness (Fitzmyer Luke I–IX AB, 36). Critical scholarship has challenged the traditional attribution, arguing that the tone, perspective, and purposes of Luke-Acts better fit a later, “second-generation” composition (Loning 1981). A very late dating would obviously disqualify any companion of Paul as author. “Second-generation,” however, is scarcely a precise designation. To place Luke-Acts as late as the 2d century (O’Neill 1961) is excessive. In fact, nothing in the writing prohibits composition by a companion of Paul and an eyewitness to some events.&quot;, Luke Timothy Johnson, 'Luke-Acts, Books of', in Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 4: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (404). New York: Doubleday.

Ellis in ISBE.

* &quot;While most scholars continued to affirm Lukan authorship, some German writers in the mid-20th cent again raised objections (cf. Kümmel, intro, pp. 147–150; Ellis, Gospel of Luke, pp. 42–52). They pointed to theological emphases and historical descriptions in Luke-Acts that differ fundamentally from those in Paul’s letters. Their objections rested in part on exegetical judgements, e.g., a philosophical interpretation of the Areopagus speech, the general attitude toward the law in Acts, and the traditional identification of Gal. 2 with the conference in Acts 15. They also presupposed the second century tradition that Luke was a disciple of Paul and would therefore have reflected his theology. In each instance the conclusions are questionable, if not doubtful; in some they are only a return to the views of F. C. Baur.&quot;, EE Ellis, in Bromiley, G. W. (1988; 2002). Vol. 3: The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised (185). Wm. B. Eerdmans.
* &quot;While the scholars mentioned above offered many valuable insights, their general reconstruction and concomitant conclusion about the authorship of Luke-Acts were untenable. Recent work (e.g., of Fitzmyer, Hengel, and Marshall) has tended to confirm the tradition of Lukan authorship, which is, on the whole, consistent with the literary and historical character of the documents and can be accepted with reasonable certainty.&quot;, EE Ellis, in Bromiley, G. W. (1988; 2002). Vol. 3: The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised (185). Wm. B. Eerdmans.

Ian Howard Marshall, in NBD.

* &quot;The question of the authorship of Lk. is closely bound up with that of Acts. The two books are parts of one work, and attempts to deny their common authorship have not been successful. The traditional ascription of both books to *LUKE still remains the most probable view. The evidence is basically derived from *ACTS. So far as the Gospel is concerned, it contains little concrete evidence for or against the traditional ascription of authorship. The claim that it breathes the atmosphere of the sub-apostolic period (i.e. the time after Luke’s death) is too subjective to carry any conviction.&quot;, IH Marshall, in Wood, D. R. W., &amp; Marshall, I. H. (1996). New Bible dictionary (3rd ed.) (704). Leicester, England; Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press.
* &quot;In one sense, identification of the author of the Gospel sheds little light on it, since we know scarcely anything about the author additional to what can be gleaned from Lk. and Acts. In another sense, however, the knowledge of the author’s identity is valuable because it confirms that he was a person well qualified (in accordance with his own explicit claim) to learn the contents of the Gospel tradition and to reformulate them. The historical credentials of the Gospel are greater than if it was the work of some unknown figure from a later date.&quot;, IH Marshall, in Wood, D. R. W., &amp; Marshall, I. H. (1996). New Bible dictionary (3rd ed.) (704). Leicester, England; Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press.
* &quot;Although there is a tradition of uncertain date connecting the composition of the Gospel with Achaia, there is nothing in the writing itself to substantiate this view. It is more likely that we should connect the Gospel with Rome (where Mk. was available and where Luke was present with Paul) or with Antioch in Syria (with which Luke is also connected by what is probably a more reliable tradition, and where the ‘Q’ source which he shared with Matthew was probably compiled). Behind the Gospel, however, there ultimately lie traditions current in Palestine. Luke’s connection with the early church in Palestine and Syria is ultimately of more significance than where he adventitiously happened to produce his Gospel.&quot;, IH Marshall, Wood, D. R. W., &amp; Marshall, I. H. (1996). New Bible dictionary (3rd ed.) (704). Leicester, England; Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press.

Black, in CPNIVC.

* &quot;Given strong external and internal evidence for Lukan authorship, one may wonder why much of contemporary scholarship rejects the notion entirely.6 The answer is based on internal evidence which is said to disallow Lukan authorship. Quite simply, the book of Acts presents a view of Paul the Christian who appears to be quite different from the Paul who wrote the letters, especially Galatians. The book of Acts does not cite or even mention Paul’s letters. More significantly, it is argued that the theological portrait of Paul in Acts could not have been painted by a companion of Paul. Luke’s portrait is especially problematic with regard to Paul’s stance on keeping the Law.7 We must admit that it is somewhat surprising when Paul, who wrote that, “All who rely on observing the Law are under a curse,” (Gal 3:10), consistently upholds the Law in Acts. Most notably, James in Acts 21:24 encourages Paul to help the four men under a vow in order to show that “you yourself are living in obedience to the Law.”8&quot;, Black, M. C. (1996). Luke. College Press NIV commentary. Joplin, Mo.: College Press Pub.

* Efforts to argue that the Third Gospel demonstrates that its author was a doctor have been abandoned today. Hobart argued that the sheer number of healing stories and the vocabulary demonstrated that Luke was a physician.10 However, Cadbury later refuted these claims by proving that Luke showed no more “medical” language than other educated writers of his day.11 Of course, the healing stories and “medical” vocabulary are consistent with authorship by a physician. They simply do not prove it.&quot;, Black, M. C. (1996). Luke. College Press NIV commentary. Joplin, Mo.: College Press Pub.

Green, in NICNT.

* &quot;Although the most likely candidate for the authorship of Luke-Acts is Luke the physician and sometime companion of Paul,67 the author himself has not included his name within the Gospel itself and the title, “according to Luke,” was added by others only decades later.&quot;, Green, J. B. (1997). The Gospel of Luke. The New International Commentary on the New Testament (21). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Bock, in BECNT.

* &quot;Fitzmyer (1981: 40) divides the external evidence handily into two categories: what can be deduced from the NT and what cannot be deduced from it. That Luke was a physician, was tied to Paul, was not an eyewitness, and wrote his Gospel with concern for Gentiles are facts the NT makes clear. That Luke was from Syria, proclaimed Paul’s gospel, was unmarried, was childless, and died at an old age are ideas that are not in the NT. Though the differences about Luke’s age at death tell us that not everything in these traditions is indisputably true, their unity about authorship makes almost certain the identification of Luke as the Gospel’s author. The tradition’s testimony also makes Luke’s connection to Paul very likely.&quot;, Bock, D. L. (1994). Luke Volume 1: 1:1-9:50. Baker exegetical commentary on the New Testament (5–6). Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books.

* &quot;Most commentators identify Luke as a Gentile without any further detail. They (1) point to Col. 4:10–11, 14, (2) note Acts 1:19, which mentions a field with a Semitic name and then speaks of “their” language, and (3) point out the attention to Hellenistic locales and the concern for Gentiles. This last argument is not strong, since a Jew like Paul could fit into such geographical locales and concerns. In sum, it seems very likely that Luke was a Gentile, though it is unclear whether his cultural background was Semitic. In any case, he probably had religious contact with Judaism before coming to Christ.&quot;, Bock, D. L. (1994). Luke Volume 1: 1:1-9:50. Baker exegetical commentary on the New Testament (6–7). Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books.

* &quot;Colossians 4:14 refers to Luke as a doctor. In 1882, Hobart tried to bolster this connection by indicating all the technical verbal evidence for Luke’s vocation. Despite the wealth of references Hobart gathered, the case was rendered ambiguous by the work of Cadbury (1926), who showed that almost all of the alleged technical medical vocabulary appeared in everyday Greek documents such as the LXX, Josephus, Lucian, and Plutarch. This meant that the language could have come from a literate person within any vocation. Cadbury’s work does not, however, deny that Luke could have been a doctor, but only that the vocabulary of these books does not guarantee that he was one.&quot;, Bock, D. L. (1994).

Ian Howard Marshall, in NIGTC.

* &quot;The Gospel itself is anonymous and contains no information which would enable us to identify its author, although one may draw some conclusions regarding his milieu and situation. That he wrote for an urban church community in the Hellenistic world is fairly certain. From the latter half of the second century onwards the clear and consistent verdict of early church writers is that he was Luke, the ‘beloved physician’ and the companion of Paul. It is sometimes claimed that this tradition is simply an intelligent deduction from the NT evidence that Acts was written by a companion of Paul, who is most likely to have been Luke; consequently, it is argued, the tradition has no independent value. But the argument is stronger than this. The tradition in question may date back to the first half of the second century (Bruce, 4–8), and it is unequivocal in singling out Luke from among several possible candidates among Paul’s companions during the period covered by the ‘we’ sections in Acts. There is never any suggestion of a rival candidate for the honour of writing the Gospel. Attempts have been made to strengthen the argument for authorship by a physician by finding examples of medical phraseology in Luke-Acts; these are too few to be made the basis of an argument, but there is perhaps just sufficient evidence to corroborate a view more firmly based on other considerations. The traditional view of authorship faces two main difficulties. One is based on the evidence of Acts, where, it is claimed, the picture of Paul is too far removed from historical reality to be the work of a companion of the apostle. This point lies beyond the scope of a commentary on the Gospel, but reference may be made to Luke: Historian and Theologian where reasons are given for disputing the point (see further Ellis, 42–52). The other point is that Luke is said to give the impression of writing at a time when the early church had settled down into its ‘early catholic’ period; consequently he belonged to the post-Pauline period. But again the argument fails to convince.&quot;, Marshall, I. H. (1978). The Gospel of Luke : A commentary on the Greek text. The New international Greek testament commentary (33–34). Exeter [Eng.: Paternoster Press.

Nolland, in WBC.

* &quot;How do we evaluate this traditional ascription? The role attributed to Luke in the NT is quite modest. In Philem 24 he occurs in a list of Paul’s fellow workers. In Col 4:14 Luke the beloved physician sends greetings (and is normally thought to be of non-Jewish origin on the basis of v 11, though this can be read in other ways). In 2 Tim 4:11 he is said to be Paul’s sole companion. That is all, unless we identify this Luke with the Lucius (Λούκιος) who is said to be kinsman of Paul in Rom 16:21. The tradition has certainly exploited these texts to maximize the link with Paul; but this is clearly in the context of the sub-apostolic standing of Luke, which itself constituted a problem for the recognition of this text as Scripture and canon. One could argue that the Gospel preface (1:1–4) necessitated attribution to a non-apostolic figure, and that given this constraint, Luke offered a figure with attested apostolic links. Cadbury (“The Tradition,” 2:260–61) and Haenchen (Acts, 14) go further and argue that Lukan authorship was probably inferred from a comparison of the information of the “we” passages in Acts with the information to be gleaned about Paul’s companions from the letters and from Acts. This would not be impossible but does seem more like the kind of exegetical activity which came only later. I remain impressed by the degree to which the Lukan authorship comes through in the tradition as a problem to be met, rather than as a piece of good fortune (which would, for that reason, be suspected of being only the product of wishful thinking). Though the Gospel preface clearly plays a role in the tradition, it would seem that the tradition begins from the attribution to Luke and expounds on that, partly in the light of the material of the preface, rather than the material of the preface serving as the beginning point for the growth of the tradition. In the end the argument is not decisive, and further considerations have been offered both in favor of and against Lukan authorship.&quot;, Nolland, J. (2002).

Ian Howard Marshall, in NBC.

* &quot;From the second half of the second century AD onwards there is a clear and consistent belief that the writer of this gospel (and Acts) was Luke, the doctor and companion of Paul (Col. 4:14). It has sometimes been argued that this belief is nothing more than an intelligent deduction from the NT evidence that Luke-Acts was written by the companion of Paul who was present during the episodes described in Acts in the first person plural form (Acts 16:10–17, etc). Among Paul’s possible companions Luke is a plausible choice. It can then be argued that the belief has no independent value as a testimony to the earliest tradition, but is simply one of several possible ‘guesses’. However, we may note that the tradition is quite unequivocal in naming Luke and not any other companion of Paul. Moreover this tradition is fairly early (possibly c. AD 120), and there is not the faintest hint of any alternative view in the early church. Marcion, an early Christian heretic, who held faithfully to Paul alone as his apostolic authority, selected Luke’s gospel as his one gospel; presumably he accepted the tradition that it was written by Paul’s companion. Against the tradition it has been argued: 1. The picture of Paul in Acts is so distorted that it can hardly have been written by a companion and contemporary of Paul. 2. The gospel has the atmosphere of a time, after the apostles, when the church had given up hope of the imminent return of Jesus and had settled down into the form of rather conventional, institutional life sometimes known as ‘early catholicism’. Neither of these arguments is strong enough to overcome the tradition.&quot;, Carson, D. A. (1994). New Bible commentary : 21st century edition (4th ed.).

::::::So without having actually read them, you think they must be &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;archaic' just because RH thinks they're good. Here's a quick review for those who don't like reading.
::::::* Johnson: Says Luke is the '''reputed''' author of Luke/Acts, says critical scholarship has challenged the traditional attribution, says that it is not impossible for Luke to have been written by &quot;a companion of Paul&quot;, but does not say more than this
::::::* Ellis: Says the traditional attribution of Luke/Acts to Luke is still the most probable and can be accepted with reasonable certainty, notes 20th century criticism of the traditional view
::::::* Marshall (NBD): Says the composition of Luke/Acts by Luke is still most probable, but says the gospel of Luke contains little concrete evidence for or against the traditional ascription of authorship
::::::* Black: States explicitly that much of contemporary scholarship rejects the traditional attribution, lists '''criticisms''' of the traditional attribution, and points out that attempts to prove the author of the gospel of Luke was a physician have failed
::::::* Green: Says that the traditional attribution is most likely, but acknowledges the attribution was made decades after the gospel was written
::::::* Bock: Cites Fitzmyer's assessment of the external evidence, says Luke as the author of the gospel is &quot;almost certain&quot;, and points out that attempts to prove the author of the gospel of Luke was a physician have failed
::::::* Marshall (NIGTC): Says the Gospel itself is anonymous and contains no information which would enable us to identify its author, says the traditional view of authorship faces two main difficulties and explains those difficulties, directing the reader to arguments against them
::::::* Nolland: Says the argument is not decisive, and further considerations have been offered both in favor of and against Lukan authorship
::::::* Marshall (NBC): Presents two arguments against the tradition and says they aren't strong enough to contradict it
::::::In all seriousness, it is ludicrous to describe these views as conservative and archaic. It's conservative to say that the argument for Lukan authorship '''isn't decisive'''? It's archaic to say that attempts to prove the author of the gospel was a physician '''have failed'''? It's conservative and archaic to say that the traditional view '''is rejected by much contemporary scholarship'''?
::::::Meanwhile, looking at the references in the article which were considered sufficiently scholarly and which are used to criticize traditional views of Luke, I find:
::::::* A work by the devoutly religious conservative FF Bruce, from 1952
::::::* Works by the equally religious Bruce Metzger
::::::* Lutheran David Aune
::::::* Catholic priest John Meier
::::::* The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica (not exactly up to date, hardly scholarly)
::::::* Strong's concordance (over 100 years old and considered utterly worthless by current scholarship)
::::::You cannot possibly tell me that you're going to object to the likes of Marshall, Ellis, and Bock, if you have no objection to these sources being used.

{{od}}In my opinion, the pro christian presses should be largely avoided because they would be [[WP:QS]]. Similarly, we would also avoid any pro atheistic or pro x$ presses. Secondly, Eardmans should be used with some care. My impression is that it produces both types of stuff. Promotional, as well as academic. So, we may have to look at the particular author to see what other works of his has been published, and by what type of presses. Publishing by Eardmans should not be taken as an indication one way or the other. And, in my view, looking at publishers as a  way of determining reliability is in keeping with WP policy. There is nothing archaic about it.-[[User:Civilizededucation|&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Civilized&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;education&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Civilizededucation|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:33, 19 November 2010 (UTC)
:[[WP:QS]] states that &quot;Questionable sources are those with a poor reputation for checking the facts, or with no editorial oversight&quot;. Applying this rule means that any source to be identified as [[WP:QS]] must first be proved to have a poor reputation for checking the facts, or with no editorial oversight. So if you want to exclude certain publishers as [[WP:QS]] you must first prove that they have a poor reputation for checking the facts, or with no editorial oversight. Simply saying &quot;I think Christian presses are [[WP:RS]] because I don't trust Christians to be objective&quot; is not an application of Wiki policy; it's a personal POV. I agree that individual authors need to be assessed, not just publishers. IH Marshall for example is a particularly well known and commonly cited Lukan scholar. I also agree that looking at publishers is a good way to determine reliability.

:::::The point at issue is not whether or not they are 'pro christian presses'. Please read what Leadwind says, he has expressed the point well. As for promotional sources, there's hardly a source less promotional than the Jesus Seminar, quoted favourably in the article. Likewise, Erhman is included in the article despite the fact that one of his work cited (&quot;Misquoting Jesus&quot;), was published by HarperCollins (not by an academic press), and the fact that Erhman is unashamedly promoting a personal point of view, including claims for textual criticism which are not supported by the text critical scholarly consensus. So clearly &quot;non-promotional&quot; is a rule being applied somewhat &quot;flexibly&quot; to sources in this article, and that's putting it politely.--[[User:Taiwan boi|Taiwan boi]] ([[User talk:Taiwan boi|talk]]) 09:34, 21 November 2010 (UTC)
:::::I agree with CE that we should avoid promotional sources. Especially when we are trying to strike a balance, it's key that we refer to &quot;disinterested&quot; sources to measure the relative weight of different viewpoints. Promotional sources are not disinterested so they are the wrong place to look when trying to achieve balance (see [[WP:WEIGHT]]). I also agree with Tb that &quot;When a work published by Eerdmans, IVP, or even College Press is reviewed positively, cited, or otherwise treated professionally in [[WP:RS]], we should treat it appropriately.&quot; Eerdmans I've never objected to (nor Fortress, Paulist, etc.). If there really is an IVP or College Press book that disinterested, nonpromotional RSs treat as scholarly and respectable, we should do that same. Also, when these books or any other books express a minority view (e.g., Luke wrote Luke) then we should label it the minority viewpoint. J.A.T. Robinson seems to be the most prominent recent scholar who advocated for an apostolic connection for each gospel. He seems most prominent because he gets mentioned in tertiary sources. We should cite him regardless of his publisher because he's made it into the circle of scholars that we are instructed to pay attention to.

::::::@TaiwanBoi. Academic standing is the only thing which matters on Wikipedia. Your and mine idiosyncratic ideas don't count. The JS has an unparalleled academic significance. And Ehrman's academic standing is as unassailable as that of Brown, Metzger, Aune, Meier. Meier is a priest. He also has some pretty singular ideas on the miracles. But these things don't matter. They get overruled by their academic standing. Most of Ehrman's works are published by OUP. This is enough to conclude that he has an unassailable academic standing. RomanHistorian too has some pretty weird ideas. Vermes is anti christian. Ehrman, Pagels are attacking christianity. Harris is fringe for him. And the JS too is unusable for him. You guys probably don't know about Ludemann and Crossan. You would balk when you find out what they think. But it dosen't matter. Academic standing does. And conformity to traditional thinking/ likeability among christians doesn't. Most of your problems seem to be because you don't seem to understand this point and because you seem to be unfamiliar with the current mainstream academic thinking. On the whole, you wanted to know why some sources are preferable, while others are unpreferred. You have the answers now. If you still can't see it, it's ''your'' problem. Deal with it yourself.

:::::::'''[1]''' If you had read my previous agreement with Leadwind, you would find that I am not RomanHistorian nor do I share his view. I agree that academic standing matters. But academic standing does not mean that authors are always free from promotional POV. FF Bruce and Metzger both have high academic standing, as do Meier and Aune. Yet they all have views which are not mainstream, and all of them promote one non-mainstream view of another as you're well aware (your reference to Meier's miracles is a case in point). This does not stop you using them in the article, '''and nor should it'''. Ehrman is a scholar whose views are relevant, and can be cited here, but should be identified as minority views when they are actually minority views, and he should be identified as a promotional source when he's being blatantly promotional. Regardless of the fact that two of his works have been published by the OUP, he is explicitly promotional and a number of his claims are rejected by the entire scholarly consensus on text criticism. He makes claims of inauthenticity for certain texts which have a '''B rating in NA 27/UBS 4'''; how can you possibly expect me to take him seriously over the likes of [[Kurt Aland|Aland]], [[Carlo Maria Martini|Martini]], [[Bruce Metzger|Metzger]], and [[Allen Wikgren|Big Allen]]? He makes claims of conspiratorial textual editing for theological and ideological reasons which have received no support from the broader scholarly consensus. He does this specifically because he is writing to promote a personal POV; he's an ex-evangelical who's trying to convince religious people they shouldn't believe in the Bible. '''I am not saying he should not be included as a source'''. I haven't said the Jesus Seminar shouldn't be used a a source either. I'm simply pointing out that '''your''' claim that you want to exclude certain sources on the basis that they're &quot;promotional&quot; is simply not true. If you really believed that then the Jesus Seminar wouldn't be included in this article, and nor would Ehrman. You would at least identify Ehrman's conspiratorial text critical claims as a minority viewpoint, but you don't want to do that either.
:::::::'''[2]''' Moving on, there's nothing you can tell me about the relevant literature that I don't know. I have a personal library worth over US$50,000 which rivals some seminaries.

Ever since I did so I've met resistance from the very people I'm trying to help, who fail to read just about anything I write and who keep accusing me of being a virtual clone of RomanHistorian, even when I've opposed his edits and sided against him with Leadwind.

To be told that none of them were valid sources for the '''minority position''', was just ridiculous. I believe that the article would benefit from some of those sources being included in a description of the minority position on authorship, and probably most if not all of them could be used in the article on the authorship of Luke/Acts in order to demonstrate that even mainstream Christian commentators agree, at least in part, with certain arguments raised by the majority position. In particular, the article on the authorship of Luke/Acts says &quot;Some claim that the vocabulary used in Luke-Acts suggests its author may have had medical training, but this claim has been widely disputed&quot;, and has a &quot;who?&quot; tag next to it.

:Thank you, Andrew. I would like the article to say that in the majority viewpoint the evidence against the author being a companion of Paul's is compelling enough that the evangelist is considered to be unknown. And I would like the article to also describe the opinion in support of Lukan authorship, giving it due weight as a significant minority viewpoint. Until we can agree which view is in the majority, we can't agree on how to treat each view with proper weight. I call the unknown-author theory the majority view because because it's what I see in my commonly accepted reference text (EBO), and because support for the Luke view is so faint. Roman can cite InterVarsity Press all he likes in the minority view section, which should be smaller than the majority view section. If someone can cite me a commonly accepted reference text of comparable value that contradicts EBO, I'll of course be willing to shift positions.

== Sources on authorship: Rick Strelan ==

[http://www.uq.edu.au/hprc/index.html?page=21291 Rick Strelan], who has been published in academic journals such as [[Journal for the Study of the New Testament|JSNT]], [[Journal of Theological Studies|JTS]] (Oxford), and [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201924&amp;crossRegion=asia BTB], as well as by academic publishers such as [[Ashgate Publishing]] and [[Walter de Gruyter]], had &quot;Luke the priest: the authority of the author of the Third Gospel&quot; published in 2008 by Ashgate Publishing. The following is an excerpt from his review of commentary supporting the traditional view of authorship (pp. 99-100).  Bold emphasis mine.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Others, however, are quite convinced that Luke, the fellow-worker and companion of Paul, was in fact the author, and that the tradition therefore is reliable and credible. '''Significant and reputable Luke-Acts scholars such as Hengel, Fitzmyer, and Marshall would belong to that group'''. Hengel argues that the titles of the Gospels were uniform in the second century, and he believes that the superscriptions 'have been completely neglected in recent scholarship' (2000:48). He is very critical of those who refuse to accept that the tiles were very old and not late-second century additions (2000:55). Fitzmyer concludes that most of the modern arguments &quot;do not militate against the traditional identification of the author of the Third Gospel and Acts with Luke, the Syrian from Antioch, who had been a sometime collaborate of the Apostle Paul' (1981:51; compare also 53). '''And there are many others'''.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Thornton''' (1991) thinks there are only two viable possibilities: Either Luke, the fellow-worker and traveling companion of Paul, is the author, or someone wrote under his name. '''Nolland''' believes there are no good counter-arguments, so it is best to read the tradition as the preservation of reliable memory (1989: 1. xxxvii). '''Riley''' joins in, saying there is 'overwhelming evidence to support the traditional ascription of authorship' (1993: vii). '''Eckey''' is another recent scholar who is convinced that there is enough evidence to support the traditional theory that Luke, the doctor and companion of Paul, was the author (2004: 49). '''For Riley and Eckey, as for many others, much hinges on three factors''': The tradition that almost unanimously ascribes the Gospel and Acts to 'Luke'; the 'we' passages in Acts suggest the author is an eyewitness and a companion of Paul; and the medical language and interest found in both writings fit the language and interest of a physician, and Luke held that profession, as Col 4:14 states. '''But each of these arguments can be, and has been, questioned'''.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strelan's work is already found cited in the relevant scholarly literature, so he would appear to be both [[WP:NOTE]] and [[WP:RS]]. The question is, do people agree or disagree that these comments of his are relevant to the authorship section of the article? Personally I believe it's well balanced by his final sentence, and that the sources he notes are worthy of mention if only because he feels the need to mention them in a review of the relevant literature (I was not surprised to see IH Marshall in his list; Marshall is recognized as one of the standard Lukan scholars). I have a number of other academic sources to offer on the same question, taking different views, but I'd like to deal with one source at a time for now.--[[User:Taiwan boi|Taiwan boi]] ([[User talk:Taiwan boi|talk]]) 10:35, 22 November 2010 (UTC)

:These look like really good notes. The trick is to keep a balance between majority and minority views, so one can't just add extensive material to one side or the other. But these notes are way better than Vermes's off-handed comment about &quot;many&quot; scholars, which is a tangent in his work. So replace the second-rate information already there with this good stuff, and we're ahead.

::Great, glad this will prove useful. I spent some time going through my sources today, and you'll see some of my work in the Luke-Acts authorship article. I didn't want to touch the Luke article without checking first. As an aside, I was impressed to see a prof from UQ with such a high scholarly standing.--[[User:Taiwan boi|Taiwan boi]] ([[User talk:Taiwan boi|talk]]) 15:53, 22 November 2010 (UTC)

== Authorship of Luke-Acts ==

I have made a number of contributions to the article on the authorship of Luke-Acts, so I hope I haven't trodden on any toes here. It seemed that no one had contributed significantly to it for some time, so I decided to be bold. I intend to rework the article further.--[[User:Taiwan boi|Taiwan boi]] ([[User talk:Taiwan boi|talk]]) 11:48, 22 November 2010 (UTC)

{{Collapse top}}
{{Content of Matthew}}
{{Collapse bottom}}
The article on the gospel of Matthew has this portal for the content. It would save a lot of space if it could be adapted for Luke. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 07:09, 14 June 2011 (UTC)

== varriation between the wiki pages for each gosple ==

It strikes me that the pages for each gospel are quite different, for example the gospel of matter has themes as a heading, whereas none of the others do (though each of them, so far as I can see contain material that could go under such a heading). I think that this problem could be fixed relatively simply and without any major additions and would be a substantial addition to all four as it would make them much easier to navigate, compare and understand. Just an idea. [[Special:Contributions/124.254.80.71|124.254.80.71]] ([[User talk:124.254.80.71|talk]]) 07:51, 22 June 2011 (UTC)

== Donald Guthrie &quot; Christian scholar&quot;? ==

I can't understand why Donald Guthrie  is referred as &quot;Christian scholar&quot; while for other scholars (i.e. Streeter, Brown, Koester) there is no reference to their religion...--[[Special:Contributions/95.247.63.150|95.247.63.150]] ([[User talk:95.247.63.150|talk]]) 11:16, 21 October 2011 (UTC)

== Chapter Articles ==

Not sure whether this is the right place for this inquiry, but here goes:
[[Luke 1]], [[Luke 2]], [[Luke 3]] and [[Luke 4]] all have their own articles, but then [[Luke 5]], [[Luke 6]] etc. all redirect back to this article. Any reason why they stop at 4? It looks like a project was started but not finished. Either we should have no chapter articles, or all the chapters - but not this halfway-house.

== Book of Luke being anonymous. ==

User 82.3.94.209 and A Georgian, here is a place for you two to discuss the differences, get some other editors input, and then it can be decided about without edit warring. [[User:Vyselink|Vyselink]] ([[User talk:Vyselink|talk]]) 22:17, 10 October 2012 (UTC)

*I have tried to explain every way I can that the statement in question needs a reference, citation, or source to meet Wikipedeia standards  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:A Georgian|A Georgian]] ([[User talk:A Georgian|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/A Georgian|contribs]]) 01:58, 11 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:The Gospel of Luke is either anonymous or not anonymous.  If it is not anonymous, then A Georgian should be able to provide a verse proving that this is the case.  It is very revealing that despite having been challenged to do so multiple times, he refuses even to attempt to do so.  Why does he not do so?  If he can produce such a verse, then he wins instantly.

:I suggest that the reason he does not is that he knows as well as I do that the text is anonymous.  Unable to proceed down this route, he therefore tries to suppress this piece of factual information by way of a technicality, with this ludicrious argument about it being 'unsourced'.  Of course, he never attempts to explain how such a claim could be sourced in the first place.  Does he seriously expect there to be a Bible verse saying, &quot;I, the writer, am not revealing my identity&quot;?

:Previous contributers to this article appear to understand this basic concept.  Later on in the article, in the specific section on authorship, we find the claim that the text is anonymous. This claim is unsourced, for how could it be otherwise!

:In summary, I claim that nowhere in the book of Luke does the author identify himself.  This claim is impossible to prove directly, other than by reading the whole text for yourself.  If A Georgian disagrees with this claim, then let him provide a verse contradicting that claim.  If he can provide no such verse, then I do not understand what his problem is.

I see you don't even attempt to address my argument either, James.  Probably because like Musdan and Georgian, you realise that it is irrefutable.

But no matter.  I have removed certain unsourced material from the article.  Since everything I removed was unsourced, I am sure that no-one here has a problem with it.[[Special:Contributions/82.3.94.209|82.3.94.209]] ([[User talk:82.3.94.209|talk]]) 19:40, 11 October 2012 (UTC)
* Please don't remove the article lead; see the [[WP:MOS|manual of style]]. Most of the content you are trying to remove are trivial facts about the book. Indeed, the gospel is anonymous; however, that doesn't mean that you are supposed to remove statements that the book is known as &quot;Gospel according to Luke&quot; or &quot;Gospel of Luke&quot; - indeed, without it the second paragraph lacks its context. - [[User:Mike Rosoft|Mike Rosoft]] ([[User talk:Mike Rosoft|talk]]) 19:51, 11 October 2012 (UTC)

== Raymond who? ==

Well, The article covers one of the most influential writings in Christianity.&lt;br /&gt;
Somehow the name of a non relevant post-modern time theologian made it to the lead section. This should be avoided. Such remarks could be used for reference but not as explicit as to even mention the name of the theologian in the body of the article leave alone in the lead section.
