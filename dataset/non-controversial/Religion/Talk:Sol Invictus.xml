== Winter Solstice ==
In the Roman period the winter solstice was on 21st December as it is now. 
For roughly three days prior to, and three days after the solstice the movement of the rise of the sun is imperceptible. Dec 25th is the first day on which the sunrise can be seen to have moved North form its six days standstill. This is why the sun is &quot;victorious&quot; over the darkness.
Perhaps there should be a paragraph offering some clarity about this, since it seems integral to the celebration of Sol Invictus. I'm undoing the change because its misleading to say the solstice was on the 25th Dec.[[User:Mrpearcee|Mrpearcee]] ([[User talk:Mrpearcee|talk]]) 06:33, 24 June 2008 (UTC)



:From the wikipedia page of Elagabalus (Roman emperor from 218 AD - 222 AD):
:
::&quot;Elagabalus replaced Jupiter, head of the Roman pantheon, with a new god, Deus Sol Invictus, and forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, which he personally led.&quot;
:
:This suggests he was not in fact created by Aurelian in 274..

CheeseDreams:  You are probably right that &quot;Sol Invictus&quot; refers to several ''gods'', and those should therefore be distinguished.  It is, however, a single ''title'', and it's worth having a history of that title's usage.  

In particular, there's been some caution in recent scholarship about a hard-and-fast equation between Aurelian's imperial cult on the one hand and Mithraism on the other.  An article on the ''title'' can address issues like that, where a simple disambig cannot.  [[User:Bacchiad|Bacchiad]] 20:36, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

There are a couple of points worth noting, that call into question some of the assertions in this article:
#The earliest ''dated'' mention of ''Sol Invictus'' is an inscription of AD 158, i.e. long before Elagabal.
:''The location and some description of this AD 158 inscription will be essential, so that this assertion can be followed by by interested readers.''
#Sol is depicted in Roman art continuously from the 1st c. BC to the 4th c. AD with a very consistent iconography. There is no way to tell from the iconography whether a Sol is ''Indiges'' or ''Invictus''.
:''If the art here is numismatics, bas-reliefs or sculpture it would be better to say so. One or two famous examples that we should all know about should be pointed out.''
#Invictus (Greek aniketos) is used in many contexts, and is closely linked to Alexander the Great and Hercules.  -- Anon
:''Additionally, the cult of Hercules was closely linked to the Julio-Claudians. See the fresco illus. at [[Herculaneum]].''

:this is an old conversation i know but i thought i should point out that the winter solstice did not occur on the 21st during the roman period.  at the time the julian calendar was put into affect Bruma (tr: winter solstice/shortest day) was said to occur on December 25.
this is why sol invictus lasted until the 25th when they converted to the calendar. the 21st wasnt a reoccurring date for the solstice until the gregorian calendar was adjusted in the late 16th century.[[Special:Contributions/99.140.208.150|99.140.208.150]] ([[User talk:99.140.208.150|talk]]) 19:40, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

&quot;Unlike the earlier, agrarian cult of Sol Indiges (&quot;the native sun&quot; or &quot;the invoked sun&quot; - the etymology and meaning of the word &quot;indiges&quot; is disputed&quot;

Native sun is not probable, why would the Romans need to differentiate between a native and foreign sun centuries before the 'oriental' sun god was adopted? Most scholars now think Indiges means 'divine ancestor' and refers to Sol's ancestral role to the Latin people via Latinus.

:&quot;However, given evidence for a substantial Christian population in the empire by Aurelian's reign, an earlier Christian tradition associating March 25 and December 25 with the conception and birth of Jesus respectively, and the already existing use of solar language for Jesus among Christians (based on Malachi 4:2), it is also possible that Aurelian tried to appropriate an existing Christian observance for his festival of the Unconquered Sun.&quot;

==Reference==
It would be nice to have a reference for &quot;Aurelian dedicated the Sol Invictus Temple on Dec 25, 274&quot;, I'm pretty sure it is correct but don't happen to have a reference at the moment. It might be in the references cited by Gibbon (see link on page). References might be provided in Eliade's Encyclopedia of Religions.

From Catholic Encyclopedia Christmas [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm]: &quot;Natalis Invicti. The well-known solar feast, however, of Natalis Invicti, celebrated on 25 December, has a strong claim on the responsibility for our December date. For the history of the solar cult, its position in the Roman Empire, and syncretism with Mithraism, see Cumont's epoch-making &quot;Textes et Monuments&quot; etc., I, ii, 4, 6, p. 355. Mommsen (Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, 12, p. 338) has collected the evidence for the feast, which reached its climax of popularity under Aurelian in 274. Filippo del Torre in 1700 first saw its importance; it is marked, as has been said, without addition in Philocalus' Calendar.&quot;

* These references in Cumont are wrong.  The reference in the CIL does not mention Aurelian. [[User:84.69.54.28|84.69.54.28]] 21:10, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

Strange that a Catholic Encyclopedia reference is wrong. It might be a scanning error in the online edition, perhaps a print edition would have the correct reference.

This is the Zosimus reference [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus01_book1.htm Zosimus]: &quot;Aurelianus ... erected that sumptuous temple of the sun, which he ornamented with all the sacred spoils that he brought from Palmyra; placing in it the statues of the sun and Belus&quot;

Gibbon cites Eusebius' Chronicon, that may be the source of the 274 date.

[http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/nt11/085.htm Gibbon]: &quot;Vopiscus in Hist. August. 222. [Aurel. c; 39.] Zosimus, l. i. [c. 61, p. 53] p. 56. He placed it in the images of Belus and of the Sun, which he has brought from Palmyra. It was dedicated in the fourth year of his reign (Euseb. in Chron. [an. CCLXXV.]), but was most assuredly begun immediately on his accession.&quot;

It's in [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm Jerome's Chronicle]: &quot;Aurelian builds a temple to the Sun -275&quot; (probably means late 274, does note 4th year of Aurelian)

==Syrus==
Is &quot;the scriptor Syrus&quot; referenced on this page Ephraem Syrus ([[Ephrem the Syrian]]) or a different Syrian? [[User:Daibhid C|Daibhid C]] 01:06, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

* 'scriptor Syrus' does seem meaningless: it only means 'the Syrian writer'.  Perhaps the author could supply his source?

It refers to 12th Century Syrian Bishop who wrote the reasons for 25th December being adopted as a counter to the feast of Sol Invictus, his name eludes me for the moment. See Ramsay MacMullen Paganism and Christianity in the 4th to 8th Centuries.

Read S.Hijmans in BabEsch &quot;The Sun which did not rise in the East: The cult of Sol Invictus in the light of the non-literary evidence.&quot; Hijmans demolishes the notion that Sol Invictus was an eastern divinity or even had the slightest link to the east. Sol Invictus' origins are to be found in Rome and Rome alone, not in the Orient. An Australian researcher also gave a presentation on Roman SOl Worship at a Classical Talk last year and also vehemently denied the concept of Sol Invictus being of a different origin than Sol Indiges.

=== Mithras? ===

&quot;While not officially identified with Mithras, Aurelian's Sol borrowed many features from Mithraism, including the iconographical representation of the god as a beardless youth.&quot;

In fact, Sol depicted as a beardless youth hails from Graeco-Roman traditional imagery of Sol/Helios. See any artistic piece of the sun god from the 5th c. b.c.e onwards to see this. It has nothing to do with Mithras; in fact one of the main pieces of evidence that finally demolished the identification of Sol Invictus with Mithras was the complete differences in depiction. Mithras is almost always instantly identifiable by his Persian dress and his act of the tauroctony, Sol is never depicted in this manner.

Also, the identification of Jesus with Sol based on the painting in the Tomb of the Julii is now thought to be highly suspect. In fact, the Christian identification of the tomb is not certain. The 1950's works by Toynbee etc must be viewed with some scepticism now. See 2000, “Language, Metaphor, and the Semiotics of Roman Art: Some Thoughts on Reading the Mosaics of Mausoleum M in the Vatican Necropolis”, BABesch 75, 147-164

The references from the Catholic Encyclopedia for the Tomb of the Julii are outdated, and articles such as the above should be viewed rather than using old sources. No expert now views these as being Christian in origin.

=== Sol Invictus in 250 ===

There is something suspect about using the representation in the golden tomb of 250 as Jesus=Sol Invictus.  The state sun cult of Sol Invictus did not exist until 274!  It has to be a representation of Helios, therefore, and so doubtfully relevant here. [[User:Roger Pearse|Roger Pearse]] 15:22, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:Agreed and it is also reading too much into the portrayal's meaning rather than seeing it at face value. 19th century scholars were utterly obsessed with notions of Christian development and the link with solar monotheism and saw everything within this paradigm, in fact it is often very surprising that the contextual evidence for these assertions are non-existent.

:The Tomb of the Julii is a depiction of the pagan Roman Sun God, it has nothing to do with the early Christian Church. The same goes with all representations of Christ-Helios. Not one of these can be categorically stated to be of Jesus and given the context of the divine charioteer, the most obvious conclusion is that these are portrayals of Sol-Helios.

This article is heavy christian influenced... it's not a surprise... the cult of Sol Invictus is very arcaic and is present in almost every ancient culture. In the Roman Era was worldwide in expansion since the time of Pompey The Great, and had an Imperial favour since Settimius Severus and then Elagabalus, so Aurelian is NOT the first Emperor that had worshiped Sol Invictus.

:Archaic?? Hardly. The cult of Sol is indeed archaic, but there is no evidence for the epithet invictus being attached to Sol before the reign of Antoninus Pius. The god worshipped by Elagabalus is not the same as that worshipped by Aurelian, and Septimius Severus was primarily devoted to Serapis and showed very little sign of devotion to Sol, in fact, no more than many other emperors (in fact, Gallienus showed far more devotion that SS did.) &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/192.43.227.18|192.43.227.18]] ([[User talk:192.43.227.18|talk]]) 05:28, 12 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt;

==Sol Invictus or Christmas first?==
The following mystification has been removed here, for editing:
:''The Sol Invictus festival ran from December 22 to December 25. It has traditionally been assumed that eradicating the remnants of this pagan holiday was a reason why [[Christmas]] was picked by the early Catholic leaders as the birthday of [[Jesus Christ]]. More recently there is evidence that Christian celebration of Christmas pre-dates the Sol Invictus festival &lt;ref&gt; Tighe, William J. [http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-10-012-v Calculating Christmas], 2003 &lt;/ref&gt;.''
:I do understand that traditionally it has been assumed that the Christians picked on 25th December to replace the Sol Invictus festival. However more recently it has been recognised that there is increasing evidence for the priority of Christmas (as a celebration at least). If you revert an article you should explain why you are doing so. [[User:Mercury543210|Mercury543210]] 20:16, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

Please briefly edit into the article the &quot;evidence&quot; noted in your source,which has been moved here for editing. Merely alluding to it is deceptive. Tighe's central assertion might well be quoted, for a start: &quot;The pagan festival of the “Birth of the Unconquered Son” instituted by the Roman Emperor Aurelian on 25 December 274, was almost certainly an attempt to create a pagan alternative to a date that was already of some significance to Roman Christians.&quot; He admits that &quot;it is true that the first evidence of Christians celebrating December 25th as the date of the Lord’s nativity comes from Rome some years after Aurelian, in A.D. 336.&quot; He then introduces a series of [[red herring]]s concerning various Christian attempts to settle the birth of Jesus on 25 December, but his conclusion is sound: &quot;Christmas (December 25th) is a feast of Western Christian origin. In Constantinople it appears to have been introduced in 379 or 380.&quot; Neither Tighe's convolutions nor his own conclusions demonstrate his thesis. This mumbo-jumbo is no better than run-of-the-mill special pleading by any mediocre Wikipedian. It is not suitable for inclusion in a neutral presentation of the ''facts'' of [[Sol Invictus]].  --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 20:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

::I believe we are all united in the aim of providing the most objective and accurate information. I find that some of comments made by [[User:Wetman|Wetman]] rather unhelpful. Phrases like 'hocus pocus' and 'mumbo-jumbo' are better left in Harry Potter. Tighe's article should not be caricatured. If it is felt that Tighe made claims beyond the evidence, then cite the basis for this. IMHO, Tighe's article makes a reasonable argument and is widely cited.
-&gt; &quot;If it is felt that Tighe made claims beyond the evidence, then cite the basis for this.&quot; Sorry, but this is not how peer-reviewing process works. It is Tighe's burden to prove that he is correct, not other's people burden to prove that he is incorrect. I've looked at Tighe's article and I couldn't find his references - what are his sources?! I've been doing research based on scientific journal articles and those have references crawling out of their pages. This Touchstone journal doesn't seem to be very thorough with their peer-review process (if they even are a peer-review magazine). Also, who is citing Tighe's article is a question. If it's evangelical ministers, then I'd hold off with the conclusion that he's correct. If it's professors of history backing up his claims, then I'd be willing to bite the information.

::The earliest reference to Christmas being celebrated on 25th Decmember dates to 243AD, see Schmidt, Alvin, J.(2001), &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, HarperCollins, p377-9.

Talley’s &quot;The Origins of the Liturgical Year&quot;, 2nd edition (College-ville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1991), pp. 9–10, 85–103, and incidentally is cited by Tighe, but I've not read this.

I just don't understand why there is such sentences in this article : &quot; Other recent Christian commentators also agree that...&quot; and so what ? If we quote Christian commentators, why not the pastafarians ? How could Christian commentators be reliable ? They're not looking for the truth, they want to prove that JC has existed and was born on 25 December. Let's stand with the facts :
&lt;br&gt;- nobody knows when the Christ, if ever he has existed, was born
&lt;br&gt;- we know that the cult of Sol Invictus was celebrated on 25 december
&lt;br&gt;- it's very common that christian religions exploit pagans cult to their benefits, when they are unable to censor it. Just like Bill Gates will buy any product he's unable to compete with, in order to make his own.
&lt;br&gt;- Christmas celebration may have started from the 4th century, but has not been an important feast before the middle age.
&lt;br&gt;So let's stop the christian propaganda, please.

The article says &quot;the earliest record of the celebration of Christ's birthday on December 25 dates to 243 A.D.&quot; I was under the impression that the earliest record came from the Chronography of 354, which would probably (though not necessarily) mean Sol Invictus came first, before Christmas. Does anyone know precisely what this 243 A.D. document is? [[User:Drekadair|Drekadair]] ([[User talk:Drekadair|talk]]) 22:14, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

:: As Tighe stated, &quot;There is ''some fleeting evidence'' that ''at least some first- and second-century Christians'' thought of March 25th or April 6th as the date of Christ’s birth, but rather quickly the assignment of March 25th as the date of Christ’s conception prevailed.&quot; (italics used for emphasis by poster) That is quite a minuscule thread of info to posit that the first Christian Christmas celebration happened in 243 A.D.. For it to be of &quot;an important day to Christians&quot;, I would suggest it be a day where a majority of Christians, rather than having some &quot;fleeting evidence&quot; from &quot;at least some&quot; people, would recognize the March 25th date. Then to lead to the conclusion that these people thought that saints were born and died on the same day, then take the 9 month spread (for Mary to be pregnant with Jesus) to mean that there was a celebration on December 25th of 243 A.D.,... this is getting a little loose in providing factual, un-biased, information.--[[User:Apensity|Apensity &amp;#124; Factcheck.org - Source Watch - Textual Criticism]] ([[User talk:Apensity|talk]]) 05:09, 1 December 2009 (UTC)

== Opening essay ==

At some point someone wrote an essay in the introduction, ignoring the remainder of the article.  I've moved this out -- let's keep the introduction (a) brief and (b) uncontroversial -- to a separate section.

The essay itself contains much very dubious material.  References offered do not consist of scholarship or primary sources, but to general encyclopedias.  It also duplicates other sections on the page. I've therefore pruned it very aggressively down to what seems to be (a) not already discussed (b) not proper to other pages such as [[Mithras]] or [[Christmas]] and (c) actually factually correct and backed up by works such as Halsberghe.  

The real problem with Sol Invictus is the sheer lack of ancient data, and the quantity of modern myth-making.  If we insist on either primary sources or scholarship, and reference both, that would seem more useful?

If someone reckons more can be rescued, by all means restore it. Roger Pearse 11:26, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

:I am not a specialist of this question, but it seems you are deleting a lot of referenced material here.

== More recent not POV? ==

The reason I've held fairly fast to the phrase 'more recent' is simply that the Catholic Ency. ref is over 70 years (1917 vs 1991) older than the two refs cited. I'm using 1991 as I believe both the sources cited ref. back to Talley’s book. The original 'scholarly consensus' is being revised (reviewed?) in the light of 'more recent' (yep, that phrase again) work. Hence it seems to be a statement of fact and not POV.

This section says that the Catholic Encyclopedia's claim (in 1908) that Christmas was based off of Sol Invictus is &quot;no longer credible.&quot;  The question of whether a claim is credible or not is a obviously a point of view.  It does appear that many Christians (including the Pope) now dispute that Christmas was based off of Sol Invictus.  My problem is that the section appears to be implying that the point of view that Sol Invictus was an attempt by the Pagans to co-opt Christmas is right.

For three days before the 21st and three days afterward the movement of the sun is imperceptible. The 25th December is the first day that the dawn of the sun can be perceived to have moved North from its most Southerly solstice position. ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' was the celebration of the rebirth of the sun, for from then on daylight hours would grow longer and the nights shorter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sol.&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Chicago (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually no both the commenters on January 7, 2009 and January 7, 2011 are wrong. And that can be seen simply at [[Sabbath in Christianity]] from there; &quot;The origin of Sunday worship in the 1st or 2nd century remains a debated point. Often first-day worship (Sunday morning or Saturday night) was practiced alongside observance of seventh-day Sabbath rest[11] and was a widespread Christian tradition by the 2nd century;[1][22] over time, Sunday thus came to be known as Lord's Day and, later, a rest day.

On March 7, 321, the Roman Emperor Constantine issued a decree making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating:[23]

    All judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon the venerable day of the sun. Country people, however, may freely attend to the cultivation of the fields, because it frequently happens that no other days are better adapted for planting the grain in the furrows or the vines in trenches. So that the advantage given by heavenly providence may not for the occasion of a short time perish.

Ellen G. White states that ecumenical councils generally each pressed Sabbath down slightly lower and exalted Sunday correspondingly, and that the bishops eventually urged Constantine to syncretize the worship day to promote the nominal acceptance of Christianity by pagans. But &quot;while many God-fearing Christians were gradually led to regard Sunday as possessing a degree of sacredness, they still held [seventh-day] Sabbath.&quot;[24][11]

Some church authorities opposed widespread seventh-day Sabbath observance as a Judaizing tendency.[11] For example, the Council of Laodicea (canon 29) required Christians to separate from Jewish laws and traditions, stating that Christians must not Judaize by resting on Sabbath, but must work that day and then, if possible, rest on the Lord's Day, and that any found to be Judaizers were declared anathema from Christ.[25] This was consistent with Constantine's personal position towards Jewry,[26][27] which has been described by the primitive Christianity movement as being anti-Semitic, antinomian, and persecution of seventh-day observers.[citation needed] Simultaneously Rabbinical Judaism was distinguishing itself from primitive Christianity. White says that the Roman bishops &quot;demanded ... that the Sabbath be profaned; and they denounced in the strongest language those who dared to show it honour. It was only by fleeing from the power of Rome that any could obey God's law in peace.&quot;[28]&quot; [[User:Historylover4|Historylover4]] ([[User talk:Historylover4|talk]]) 08:34, 14 May 2012 (UTC)

== Inappropriate Source Material ==

The article on Sol Invictus is fatally flawed.

Citing the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; in the basic information about Sol Invictus is like taking a Capulet's word regarding the character of a Montague.  The lack of pagan and/or historical references reduces this article to mere propaganda.  It is no more approptiate to cite an overtly Christian source regarding Sol Invictus than it is to cite an overtly Christian source about Ramadan or the Druids or the biography of Buddha.

This needs to be remedied or this article needs to be deleted.

== Day Length ==

I removed the following text: 

''December 25 is 4 days after the winter solstice (from Latin solstitium, &quot;the sun stays still&quot;), and in this period, with the days starting to become visibly longer and the nights shorter, December 25 would have been a logical date to choose as the day of the rebirth of the sun, imagery then utilized by the Christian community.''

because it was patently incorrect. Using the United States Naval Observatory calculations, the sun is above the horizon in Rome, on 12/21/2009, from 0735 through 1642 local time, for a solar day length of 9:07. Civil twilight calculations yield a day of 10:11 of non-night conditions. On 12/25, the sun is above the horizon from 0736 through 1644 local time, for a solar day length of 9:08. Civil twilight calculations yield a day length of 10:11. The days are '''not''' noticeably longer on 12/25 than on 12/21. 

Just to extend the concept, I did similar calculations for Fairbanks, AK. Both civil twilight and solar time above the horizon advance only by 2 minutes, not significantly longer.

I think it's safe to say that Hijmans is presenting positions which have wide support among contemporary scholars dealing with Sol. Chapters 1, 6, 7, 8 and parts of 9 are all based on previously published articles which appeared in solid peer reviewed venues. His 1996 article (Sol Invictus is Roman, not Syrian)is repeatedly cited and accepted by Matern, Wallraff and Berrens, i.e. the three most comprehensive studies to appear on Sol in the past decade. Does anyone know of scholars dealing with Sol who have addressed and refuted his conclusions in that or any other article he published? As for the book, the only part that is new here is the presentation and analysis of the images of Sol (chapters 2 - 4), but that whole section is 
not relevant to the Wiki article.
So what Hijmans is quoted on in the Wiki article is all based in peer-reviewed publications. We could refer to those rather than his dissertation, but because only the dissertation is online, it offers readers the only easy access to this material. Besides being peer-reviewed, his most important conclusion has been accepted by other Sol-specialists. We can't get around that.
The problem is that these scholars are saying the opposite of what has previously been claimed, (and they are backing that up with solid evidence). We can't amalgamate diametrically opposing views. But in my opinion, simply presenting the new views without contrasting them with the old would be confusing to Wiki readers, who will find the old views in other encyclopedias and won't know why there are such differences. Do we rewrite the wiki entry along a dichotomy: traditional views versus recent ones (Halsberghe versus Berrens, Wallraff, Matern and Hijmans)?[[User:Sacerdos solis|Sacerdos solis]] ([[User talk:Sacerdos solis|talk]]) 21:25, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

:It's good to have your response. We need have no problem in accurate representation of the relevant scholarship and recent developments. And of course, Hijmans' interpretation is neither novel nor revolutionary. I'll even say I entirely agree with him; but I'll do so here, not in the article. The article presents the scholarship - or rather, the scholarly consensus. No dichotomy I can see, unless as an artefact of scholarly theory or personal preference: and as ever, &quot;The Truth&quot; must elude us on all fronts, else we fail our readers. 

:There could still be a problem with translation; we're an English wiki, and our content should be verifiable in English wherever possible.

Finding the right balance between new scholarship and older views is always tricky, I guess. But when new scholarship points out errors of fact in the old, do we then still give credence to the old views? For example: in the opening paragraph the entry states that the cult of Sol Invictus was founded by Aurelian in AD 274. Hijmans of course rejected this 14 years ago, and Berrens reinforced this in 2004, both with pretty straightforward evidence: Berrens, e.g., cites coins of Sol with the legend Sol Invictus minted by emperors like Gallienus, well before 274. How much more do Berrens,, Hijmans and others need to do, before we accept their views? Likewise, we can't simply ignore all the coins of Sol minted before Aurelian, and extensively discussed by Berrens, the way the opening paragraph does now. My suggestion: we go for the most recent scholarship so lng as it's unchallenged and not brand new (say less tha 5years old).  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Archaioman|Archaioman]] ([[User talk:Archaioman|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Archaioman|contribs]]) 22:25, 9 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
