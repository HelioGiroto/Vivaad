'''Increase Mather''' (June 21, 1639 &amp;ndash; August 23, 1723) was a major figure in the early history of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] (now the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]] of Massachusetts). He was a [[Puritan]] [[Minister (religion)|minister]] who was involved with the government of the colony, the administration of [[Harvard College]], and most notoriously, the [[Salem witch trials]]. He was the son of [[Richard Mather]], and the father of [[Cotton Mather]], both influential Puritan ministers. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mather was born in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name=&quot;colombia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Mather, Increase.

Three of his brothers (Samuel, Nathaniel and Eleazar) also became ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;1911rm&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|Mather, Richard|author=Richard Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
In 1651 Mather was admitted to [[Harvard University]] where he roomed with and studied under [[John Norton (Puritan divine)|John Norton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief Biographical Sketch of the Reverend Increase Mather | author = Andrew Mitchell | format = [[Microsoft Word]] (.DOC) | url = http://www.hillsdale.edu/Academics/downloads/andrewmitchellincreasebio_1.doc | accessdate = 2006-10-12 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- One source for studied with and one for roomed with. --&gt; When he graduated (1656) with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]],&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; he began to train for the [[Christian ministry|ministry]] and gave his first sermon on his eighteenth birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|Mather, Increase|author=Richard Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly left Massachusetts and went to Ireland, where he studied at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in [[Dublin]] for an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; He graduated in 1659&lt;ref name=&quot;colombia&quot; /&gt; and spent the next 3 years as a [[chaplain]] attached to a garrison in the [[Channel Islands]]&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt;

During his time at Trinity College he was licensed as a Commonwealth Minister by [[Oliver Cromwell]] to the joint charge of St. Tida's Church at Ballyscullion and St. Swithan's Church in Magherafelt. On Cromwell's death in 1659 his joint charge at these South Londonderry churches was quickly severed by the new authorities.

Harvard was later to award him the first [[honorary degree]] in the [[New World]],  becoming a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]], in 1692.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt;

[[File:MatherEliot House.jpg|thumb|left|The house built in 1677 by Increase Mather near the north corner of Hanover and North Bennet Streets, Boston, survived into the 20th century]]

===Establishing himself in Massachusetts===
In 1661, with the advent of the [[English Restoration]] and resurgence of [[Anglicanism]], Increase returned to Massachusetts, where he married Maria Cotton.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; She was his stepsister&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; by virtue of his father's marriage to Sarah Hankredge, the widow of [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] and mother of Maria.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt; She gave birth to [[Cotton Mather]] in February, 1663.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt;

He published in 1676 ''A Brief History of the War with the Indians in New-England'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/31/ UNL.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; a contemporary account of [[King Philip's War]].

He was [[ordination|ordained]] as minister of the [[Second Church, Boston|North Church]],&lt;ref&gt;(the original Old North meetinghouse, not to be confused with the Anglican/Episcopal [[Old North Church]]),&lt;/ref&gt; whose congregation included many of the [[upper class]] and governing class,&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; on May 27, 1664. He held this post until he died.&lt;ref name=&quot;colombia&quot; /&gt; By virtue of his position he quickly became one of the most influential people in the colony, both religiously and politically.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt;

====Harvard====
On June 11, 1685 he became the Acting President of [[Harvard University]] (then Harvard College) and steadily advanced: A little over a year later on July 23, 1686 he was appointed the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]. On June 27, 1692 he became the [[President of Harvard University|President of Harvard]], a position which he held until September 6, 1701.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt;

He was rarely present on campus or in the town, especially during his term of Rector as he was out of the Colony for all but two years of his term in that office.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; Despite his absences he did make some changes: reimplementation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] instruction, replacement of classical Roman authors with [[Bible|Biblical]] and Christian authors in [[ethics]] classes, enactment of requirements that students attend classes regularly, live and eat on campus and that seniors not [[hazing|haze]] other students.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt;

===Involvement in politics===
While politics and Puritan religion were closely related during Increase's lifetime, his first direct involvement with politics occurred as a result of [[James II of England]]'s manipulation of the New England governments. In 1686 James revoked the [[Charter of Massachusetts]] in the process of creating the [[responsible government|unresponsible]] [[Dominion of New England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;colombia&quot; /&gt;

The Dominion was headed by [[Edmund Andros]], who not only disliked puritanism and was haughty,&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; but ruled as a near absolute dictator: [[Town meeting]]s were outlawed, leaving the Dominion without consent of the governed, marriage was removed from the clergy, and the [[Old South Church]] was temporarily appropriated for [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] services.&lt;ref name=&quot;ish&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Interactive State House | work = Governors of Massachusetts | publisher = [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] | url = http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/massgovs/eandros.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]], prohibiting discrimination against [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]], also saw staunch opposition from the Puritan establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; When Mather successfully roused opposition to revocation of the charter, he was nearly framed for [[treason]]. He then traveled to London (eluding spies out to catch him) to petition the King.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot;/&gt;

While engaged in petitioning he published pieces to build popular support for his positions, such as ''A Narrative of the Miseries of New-England, By Reason of an [[dictatorship|Arbitrary Government]] Erected there Under Sir Edmund Andros'' (1688) and ''A Brief Relation for the Confirmation of Charter Privileges'' (1691).&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt;

He also attempted to restore the old charter&lt;ref name=&quot;colombia&quot; /&gt; and obtain a royal charter for Harvard;&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; however, he abandoned that course and changed his petitions to a new charter not lacking any of the rights previously granted.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] and [[1689 Boston revolt|subsequent overthrow]] of Andros, a new charter was granted to the colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; The 1692 charter was a major departure from its predecessor, granting sweeping [[home rule]], establishing an elective [[legislature]], enfranchising all [[fee simple|freeholders]] (previously only men admitted to a congregation could vote), and uniting the Massachusetts Bay Colony and [[Plymouth Colony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; Following Andros' deposition and arrest,&lt;ref name=&quot;ish&quot; /&gt; he had [[William Phips]] appointed as Royal Governor and they returned to Massachusetts, arriving on May 14, 1692.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMKC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Biography of Increase Mather | url = http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/ASA_INC.HTM | accessdate = 2006-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his return, the administration of Harvard grew increasingly insistent that he reside nearer to the institution. Not wanting to leave his Second Church, he didn't, eventually resigning the Presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt;

===Involvement in the Salem witch trials===
As an influential member of the community, having handpicked Governor Phips and his deputy Stoughton, Increase was involved in the notorious witch hysteria of [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. As the court of [[oyer and terminer]] was beginning to hear cases of suspected witchcraft, Increase's son Cotton wrote a letter known as &quot;The Return of Several Ministers Consulted,&quot; which urged caution but failed to denounce the use of &quot;[[spectral evidence]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;va&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Salem Witch Trials: Increase Mather | author = Mathew Madden | url = http://www.iath.virginia.edu/salem/people/i_mather.html | accessdate = 2006-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June and July 1692 as the trials and executions grew, Mather made a number of sermons interpreted as a plea to cool the heated atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;va&quot; /&gt; In September he published ''Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits Personating Men, Witchcrafts, infallible Proofs of Guilt in such as are accused with that Crime'' (more commonly known as just &quot;Cases of conscience concerning evil spirits&quot;), which defended the judges and trials, but strongly denounced the spectral evidence used by them. It said, &quot;It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned.&quot; (A slightly altered version of this phrase would later become known as [[Blackstone's formulation]].) Afterwards, his reputation was not improved by his involvement and association with the trials, nor by his subsequent refusal to denounce them. His refusal to repudiate was likely because of his longtime friendship with the judges involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMKC&quot; /&gt; He was also briefly mentioned in a thorough treatment of his son Cotton by Robert Calef in his comprehensive book of the Salem Trials and their aftermath [[Robert Calef|''More Wonders of the Invisible World']]'&lt;ref name=&quot;va-rc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = More wonders of the invisible world | publisher = University of Virginia | url = http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/calef/calef.html | accessdate = 2006-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (referred to as ''More Wonders of the Spiritual World'' by the [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt;
Increase was said to have burned Calef's book in Harvard Yard.

===Later life and death===
[[Image:Increase Mather grave.jpg|thumb|right|The Mather tomb in [[Copp's Hill Cemetery]]]]
Following Maria's death in August 1714, he remarried.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; On September 27, 1722 he [[loss of consciousness|fainted]] and was bedridden thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; In August 1723 he suffered [[Urinary bladder|bladder failure]]&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt; and died three weeks later on August 23, 1723 in [[Boston]] and was buried on [[Copp's Hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mhs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = MHS Increase Mather Papers, 1659-1721 Guide to the Microfilm Edition | publisher = The [[Massachusetts Historical Society]] | url = http://www.masshist.org/findingaids/doc.cfm?fa=fa0239 | date=2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before his death, he took lodging at the retreat of Mineral Spring Pond to recover from his illness and drink from the famous healing waters of the springs from [[Spring Pond]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=pSkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA107&amp;dq=%22spring+pond%22+salem+ma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=31#v=onepage&amp;q=cotton%20mather&amp;f=false The Register of the Lynn Historical Society, Volumes 15-16 By Lynn Historical Society, page 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Throughout his life Mather was a staunch Puritan, opposing anything openly contradictory to, mutually exclusive with, or potentially &quot;distracting&quot; from his religious beliefs. He supported suppression of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], unnecessary effort on Sundays and [[Sumptuary law|ostentatious clothing]]. He was initially opposed to the [[Half-Way Covenant]] but later supported it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt; He firmly believed in the direct appearance of God's disfavor in everyday life, e.g. the weather, political situations, attacks by &quot;Indians&quot;, fires and floods, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UMKC&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--1st ref explicitly states so, second gives examples--&gt;

He was strenuous in attempting to keep people to his idea of morality,&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; making strong use of [[jeremiad]]s to try to prevent indifference and especially to try to get government officials to enforce public morality.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt;

During his tenure at Harvard he regularly stamped out any relaxation of Puritan strictness, such as [[latitudinarianism]], which had flourished during his overseas absence.&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt;

Following his acceptance of the Covenant, [[Solomon Stoddard]] and others attempted to further liberalize Puritanism by [[baptism]] of children who had nonmember parents&lt;ref name=&quot;harv&quot; /&gt; and admittance of all but the openly immoral to services.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt; To try and stop this, he had a [[synod]] called in an attempt to outlaw similar measures. A declaration was adopted, but never made binding.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt; Following this, reform-minded members were sent to the body and it took on a less conservative tone, bitterly disappointing Mather.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd&quot; /&gt;

==Given name==
The stated reason for his [[first name]] was &quot;...the never-to-be-forgotten [[wikt:increase|increase]], of every sort, wherewith God favoured the country about the time of his nativity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1911&quot; /&gt;  [&quot;Increase&quot; is a literal translation of the Hebrew name &quot;YosÃ«f&quot; (Joseph).]
