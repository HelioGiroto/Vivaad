The '''Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East''' is a [[ecclesiastical province#Anglican Communion|province]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] stretching from [[Iran]] in the east to [[Algeria]] in the west, and [[Cyprus]] in the north to [[Somalia]] in the south. It is the largest and the most diverse Anglican province. The church is headed by a President Bishop, currently the [[Most Reverend]] [[Mouneer Hanna Anis]], who ranks as a representative [[primate (religion)|primate]] in the Anglican Communion. The Central Synod of the church is its deliberative and legislative organ. The province is divided into four dioceses:

* [[Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem|Diocese of Jerusalem]] — covering [[Israel]], [[Palestinian territories]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]],
* [[Anglican Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf|Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf]] — covering [[Cyprus]], the [[Persian Gulf states]], [[Arabia]] and [[Iraq]],
* [[Anglican Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]] with North Africa, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti — also covering [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]],
* [[Anglican Diocese of Iran|Diocese of Iran]].

Each diocese is headed by a [[bishop]]. The President Bishop is chosen from among the diocesan bishops, and retains diocesan responsibility. The current President Bishop also serves as Bishop of Egypt and North Africa. The province estimates that it has around 35,000 baptized members in 55 congregations. The province has around 40 educational or medical establishments and 90 clergy. Today, in Jerusalem, Anglicans constitute a large portion of the Christian community.

==History==
===Origins===
The Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East began as a number of missionary posts of the [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) in Cyprus, the [[Middle East]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The Church Mission Society continues to provide the province with lay mission partners and ordained chaplains, but now the majority of its ministry is drawn from local congregations.

During the 1820s, CMS began to prepare for permanent missionary stations in the region.

In 1833, a missionary station was established in [[Jerusalem]] with the support of the ''London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews'' (a Jewish Christian missionary society now known as the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People]] or CMJ). In 1839, the building of the [[Church of Saint Mark, Alexandria]] was begun.

In 1841, [[Michael Solomon Alexander]], a converted [[rabbi]], arrived in Jerusalem as [[bishop]]. His [[diocese]] originally covered the mission stations in the Middle East and Egypt, and was a joint venture with the [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]] (the so-called ''Anglo-Prussian Union''), serving Lutherans and Anglicans.

In 1849, [[Christ Church, Jerusalem]], became the first Anglican church in Jerusalem.

In 1881, the Anglo-Prussian Union ceased to function, and it was formally dissolved in 1887. From that time, the diocese became solely Anglican.

[[St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem|Saint George's Cathedral]] was built in 1898 in Jerusalem as a central focus for the diocese.

===Later history===
Although the diocese of Jerusalem began as a foreign missionary organisation, it quickly established itself as part of the Palestinian community. In 1905, the [[Palestinian Native Church Council]] was established to give Palestinians more say in the running of the church. This led to an increase in the number of Palestinian and Arab clergy serving the diocese.

In 1920, the [[Anglican Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt and the Sudan]] was formed, separate from the Diocese of Jerusalem, with [[Llewelyn Gwynne]] as its first bishop. In the 1920s the Bishop founded [[St. George's College, Jerusalem|St. George's College]] as a seminary for local clergy-in-training. Bishop Gwynne established the second cathedral of [[All Saints', Cairo]] (the present cathedral is the third building) in 1938.

In 1945, [[Sudan]] became a separate diocese from Egypt (see [[Episcopal Church of the Sudan]] for its history).

In 1957, the Diocese of Jerusalem was elevated to the rank of an [[archdiocese]] (its bishop being an [[archbishop]]) under the authority of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The Archbishop in Jerusalem had metropolitan oversight of the entire area of the current province with the addition of the Sudan (five dioceses in all). In that same year, [[Najib Cubain]] was consecrated Bishop of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, the first Arab bishop, assistant to the Archbishop in Jerusalem. During the 1950s, political unrest in Egypt left the diocese in the care of four Egyptian clergy under the oversight of the Archbishop in Jerusalem.

An Anglican Bishop of Egypt was appointed in 1968, and, in 1974, the first Egyptian bishop, [[Ishaq Musaad]], was consecrated. In 1976, [[Faik Hadad]] became the first Palestinian Anglican bishop in Jerusalem.

==Current position==
In 1976, the structure of the Anglican church in the region was overhauled.

Jerusalem became an ordinary bishopric, and the four dioceses had equal status in the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. The Archbishop of Canterbury relinquished his metropolitan authority to a Presiding Bishop and the Central Synod, with the four dioceses rotating the responsibility of the Bishop President and Synodical Leadership. The Central synod includes the four dioceses of the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. When a Bishop reaches the age of 68, a coadjutor Bishop should be elected to work alongside the Bishop for two years.[http://www.comeandsee.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=659]

The Diocese of Egypt was expanded to take in the chaplaincies of Ethiopia, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.

The Sudan became a fully separate and independent province.

In 1970, the Cathedral of All Saints' in Cairo was demolished to make way for a new Nile bridge. In 1977, work on a new building on [[Zamalek]] was begun, and completed in 1988.
