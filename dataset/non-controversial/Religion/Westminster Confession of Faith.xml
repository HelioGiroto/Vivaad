{{Calvinism}}

The '''Westminster Confession of Faith''' is a [[Reformed]] [[confession of faith]], in the [[Calvinist]] theological tradition. Although drawn up by the 1646 [[Westminster Assembly]], largely of the [[Church of England]], it became and remains the 'subordinate standard' of doctrine in the [[Church of Scotland]], and has been influential within [[Presbyterian]] churches worldwide.

In 1643, the [[List of Parliaments of England|English Parliament]] called upon &quot;learned, godly and judicious Divines&quot;,  to meet at [[Westminster Abbey]] in order to provide advice on issues of worship, doctrine, government and discipline of the Church of England. Their meetings, over a period of five years, produced the confession of faith, as well as a [[Westminster Larger Catechism|Larger Catechism]] and a [[Westminster Shorter Catechism|Shorter Catechism]].  For more than three centuries, various churches around the world have adopted the confession and the catechisms as their standards of doctrine, subordinate to the [[Bible]].

The Westminster Confession of Faith was modified and adopted by [[Congregationalists]] in England in the form of the [[Savoy Declaration]] (1658).  Likewise, the [[Baptists]] of England modified the Savoy Declaration to produce the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Baptist Confession]] (1689).  English Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists would together (with others) come to be known as [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]], because they did not conform to the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]] (1662) establishing the Church of England as the only legally approved church, though they were in many ways united by their common confessions, built on the Westminster Confession.

==Historical situation==
[[Image:WestminsterAssembly.jpg|thumb|right| {{citation | title = The Assertion of Liberty of Conscience by the Independents at the Westminster Assembly of Divines | type = painting | authorlink = John Rogers Herbert | first = John Rogers, RA | last = Herbert | year = ca. 1844}}.]]
During the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1649), the [[Roundhead|English Parliament]] raised armies in an alliance with the [[Covenanter]]s who by then were the [[de facto]] government of [[Scotland]], against the forces of the king, [[Charles I of England]] and Ireland, [[King of Scots]].  The purpose of the Westminster Assembly, in which 121 Puritan clergymen participated, was to provide official documents for the reformation of the Church of England. The Church of Scotland had recently overthrown its bishops and adopted presbyterianism (see [[Bishops' Wars]]).  For this reason, as a condition for entering into the alliance with the [[Roundhead|English Parliament]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] formed the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] with the English Parliament, which meant that the Church of England would abandon [[Anglicanism|episcopalianism]] and consistently adhere to [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] standards of doctrine and worship.  The Confession and Catechisms were produced in order to secure the help of the Scots against the king.

The Scottish Commissioners who were present at the Assembly were satisfied with the Confession of Faith, and in 1646, the document was sent to the English parliament to be ratified, and submitted to the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] of the [[Kirk#Church of Scotland|Scottish Kirk]].  The [[Church of Scotland]] adopted the document, without amendment, in 1647.   In England, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] returned the document to the Assembly with the requirement to compile a list of proof texts from Scripture.  After vigorous debate, the Confession was then in part adopted as the Articles of Christian Religion in 1648, by act of the English parliament, omitting some sections and chapters.  The next year, the Scottish parliament ratified the Confession without amendment.

In 1660, restoration of the British monarchy and Anglican episcopacy resulted in the nullification of these acts of the two parliaments.  However, when [[William III of England|William of Orange]] replaced the Roman Catholic King James VII of Scotland&lt;ref group=note&gt;James VII of Scotland was [[James II of England]] and Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; on the thrones of Scotland, England and Ireland, he gave royal assent to the Scottish parliament's ratification of the Confession, again without change, in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/extranet/xchurchlaw/xchurchlawconfession.htm|title=Extranet: Church law: Westminster Confession of Faith|publisher=[[Church of Scotland]]|accessdate=12 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The confession is a systematic exposition of Calvinist orthodoxy (which [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] scholars refer to as &quot;scholastic Calvinism&quot;),{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} influenced by [[Puritan]] and [[covenant theology]].

It includes doctrines common to most of [[Christendom]] such as the [[Trinity]] and [[Jesus]]' sacrificial death and [[resurrection]], and it contains doctrines specific to [[Protestantism]] such as ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and ''[[sola fide]]''. Its more controversial features include double [[predestination]] (held alongside freedom of choice), the covenant of works with [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the Puritan doctrine that assurance of salvation is not a necessary consequence of faith, a [[regulative principle of worship|minimalist conception of worship]], and a strict [[Sunday Sabbatarianism|sabbatarianism]].

Even more controversially, it states that the [[Pope]] is the [[Antichrist]], that the Roman Catholic [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] is a form of [[idolatry]], that the civil magistrates have divine authority to punish heresy, and rules out marriage with non-Christians.  These formulations were repudiated by the various bodies which adopted the confession (for instance, the [[Church of Scotland]], though its ministers are still free to adhere to the full confession and some do), but the confession remains part of the official doctrine of some other Presbyterian churches. For example, the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] holds to the Westminster Confession of Faith as its standard, subordinate to the Word of God, and read in the light of a [[Basis of Union (Presbyterian Church of Australia)|declaratory statement]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Presbyterian Church of Australia]], [http://pcau.org.au/basis-of-union.html &quot;The Scheme of Union&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Presbyterian adoption and revisions==
The first American Presbyterian ministers were New England Congregationalists, whose congregations originated with the migration from England to the Dutch colony in America as early as the 1640s, and Presbyterian immigrants from Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The first American presbytery, uniting some of these independent congregations and those of the British immigrants, was formed in 1706. This body grew large enough to form the first synod in Philadelphia in 1716. Prior to 1729, some presbyteries required candidates for the ministry to profess adherence to the Westminster Confession. When the [[Synod of Philadelphia]] met in 1729 to adopt the Westminster Confession as the doctrinal standard, it required all ministers to declare their approval of the Westminster Confession of Faith and catechisms. At the same time, the Adopting Act allowed candidates and ministers to scruple articles within the Confession. Whether or not the article scrupled was essential or nonessential was judged by the presbytery with jurisdiction over the candidate's examination. This allowance implied a difference, ''within the standards themselves'', between things that are essential and necessary to the Christian faith, and things that are not. This compromise left a permanent legacy to following generations of Presbyterians in America, to decide what is meant by &quot;essential and necessary&quot;, resulting in permanent controversies over the manner in which a minister is bound to accept the document; and it has left the American versions of the Westminster Confession more amenable to the will of the church to amend it.

=== The 1789 American Revision ===
The American revision of 1787–1789 removes from the Confession and the Catechisms mention of certain duties of the civil government in relationship to the church. The revision also removes explicit identification of the Pope as the Antichrist.
