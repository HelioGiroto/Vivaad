==Greek transliteration==

I'm again removing this stuff:

&quot;The fact that the Septuagint and Nehemiah call Joshua Iēsous or Yeshua indicates that the name was pronounced in this way at their time. The question we address now is whether this form was used at the time of Jesus. Was the Greek spelling Iēsous meant to reflect the actual pronunciation as Yeshua, or was his name really Yehoshua and those who composed the Greek of our New Testament changed it to Iēsous in order to conform to some convention?

Although the form Iēsous was the normal form for [[Joshua son of Nun]], this would obviously not require Greek writers or translators to use it for someone else named Yehoshua`. (The normal transliteration of Yehoshua would have been Ιωσους or Ιωσουε (compare the Latin Iosue), as in other NT names like Ιωσαφατ for Yehoshaphat.) And yet all New Testament writers or translators (at least nine different persons) use the form Iēsous for the founder of Christianity.&lt;!--Ghost, please do not delete this again as though it's &quot;original research&quot;! It's simply a statement of fact.--&gt;&quot;


This is indeed original research. The forms Ιωσους or Ιωσουε are unattested in any Greek text nor does any discussion of the name in published works present these speculative forms. All known cases of Greek transliteration of the name Joshua are Iēsous, no other form is known. Also its not the Septuagint that calls &quot;Joshua&quot; by the name &quot;Yeshua&quot; it is the original Hebrew texts of Ezra and Nehemiah that use &quot;Yeshua&quot;, you seem to be equating Iēsous with &quot;Yeshua&quot; despite the fact that it is used for &quot;Yehoshuah&quot; as well and there is no indication that Yehoshua was pronounced Yeshua when written out in Hebrew in uncontracted form, you seem to think that the Greek form implies the contracted Hebrew pronunciation Yeshua, but that is fallacy, Greek does not have an &quot;h&quot;, the fact that its not present in the Greek form says nothing about the pronunciation of the Hebrew, you can't make up alternative speculative Greek transliterations and use them to conclude that Iēsous implies a pronunciation Yeshua.

: Related to that, the initial paragraph states that ''Yeshua''... &quot;is thought by some scholars and religious groups to be the Hebrew or Aramaic name for Jesus.&quot; I think it's well-established and well-sourced for the hypothesis. What surprises me is that the phrase implies that it is a contested issue or minority position. If that is indeed the case, what other possibilities are there, or which groups do not advocate such a form as being the original Aramaic or Hebrew form of Jesus's name? --[[User:Wtrmute|Wtrmute]] ([[User talk:Wtrmute|talk]]) 21:47, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yeshua is the name used for Jesus by Maimonides and anonymous redactors of the Josippon, but it is not known if this was the name used for him in the 1st century, as the article explains it could have been the full form Yehoshua or the Greek Iesous. As explained the Church fathers who discuss the matter claim that the Greek form is his original name.

==Yarim Ha’Am Veyokhiakh Shedvaro Vetorato Omdim==
I'm not sure, but this story about a Rabbi blurting out the word Yeshua in Kabbalistic language is interesting, and might deserve a mention if its relevancy is correctly pointed out or demonstrated.

==Yahshua-Yahshuah==
See [[Talk:Yahshua#Merge]] regarding a proposal to merge the articles [[Yahshuah]] and [[Yahshua]]. --[[User:AuthorityTam|AuthorityTam]] ([[User talk:AuthorityTam|talk]]) 21:25, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

== Sound sample ==

I'd love to hear the variations here spoken. Any chance we can get some sound samples on this page? -- [[User:SpareSimian|SpareSimian]] ([[User talk:SpareSimian|talk]]) 15:12, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

== Yeshu (ישו)==
There is not one single Christian source that links this pejorative hebrew spelling of Yeshua/Jesus. It is complete crap that it is in this article and I suggest that it is removed. In the interm I posted reference from printed articles showing that it is infact pejorative and biased. --[[User:Teacherbrock|Teacherbrock]] ([[User talk:Teacherbrock|talk]]) 12:44, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
:This article is about Yeshua, not Yeshu.  If you want to include material about the latter being perjorative, maybe the [[Yeshu]] article would be a better place.  Also, when you put in citations, use the book's name, author and page number, not the google link.  --[[User:Noleander|Noleander]] ([[User talk:Noleander|talk]]) 23:26, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

---So we can remove Yeshu from the article completely? I agree. --[[User:Teacherbrock|Teacherbrock]] ([[User talk:Teacherbrock|talk]]) 17:10, 27 October 2010 (UTC)

== Disambig links at top ==

Teacherbrock:  the convention in WP is to have a single disambiguation sentence/paragraph at the top, not 2 separate paragraphs.  Is that okay?  --[[User:Noleander|Noleander]] ([[User talk:Noleander|talk]]) 17:23, 27 October 2010 (UTC)


sure--[[User:Teacherbrock|Teacherbrock]] ([[User talk:Teacherbrock|talk]]) 20:41, 29 October 2010 (UTC)

== Article lede ==
I have I hope tweaked the lede in a good way; putting the Strong's ref into a ref box, and adding into lede [[Joshua the High Priest]] - which is the most notable sourced used of this spelling - then [[Joshua]] and [[Yeshu]] in [[Franz Delitzsch]] etc. What further [[WP:source]] can be added for the spelling in the lede? [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 01:41, 24 June 2011 (UTC)
:Way over-elaborate - Yeshua simply is the name used in Hebrew and Aramaic. List variants if you must, but there's really no need.[[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 00:40, 29 July 2011 (UTC)</text>
