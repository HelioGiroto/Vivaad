The '''seven-day week''' is used by the majority of the world and is the [[international standard]] as specified in [[ISO 8601]].

== Origins ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
{{original research|section|date=April 2011}}
The origin of the seven-day week is the religious significance that was placed on the [[seventh day]] by ancient cultures, including the [[Babylonian]] and [[Jewish]] civilizations. Jews celebrated every seventh day, within a continuous cycle of seven-day weeks, as a holy day of rest from their work, in remembrance of the creation week.
Similarly, the Babylonians celebrated the seventh day of each seven-day week as a holy day, but adjusted the number of days of the final week in their month so that their monthly [[calendar]] would always commence on the [[new moon]]. This may further be reflected in the contemporary and traditional [[Zoroastrian calendar]]s that relates to the first, seventh and so on days of the month as pertaining to Ahura Mazda (God).{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Historically, a number of other cultural groups, such as [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]], have continued to regularly hold religious events on a specific day within each seven-day week.

The seven-day week is approximately a quarter of a [[lunation]], so it has been proposed that this is the implicit, astronomical origin of the seven-day week. However, there are a number of problems with the proposal. The seven-day week is actually only 23.7% of a lunation, which means that a continuous cycle of seven-day weeks rapidly loses [[synchronisation]] with the lunation. The problem is compounded by the fact that a lunation is only the [[mean]] time for the [[lunar phase]] cycle, with each individual lunar phase varying in length. Also, the [[duodecimal]] (base-12) and [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) numeral systems have historically been the primary systems used to divide other chronological and calendar units. Therefore, it is not immediately apparent why the seven-day week was selected by ancient cultures, rather than a week that included a number of days that was a factor of these numeral systems, such as a six-day or a twelve-day week, or a week that divided the lunation more accurately using a factor of these number systems, such as a five-day or ten-day week.{{Or|date=April 2011}} There are no historical Jewish or Babylonian records that confirm that these cultures explicitly defined the seven-day week as a quarter of a lunation.

=== Ancient Near East ===

{{details|Babylonian calendar}}
Counting from the [[new moon]], the Babylonians celebrated the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th as &quot;holy-days&quot;, also called &quot;evil days&quot; (meaning &quot;unsuitable&quot; for prohibited activities). On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to &quot;make a wish&quot;, and at least the 28th was known as a &quot;rest-day&quot;.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} On each of them, offerings were made to a different god and goddess. Tablets from the 6th-century BC reigns of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses]] indicate these dates were sometimes approximate. The [[lunation]] of 29 or 30 days basically contained three seven-day weeks, and a final week of eight or nine days inclusive, breaking the continuous seven-day cycle. The Babylonians additionally celebrated the 19th as a special &quot;evil day&quot;, the &quot;day of anger&quot;, because it was roughly the 49th day of the (preceding) month, completing a &quot;week of weeks&quot;, with sacrifices and prohibitions.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Reconstruction of a broken tablet seems to define the rarely attested ''Sapattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''Sabattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' as the 15th day of the lunation: this word is cognate with Hebrew ''[[Shabbat]]'', but is monthly rather than weekly. It is regarded as a form of [[Sumer]]ian ''sa-bat'' (&quot;mid-rest&quot;), attested in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''um nuh libbi'' (&quot;day of mid-repose&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pinches, T.G.|editor=Hastings, James|others=Selbie, John A., contrib|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=20|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003|pages=889–891|chapter=Sabbath (Babylonian)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qVNqXDz4CE8C|isbn=978-0-7661-3698-4|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven-day week appears in the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation story]] in the [[Book of Genesis]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]], where [[Elohim]] (God) is said to have created the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:1-2:3|NIV}}). In the [[Book of Exodus]], the fourth of the [[ten commandments]] is to rest on the seventh day, the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], which can be seen as implicating a seven-day week social institution ({{bibleverse||Exodus|20:8-11|NIV}}).

===Classical Antiquity===
Frank C. Senn in his book ''Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical'' points to data suggesting evidence of an early continuous use of a seven-day week; referring to the Jews during the [[Babylonian Captivity]] in the 6th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; after the destruction of the [[Temple of Solomon]]. The ancient Romans traditionally used the eight-day [[Roman_calendar#Nundinal_cycle|nundinal cycle]], but after the adoption of the [[Julian calendar]], in the time of [[Augustus]], the seven-day week came into use. For a while, the week and the nundinal cycle coexisted, but by the time the week was officially adopted by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] in AD 321&lt;ref&gt;

=== Christian Europe ===
The seven-day weekly cycle is reputed{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} to have remained unbroken in Europe for almost two millennia, despite changes to the [[Alexandrian calendar|Alexandrian]], [[Julian calendar|Julian]], and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars. The date of [[Easter]] Sunday can be traced back through numerous [[Computus|computistic tables]] to an Ethiopic copy of an early Alexandrian table beginning with the Easter of 311 AD.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption after other systems ==
=== China ===
The earliest known reference in Chinese writings to a seven-day week is attributed to Fan Ning, who lived in the late 4th century in the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]], while diffusions from the [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]] are documented with the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk [[I Ching (monk)|Yi Jing]] and the Ceylonese or Central Asian Buddhist monk [[Amoghavajra|Bu Kong]] of the 7th century ([[Tang Dynasty]]).

=== Japan ===
The Chinese transliteration of the planetary system was soon brought to Japan by the Japanese monk [[Kobo Daishi]]. Surviving diaries of the Japanese statesman [[Fujiwara Michinaga]] show the seven-day system in use in [[Heian Period|Heian]] [[Japan]] as early as 1007. In Japan, the seven-day system was kept in use for astrological purposes until its promotion to a full-fledged Western-style calendrical basis during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era.

=== Hindu ===
The seven-day week may have been in use during the [[Vedic Period]], although according to [[Pandurang Vaman Kane]], author of [[History of Dharmasastra (book)|History of Dharmasastra]], &quot;this is not conclusive&quot;.

The [[Pancasiddhantika#Pancha-Siddhantika|Pañcasiddhāntikā]] mentions 'Monday'. The [[Garga Samhita|Garga]] dated 1st Century [[BCE]], refers to the seven-day week, Sunday to Saturday.

He concludes &quot;the above references furnish a [[terminus ad quem]] ([[viz.]] 1st century BCE–1st century CE) The [[Terminus post quem|terminus a quo]] cannot be stated with certainty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
{{Main|French republican calendar}}
[[France]] discontinued the seven-day week for a ten-day week with the introduction of the [[French republican calendar|republican calendar]] in 1793.  The [[Concordat of 1801]], which re-established the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in France, also restored the seven-day week, beginning with Easter Sunday, 18 April 1802.

=== Soviet Union ===
{{Main|Soviet calendar}}
In 1929, the [[USSR]] discontinued the seven-day week for a [[Soviet_calendar#Five-day_weeks|five-day week]], then a [[Soviet_calendar#Six-day_weeks|six-day week]]. While the days were still named according to the seven-day week, the work schedules were rotated in five- and six-day periods.  The seven-day week was reintroduced on 27 June 1940.

== Week numbering ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[ISO 8601]] --&gt;
Weeks in a Gregorian calendar year can be numbered for each year. This style of numbering is commonly used (for example, by schools and businesses) in some European and Asian countries, but rare elsewhere.

[[ISO 8601]] includes the [[ISO week date]] system, a numbering system for weeks – each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that).
For example, week 1 of 2004 (2004W01) ran from Monday 29 December 2003 to Sunday, 4 January 2004, because its Thursday was 1 January 2004, whereas week 1 of 2005 (2005W01) ran from Monday 3 January 2005 to Sunday 9 January 2005, because its Thursday was 6 January 2005 and so the first Thursday of 2005. The highest week number in a year is either 52 or 53 (it was 53 in the year 2004). Schematically, this ISO convention translates as follows:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;7&quot;| Dates in January
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Effect
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''M''' || '''T''' || '''W''' || '''T''' || '''F''' || '''S''' || '''S''' || '''Week number''' || '''Week assigned to'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''1''' || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 1 || New year
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|  || '''1''' || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 1 || New year
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|  ||  || '''1''' || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 1 || New year
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|  ||  ||  || '''1''' || 2 || 3 || 4 || 1 || New year
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|  ||  ||  ||  || '''1''' || 2 || 3 || 52 or 53 || Previous year
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|  ||  ||  ||  ||  || '''1''' || 2 || 52 or 53 || Previous year
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|  || || || || || || '''1''' || 52 or 53 || Previous year
|}

In some countries, though, the numbering system is different from the ISO standard. At least six numberings are in use:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjh2.de/datetime/weeknumber/wnd.php?l=en Weeknumber sorted by definition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/weekinfo.htm Calendar Weeks]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts and figures ==
* 1 week = 7 days = 168 hours = 10,080 minutes = 604,800 seconds (except at [[daylight saving time]] transitions or [[leap seconds]])
* 1 Gregorian calendar year = 52 weeks + 1 day (2 days in a leap year)
* 1 week = {{Fraction|1600|6957}} ≈ 22.9984% of an average Gregorian month

In a [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] mean year there are 365.2425 days, and thus exactly {{Fraction|52|71|400}} or 52.1775 weeks (unlike the [[Julian year (calendar)|Julian year]] of 365.25 days or {{Fraction|52|5|28}} ≈ 52.1786 weeks, which cannot be represented by a finite decimal expansion). There are exactly 20871 weeks in 400 Gregorian years, so 30 April 1611 was a Saturday just like 30 April 2011.

A system of [[Dominical letter]]s has been used to determine the day of week in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] or the [[Julian calendar]].
