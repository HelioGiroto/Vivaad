[[Talk:Vajrayana/Archive|Archive]]
==Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana==
''The same argument holds that all Buddhism is primarily a form of [[Hinayana]] since Hinyana suttas, and [[vinaya]] continue to have importance, and many later teachings have their origins in Hinayana thought. Indeed even Vajrayana practices contain an element of Hinyana in the form of renunciation which the Vajrayana came to see as the quintessential Hinayana practice.&quot;
:This was removed because it is based upon the premise that Hinayana and Mahayana are what they are according to what scriptures they accept. However, this is not the case: Hinayana has as it's goal the Nirvana of an Arhat. Mahayana and Vajrayana have as their goal the Nirvana of a Buddha. This is why it is 'okay' to say that the Vajrayana is a specialised form of Mahayana. ([[User:20040302|20040302]] 16:06, 5 May 2004 (UTC))

:I'm curious, do you know if the Theravada school accepts this distinction? - [[User:Nat Krause|Nat Kraus]][[User_Talk:Nat Krause|e]] 10:28, 8 May 2004 (UTC)

::The specific distinction (I guess) you are refering to is that between a Bodhisattva and Sravaka? (Mahayana refers to the path of Bodhisattvas, and here ''Hinayana'' I took to refer to Sravakayana - or the path of Arhats)?  Yes, there is no problem with that.  The Pali canon and Jataka tales assert that there is a distinction between the Bodhisattva and the Sravaka.  Remember, the Pali canon does agree that Sakyamuni was a Bodhisattva before he achieved enlightenment.  Buddha himself said it was not necessary to follow the path of a Bodhisattva to escape samsara, that all one needed to do was to get out, and this is why he taught the Sravakayana.  I do not think that any tradition actually objects to this point.

:::Hmmm, I guess so.  It's not that I'm trying to argue that some sect or another is wrong or right or more ultimate or something, or that anybody is malicious (well, &quot;every heart is sinful and desperately wicked&quot;).  But I'm still trying to figure out if I can really agree that there is no Mahayana school / non-Mahayana school division.  I'll continue to dwell on the subject occasionally. - [[User:Nat Krause|Nat Kraus]][[User_Talk:Nat Krause|e]] 18:15, 8 May 2004 (UTC)

::::I didn't take it that you were looking for dirt, but to the issue of Mahayana/non-mahayana, which (I believe) is a more interesting discourse.

::::My point above (as ever) was that mahayana is the path of the Bodhisattva, not a group of schools. In this sense, mahayana is recognised by the Theravada and other Nikaya schools (though they may dispute that schools that call themselves 'mahayana' are actually following the mahayana path!) 

::::Regarding the division itself, we need to ask ourselves &quot;Is it useful? -Does it serve a good purpose?&quot;  If we look 'across the road' to Christianity, at the division into Catholicism and Protestantism - is that a legitimate division of Christianity? And in one sense, the answer is 'Yes' because by definition Protestants have ''protested'' against Catholicism, though a quick trip to the [[List_of_Christian_denominations]] will show just how reductive such a division is.  Why I brought this up is that I believe that early Western scholars were looking for a similar division of Buddhism as a rationale (e.g. the 'northern buddhists' of China and the 'southern buddhists' of Ceylon), but were possibly faced with the dilemma of attempting to find the &quot;Martin Luther&quot; of Buddhism. Of course, if they did think this way, they missed the point - in that Buddhism has a different cultural background, and is imbued with a completely distinct set of messages than those that are found in the Ibrahimic religions.

::::My working assumption of the distinction between the Nikaya and non-Nikaya schools is based upon the concept of transmission.  I believe that the Nikaya only recognise transmission through scripture, whereas non-Nikaya recognise transmission through realisation.  This allows the non-Nikaya to be more creative, adaptive, and dynamic with scriptural elements, in that (if you will) they are more interested in the ''Spirit of the law'' rather than the ''Letter of the law''; moreover, because they recognise the idea of transmission of realisation, then who they call 'Buddha' is not just the person who walked and taught in the C6th BCE, but also the consequences of his actions and teachings.   This then allows for the later authorship of sutras, which are indeed spoken by the Buddha, but not in the way that is normally meant by such an idea- the individuals who penned the words 'heard the sutra' through realisation; for them to claim that it is 'their own' realisation would imply the existence of a self that they do not wish - moreover, they could claim, whatever remnants of their self-grasping there is could not write dharma - dharma is the pure expression of Buddha's mind - and in that sense, it is more appropriate to say that the text is indeed authored by Buddha. 

::::So following this tirade, the Nikaya, non-Nikaya distinction can indeed be made (by identifying those that agree solely with the Pali or it's equivalents). However, we still need to ask ourselves is such a distinction, on those lines, relavant or useful?  It is really clear that e.g. the Pure Land traditions are completely distinct from any of the Tibetan traditions, and certainly in some respects (e.g. Tibetan monastic vinaya) the Tibetan tradition is considerably closer to Theravada than it is to Korean or other Mahayana monastic vinaya, though in many other respects their are other similarities. 

:::::I wouldn't try to make too clear a distinction between the Tibetan and the east Asian Mahayana. When I went to Taiwan in 1984 I was surprised to find so many similarities in the rituals at some temples with the Tibetan rituals I was familiar with. The Tibetan variety of Vajrayana was the preferred religion of the Mongols and the Manchus when they were ruling China. And it is Chinese custom to practise more than one school at any time. They often don't regard different schools as contradictory but simply as having different functions. For example, people go to a mandala offering ceremony to receive blessings &amp; make offerings. They recite Pureland texts mantras when someone dies or to ensure longevity. Pure Mahayana without Vajrayana is sometimes practised in the Tibetan tradition but it is simply overwhelmed by the preponderance of the Vajrayana. I knew a monk in the Tibetan tradition who was advised by his lamas not to take deity empowerments and to just practise Mahayana teachings. This  was his personal decision and there are other individuals in similar situations. It is a matter of personal potential which teachings are best suited.--[[User:Bobgould|Bodhirakshita]] 09:08, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::::I had an interesting discussion with an academic the other day about just how cartesian and C19th the whole idea of cataloguing, categorising and taxonomising is; how the mid C20th brought about the ability for us to break out of these absolutist concepts, and yet how incredibly reluctant we are to let go of them as building blocks, and see them just as the patterns that they are - models that are useful for certain purposes only, but no nearer or further from any objective truth than any other model that we wish to use.

::::Hmmm.. Obviously drank lots of coffee this morning! ([[User:20040302|20040302]] 11:24, 9 May 2004 (UTC))

:::::You have made a good distinction between the Nikaya &amp; non-Nikaya but what do all these different traditions have in common that makes them Buddhist? There are a number of factors that all orthodox Buddhist schools share. The Buddha outlined 37 factors which he considered prerequisites to enlightenment. They are known in the Pali Canon as the bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma, the Wings to Awakening. As they are common to the Foundational Vehicle (The Dalai Lama now uses &quot;Foundational Vehicle&quot; in preference to &quot;Hinayana&quot; which has derogatory connotations) &amp; the other schools it not incorrect to say that the other schools are based on the Foundational Vehicle. These factors are what distinguish Buddhism from other religions.

:::::A Theravadan article on the bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma can be found at [http://accesstoinsight.org/lib/modern/thanissaro/wings/index.html http://accesstoinsight.org/lib/modern/thanissaro/wings/index.html] --[[User:Bobgould|Bodhirakshita]] 08:40, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::::::Well put, Bodhirakshita. (Sorry for the 7 month lag!) Since I wrote this, I have not changed my view-point much - though I further feel that we also see a division between Nikaya and Mahayana on the basis of the nature of a Buddha after death. This is the distinction between Nirvana-with-remainder and Nirvana-without-remainder. After all, according to Mahayanists, Sakyamuni Buddha is still directly teaching and will continue to do so until the end of time, whereas from what I understand of the Nikaya, Sakyamuni Buddha ceased to teach directly on the moment of his Parinirvana. Regarding to the commonality of Buddhism, I guess I would also say that accordance with-
*The belief that Sakyamuni is (for our time and our planet) uniquely realised. 
*The maintenance, promotion, and study of the Tripitaka
*The support and maintenance of one of the ancient lineages of Vinaya

In other words, the institutional support and maintenance of the three refuges. I guess this is possibly more contentious, but my personal view sees that as pretty reasonable. ([[User:20040302|20040302]] 14:31, 22 September 2005 (UTC))

==What is Vajrayana? A faster path to enlightenment==
I have a problem with this section which puts the emphasis on the speed factor of Vajrayana when it's chief characteristics are purification &amp; transformation, purifying thought &amp; action &amp; transforming passions &amp; delusions into wisdoms. See [http://www.dzogchen.org.au/buddhism.html http://www.dzogchen.org.au/buddhism.html] I think the whole section should be re-written. - --[[User:Bobgould|Bodhirakshita]] 04:25, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

&quot;Second speed-up technique: Esoteric Transmission or Initiation&quot;

&quot;The esoteric transmission framework can take varying forms. The Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism uses a method called dzogchen. Other Tibetan Kagyu schools and the Shingon school in Japan use an alternative method called mahamudra.&quot;

:This is incorrect on several counts. Dzogchen transmission is not the same as Vajrayana initiation or empowerment. Dzogchen transmission has a different function to Vajrayana. Dzogchen is also found in the Bön tradition &amp; in the Kagyu sub-sects. And again Mahamudra transmission is not Vajrayana empowerment. See the Wikipedia article [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen Dzogchen] - --[[User:Bobgould|Bodhirakshita]] 04:58, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==Buddhahood vs nirvana==

This curious sentence was recently added: ''It should also be noted that the goal of the Mahayana and Vajrayana is the attainment of Buddhahood, whereas the goal for Theravada pracitce is liberation from the cycle of rebirth in Nirvana.''

Did I miss something in Buddhism 101, or isn't attaining Buddhahood the same as liberation from the cycle of rebirth...? [[User:Jpatokal|Jpatokal]] 01:07, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:I thoroughly don't know, but many people would say they are not the same.  They are making a distinction between [[arhat]]ship and [[Buddha]]hood.  To be clearer, [[Buddha]]hood is seen as a type of [[arhat]]ship, i.e. a type of liberation from samsara.  Ideally, this should be reflected in the article. - [[User:Nat Krause|Nat Kraus]][[User_Talk:Nat Krause|e]] 02:29, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::There are 3 types of Buddhahood: Sravaka, Pratyeka &amp; Samyaksam Buddha. See the Wikipedia article at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinayana http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinayana] - --[[User:Bobgould|Bodhirakshita]] 03:50, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)
:::It's not at all clear to me that you can have gradations of Buddha-ness. Awakenedness isn't supposed to be composite, so it's hard to see how you could break it down. If an Arhat is not considered by (some?) Mahayanists(?) to be a real Buddha, then I think that is something that should be said. I think [[User:Jpatokal|Jpatokal]]'s 18-month-old observation ought to be addressed somewhere, but I've no idea which article is most appropriate.
:::I don't know which kinds of Buddhist think that Arhatship is not a kind of Buddhahood, but I know that some take that view. I'd like to know which Buddhists take which view, and what their reasonings are.
:::--[[User:MrDemeanour|MrDemeanour]] 21:44, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

::::Vajrayana Buddhists make a distinction between enlightenment (Buddhahood, cessation of all illusion and confusion) and liberation (cessation of the illusory ego). The Theravada term of 'enlightenment' is the same thing as the Vajrayana term of liberation. What Theravada sees as the goal, Vajrayana sees as the first step. Hope this clears things up.
::::--[[User:Zormal|Zormal]] 18:48, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
:::::Thanks, Zormal! Actually I'm familiar with the distinction that vajrayanists make; I'm curious as to whether other buddhists make a similar distinction between arhats and samyaksambuddhas. I'd also like to have some better understanding of what the difference is. As I understand it, it's to do with the removal of progressively more subtle veils of ignorance - but what do I know :-)
[[User:MrDemeanour|MrDemeanour]] 12:50, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

== The difference between Nirvana and Buddha hood. ==

Nirvana is a Sanskrit word as you well know, but did you know it consists of tree words, Nir Vad Djna, literally this mean “Without wrong thought”, at least this is what my teacher Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche taught me. To reach Nirvana is to come to the end of ones preconceived ideas, to the place where the world is new at every moment.

Buddha hood is to gain the state of a Buddha, to be a Buddha is to gain throughout ages an accumulation of merits or positive accumulated fearlessness to deal with the parts of life that beings do not like to deal with and witch make up what is commonly known as the subconscious. Having gained a storage of “good merit” one will have the connection to a whole world of sentient beings, through ones work, and so will start at a proper time a new world cycle of Buddhist teachings.

To become a Buddha and to attain Nirvana is one and the same, there is no difference between the two, in actual experience. To reach Nirvana is like becoming truly sane. And to become a Buddha is to become the King of Fearlessness.

Nirvana you may gain for you self anytime but becoming a Buddha is another matter.

::Different teachers give different etymologies for the word &quot;nirvana&quot;. The most common is as follows: &quot;nir&quot; is the prefix meaning &quot;to cease&quot; or &quot;to stop&quot;; &quot;vaana&quot; means &quot;blowing&quot;: thus &quot;extinguished&quot; or &quot;blown out&quot; would be the literal translation. - --[[User:Bobgould|Bodhirakshita]] 03:53, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==Somebody please rewrite...==

...the first section.  How can anyone trust someone who explains the terms so poorly? [[User:Mandel|Mandel]] June 30, 2005 19:43 (UTC)
:Attempted improvements: Vajrayana isn't a school. The &quot;three yanas&quot; don't include &quot;Theravada&quot;, as such. Vajrayana not really a 'subset' of the Mahayana 'school', as vajrayanists study widely in all the Mahayana schools. I'm afraid this edit felt a bit like butchery; I'll have a pop at the second paragraph separately, in the hope that this will make it easier to revert my efforts.

==Vajrayana texts==

Shouldnt there be a sectiron about vajrayana texts ( sutras,tantras ) etc . And links to external sites that have vajrayana texts .[[User:Farhansher|Farhansher]] 8 July 2005 04:16 (UTC)
:Any cononical Vajrayana texts that aren't tantras are also texts that non-tantric schools of Buddhism accept (Sutra, Vinaya, Shastra). So you are asking for a section about the [[Tantra#Tibetan_tantra]]; this exists already. 
:If you are asking for a catalogue of Buddhist tantras, it might be hard to get a definitive set (according to some traditions, they are numberless); and it's not clear what the 'regular' reader would be expected to make of a list of names of Buddhist tantras. Since those to whom these texts have been properly explained are generally bound to maintain some degree of confidence/secrecy, people are stuck with the titles of the tantras, their alleged authors, and some handwaving stuff like that.

:I don't know what we are supposed to do about this, unless some non-vajrayana philologist who understands the language wants to come along and expound the tantras to folks who are is considered by vajrayanists to be incapable of understanding the explanation. And how could someone with a &quot;correct&quot; knowledge of the material revise it, without breaking their vows?

:I think a decent explanation of the philological/anthropological/whatever view of what is known about these texts would be fantastic. I have only one reference of that kind though: 
:David Snelgrove, ''Indo-Tibetan Buddhism'', Shambhala Press, ISBN1-57062-973-0
:Very interesting, lots of footnotes, quite a lot of repetition. Very good (in my ill-informed opinion) on the relationships between the different classes of Buddhist tantras. Large section on the connections between Buddhist and Shaivite tantra, and some serious discussion about the origins of the practices. Some material that is rather explicit, and that probably should be considered off-bounds to practitioners, unless they have the proper permission.
:I'm not tantric - I think you are supposed to have some realisation of emptiness before it makes any sense to try to approach tantra; but such teaching as I have had was all aimed in a generally-tantric direction.

::--[[User:MrDemeanour|MrDemeanour]] 23:29, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Well, you are more or less right. It's impossible to have any substantial ability in one's practice of Buddhist tantra without a strong grounding in both emptiness and bodhicitta. Of course, there are plenty of practitioners who do NOT have such a grounding, and I guess it would be rude or provocative to tell them that they are not tantrics! The classical source for differentiation of the tantras is a Tibetan historian called Bu-ston; his works are still relied upon by academics from the East and West. Of course, there are many other issues regarding Tantra - for instance, is the mere mantra recitation tantra? We find similar 'dharanis' for warding off snakes and so on even in the Pali canon. I could waffle on for pages.. ([[User:20040302|20040302]])

== &quot;Should...&quot; ==

&quot;Secrecy is a cornerstone of tantric Buddhism, simply to avoid the practices from harming oneself and others without proper guidance. One should realise that it is not even allowed to explain the full symbolism and psychology of the practice to the un-initiated, so obviously, this leads to misunderstanding and dismissal. Tantric techniques may initially appear to consist of ritualistic nonsense; however, it should only be practiced on the basis of a thorough understanding of Buddhist philosophy and strictly following the traditions.&quot;

It is not the place of wikipedia to tell people what they should and shouldn't do.

Also this passage is POV. There are many people who think that the policy of witholding religious teachings from the uninitiated is more for the benefit of the teachers, the hierarchy, than of the disciple, because it makes the disciple politically dependent on the teacher. For instance this was the reason for [[Nichiren|Nichiren's]] hostility to Shingon. Nichiren said (at least according to the way his teachings are interpreted and taught within [[Soka Gakkai International]]) that enlightenment depended on the individual's faith rather than on a mastery of techniques or on intercession from others. I assume that there are other Buddhists and Buddhologists who take a similar view (analogous to [[Martin Luther|Luther's]] objection to the obscurantism of the Catholic Church) and who would therefore have the a similar objection to the Vajrayana position.

Some relatively minor rewording should be enough to keep everybody happy :-) [[User:Ireneshusband|Ireneshusband]] 04:26, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

== Entheogens ==

Why was my addition of a bullet point (with citation: http://www.earthrites.org/magazine_article_crowley.htm) noting the potential use of entheogens within Tantric Buddhism deleted?

Response:
First, &quot;theo&quot; means &quot;god&quot;, and buddhism is a non-theistic religion. (Deva/yidam is a different thing) Then most gurus are explicit against drugs, even if there is some use of alcohol as &quot;samaya substance&quot;. Even if this is a true secret vajrayana practice (which I sincerely doubt), an encyclopedia entry should not expose esoteric and controversial knowledge about its subject, but what is publically known. Third, the article referred does not conform to academic standards of quality, and is seemingly just a sensationalist piece. If some aknowledged scholar in the vajrayana made the comment, then the possibility would have to be acredited. Since &quot;Mike Crowley&quot; is vastly unknown and have never been even quoted or cited in any of the works on vajrayana I have read, it seems to me his opinion should not be publicly related to vajrayana.

I am the second one to have deleted the reference. I don't know who first did it.

Response:
First, if you'd prefer the word &quot;psychedelic,&quot; that's fine.  I was using the term &quot;entheogen&quot; to abate controversy.  I meant it in its loose sense, which generally uses the root &quot;theo&quot; to refer to anything that approximates the divine, but psychedelic may work better.
Second, Wikipedia is full of controversial interpretations of historical writings.  As long as they are acknowledged as such (as I did) and supported with references (as I did), I see no problem with mentioning them in an encyclopedia.  I've seen some real unfounded nonsense on here pass for vaguely argued &quot;possibilities,&quot; and mine is certainly a cut above most of them.  
Third, your ad hominem attacks on the author of my reference hold little water.  Mike Crowley may not be a well-known scholar, and he may have merely posted his book online instead of going through the proper channels of publication, but his argument is more than sound if one gives it the chance.  Furthermore, his work is online and freely available for scutiny if anyone chooses to click on the link.

I've been deleted again. Your bias is disgusting. You are the reason why many people rightfully hate and fear the democratic nature of Wikipedia.

:This is not bias. It is an application of policy. Please read [[WP:V]]. Web  sources are not permitted. I have no objection to the inclusion of the information as long as you can provide a [[WP:RS|reputable source]]. [[User:Ekajati|Ekajati]] 14:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

::The Mike Crowley pages are definitely filled with supposition and hypothesis mixed up with fact - and his authority is questionable. His understanding of Abhisheka and Amrita is particularly limited, and his correlation of Amrita with Soma is mostly mistaken. Regardless, there ''are'' rare (very rare!) instances of drugs being directly mentioned - not the drugs that Crowley talks about - not in the way in which Crowley specifies - and certainly not as entheogens - but for other purposes. This is not the place to discuss such things. As a general rule, I concur with Ekajati etc. regarding the placement of the Crowley pages - it is more likely to further confuse what is already a largely mistaken area of practice and study([[User:20040302|20040302]] 12:30, 30 June 2006 (UTC))

 
Response: I do not think this is a topic which needs to be discussed in a highly public forum like wikipedia. However, the use of entheogens in the Vajrayana tradition has been well documented in reputable sources by such respected scholars as Ronald M Davidson, William George Stablein, Bulcsu Siklos, David B. Gray, Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, Shashibhusan Das Gupta,  Francesca Fremantle, Shinichi Tsuda, David Gordon White, Rene de Nebesky-Wojkowitz, James Francis Hartzell, Edward Todd Fenner, Ian Baker, Dr. Pasang Yonten Arya and others.

== Psychedelics and sex. ==

Can we please delete that?  It is ridiculous and that source has been proven to be incorrect.  Crowley has mentioned that the khatvanga entering a skullcup looks like an inverted mushroom.  Well he's wrong.  The Heruka tsog puja text (which contains the process) clearly states that the khatvanga melts into the skullcup, therefore making it impossible to look like a mushroom.  The whole inner offering is the offering of emptiness, so I don't see how emptiness could possibly have anything to do with 'magic mushrooms'.  He also forgot to mention how the rest of the process is related to mushrooms, so he clearly picks out what might make sense and takes  it out of it's original context.  That is just one example of how flimnsy his evidence is.  

As for the sexual refernce, it only is symbolic and therefore should explain the symbolism instead of what's there.  It is not a central practise of Vajrayana, as Lama Tsong Khapa gained enlgihtenment without it.

&quot;Deity Tantra is often practiced at the moment directly prior to sexual climax. The practitioner takes a consort and this is practiced in pairs. Often times the couple pictures themselves as the deities in the mandala making love.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It gives the impression that tantric buddhist deity practices are predominantly done in a &quot;sexual&quot; setting. In reality however, these deity practices are just meditation practices - with no consort involved. In anuttarayogatantra, the deities often do have consorts, but anuttarayogatantra is not relevant to most tantric practitioners.

==Relationship with Mahayana==

Under this heading, we had:

''From this view the Hinayana and Mahayana are provisional and compromised aspects of the Vajrayana - rather than seeing the Vajrayana as primarily a form of Mahayana Buddhism. This view is also found in Tibetan Buddhism, where it is taught that ultimately one can only become a Buddha by practicing tantra (even if only for the very last step of the path).''

I've deleted the last sentence. Pabongka Rinpoche's lamrim has: ''The secret tantras are said to be even rarer than the Buddhas.''(Pabongka Rinpoche; Ed. Trijang Rinpoche, transl. Michael Richards (Revised edition, 1993). Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand. Wisdom, 649. ISBN 0861715004.) Tibetans believe that enlightenment occurs without Vajrayana but that it takes aeons.

==Newar Buddhism?==
As far as I am aware, there is no sub-school of Buddhism like Newar Buddhism. What is generally practiced in Nepal is Hinduism which includes the Buddha as one of the Avatars.

The influence came from Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism (from the mountain areas).[[User:Rudyh01|rudy]] ([[User talk:Rudyh01|talk]]) 12:24, 5 July 2008 (UTC)

It is truly unfortunate that the Newari Vajrayana tradition has received very little attention in the West. However, there has been some excellent work done in this area by scholars like David Gellner, Todd T.

== Reliable sources ==

This article does not quote just academic sources but also practice sources such as the Dalai Lama, Alex Berzin and Tenzin Palmo.  Since this is so, why is it not possible to quote from the valid source of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's books?  Perhaps [[User:Mitsube|Mistube]] would give clear reasons why the inclusions he or she has deleted are incorrect or inaccurate.  Perhaps they would also like to say why Geshe Kelsang's works are unreliable while the works of other practitioners are not?  Actually, it is [[User:Mitsube|Mistube]] who is being partisan and sectarian for no justifiable reason and his or her actions are leading to an unnecessary edit war.  If you examine Geshe Kelsang's books you will find that they are mainstream Buddhism, not a partisan view.  Speaking of partisan, your use of the word 'inherent' and 'inherently' is a partisan view because few Vajrayana practitioners, unless they were Shentongpas would assert that Buddhanature and Buddhahood exist inherently, yet you do not say that your view is partisan.

If you have reasons, give them, otherwise why delete information that improves the article?  Buddhism is based on logic, not emotional reaction.  I'm giving you a chance to have your say.  If you do not give any valid reasons, I shall re-include the material in the next 24 hours.

We should practice equanimity here, either replacing all the references to practice sources with academic sources, or you should allow quotations from the valid practice sources of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso as he is a respected author and Tharpa Publications is a respected publisher. I await your reasons.--[[User:Truthsayer62|Truthsayer62]] ([[User talk:Truthsayer62|talk]]) 08:41, 6 April 2009 (UTC)

I don't see how this is &quot;taking over&quot; the article, flooding it with quotes from GKG. This is the explanation I gave on the AN, and so far no one has faulted the edit on its own merits: The [[Bodhisattva]] article itself says, ''&quot;Shepherd-like Bodhisattva - one who aspires to delay buddhahood until all other sentient beings achieve buddhahood. Bodhisattvas like [[Avalokiteshvara]], [[Shantideva]] among others are believed to fall in this category.&quot;'' Did you know that [[Manjushri]] also became a Bodhisattva by first cultivating shepherd-like bodhichitta? Yet, the DL quote says, &quot;there is no way that a Bodhisattva either would want to or could delay achieving full enlightenment.&quot; That is why I think it is incorrect, no matter who said it.

Simply including a view from one school of Buddhism isn't POV because that's reality - Buddha taught many different and at times seemingly contradictory views.  There is no one 'right' view except about common subjects such as a the Four Noble Truths.  There are many disagreements between Theravadin and Mahayana.  If Sacca and Mitsube have objections to the content of Truthbody's edits they should make changes but to just revert for no logical reason is against the non-partisan stance of Wikipedia, surely?

I hate to butt in here, but there is no policy which requires sources be academic. The primary requirement is that they be ''reliable''. Mainstream publications in the field may also be used. Publishers like Snow Lion, Tharpa and Wisdom are certainly mainstream within the field of Tibetan Buddhism. However, since Tharpa was founded by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, anything said about ''him'' in a Tharpa publication may not be objective. However, what he may say about Buddhist practice is certainly valid. If it diverges too much from the norm, then there will be multiple sources which present the majority view and GKG's view should be removed or clearly presented as minority in the context of presenting multiple views. What's going on here appears to be [[WP:POINT|disrupting Wikipedia to prove a point]], which is not really a good thing. Pure academics can never give a complete view of spiritual practice, as the results of practice are experiential and cannot be evaluated by someone who is not engaged in them. This leads to frequent inaccuracies and outright mistakes in Western academic approaches to Tantric Buddhism. Material from the practice side is in my opinion necessary to present a neutral view of the subject. [[User:Will in China|Will in China]] ([[User talk:Will in China|talk]]) 18:34, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

The Devanagiri alfabet is - just like the roman alfabet - one of the ways in which one can write sanskrit. No reason to include it, it adds no value just clutter to the text. Different peoples wrote sanskrit in different scripts.

Also, please see [[WP:CRIT]], criticism in not usually placed in the lead, which is for definitions of the topic, but rather either integrated into the article text or in a separate section.

Ok I see now you changed the references. Problem I see though is that the text hasn't changed. You make a reference to 'three turnings of the wheel', how serious should I take that reference? What does it apply to? I imagine to just the term 'three turnings of the wheel'. In that case what is the use of the reference? To prove that the term exists? What about the content of the text around it? How serious are you with these references?

What do you mean indian writer? I used a Japanese scholar and a Canadian one. None of them is indian. I will have aother look, also at where you put the info on ritual. thanks Greetings, [[User_Talk:Sacca|Sacca]] 16:08, 8 April 2009 (UTC)

== Misleading edit summary by [[User:Mitsube]] ==

The edit summary on a recent edit by this user is misleading. It states &quot;Restored neutral, sourced version of confusing paragraph if there must be such a paragraph&quot;. This is not what the edit did. Instead, it introduced an unsourced statement &quot;This classification is part of the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, and is not recognized by Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism&quot; and changed another sourced statement so that it no longer accurately represents what the source states, namely the phrase &quot;not historically accurate&quot;. The source is not so bold and only notes that the account is disputed, not that it is definitely inaccurate. Please ''read'' the sources before changing statements based upon them. The edit also introduces quotation marks around &quot;turnings of the wheel of dharma&quot; implying that this is the only part of the sentence supported by the source. It is not, the whole sentence is supported by the source. Therefore there is no reason for quotation marks.

Perhaps another editor could review [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vajrayana&amp;diff=282883363&amp;oldid=282873563 the change] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vajrayana&amp;action=edit&amp;undoafter=282873563&amp;undo=282891497 revert it] if they determine that the edit does not really do what the edit summary claims.

==Hello==

It cannot be expected that my edits are going to be popular with followers of Vajrayana. However I want to see this article display NPOV. Previously it was heavily slanted to Vajrayana POV so some correction is due. As you see I am just using scholarly publications, others are free to join in. I am sorry this has turned to a somewhat bitter enterprise, but that will not deter me. If work on the intro is made impossible, there are always other sections of this article to improve.  Greetings, [[User_Talk:Sacca|Sacca]] 07:46, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

Basically, I want this article out of start-class (which is the lowest-quality grade for an article) and move it to B status. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment    Greetings, [[User_Talk:Sacca|Sacca]] 09:54, 10 April 2009 (UTC)
==Quality Grade ==
Sacca's definition of &quot;scholarly publication&quot; is itself highly biased and limited.

Frankly, if you omit both Western scholarship by practitioners and sympathizers of Vajrayana -- of whom there are many at major universities around the world -- AND scholars from within the tradition itself, you cut off the actual truth of what Vajrayana is in favor of a seriously biased and incomplete, not to mention erroneous view.

For example -- &quot;The distinctive feature of Vajrayana Buddhism is ritual, which is used as a substitute or alternative for the earlier abstract meditations&quot; is just plain wrong, not simply misleading, but factually incorrect. And that's quite apart from whether you &quot;believe in&quot; Vajrayana, which is arguably not a neutral POV. It's hard to believe anyone could seriously maintain that statement in this day when so much reliable information is available. I could cite thousands of works by the above mentioned Western scholars, not to mention native scholars of Buddhism, that flatly contradict this assertion and get at the objective truth of what Vajrayana is and is not. But why bother if the academic purists are just going to challenge it and edit it out.

Given this, it's probably best that this article stay forever at the lowest level of quality rating. Splitting it into two separate articles from the two different points of view, both equally objective and neutral, might be a way out. But that's probably not something that Wikipedia could actually consider.

:The statement is actually true. Tibetan Buddhists do not engage in many of the meditative practices of early Buddhism, and in particular do not pursue the jhanas, see B. Alan Wallace, ''The bridge of quiescence: experiencing Tibetan Buddhist meditation.'' Carus Publishing Company, 1998, pages 215-216. B. Alan Wallace is a practitioner of Vajrayana. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 02:27, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

:::Hmm... Tibetan Buddhism definitely has more ritual, but I find it hard to accept that that is a &quot;substitute or alternative&quot; for anything particularly. I see it as more of a support for different meditation practices, mostly abstract kinds of meditation actually. So is that statement acknowledging that the rituals are a meditation practice primarily or saying that it is mere ritual without meditation? Personally I think the visualization techniques are likely equivalent to or similar to early buddhist techniques just in different forms, but that's my conjecture. Sure the Tibetans sometimes draw distinctions with early buddhist approach... but that to me seems sometimes to be more directed at their own students to provide a progressive path not really to say that they're doing something fundamentally different than early buddhists. They might be characterizing early buddhist technique as a straw man to then critique with mahayana arguments more than really doing something different fundamentally. - [[User:Owlmonkey|Owlmonkey]] ([[User talk:Owlmonkey|talk]]) 16:07, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

::::I would also see the visualizations as a kind of meditation. Specifically regarding the jhanas, these are specific states which are not pursued in the Mahayana generally. See [[Jhana#In other schools]]. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 00:18, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

::Hello, to me it seems very logical that if you introduce one practice, which takes up time and effort, it has to come out of the available time and effort which is available for other things. When I was in India I saw that the Tibetan monks are very much engaged in ritual - full time. They spend all day performing full-body prostrations (thousands of prostrations a day) in the Maha Bodhi temple, whereas Mahayanic and Theravadan monks and nuns are much more likely to sit/walk meditation. In terms of practice the Tibetans are doing one (ritualistic) practice in stead of something else. There was also this practice with grains of rice which they spread out and then colect again, in a very devoted, formal and ritualistic way. Greetings, [[User_Talk:Sacca|Sacca]] 07:22, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

:::Perhaps they spend more time in overall ritual + practice than sutric monks do. I have no idea.

::::There seem to be two such. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 23:48, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

:::::But it's still a leap to me to generalize that ritual takes the place of meditation or is any kind of substitute. In my experience, the physical actions are combined with mental/internal visualizations and contemplations, and often also include a sub-vocal yet quitely spoken component. So what's happening is the meditation has body, speech, and mind components all concurrently - but it's still a meditation practice really. This is instead of just sitting there quietly sure. So then what is ritual? are we talking about the physical actions that are part of the meditation approach? or some kind of physical action that does not have a mental/contemplative component? And if you visit Nepal and you see someone doing prostrations you're probably not seeing the elaborate linage tree visualization that they're maintaining in their mind nor hear their refuge recitation that is being muttered quietly. To suggest that Tibetan prostrations are not a meditation technique is only from not knowing what's going on at the same time... - [[User:Owlmonkey|Owlmonkey]] ([[User talk:Owlmonkey|talk]]) 00:08, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

:::::::I'm referring to the two cited after the sentence. I now agree with you both that the sentence should be softened.

== Inappropriate Tone of Article ==

The tone of this article is inappropriate. I refer to the article on [[Protestantism]] whereby an article depicts a major grouping within a religion in a similar vein to the Vajrayana as a major grouping within Buddhism. That article has achieved a C rating where this remains at start-class so it can be assumed that they are doing something right. What is very evident in their article is the lack of either criticism or promotion of Protestantism from those inclined towards Catholicism... whereas this article in places reads like a hatchet job of anti-Vajrayana sentiment sourced from scholars who spent the majority of their career working with Theravada source materials or who have written popular Buddhist books only. It may also be that there is material here that isn't sufficiently well-sourced from academic sources and is overly reliant on the self-identification of Vajrayana practitioners. Certainly there is material here that would be unintelligible to those who are not themselves Vajrayana practitioners and such obscurity is in itself inappropriate to the tone of the article. In any case, all pro-Vajrayana or anti-Vajrayana material needs removing from this article since the tone of the article should be entirely neutral. Better to have a much shorter but glaringly neutral article. A good start to neutralizing this article would be removing the whole &quot;Classifying the Vajrayana&quot; paragraph in its entirety. --[[User:Dakinijones|Dakinijones]] ([[User talk:Dakinijones|talk]]) 19:47, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

== Vajrayana v. Esoteric Buddhism ==

This article seems to conflate Esoteric Buddhism with Vajrayana. Outside Tibetan Buddhism and Newar Buddhism, are there any other traditions of Esoteric Buddhism that consider it to be a separate vehicle from the Mahayana? Shingon and the other eastern esoteric schools do not consider the esoteric path to be a different vehicle. Nor was the Esoteric Buddhism practiced in Srivijaya considered to be separate from Mahayana. For that matter, the Esoteric Buddhist lineages in Southeast Asia do not (as far as I am aware) consider themselves to be Vajrayana as a vehicle, nor Mahayana. They are more like a combination of Theravada Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism, and Daoism. In my view, this article should either be divided into several different articles which are more specific (but what page titles?), or the page should be renamed &quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot; or something with similarly broad and inclusive meaning. As it is now, the article gives the impression that Vajrayana as a vehicle is fundamental to Esoteric Buddhism, and this is not at all true across traditions.

The relative prominence of the Japanese Buddhism info box creates misleading impressions for at least one reader.

==Gandhagiri==
It seems to me that the following section is much too specific for the Vajrayana-article. It details a specific region, while, Vajrayana concerns much broader regions and even whole countries. The information ia also available at the [[History of Sambalpur]] article. [[User:Joshua Jonathan|Joshua Jonathan]] ([[User talk:Joshua Jonathan|talk]]) 08:59, 25 March 2012 (UTC)

===Gandhagiri===
In the 9th-10th century the worship and sadhana of Buddha Sambara, the presiding deity of Chakra Sambara Tantra, gained popularity in the Gandhagiri region. In Gandhagiri which also contained a large number of caves and rock shelters, apparently of the followers of Vajrayana and Sahajayana, the adherents of the cults used to live in seclusion and practice Kaya Sadhana or Yogic practices along with worshipping Buddha Sambara.&lt;ref&gt;(Pasayat,2005:12-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief deity of Chakra Sambara Tantra is Buddha Sambara, the deity whose worship is still popular in [[China]] and [[Tibet]]. According to Sadhanamala, god Buddha Sambara is one-faced and two-armed. He appears terrible with his garment of tiger-skin, garland of heads, a string of skulls round the head, three eyes and in Âlidhamudrâ, he tramples upon Kalaratri. 

A number of texts relating to the procedures of worship of &quot;Buddha Sambara&quot; have been coposed by siddhacharyas like Darikapa, Santideva, Jayadratha and others. King [[Indrabhuti]] of Sambaḷaka/Sambaḷa (early [[Sambalpur]]) composed Chakra Sambara Stotra, Chakra Sambara Anubandha Samgraha, Chakra Sambara Tantraraga Sambara Samuchchaya Nama Brutti. Indrabhuti influenced Tantric and Buddhist cult in this region including Gandhagiri region.&lt;ref&gt;(Pasayat, 2007:71-83)&lt;/ref&gt;

This tantric Buddhist culture greatly affected the religious faith and beliefs of the tribal of Gandhagiri. Even today one can notice the invocation of various Buddhist Siddhacharyas and Buddhist deities in the mantras of the tribal to ward off evil spirits or cure some disease. [[Buddha]] was worshipped by many tribal in the name of Budharaja. There is also a small hillock at the heart of present day Sambalpur by the name Budharaja.&lt;ref&gt;(Pasayat, 1998, 2003, 2007, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
