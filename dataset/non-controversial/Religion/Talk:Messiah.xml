==Suggestion, ideas to improve the article==

#When did this whole idea of a &quot;Messiah&quot; came to existance ?
#Who are the names behind it?
#What was the social situation the jews were facing ? Were they in the exile ? Isn't the messianic idea the &quot;rational&quot; solution for a people who is in captivity and does not have the means to organise itself politically ? --[[User:217.228.223.17|217.228.223.17]] 22:48, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Some scholars have suggested that messianic beliefs came into Judiasm from Zoroastrianism. Cyrus the first (Cyrus the Great), leader of the Persian empire, captured Israel from the Babylonian empire. Cyrus had made a habit of restoring the local religions that the Babylonians had suppressed. Even the Zoroastrian preists of Cyrus's empire were from a land Cyrus or one of his predecessors (can't remember) had captured and controlled. Because of the benevolence of the Persian empire, ending the Babylonian captivity and helping to rebuild the Jewish temple, and because of the theological similarities between the Judiasm and the Persian preistly caste, Zoroastrianism had a profound influence on the Jewish people and possibly vice versa. Some scholars have tried to relate this event to the story of Daniel and the Lion's den where Jewish leaders are said to have taught another people many things. I don't know what the support for this reading is.

Interestingly, the &quot;Magi&quot; who appear at the beginning of the New Testament are Zoroastrian preists.

Zoroastrian priests?  Where did you get that idea?  Certainly not from the Biblical account.  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.100.218.210|67.100.218.210]] ([[User talk:67.100.218.210|talk]]) 17:45, 23 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

[[Zoroastrianism]] began in the 5th Century BCE in Persia.  The Maji were probably Babylonian scholars, using manuscripts captured during the exile (when Daniel was taken). --[[User:DeknMike|DeknMike]] ([[User talk:DeknMike|talk]]) 15:24, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

Jews do sometimes refer to the Messiah as 'Son of God' - see the article with that title.

== Capitalization or no ==
:''Discuss at  [[Talk:Jewish_messianism#Capitalization_or_no]]''
In certain articles, the term &quot;messiah&quot; is given capitalization -in what appears to be particular to the Jewish messiah concept, to discern between Jewish and non-Jewish conceptions of &quot;messiah.&quot; I think this presents a bit of a POV issue, as using capitals for the Jewish concept serves to give a kind of title to one particular conception. Ostensibly, it can be argued that the Jewish moshiach is a titular post one which deserves a titular capitalization. But we don't for example give title to a non-existent king as &quot;King,&quot; unless that position has been filled and we are referring to a particular being. Discuss -[[User:Stevertigo|Stevertigo]] ([[User_talk:Stevertigo|t]] | [[User:Stevertigo/Log|log]] | [[Special:Contributions/Stevertigo|c]]) 00:24, 29 August 2010 (UTC)
:: IMHO, as a concept, lower case is appropriate. When ascribing messiahship to an individual figure, that faith would capitalize it.--[[User:DeknMike|DeknMike]] ([[User talk:DeknMike|talk]]) 16:44, 22 December 2011 (UTC)

== Why is Hinduism here ==

Messiahy is a Hebrew word.  It entered many other languages - but how and when did it enter the Hindi language? [[User:Slrubenstein|Slrubenstein]]   |  [[User talk:Slrubenstein|Talk]] 00:16, 20 February 2012 (UTC)
:The whole Hinduism section is unsourced and appears to be [[WP:OR]]. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;

== Improving the section &quot;Christianity&quot; ==

This section as it stands is somewhat scattershot and incoherent.

A primary source for that religion's ideas about the Messiah AKA the [[The Christ]] - a Greek equivalent of the word Messiah - is the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] from the [[New Testament|NT]], widely attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]].

Perhaps that source, with its numerous citations from the [[Old Testament|OT]], could be helpful in more fully presenting Christian ideas about the Messiah. ... comment was by IP 71.161.244.193.

:That section is full of errors and [[WP:OR]]. I tagged it. Needs to be rewritten. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 07:55, 26 July 2012 (UTC)</text>
