[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|400px|Major denominations and religions of the world]]
A '''religious denomination''' is a subgroup within a [[religion]] that operates under a common name, tradition, and identity.

The term describes various [[Christian denomination]]s (for example, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Church of England|Anglicanism]], and the many varieties of [[Protestantism]]). The term also describes the four branches of [[Judaism]] ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]), and describes the two main branches of [[Islam]] ([[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]]).

In [[Hinduism]], the major deity or philosophical belief identifies a denomination, which also typically has distinct cultural and religious practices. The major denominations include [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Smartism]].

==Formation of denominations==
{{main|Development of new religions}}
Denominations often form slowly over time for many reasons. Due to historical accidents of geography, culture and influence between different groups, members of a given religion slowly begin to diverge in their views. Over time members of a religion may find that they have developed significantly different views on [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[religious pluralism]], [[ethics]] and religious practices and rituals. Consequently, different denominations may eventually form. In other cases, denominations form very rapidly, either resulting from a split or schism in an existing denomination, or if people share an experience of spiritual revival or [[spiritual awakening]], and choose to form a new denomination based on that new experience or understanding.

==Examples==
An example within Christianity is the [[Mennonite]] and the [[Church of the Brethren]] denominations. Both denominations are similar in their beliefs, yet they are unique because their traditions were influenced by different founders ([[Menno Simons]] and [[Alexander Mack]] respectively). Their division is administrative, and there is much communication and interaction between them. Since its founding, the Mennonite denomination has split into a number of smaller Mennonite denominations, due to geography, social and theological differences.

Another example is [[Lutheranism]]. When [[Martin Luther]] protested Catholic practices, he and his followers were persecuted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as [[heresy|heretics]]. This led to the formation of alternative [[community of practice|communities of practice]] that became known as &quot;Lutheran&quot; or &quot;[[Protestant]]&quot;. Over time, the various communities who considered themselves Lutheran identified with one another and through various definitions of &quot;Lutheran&quot; practices ([[five solas]], [[priesthood of all believers]]) the conglomerations of churches formed concrete denominations based on a common [[school of thought]] related to these practices. Even today, there are major ideological differences between different denominations of Lutherans, although there may be significant overlap between their beliefs.

==Multi-denominational==
May refer to a [[religious]] event that includes several religious denominations from not always related religious groups.  Many [[civic engagement|civic]] events include religious portions led by representatives from several religious denominations to be as inclusive or representational as possible of the expected population or audience.  A recent example is the Sunday [[thanksgiving]] mass at Campamento Esperanza (English: Camp Hope), [[Chile]], where [[Church service|services]] were led by both a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and by an [[Evangelical]] [[preacher]] during the [[Chile|Chilean]] [[2010 Copiapó mining accident]].&lt;ref name=sundaymassbbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11561355 Chile mine: Rescued men attend service of thanks], BBC News, 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sundaymass&gt;{{cite web|last=Raphael |first=Angie |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/freed-miners-return-to-camp-hope/story-e6frf7jx-1225939966063 |title=Freed miners return to [[Chile]]'s Camp Hope|publisher=Herald Sun |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chaplains]], frequently [[ordained]] [[clergy]] of any [[religion]], are often assigned to [[secular]] organizations to provide [[Spirituality|spiritual]] support to its members who may belong to any of many different religions or denominations.  Many of these chaplains, particularly those serving with the [[military]] or other large secular organizations, are specifically trained to minister to members of many different faiths, even faiths with opposing religious [[ideology]] from that of the chaplain's faith.&lt;ref name=prisonchap&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0712/S00172.htm Christmas in Prison - A Quiet One], Independent News, New Zealand, Press Release: Department Of Corrections, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Military organizations that do not have enough members representing several smaller but related denominations will routinely hold multi-denominational religious services, often called &quot;[[protestant]]&quot; Sunday services, so minority protestant denominations are not left out or unserved.&lt;ref name=obamachurch&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1248042 Obamas Make Rare Trip to Church While in Hawaii], ABC News (US), MARK NIESSE 26 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forthood&gt;[http://www.first.army.mil/contentDisplay.asp?ContentID=482 New chapel heralds more North Fort Hood construction], First U.S. Army, Sgt. 1st Class Gail Braymen, 19 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
