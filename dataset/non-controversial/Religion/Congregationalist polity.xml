'''Congregationalist polity''', often known as '''congregationalism,''' is a system of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church governance]] in which every [[local church]] congregation is independent, [[Ecclesiastical polity|ecclesiastically]] [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], or &quot;[[autonomy|autonomous]]&quot;. Among those major [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions that employ congregationalism are those [[Congregational Churches]] known by the &quot;Congregationalist&quot; name that descended from the Anglo-American [[Puritan]] movement of the 17th century, the [[Baptists|Baptist]] churches, and most of the groups brought about by the [[Anabaptist]] movement in [[Germany]] that immigrated to the U.S. in the late 18th century. More recent generations have witnessed also a growing number of [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]] churches, which are most often congregationalist in their governance. In [[Christianity]], congregationalism is distinguished most clearly from [[episcopal polity]], which is governance by a hierarchy of bishops. But it is also distinct from [[presbyterian polity]], in which higher assemblies of congregational representatives can exercise considerable authority over individual congregations.

Congregationalism is not limited only to organization of Christian congregations; the principles of congregationalism have been inherited by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]]. [[Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s and most [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]]s in the U.S. operate under congregational government, with no hierarchies.

==Basic form==
The term &quot;congregationalist polity&quot; describes a form of church governance that is based on the local congregation.  Each local congregation is independent and self-supporting, governed by the own members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;&gt;Carmen Renee Berry, ''The Unauthorized Guide to Choosing a Church'', Brazos Press, 2003, ISBN 1-58743-036-3&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}  Some band into loose voluntary associations with other congregations that share similar beliefs (e.g., the [[Willow Creek Association]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  Others join &quot;conventions&quot;, such as the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] or the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] (formerly the Northern Baptist Convention).&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  These conventions generally provide stronger ties between congregations, including some doctrinal direction and pooling of financial resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  Congregations that belong to associations and conventions are still independently governed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  Most [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational churches]] are organized along congregationalist lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}} Many do not see these voluntary associations as &quot;[[Christian denomination|denominations]]&quot;, because they &quot;believe that there is no church other than the local church, and denominations are in variance to Scripture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}

==Congregational church==
{{main|Congregational church}}
{{refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
The earmarks of Congregationalism can be traced back to the Pilgrim societies of the United States in the early 17th century. Congregationalism expressed the viewpoint that (1) every local church is a full realization in miniature of the [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church|entire Church]] of [[Jesus Christ]]; and (2) the Church, while on earth, besides the local church, can '''only''' be invisible and ideal. While other theories may insist on the truth of the former, the latter precept of congregationalism gives the entire theory a unique character among plans of church government. There is no other reference than the local congregation for the &quot;visible church&quot; in Congregationalism. And yet, the connection of all Christians is also asserted, albeit in a way that defenders of this view usually decline, often intentionally, to elaborate more clearly or consistently. This first, foundational principle by which congregationalism is guided results in confining it to operate with the consent of each gathering of believers.

Although &quot;congregational rule&quot; may seem to suggest that [[direct democracy|pure democracy]] reigns in congregational churches, this is seldom the case. It is granted, with few exceptions (namely in some Anabaptist churches), that [[God]] has given the government of the Church into the hands of an [[ordination|ordained]] ministry. What makes congregationalism unique is its system of checks and balances, which constrains the authority of the minister, the lay officers, and the members.

Most importantly, the boundaries of the powers of the ministers and church officers are set by clear and constant reminders of the freedoms guaranteed by the [[Gospel]] to the laity, collectively and individually. With that freedom comes the responsibility upon each member to govern himself or herself under Christ. This requires lay people to exercise great charity and patience in debating issues with one another and to seek the glory and service of God as the foremost consideration in all of their decisions.

The authority of all of the people, including the officers, is limited in the local congregation by a definition of union, or a covenant, by which the terms of their cooperation together are spelled out and agreed to. This might be something as minimal as a charter specifying a handful of [[doctrine]]s and behavioral expectations, or even a statement only guaranteeing specific freedoms. Or, it may be a [[constitution]] describing a comprehensive doctrinal system and specifying terms under which the local church is connected to other local churches, to which participating congregations give their assent. In congregationalism, rather uniquely, the church is understood to be a truly voluntary association.

Finally, the congregational theory strictly forbids ministers from ruling their local churches by themselves. Not only does the minister serve by the approval of the congregation, but committees further constrain the pastor from exercising power without consent by either the particular committee, or the entire congregation. It is a contradiction of the congregational principle if a minister makes decisions concerning the congregation without the vote of these other officers. 

The other officers may be called &quot;deacons&quot;, &quot;elders&quot; or &quot;session&quot; (borrowing [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] terminology), or even &quot;[[vestry]]&quot; (borrowing the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] term) &amp;mdash; it is not their label that is important to the theory, but rather their lay status and their equal vote, together with the pastor, in deciding the issues of the church. While other forms of church government are more likely to define &quot;tyranny&quot; as &quot;the imposition of unjust rule&quot;, a congregationally-governed church would more likely define tyranny as &quot;transgression of liberty&quot; or equivalently, &quot;rule by one man&quot;. To a congregationalist, no abuse of authority is worse than the concentration of all decisive power in the hands of one ruling body, or one person. 

Following this sentiment, congregationalism has evolved over time to include even more participation of the congregation, more kinds of lay committees to whom various tasks are apportioned, and more decisions subject to the vote of the entire membership.

One of the most notable characteristics of New England (or British)-heritage Congregationalism has been its consistent leadership role in the formation of &quot;unions&quot; with other churches. Such sentiments especially grew strong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when ecumenism evolved out of a liberal, non-sectarian perspective on relations to other Christian groups that accompanied the relaxation of [[Calvinist]] stringencies held by earlier generations. The congregationalist theory of independence within a union has been a cornerstone of most ecumenical movements since the 18th century.

The congregationalist principles of complete autonomy and strictly voluntary union produce a practically indescribable diversity of beliefs within the congregational unions. The [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) is the result of a union constructed according to congregationalist theory between the [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]] and the [[Congregational Christian Churches]]. These uniting congregations were themselves the result of several previous unions. The General Council of Congregational Christian Churches was formed from a merger between the National Council of Congregational Churches and the General Convention of the Christian Church, also known as [[Christian Connection|Christian Churches or Christian Connection]] (not to be confused with, although partially related to, the Disciples of Christ). The Evangelical and Reformed Church was the result of a partial union of the Reformed Church in the United States and the Evangelical Synod of North America (a union of [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and Reformed). The UCC is by far the most diverse of the Reformed churches in the U.S. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United Reformed Church]] was formed in 1972 by the merger of the Presbyterian and the Congregational churches, on presbyterian principles of union but within a continuing congregational regard for local diversity.

==Baptist churches==
{{main|Baptists}}
{{refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pinson, William M., Jr. |title=Trends in Baptist Polity |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society | url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of [[Elder (Christianity)#Baptists|elders]], as well as the [[Episcopal Baptist]]s that have an [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal system]].

[[Independent Baptist]] churches have no formal organizational structure above the level of the local congregation.  More generally among [[Baptists]], a variety of parachurch agencies and evangelical educational institutions may be supported generously or not at all, depending entirely upon the local congregation's customs and predilections. Usually doctrinal conformity is held as a first consideration when a church makes a decision to grant or decline financial contributions to such agencies, which are legally external and separate from the congregations they serve. These practices also find currency among non-denominational fundamentalist or [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]] fellowships, many of which derive from Baptist origins, culturally if not theologically.

Most [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] and [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist]] congregations, by contrast, generally relate more closely to external groups such as mission agencies and educational institutions than do those of independent persuasion. However, they adhere to a very similar ecclesiology, refusing to permit outside control or oversight of local affairs.

Everything is ''ad hoc''. Most programs emerge from the inspiration and commitment of a single congregation or even a single person. Worthwhile projects survive and prosper by the voluntary cooperation of other individuals and congregations.&quot; Page 449, Leroy Garrett, ''The Stone-Campbell Movement: The Story of the American Restoration Movement'', College Press, 2002, ISBN 0-89900-909-3, ISBN 978-0-89900-909-4, 573 pages&lt;/ref&gt;  Churches of Christ are linked by their shared commitment to restoration principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perfect Stranger&quot;/&gt;{{rp|106}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Are the churches of Christ&quot;/&gt;

Congregations are generally overseen by a [[Plurality (church governance)|plurality]] of [[Elder (religious)|elder]]s (also known in some congregations as shepherds, bishops, or pastors) who are sometimes assisted in the administration of various works by [[deacon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhodes 2005&quot;/&gt;{{rp|124}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Are the churches of Christ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard 1971&quot;&gt;V.
