'''Mount Sinai''' ({{lang-ar|طور سيناء}} ''Ṭūr Sīnā’''; or {{lang|ar|جبل موسى}} ''Jabal Mūsā'', Egyptian Arabic '''Gabal Musa''', lit. &quot;Moses' Mountain&quot; or &quot;Mount Moses&quot;; {{lang-he|הר סיני}} ''Har Sinai''), also known as '''Mount Horeb''', is a mountain in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]] that is the traditional and most accepted identification of the [[Biblical Mount Sinai]]. The latter is mentioned many times in the [[Book of Exodus]] in the [[Torah]], the [[Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Hobbs, ''Mount Sinai'' (University of Texas Press) 1995, discusses Mount Sinai as geography, history, ethnology and religion.&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=95&amp;tid=58726 |title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir |publisher=Tafsir.com |date=2002-10-26 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam]]ic tradition, the biblical Mount Sinai was the place where [[Moses]] received the [[Ten Commandments]].

== Geography ==
Mount Sinai is a {{convert|2285|m|ft|adj=on}} high mountain near [[Saint Catherine, Egypt|Saint Catherine]] in the Sinai region. It is next to [[Mount St. Catherine]] (at {{convert|2629|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=s}}, the highest peak in [[Egypt]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allsinai.info/sites/geology.htm|publisher=AllSinai.info|title=Sinai Geology}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is surrounded on all sides by higher peaks of the mountain range.

== Geology ==
Mount Sinai's rocks were formed in the late stage of the [[Arabian-Nubian Shield]]'s (ANS) evolution. Mount Sinai displays a [[Ring dike|ring complex]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualacademia.com/pdf/rad586_598.pdf Hanaa M. Salem and A. A. ElFouly, ''Minerals Reconnaissance at Saint Catherine Area, Southern Central Sinai, Egypt and their Environmental Impacts on Human Health,''ICEHM2000, Cairo University, Egypt, September, 2000, page 586- 598]&lt;/ref&gt; that consists of alkaline [[granites]] intruded into diverse rock types, including [[Volcanic rock|volcanics]]. The granites range in composition from [[syenogranite]] to alkali feldspar granite. The volcanic rocks are alkaline to peralkaline and they are represented by subaerial flows and eruptions and [[subvolcanic rock|subvolcanic]] [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. Generally, the nature of the exposed rocks in Mount Sinai indicates that they originated from different depths.

== Religious significance ==

The biblical Mount Sinai was one of the most important sacred places in the [[Abrahamic]] religions.

According to [[Bedouin]] tradition, it was the mountain where [[Tetragrammaton|God]] gave laws to the [[Israelites]]. However, the earliest Christian traditions place this event at the nearby [[Mount Serbal]], at the foot of which a monastery was founded in the 4th century; it was only in the 6th century that the monastery moved to the foot of [[Mount Catherine]], following the guidance of [[Josephus]]'s earlier claim that Sinai was the highest mountain in the area. Jebel Musa, which is adjacent to Mount Catherine, was equated with Sinai, by Christians, only after the 15th century.

Christian orthodoxies settled upon this mountain in the third century, [[Georgians]] from the [[Caucasus]] moved to the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in the fifth century, and a Georgian colony was formed there in the ninth century. Georgians erected their own temples in the area of the modern Mount Sinai. The construction of one such temple was connected with the name of David The Builder, who contributed to the erecting of temples in Georgia and abroad as well.  There were political, cultural and religious motives for locating the temple on Mount Sinai. Georgian monks living there were deeply connected with their motherland. The temple had its own plots{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} in Kartli. Some of the Georgian manuscripts of Sinai remain there, but others are kept in Tbilisi, St. Petersburg, Prague, New York, Paris and in private collections.

Some modern biblical scholars now believe that the Israelites would have crossed the Sinai peninsula in a direct route, rather than detouring to the southern tip (assuming that they did not cross the eastern branch of the Red Sea/Reed Sea in boats or on a sandbar), and therefore look for the biblical Mount Sinai elsewhere.

The [[Song of Deborah]], which some [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] consider to be one of the oldest parts of the bible, suggests that Yahweh dwelt at [[Mount Seir]], so many scholars favour a location in [[Nabatea]] (modern Arabia). Alternatively, the biblical descriptions of Sinai can be interpreted as describing a [[volcano]], and so a small number of scholars have considered equating Sinai with locations in northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]; there are no volcanoes in the Sinai Peninsula.

==St. Catherine's Monastery==
([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Μονὴ τῆς Ἁγίας Αἰκατερίνης}}) lies on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], at the mouth of an inaccessible gorge at the foot of modern Mount Sinai in [[St. Catherine, Mount Sinai|St. Catherine city]] in [[Egypt]] at an elevation of 1550 meters. The monastery is [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] and is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. According to the UNESCO report (60100 ha / Ref: 954) and website hereunder, this monastery has been called the oldest working Christian monastery in the world&amp;nbsp;– although the [[Monastery of Saint Anthony]], situated across the Red Sea in the desert south of Cairo, also lays claim to that title.

== Ascent ==
[[Image:MtSinaiJune2006.JPG|thumb|left|Sunrise on Mt. Sinai]]
There are two principal routes to the summit. The longer and shallower route, ''Siket El Bashait'', takes about 2.5 hours on foot, though [[camel]]s can be used. The steeper, more direct route (''Siket Sayidna Musa'') is up the 3,750 &quot;steps of penitence&quot; in the ravine behind the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allsinai.info/sites/sites/mount%20sinai.htm|publisher=AllSinai.info|title=Mount Sinai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summit ==
[[Image:View From Sinai.JPG|thumb|Another view from the summit of Mount Sinai]]
[[Image:NearSinaiTop.JPG|thumb|left|The last few meters of the climb up Mount Sinai.]]
The summit of the mountain has a [[mosque]] that is still used by Muslims. It also has a [[Greek Orthodox]] chapel, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of a 16th century church, that is not open to the public. The chapel encloses the rock which is considered to be the source for the biblical [[Tablets of Stone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sacredsites&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredsites.com/africa/egypt/mount_sinai.html|publisher=Places of Peace and Power|title=Mount Sinai, Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the summit also is &quot;Moses' cave&quot;, where Moses was said to have waited to receive the [[Ten Commandments]].
