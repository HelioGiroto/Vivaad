{{Religion by Country}}
&lt;!-- Before editing this definition, please use the talk page. --&gt;'''Religion''' is a collection of [[belief system]]s, [[cultural system]]s, and [[world view]]s that relate humanity to [[spirituality]] and, sometimes,&lt;!--not all religions concern themselves with morality--&gt; to [[morality|moral values]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a &quot;cultural system&quot; (Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973). A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as &quot;an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category.&quot; (Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and [[sacred history|sacred histories]] that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[creation myth|origin of life]] or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]]. They tend to derive [[Moral code|morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]]. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Everything World's Religions Book: Explore the Beliefs, Traditions and Cultures of Ancient and Modern Religions, page 1 Kenneth Shouler - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions may have organized [[religious behaviour|behaviors]], [[clergy]], a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, [[holy places]], and [[Religious text|scripture]]s. The practice of a religion may also include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration of a [[god]], [[gods]] or [[goddess]]es, [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]], [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[music]], [[art]], [[dance]], [[Community service|public service]] or other aspects of human culture. Religions may also contain mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''religion'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[faith]]'' or ''[[belief system]]''; however, in the words of [[Émile Durkheim]], religion differs from private belief in that it is &quot;something eminently social&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim, E.]] (1915) ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; A global 2012 poll reports that 59% of the world's population is religious, 23% are [[irreligion|not religious]], and 13% are [[atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |title=Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism |publisher=WIN-Gallup International |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Main|Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio}}

''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' &quot;religious community,&quot; from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') &quot;respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;obligation, the bond between man and the gods&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure.  One possibility is derivation from a reduplicated ''{{lang|la|*le-ligare}}'', an interpretation traced to [[Cicero]] connecting ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' &quot;read&quot;, i.e. ''re'' (again) + ''lego'' in the sense of &quot;choose&quot;, &quot;go over again&quot; or &quot;consider carefully&quot;.  Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligare}}'' &quot;bind, connect&quot;, probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re'' (again) + ''ligare'' or &quot;to reconnect,&quot; which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation of [[Lactantius]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.'' Toronto. Thomas Allen, 2004. ISBN 0-88762-145-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Power of Myth]],'' with Bill Moyers, ed. Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991.  ISBN 0-385-41886-8&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: &quot;we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:75.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]], the root of the English word &quot;religion&quot;, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only &quot;reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]]&quot; (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean &quot;diligence&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p.33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called &quot;law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. ''[http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA28&amp;id=aM0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=4 Introduction to the science of religion]''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages have words that can be translated as &quot;religion&quot;, but they may use them in a very different way, and some have no word for religion at all. For example, the [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as &quot;religion&quot;, also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]]. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between &quot;imperial law&quot; and universal or &quot;Buddha law&quot;, but these later became independent sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshio Kuroda|Kuroda, Toshio]] and Jacqueline I. Stone, translator. &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030323095019/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/477.pdf The Imperial Law and the Buddhist Law].&quot; ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'' 23.3-4 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil McMullin. ''Buddhism and the State in Sixteenth-Century Japan''. Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no precise equivalent of &quot;religion&quot; in Hebrew, and [[Judaism]] does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;Hershel Edelheit, Abraham J. Edelheit,  [http://www.questia.com/library/book/history-of-zionism-a-handbook-and-dictionary-by-abfaham-j-edelheit-hershel-edelheit.jsp History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary], p.3, citing [[Solomon Zeitlin]], ''The Jews. Race, Nation, or Religion?'' ( Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;  One of its central concepts is &quot;[[halakha]]&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;law&quot;&quot;, which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life.

The use of other terms, such as obedience to God or [[Islam]] are likewise grounded in particular histories and vocabularies.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Turner. ''Islam without Allah?'' New York: Routledge, 2000. pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There are numerous definitions of religion and only a few are stated here. The typical dictionary definition of religion refers to a &quot;belief in, or the worship of, a god or gods&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chambers.co.uk/dictionaries/the-chambers-dictionary.php ''The Chambers Dictionary''.] Chambers.&lt;/ref&gt; or the &quot;service and worship of God or the supernatural&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion Religion]. Merriam-Webster Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many writers and scholars{{Who|date=September 2012}} have noted that this basic 'belief in god' definition fails to capture the diversity of religious thought and experience.{{Citation Needed|date=September 2012}} [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion as simply &quot;the belief in spiritual beings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1''. London: John Murray; (p.383).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued, back in 1871, that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus &quot;has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them&quot;. He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a &quot;system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1993) ''Religion as a cultural system''. In: The interpretation of cultures: selected essays, Geertz, Clifford, pp.87-125. Fontana Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Alluding perhaps to [[Edward Burnett Tylor| Tylor's]] &quot;deeper motive&quot;, Geertz remarked that &quot;we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(''ibid'', p. 90)&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] also emphasized the &quot;cultural reality&quot; of religion, which he defined as &quot;the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings&quot;; he took the term &quot;supernatural&quot; simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;vergote&quot;&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, belief and unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[Durkheim]], in his seminal book [[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]], defined religion as a &quot;unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. (1915) [http://www.archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durkrich ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'']. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; By sacred things he meant things &quot;set apart and forbidden &amp;mdash; beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them&quot;. Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. &quot;In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them&quot; (''ibid'', p. 45).&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be &quot;a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(''ibid'', p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.&lt;ref&gt;(''ibid'', pp. 40–41)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book [[‪The Varieties of Religious Experience‬]], the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as &quot;the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1902) [http://archive.org/details/varietiesreligi02jamegoog ''The Varieties of Religious Experience. A Study in Human Nature''.] Longmans, Green, and Co. (p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt; By the term &quot;divine&quot; James meant &quot;any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(''ibid'', p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt; to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.&lt;ref&gt;(''ibid'', p. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as &quot;one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p.82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is &quot;the state of being ultimately concerned&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1957) ''Dynamics of faith''. Harper Perennial; (p.1).&lt;/ref&gt; which &quot;is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of &quot;sacred&quot;, &quot;divine&quot;, intensive &quot;valuing&quot;, or &quot;ultimate concern&quot;, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g. [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion. Online Textbook'']. Philip A. Pecorino. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
There are a number of theories regarding the origins of religion. According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, &lt;blockquote&gt;Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology|edition= |last1= Monaghan|first1= John |last2= Just |first2= Peter |year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-19-285346-2|page= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies. Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, &quot;it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology|edition= |last1= Monaghan|first1= John |last2= Just |first2= Peter |year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-19-285346-2|page= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings,&lt;ref name=&quot;vergote 89&quot;&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and thus religion, as a concept, has been [[Reification (fallacy)|applied inappropriately]] to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.

==Types of religion==
{{See|History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|300px|Major denominations and religions of the world]]
===Categories===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''universal religions'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinnells&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-33311-3 |pages=439–440 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald. ''The Ideology of Religious Studies''. New York: Oxford University Press USA, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Prentiss. ''Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity''. New York: NYU Press, 2003. ISBN 0-8147-6701-X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomoko Masuzawa. ''The Invention of World Religions, or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005. ISBN 0-226-50988-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called &quot;world religions.&quot; However, some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;pennington&quot;&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. ISBN 0-19-516655-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. McCutcheon. ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lash. ''The beginning and the end of 'religion'.'' Cambridge University Press, 1996. ISBN 0-521-56635-5&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. &quot;religions&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. &quot;Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation.&quot; ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp.71-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] faiths;
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. Page 06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaith cooperation===
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse, many religious practitioners have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which remains notable even today both in affirming &quot;universal values&quot; and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian-Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.

Recent interfaith initiatives include &quot;A Common Word&quot;, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,&lt;ref&gt;[http://acommonword.com/ A Common Word]&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;C1 World Dialogue&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/ C1 World Dialogue]&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;Common Ground&quot; initiative between Islam and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://islambuddhism.com/ Islam and Buddhism Common Ground]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[United Nations]] sponsored &quot;World Interfaith Harmony Week&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/ World Interfaith Harmony Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/world-interfaith-harmony-week-resolution/ UN resolution]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Religious groups==
{{Main|Major religious groups}}
{{Further|Organized religion}}
The list of still-active religious movements given here is an attempt to summarize the most important regional and philosophical influences on local communities, but it is by no means a complete description of every religious community, nor does it explain the most important elements of individual religiousness.

The five largest religious groups by population, estimated to account for between 5 and 7 billion people, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and Chinese folk religion.

===Abrahamic religions===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].
* '''[[Judaism]]''' is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. Judaism is based primarily on the [[Torah]], a text which some Jews believe was handed down to the people of Israel through the prophet [[Moses]]. This along with the rest of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Talmud]] are the central texts of Judaism. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Christianity]]''' is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
** '''[[Catholic Church]]''', headed by the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]], is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of the [[Latin Rite|Western church]] and 22&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]].
** '''[[Protestantism]]''', separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and split in many denominations,
** '''[[Eastern Christianity]]''' which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Church of the East]].
::There are other smaller groups, such as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], whose inclusion in Christianity is sometimes disputed.
[[Image:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
* '''[[Islam]]''' is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Southeast Europe]]. The two largest sects are [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]], although there are [[Divisions of Islam#Heterodox groups|other minor groups]] as well. [[Wahhabi]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Afghanistan]].
* The '''[[Bahá'í Faith]]''' is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]].
* Smaller regional Abrahamic groups, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===Indian religions===
[[File:Rama, Lakshman and Sita at the Kalaram Temple, Nashik..jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hindu]] statue of [[Rama]] in Kalaram Temple ([[India]])]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]].
* '''[[Hinduism]]''' is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a &quot;religion&quot;, &quot;set of religious beliefs and practices&quot;, &quot;religious tradition&quot; etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: &quot;Establishing the boundaries&quot; in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1-17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, ISBN 0-900588-74-8, proposes a definition of the term &quot;religion&quot; and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt; P. 484 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; P. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges &lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt; P. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short &lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name with whom Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.
* '''[[Jainism]]''', taught primarily by [[Parsva]] (9th century BCE) and [[Mahavira]] (6th century BCE), is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence for all forms of living beings in this world. Jains are found mostly in India.
*'''[[Buddhism]]''' was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhattha Gotama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana]].
** '''[[Theravada]]''' Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** '''[[Mahayana]]''' Buddhism (or the &quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) under which are a multitude of doctrines that began their development [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** '''[[Vajrayana]]''' Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, ISBN 0-203-18593-5 p=194&lt;/ref&gt;. It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E. Gene (2001). Among Tibetan Texts: History and Literature of the Himalayan Plateau. Boston: Wisdom Publications. ISBN 0-86171-179-3&lt;/ref&gt; and extends across all of Asia&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', ISBN 4-7674-2015-6&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Mikkyō]] ).
** Two notable new Buddhist sects are [[Hòa Hảo]] and the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]], which were developed separately in the 20th century.
* '''[[Sikhism]]''' is a monotheistic religion founded on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak]] and ten successive [[Sikh Gurus]] in 15th century [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Sikhs are found mostly in India.

===Iranian religions===
[[File:Maneckji Sett Agiary entrance.jpg|upright|thumb|Zoroastrian [[Fire Temple]]]]
[[Iranian religions]] are ancient religions whose roots predate the [[Islamization]] of [[Greater Iran]]. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.
* '''[[Zoroastrianism]]''' is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet [[Zoroaster]] in the 6th century BC. The Zoroastrians worship the [[Creator deity|Creator]] [[Ahura Mazda]]. In Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.
* '''[[Mandaeism]]''' is a [[monotheistic]] religion with a strongly [[Dualism|dualistic]] worldview. Mandaeans are sometime labeled as the &quot;Last [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]&quot;.
* '''[[Kurdish people#Religion|Kurdish religions]]''' include the traditional beliefs of the [[Yazidi]], [[Alevi]], and [[Ahl-e Haqq]]. Sometimes these are labeled [[Yazdânism]].

===Folk religions===
[[Folk religion]] is a term applied loosely and vaguely to less-organized local practices. It is also called [[paganism]], [[shamanism]], [[animism]], [[ancestor worship]], [[matriarchal religion]], or [[totemism]], although not all of these elements are necessarily present in local belief systems. The category of &quot;folk religion&quot; can generally include anything that is not part of an organization. Modern [[neopagan]] movement draws on folk religion for inspiration to varying degrees.
* '''[[African traditional religion]]''' is a category including any type of religion practiced in Africa before the arrival of Islam and Christianity, such as [[Yoruba religion]] or [[San religion]]. There are many varieties of [[Afro-American religion|religions developed by Africans in the Americas]] derived from African beliefs, including [[Santería]], [[Candomblé]], [[Umbanda]], [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], and [[Oyotunji]].
* Folk religions of the Americas include [[Aztec religion]], [[Inca religion]], [[Maya religion]], and modern Catholic beliefs such as the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]]. [[Native American mythology|Native American religion]] is practiced across the continent of North America.
* '''[[Australian Aboriginal culture]]''' contains [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|a mythology]] and sacred practices characteristic of folk religion.
[[File:Chinese temple incence burner.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Incense]] burner in China]]
* '''[[Chinese folk religion]]''', practiced by [[Chinese people]] around the world, is a primarily social practice including popular elements of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], with some remnants of Mahayana Buddhism. Most Chinese do not identify as religious due to the strong [[Maoist]] influence on the country in recent history, but adherence to religious ceremonies remains common. New religious movements include [[Falun Gong]] and [[I-Kuan Tao]].
* Traditional '''[[Religion in Korea|Korean religion]]''' is a syncretic mixture of Mahayana Buddhism and [[Korean shamanism]]. Unlike Japanese Shinto, Korean shamanism was never codified and Buddhism was never made a social necessity. In some areas these traditions remain prevalent, but [[Christianity in Korea|Korean-influenced Christianity]] is also influential in society and politics in South Korea.
* Traditional '''[[Religion in Japan|Japanese religion]]''' is a mixture of Mahayana Buddhism and ancient indigenous practices which were codified as [[Shinto]] in the 19th century. Japanese people retain nominal attachment to both Buddhism and Shinto through social ceremonies, but [[irreligion]] is common.
* '''[[Spiritualism]]''' is a religion in which the adherents believe they communicate with the spirits of people who have died.

===New religions===
[[File:Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist Society Sanctuary.PNG|thumb|upright|A [[Modernism|Modern-style]] Unitarian Universalist sanctuary]]
'''[[New religious movement]]s''', which may be novel in origin or part of a wider established religion, include:
* '''[[Shinshūkyō]]''' is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century. These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding. The largest religious movements centered in Japan include [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Tenrikyo]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]] among hundreds of smaller groups.
* '''[[Cao Đài]]''' is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion, established in [[Vietnam]] in 1926.
* '''[[Raëlism]]''' is a new religious movement founded in 1974 teaching that humans were created by aliens. It is numerically the world's largest [[UFO religion]].
* '''[[Hindu reform movements]]''', such as [[Ayyavazhi]], [[Swaminarayan Faith]] and [[Ananda Marga]], are examples of new religious movements within Indian religions.
* '''[[Unitarian Universalism]]''' is a religion characterized by support for a &quot;free and responsible search for truth and meaning,&quot; and has no accepted [[creed]] or [[theology]].
* '''[[Scientology]]''' teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as [[auditing]], in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience painful or traumatic events in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.
* '''[[Eckankar]]''' is a pantheistic religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one's life.
* '''[[Wicca]]''' is a neo-pagan religion first popularised in 1954 by British civil servant Gerald Gardner, involving the worship of a God and Goddess.
* '''[[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]]''' is a religion promoting harmony with nature, and drawing on the practices of the druids.
* '''[[Satanism]]''' is a broad category of religions that, for example, worship Satan as a deity ([[Theistic Satanism]]) or use 'Satan' as a symbol of carnality and earthly values ([[‪LaVeyan Satanism‬]]).

[[Sociological classifications of religious movements]] suggest that within any given religious group, a community can resemble various types of structures, including &quot;churches&quot;, &quot;denominations&quot;, &quot;sects&quot;, &quot;cults&quot;, and &quot;institutions&quot;.

==Issues in religion==

===Religion and economics===
[[Image:Religion_economy.png | thumb | The national income of countries correlates negatively with their religiosity.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Economics of religion}}
{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
While there has been much debate about how religion affects the economy of countries, in general there is a negative correlation between religiosity and the wealth of nations. In other words, the richer a nation is, the less religious it tends to be.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web|last=WIN-Gallup|title=Global Index of religion and atheism.|url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: &quot;Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Religion and Medicine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf|quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. We also reviewed articles that provided suggestions on how clinicians might assess and support the spiritual needs of patients. Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide|author=Paul S. Mueller, MD; David J. Plevak, MD; Teresa A. Rummans, MD|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested &quot;that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Maselko, J. and Kubzansky, L. D. (2006) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008 ''Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey'']. Social Science &amp; Medicine, Vol 62(11), June, 2848-2860. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and violence===

[[Image:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|The [[Crusades]] were a series of a military campaigns fought mainly between [[Christian]] [[Europe]] and [[Muslim]]s. Shown here is a battle scene from the [[First Crusade]]. They were inspired at the ''jihad'' of the Islam civilization. ]]

Charles Selengut characterizes the phrase &quot;religion and violence&quot; as &quot;jarring&quot;, asserting that &quot;religion is thought to be opposed to violence and a force for peace and reconciliation.  He acknowledges, however, that &quot;the history and scriptures of the world's religions tell stories of violence and war as they speak of peace and love.&quot;&lt;ref name=Selengut&gt;{{cite book |title=Sacred fury: understanding religious violence |first=Charles |last=Selengut|page=1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mOqtEkGlq0cC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22sectarian+violence%22+%22religious+violence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sectarian%20violence%22%20%22religious%20violence%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7425-6084-0 |date=2008-04-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hector Avalos]] argues that, because religions claim divine favor for themselves, over and against other groups, this sense of righteousness leads to violence because conflicting claims to superiority, based on unverifiable appeals to God, cannot be adjudicated objectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos|publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of religion [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] go further and argue that religions do tremendous harm to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchens 2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=God is not Great|publisher=Twelve|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins 2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Bantam Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Regina Schwartz argues that all monotheistic religions are inherently violent because of an exclusivism that inevitably fosters violence against those that are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawrence Wechsler asserts that Schwartz isn't just arguing that Abrahamic religions have a violent legacy, but that the legacy is actually genocidal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wechsler |first=Lawrence |title=Mayhem and Monotheism|url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron Bland asserts that one of the most prominent reasons for the &quot;rise of the secular in Western thought&quot; was the reaction against the religious violence of the 16th and 17th centuries. He asserts that &quot;(t)he secular was a way of living with the religious differences that had produced so much horror. Under secularity, political entities have a warrant to make decisions independent from the need to enforce particular versions of religious orthodoxy. Indeed, they may run counter to certain strongly held beliefs if made in the interest of common welfare. Thus, one of the important goals of the secular is to limit violence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Byron |last=Bland |title=Evil Enemies: The Convergence of Religion and Politics|url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/program/centers/scicn/papers/religion_and_political_violence.pdf |date = May 2003|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, believers have used similar arguments when responding to atheists in these discussions, pointing to the [[Criticism of atheism#Atheism and totalitarian regimes|widespread imprisonment and mass murder]] of individuals under [[state atheism|atheist states]] in the twentieth century:&lt;ref name=&quot;John S.

In response to such a line of argument, however, author Sam Harris writes:
&quot;The problem with fascism and communism, however, is not that they are too critical of religion; the problem is that they are too much like religions. Such regimes are dogmatic to the core and generally give rise to personality cults that are indistinguishable from cults of religious hero worship. Auschwitz, the gulag and the killing fields were not examples of what happens when human beings reject religious dogma; they are examples of political, racial and nationalistic dogma run amok. There is no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too reasonable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/harris06/harris06_index.html 10 myths and 10 truths about Atheism] Sam Harris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religion and the law===

There are laws and statutes that make reference to religion.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;An example is the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. However the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has intentionally not pinned down a precise legal definition to allow for flexibility in preserving rights for what might be regarded as a religion over time. [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Religion]&lt;/ref&gt; This has led scholar Winnifred Sullivan to claims that religious freedom is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Winnifred Fallers Sullivan, ''The Impossibility of Religious Freedom''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the Western legal principle of [[separation of church and state]] tends to engender a new, more inclusive [[civil religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald C. Wimberley and James A. Christenson. &quot;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/4106009 Civil Religion and Church and State]&quot;. ''The Sociological Quarterly'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Winter, 1980), pp. 35-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and science===
{{Main|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}

Religious knowledge, according to religious practitioners, may be gained from religious leaders, [[sacred texts]], [[scriptures]], or personal [[revelation]]. Some religions view such knowledge as unlimited in scope and suitable to answer any question; others see religious knowledge as playing a more restricted role, often as a complement to knowledge gained through physical observation. Adherents to various religious faiths often maintain that religious knowledge obtained via sacred texts or revelation is absolute and infallible and thereby creates an accompanying [[religious cosmology]], although the proof for such is often [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] and generally limited to the religious texts and revelations that form the foundation of their belief.

In contrast, the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiments]] and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even outright rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

===Religion and social constructionists===
In recent years, some academic writers have described religion according to the theory of [[social constructionism]], which considers how ideas and social phenomena develop in a social context.  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Timothy Fitzgerald, Daniel Dubuisson and Talal Asad.  The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, says that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on etymology, which &quot;tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history&quot;.&lt;ref name=dubuisson/&gt;  &quot;What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion'&quot;, he says, &quot; is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history.&quot;&lt;ref name=dubuisson/&gt;  He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word &quot;religion&quot;.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;Daniel Dubuisson, ''The Western Construction of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;  Dubuisson prefers the term &quot;cosmographic formation&quot; to religion.  Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]].  The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the &quot;living&quot; or &quot;universal&quot; European world view to the &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;ethnic&quot; religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson. &quot;Exporting the Local: Recent Perspectives on 'Religion' as a Cultural Category&quot;, ''Religion Compass'', 1.6 (2007), p.792.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Tomoko Masuzawa, ''The Invention of World Religions.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s definition of religion as a &quot;cultural system&quot; was proposed in the 20th century and continues to be widely accepted today.

According to Fitzgerald, the history of other cultures' interaction with the religious category is not about a universal constant,{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} but rather concerns a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call &quot;religiousness&quot;, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. This system persisted in the eastern [[Byzantine Empire]] following the [[East-West Schism]], but Western Europe regulated unpredictable expressions of charisma through the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  As the Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this point that &quot;religion&quot; was dissociated with universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However there was not yet the idea of dogma as personal choice, only of [[established church]]es.  With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as &quot;a feeling of absolute dependence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hueston A. Finlay. &quot;‘Feeling of absolute dependence’ or ‘absolute feeling of dependence’? A question revisited&quot;. ''Religious Studies'' 41.1 (2005), pp.81-94.&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary [[Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as &quot;the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. &quot;Lectures on the origin and growth of religion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Asad argues that before the word &quot;religion&quot; came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a &quot;rule&quot; just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354–430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven.  It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''Genealogies of Religion''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1993 p.34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]].  In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara says that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of &quot;religion&quot; as a worldwide practice.&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Balagangadhara. ''The Heathen in His Blindness...'' New York: Brill Academic Publishers, 1994. p.159.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of &quot;religious freedom&quot; was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pennington&quot;/&gt; In [[Japan]], where Buddhism was still seen as a philosophy of [[natural law]],&lt;ref&gt;Jason Ānanda Josephson. &quot;When Buddhism Became a 'Religion'&quot;. ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'' 33.1: 143–168.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;religious freedom&quot; as separate from other power structures was unnecessary until Christian missionaries demanded free access to conversion, and when Japanese Christians refused to engage in patriotic events.&lt;ref&gt;Isomae Jun’ichi. &quot;Deconstructing 'Japanese Religion'&quot;. ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'' 32.2: 235–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other writers====
Similar views have been put forward by writers who are not social constructionists.  [[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]], says that religion does not refer to belief in &quot;[[God]]&quot; or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to &quot;a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments.”&lt;ref&gt;George A. Lindbeck, ''Nature of Doctrine'' (Louisville: Westminster/John Knox Press, 1984), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas de Lange]], Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at [[Cambridge University]], says that &quot;The comparative study of religions is an academic discipline which has been developed within Christian theology faculties, and it has a tendency to force widely differing phenomena into a kind of strait-jacket cut to a Christian pattern.  The problem is not only that other 'religions' may have little or nothing to say about questions which are of burning importance for Christianity, but that they may not even see themselves as religions in precisely the same way in which Christianity sees itself as a religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas de Lange, ''Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related forms of thought==
===Religion and superstition===
{{See|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Superstition has been described as &quot;the incorrect establishment of cause and effect&quot; or a false conception of causation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R. Foster and Hanna Kokko, &quot;The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour&quot;, ''Proc. R. Soc. B'' (2009) 276, 31–37]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Religion is more complex and includes social institutions and morality. But religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p 211 {{Clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Early Christianity]] was outlawed as a ''superstitio Iudaica'', a &quot;Jewish superstition&quot;, by [[Domitian]] in the 80s AD.  In AD 425, when Rome had become Christian, [[Theodosius II]] outlawed [[Ancient Roman religion|pagan traditions]] as superstitious.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition &quot;in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion&quot; (para. #2110).  &quot;Superstition,&quot; it says, &quot;is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16-22&quot; (para. #2111)

===Myth===
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
#A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
#A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
#A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 ISBN 0-385-24774-5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Urarina shaman B Dean.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Urarina]] [[shaman]], 1988]]

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called &quot;myths&quot; in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term &quot;myth&quot; can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, &quot;Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library ISBN 1-57731-202-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term ''myth'' has a non-pejorative meaning. There, ''myth'' is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true. Examples include the death and [[resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin and is also ostensibly a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old &quot;life&quot; and the start of a new &quot;life&quot; is what is most significant.  Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

==Secularism and irreligion==
{{Main|Secularism|Irreligion}}
{{See also|Atheism|Agnosticism|Antireligion}}

The terms &quot;[[atheist]]&quot; (lack of belief in any gods) and &quot;agnostic&quot; (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of &quot;religious&quot;. There are religions (including Buddhism and Taoism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of &quot;religious&quot; is the word &quot;irreligious&quot;. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

As religion became a more personal matter in Western culture, discussions of society became more focused on political and scientific meaning, and religious attitudes (dominantly Christian) were increasingly seen as irrelevant for the needs of the European world. On the political side, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] recast Christian beliefs in light of humanism, paving the way for [[Karl Marx]]'s famous characterization of religion as &quot;[[Opium of the people|the opium of the people]]&quot;. Meanwhile, in the scientific community, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]] in 1869 coined the term &quot;[[agnostic]],&quot; a term—subsequently adopted by such figures as [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]]—that, while directly conflicting with and novel to Christian tradition, is accepted and even embraced in some other religions. Later, [[Bertrand Russell]] told the world ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'', which influenced several later authors to discuss their breakaway from their own religious uprbringings from Islam to Hinduism.

===Parody religions===
{{main|Parody religion}}
Parody religions are imitation [[belief system]]s that challenge [[Spirituality|spiritual]] convictions of others, often through [[humor]], [[satire]], and/or [[burlesque]]. Often created to achieve a specific purpose related to another belief system, a parody religion can be a parody of one or more specific systems or even the very concept of [[religious belief]]. In some parody religions, emphasis is on making fun and being a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among like-minded, e.g. the [[Church of the SubGenius]]. Other parody religions target a specific religion, [[sect]], [[cult]], or [[new religious movement]].

One approach to parody religion aims to highlight deficiencies in particular pro-religious arguments — the thinking being that if a given argument can also be used to support a clear parody, then the original argument is [[proving too much|clearly flawed]]. An example of this is the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]], which parodies the equal time argument employed by [[intelligent design]] [[Creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/2006-03-26-spaghetti-monster_x.htm USA Today - Spaghetti Monster is noodling around with faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several religions that are classified as parody religions have a number of relatively serious followers who embrace the perceived absurdity of these religions as spiritually significant, a decidedly [[post-modern]] approach to religion. For instance, in [[Discordianism]], it may be hard to tell if even these &quot;serious&quot; followers are not just taking part in an even bigger joke. This joke, in turn, may be part of a greater path to enlightenment, and so on ''ad infinitum''.

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of religion}}

Religious criticism has a long history, going back at least as far as the 5th century [[BCE]]. During classical times, there were religious critics in [[ancient Greece]], such as [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras &quot;the atheist&quot; of Melos]], and in the 1st century BCE in [[ancient Rome|Rome]], with [[Titus Lucretius Carus]]'s ''[[De Rerum Natura]]''.

During the [[Middle Ages]], potential critics of religion were persecuted and largely forced to remain silent. There were notable critics like [[Giordano Bruno]], who was burned at the stake for disagreeing with religious authority. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/bruno00.htm BRUNO His Life and Thought];[http://galileo.rice.edu/chr/bruno.html Giordano Bruno (1548-1600)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century]] with the [[Enlightenment]], thinkers like [[David Hume]] and [[Voltaire]] criticized religion.

In the [[19th century]], [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[theory of evolution]] lead to increased skepticism about religion. [[Thomas Huxley]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Robert Ingersol]], and [[Mark Twain]] were noted 19th century and early 20th century critics. In the [[20th century]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Siegmund Freud]], and others continued religious criticism.

[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Victor J. Stenger]], and the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] were active critics during the late 20th century and early 21st century.

Critics consider religion to be outdated, harmful to the individual (e.g. [[brainwashing]] of children, [[faith healing]], [[circumcision]]), harmful to society (e.g. [[religious war|holy war]]s, [[terrorism]], wasteful distribution of resources), to impede the progress of [[science]], to exert social control, and to encourage immoral acts (e.g. [[human sacrifice|blood sacrifice]], [[homophobia|discrimination against homosexuals]] [[misogyny|and women]]). A major criticism of many religions is that they require beliefs that are irrational, unscientific, or unreasonable, because religious beliefs and traditions lack scientific or rational foundations.

Some modern-day critics, such as [[Bryan Caplan]], hold that religion lacks utility in human society; they may regard religion as irrational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Religious Beliefs Are Irrational, and Why Economists Should Care|author=Bryan Caplan | url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/ldebate.htm}} The article about religion and irrationality.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Peace Laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]] has spoken out against undemocratic Islamic countries justifying &quot;oppressive acts&quot; in the name of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Dialogues 2006 Conference, Brisbane. &quot;In these countries, Islamic rulers want to solve 21st century issues with laws belonging to 14 centuries ago. Their views of human rights are exactly the same as it was 1400 years ago.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
