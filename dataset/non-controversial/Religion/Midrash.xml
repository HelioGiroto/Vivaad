The Hebrew term '''''Midrash'''''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; ({{lang-he|מדרש}}; plural ''midrashim'', &quot;story&quot; from &quot;to investigate&quot; or &quot;study&quot;) also &quot;Interpretation&quot; or &quot;Exposition&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://virtualreligion.net/iho/midrash.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a   [[Homiletics|homiletic]] method of biblical [[exegesis]]. The term also refers to the whole compilation of homiletic teachings on the [[Bible]]. 

''Midrash'' is a way of interpreting biblical stories that goes beyond simple distillation of religious, legal or moral teachings. It fills in many gaps left in the biblical narrative regarding events and personalities that are only hinted at.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=1104191&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=15&amp;title=%27Living%20with%20contradiction%20%27&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 Living with contradiction, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of midrash was to resolve problems in the interpretation of difficult passages of the text of the Hebrew Bible, using Rabbinic principles of [[hermeneutics]] &amp; [[philology]] to align them with the religious &amp; ethical values of religious teachers. This method of interpretation was eventually expanded 'to provide scriptural pretexts to justify oral tradition.'&lt;ref&gt;http://virtualreligion.net/iho/midrash.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[Gesenius]] ascribes the etymology of ''midrash'' to the [[Qal (linguistics)|Qal]] of the common Hebrew verb ''darash'' (דָּרַשׁ) &quot;to seek, study, inquire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brown Driver Briggs]] Hebrew Lexicon ''midrash''&lt;/ref&gt; The word, &quot;midrash&quot; occurs twice in the [[Hebrew Bible]]: 2 Chronicles 13:22 &quot;in the midrash of the prophet [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo]]&quot;, and 24:27 &quot;in the midrash of the Book of the Kings.&quot;

== Methodology ==
According to the [[PaRDeS]] approaches to [[exegesis]], interpretation of Biblical texts in Judaism is realized through ''peshat'' (literal or plain meaning, lit. &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;), ''remez'' (deep meaning, lit. &quot;hints&quot;), ''derash'' (comparative meaning, from Hebrew ''darash''—&quot;to inquire&quot; or &quot;to seek&quot;) and ''sod'' (hidden meaning or philosophy, lit. &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;mystery&quot;). The Midrash concentrates somewhat on ''remez'' but mostly on ''derash'' (Some thinkers divide PaRDeS into pshat, remez, ''din'' (law) and sod.  In this understanding, midrash aggada deals with remez and midrash halakha deals with din).  

Many different exegetical methods are employed to derive deeper meaning from a text. This is not limited to the traditional thirteen textual tools attributed to the [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Ishmael ben Elisha|Rabbi Ishmael]], which are used in the interpretation of ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law). Presence of apparently superfluous words or letters, chronology of events, parallel narratives or other textual anomalies are often a springboard for interpretation of segments of Biblical text. In many cases, a dialogue is expanded manifold: handfuls of lines in the Biblical narrative may become long philosophical discussions. It is unclear whether the Midrash assumes these dialogues took place in reality or if this refers only to subtext or religious implication.

Many midrashim start off with a seemingly unrelated sentence from the Biblical books of [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] or the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. This sentence later turns out to metaphorically reflect the content of the rabbinical interpretation offered. This strategy is used particularly in a sub-genre of midrash known as the &quot;petikhta.&quot;

Some Midrash discussions are highly metaphorical, and many Jewish authors stress that they are not intended to be taken literally. Rather, other midrashic sources may sometimes serve as a key to particularly esoteric discussions. Later authors maintain that this was done to make this material less accessible to the casual reader and prevent its abuse by detractors.

== Forms of Midrashic literature ==
In general the Midrash is focused on either [[halakha]] (legal) or [[Aggada|Aggadic]] (non-legal and chiefly homiletical) subject matter. Both kinds of Midrashim were at first preserved only [[oral law|orally]]; but their writing down commenced in the 2nd century, and they now exist in the shape chiefly of exegetical or homiletical commentaries on [[Tanakh]] (the Hebrew Bible). Midrashic literature is worthwhile reading not only for its insights into Judaism and the history of Jewish thought, but also for the more incidental data it provides to historians, philologists, philosophers, and scholars of either historical-critical Bible study or comparative religion.

== Halakhic midrashim ==
{{Rabbinical Literature}}
''[[Midrash halakha]]'' are the works in which the sources in the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible) of the traditionally received laws are identified. These Midrashim often predate the [[Mishnah]]. The Midrash linking a verse to a ''halakha'' will often function as a proof of a law's authenticity; a correct elucidation of the Torah carries with it the support of the ''halakhah'', and often the reason for the rule's existence (although many rabbinical laws have no direct Biblical source). The term is applied also to the derivation of new laws, either by means of a correct interpretation of the obvious meaning of scriptural words themselves or by the application of certain [[hermeneutic]] rules.

=== Origins ===
After the return of Jewish refugees from their exile in [[Babylon]], some argue that the [[Torah]] was central to Jewish life at home and abroad. This is certainly the case in some strains of Judaism, although scholars agree the period was marked by wide diversity, so the centrality of Torah would vary greatly for different groups. A significant concern of Jewish authorities was to ensure compliance with the Torah's commandments, the enactments of the [[Torah|Mosaic Law]]; yet, as these laws had been written in circumstances of the past, they seemed to call for adaptation or explication if they were to fit the circumstances of contemporary life. Explanations of the terms of the Mosaic legislation are legal, or [[Halakha|halakhic]] Midrashim. Relatedly, the Mishnah does not generally cite a scriptural basis for its laws; connecting the Mishnaic law with the Torah law is also undertaken by the later Midrash (and Talmuds).

== Aggadic midrashim ==
{{main|Aggadah}}
Homiletic midrashim embraces the interpretation of the non-legal portions of the Hebrew Bible. These midrashim are sometimes referred to as ''aggadah'' or ''haggadah'', a loosely defined term that may refer to all non-legal discourse in classical rabbinic literature.

Aggadic explanations of the non-legal parts of Scripture are characterized by a much greater freedom of exposition than the halakhic Midrashim (midrashim on Jewish law.) Aggadic expositors availed themselves of various techniques, including sayings of prominent rabbis. These aggadic explanations could be philosophical or mystical disquisitions concerning [[angel]]s, [[demon]]s, [[paradise]], [[hell]], the [[messiah]], [[Satan]], feasts and fasts, [[parable]]s, legends, satirical assaults on those who practice [[idolatry]], etc.

Some of these midrashim entail mystical teachings. The presentation is such that the Midrash is a simple lesson to the uninitiated, and a direct allusion, or analogy, to a Mystical teaching for those educated in this area.

An example of a Midrashic interpretation:

:&quot;And God saw all that He had made, and found it very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.&quot; ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:31)—Midrash: ''Rabbi Nahman said in Rabbi Samuel's name: &quot;Behold, it was good&quot; refers to the Good Desire; &quot;And behold, it was very good&quot; refers to the Evil Desire. (It only says &quot;very good&quot; after man was created with both the good and bad inclinations, in all other cases it only says &quot;and God saw that it was good&quot;) Can then the Evil Desire be very good? That would be extraordinary! But without the Evil Desire, however, no man would build a house, take a wife and beget children; and thus said Solomon: &quot;Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man's rivalry with his neighbour.&quot; (Kohelet IV, 4)''.&lt;ref&gt;(''Genesis Rabbah'' 9:7, translation from Soncino Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical compilations ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
{{see also|Rabbinical literature}}

=== Tannaitic ===
* '''[[Mekhilta]]'''. The Mekhilta essentially functions as a commentary on the [[Book of Exodus]]. There are two versions of this midrash collection. One is ''Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael'', the other is ''Mekhilta de Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai''. The former is still studied today, while the latter was used by many medieval Jewish authorities. While the latter (bar Yohai) text was popularly circulated in manuscript form from the 11th to 16th centuries, it was lost for all practical purposes until it was rediscovered and printed in the 19th century.
** [[Mekhilta#Mekilta of R. Ishmael|Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael]]. This is a halakhic commentary on Exodus, concentrating on the legal sections, from Exodus 12 to 35. It derives halakha from Biblical verses. This midrash collection was redacted into its final form around the 3rd or 4th century; its contents indicate that its sources are some of the oldest midrashim, dating back possibly to the time of Rabbi Akiva. The midrash on Exodus that was known to the Amoraim is not the same as our current mekhilta; their version was only the core of what later grew into the present form.
** [[Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon|Mekhilta de Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai]]. Based on the same core material as Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, it followed a second route of commentary and editing, and eventually emerged as a distinct work. The Mekhilta de Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai is an exegetical midrash on Exodus 3 to 35, and is very roughly dated to near the 4th century.
* '''[[Sifra]]''' on [[Leviticus]]. The Sifra work follows the tradition of Rabbi Akiva with additions from the School of Rabbi Ishmael. References in the Talmud to the Sifra are ambiguous; It is uncertain whether the texts mentioned in the Talmud are to an earlier version of our Sifra, or to the sources that the Sifra also drew upon. References to the Sifra from the time of the early medieval rabbis (and after) are to the text extant today. The core of this text developed in the mid-3rd century as a critique and commentary of the Mishnah, although subsequent additions and editing went on for some time afterwards.
* '''[[Sifre]]''' on [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]], going back mainly to the schools of the same two Rabbis. This work is mainly a halakhic midrash, yet includes a long haggadic piece in sections 78-106. References in the Talmud, and in the later Geonic literature, indicate that the original core of Sifre was on the [[Book of Numbers]], Exodus and [[Deuteronomy]]. However, transmission of the text was imperfect, and by the Middle Ages, only the commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy remained. The core material was redacted around the middle of the 3rd century.
* '''[[Sifre Zutta]]''' (The small Sifre). This work is a halakhic commentary on the book of Numbers. The text of this midrash is only partially preserved in medieval works, while other portions were discovered by [[Solomon Schechter]] in his research in the famed [[Cairo Geniza]]. It seems to be older than most other midrash, coming from the early 3rd century.

=== Post-Talmudic ===
* ''Midrash Qohelet'', on [[Ecclesiastes]] (probably before middle of ninth century).
* ''[[Midrash Esther]]'', on [[Book of Esther|Esther]] (A.D. 940).
* The ''Pesikta'', a compilation of homilies on special Pentateuchal and Prophetic lessons (early eighth century), in two versions:
** [[Pesikta Rabbati]]
** [[Pesikta de-Rav Kahana]]
* '''[[Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer]]''' (not before eighth century), a Midrashic narrative of the more important events of the Pentateuch.
* '''[[Tanchuma]]''' or '''[[Yelammedenu]]''' (ninth century) on the whole Pentateuch; its homilies often consist of a Halachic introduction, followed by several poems, exposition of the opening verses, and the Messianic conclusion. There are actually a number of different 'Midrash Tanhuma' collections. The two most important are ''[[Midrash Tanhuma Ha Nidpas]]'', literally the published text. This is also sometimes referred to as ''[[Midrash Tanhuma Yelamdenu]].'' The other is based on a manuscript published by [[Solomon Buber]] and is usually known as ''[[Midrash Tanhuma Buber]],'' much to many students' confusion, this too is sometimes referred to as  ''Midrash Tanhuma Yelamdenu.'' The fact is even though the first one is the most widely distributed today, when the Medieval authors refer to Midrash  Tanchuma, they usually mean the second one.
* '''[[Midrash Shmuel (aggadah)|Midrash Shmuel]]''', on the first two Books of Kings (I, II Samuel).
* ''[[Midrash Tehillim]]'', on the [[Psalms]].
* '''[[Midrash Mishle|Midrash Mishlé]]''', a commentary on the book of Proverbs.
* '''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]''' (or simply '''Seder Olam'''). Traditionally attributed to the tannaitic Rabbi [[Yose ben Halafta]]. This work covers topics from the Creation of the universe to the construction of the Second [[Temple in Jerusalem]].
* '''[[Yalkut Shimoni]]'''. A collection of midrash on the entire Hebrew Scriptures ([[Tanakh]]) containing both [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggadah|aggadic]] midrash. It was compiled by Shimon ha-Darshan in the 13th century CE and is collected from over 50 other midrashic works.
* '''[[Tanna Devei Eliyahu]]'''. This work that stresses the reasons underlying the commandments, the importance of knowing Torah, prayer, and repentance, and the ethical and religious values that are learned through the Bible. It consists of two sections, Seder Eliyahu Rabbah and Seder Eliyahu Zuta. It is not a compilation but a uniform work with a single author.
* ''[[Alphabet of Akiba ben Joseph]]'', a midrash on the names of the letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]
* [[Midrash Tadshe]] (called also [[Baraita de-Rabbi Pinehas ben Yair]]):

=== Midrash Rabbah ===
* '''[[Midrash Rabbah]]'''. Widely studied are the ''Rabboth'' (great commentaries), a collection of ten midrashim on different books of the Bible. However, despite the similarity in their names, ''these are not a cohesive work''. They were written by different authors, in different locales, in different historical eras. The ones on Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are chiefly made up of homilies on the Scripture sections for the Sabbath or festival, while the others are rather of an exegetical nature.
** ''[[Genesis Rabba|Bereshith Rabba]]'', ''Genesis Rabbah''. This text dates from the sixth century CE. A midrash on Genesis, it offers explanations of words and sentences and haggadic interpretations and expositions, many of which are only loosely tied to the text. It is often interlaced with maxims and parables. Its redactor drew upon earlier rabbinic sources, including the Mishnah, Tosefta, the halakhic midrashim the Targums. It apparently drew upon a version of Talmud Yerushalmi that resembles, yet was not identical to, the text that survived to present times. It was redacted sometime in the early 5th century.
** ''[[Exodus Rabbah|Shemot Rabba]]'', ''Exodus Rabbah'' (tenth or eleventh and twelfth century)
** ''[[Leviticus Rabbah|Vayyiqra Rabba]]'', ''Leviticus Rabbah'' (middle seventh Century)
** ''[[Numbers Rabbah|Bamidbar Rabba]]'', ''Numbers Rabbah'' (twelfth century)
** ''[[Deuteronomy Rabbah|Devarim Rabba]]'', ''Deuteronomy Rabbah'' (tenth century)
** ''[[Song of Songs Rabbah|Shir Hashirim Rabba]]'', ''Song of Songs Rabbah'' (probably before the middle of ninth century)
** ''[[Ruth Rabbah|Ruth Rabba]]'', (probably before the middle of ninth century)
** ''[[Lamentations Rabbah|Eicha Rabba]]'', ''Lamentations Rabbah'' (seventh century). ''Lamentations Rabbah'' has been transmitted in two versions. One edition is represented by the 1st printed edition, 1519 Pesaro; the other is the Buber edition, based on manuscript J.I.4 from the Biblioteca Casanatense in Rome. This latter version ([[Salomon Buber]]) is quoted by the [[Shulkhan Arukh]], as well as medieval Jewish authorities. It was probably redacted sometime in the 5th century.

== Contemporary Midrash ==
A wealth of literature and artwork has been created in the 20th and 21st centuries by people aspiring to create &quot;Contemporary Midrash&quot;.  Forms include poetry, prose, Bibliodrama (the acting out of Bible stories), murals, masks, and  music, among others.  The Institute for Contemporary Midrash was formed to facilitate these reinterpretations of sacred texts.  The institute hosted several week-long intensives between 1995 and 2004, and published eight issues of ''Living Text: The Journal of Contemporary Midrash'' from 1997 to 2000.
