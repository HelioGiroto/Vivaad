A '''biblical canon''', or '''canon of scripture''',&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, L. M. &amp; Sanders, J. A., eds. (2002). ''The Canon Debate''. &quot;The Notion and Definition of Canon.&quot; pp. 29, 34. (In the article written by Eugene Ulrich, &quot;canon&quot; is defined as follows: &quot;...the definitive list of inspired, authoritative books which constitute the recognized and accepted body of sacred scripture of a major religious group, that definitive list being the result of inclusive and exclusive decisions after serious deliberation.&quot; It is further defined as follows: &quot;...the definitive, closed list of the books that constitute the authentic contents of scripture.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; is a list of books considered to be authoritative [[scripture]] by a particular religious community. The word &quot;canon&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;κανών&quot;,  meaning &quot;[[ruler|rule]]&quot; or &quot;[[measuring stick]]&quot;. The term was first coined in reference to scripture by Christians, but the idea is said to be Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, editors of ''The Canon Debate'', 2002, ''The Notion and Definition of Canon'' by Eugene Ulrich, page 28: &quot;The term is late and Christian ... though the idea is Jewish&quot;; also from the ''Introduction'' on page 13: &quot;We should be clear, however, that the current use of the term &quot;canon&quot; to refer to a collection of scripture books was introduced by David Ruhnken in 1768 in his ''Historia critica oratorum graecorum'' for lists of sacred scriptures. While it is tempting to think that such usage has its origins in antiquity in reference to a closed collection of scriptures, such is not the case.&quot; The technical discussion includes Athanasius's use of &quot;kanonizomenon=canonized&quot; and Eusebius's use of ''kanon'' and &quot;endiathekous biblous=encovenanted books&quot; and the [[Mishnaic]] term ''Sefarim Hizonim'' (external books).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[textual criticism|textual basis]] of the canon can also be specified. For example, the Hebrew/Aramaic text as [[Tiberian vocalization|vocalized]] and [[Hebrew diacritics|pointed]] (cf. ''[[niqqud]]'') in the [[medieval]] era by the [[Masoretes]], the [[Masoretic text]], is the canonical text for Judaism. A modern example of this closing of a textual basis, in a process analogous to the closing of the canon itself, is the [[King James Only movement]], which takes either the actual English text of various [[redaction]]s of the actual [[King James Bible]] itself, or alternately, the textual basis of the King James Version — [[Daniel Bomberg|Bomberg's Masoretic text]] for the [[Old Testament]] and the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' in various editions, those of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], [[Theodore Beza|Beza]], and [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]], alongside the [[Complutensian polyglot]], for the [[New Testament]] — as the specified, correct, and inspired textual tradition. Similarly, certain groups specify their particular self-published version or [[Bible translations|translation of the Bible]] as the most reliable. Among these are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], who produce the [[New World Translation]].

Most of the canons listed below are considered &quot;closed&quot; (i.e., books cannot be added or removed),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxv.iii.iii.xxv.html Athanasius Letter 39].6.3: &quot;Let no man add to these, neither let him take ought from these.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a belief that public [[revelation]] has ended and thus the inspired texts may be gathered into a complete and authoritative canon, which scholar [[Bruce Metzger]] defines as &quot;an authoritative collection of books.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, page 32–33: ''Closed list''; page 30: &quot;But it is necessary to keep in mind [[Bruce Metzger]]'s distinction between &quot;a collection of authoritative books&quot; and &quot;an authoritative collection of books.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an &quot;open canon&quot;, which permits the addition of books through the process of [[continuous revelation]], Metzger defines as &quot;a collection of authoritative books.&quot; (A table of Biblical scripture for both Testaments, with regard to canonical acceptance in [[Christendom|Christendom's]] various major traditions, appears [[#Canons of various Christian traditions|below]]. For a further listing of canons used and enumeration of the books included in them, with distinct regard to the original language in which they were written, see Wikipedia's article on the [[books of the Bible]].)

These canons have been developed through debate and agreement by the religious authorities of their respective faiths. Believers consider canonical books to be [[Biblical inspiration|inspired by God]] or to express the authoritative history of the relationship between God and [[People of God|his people]]. Books, such as the [[Jewish-Christian gospels]], have been excluded from the canon altogether, but many [[Antilegomena|disputed books]] considered non-canonical or even [[apocryphal]] by some are considered to be [[Biblical apocrypha]] or [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical]] or fully canonical by others. There are differences between the Jewish [[Tanakh]] and [[Christian biblical canons]], and between the canons of different [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]]. The differing criteria and processes of canonization dictate what the various communities regard as inspired scripture. In some cases where there are varying strata of scriptural inspiration, it becomes prudent even to discuss texts that only have an elevated status within a particular tradition. This becomes even more complex when considering the open canons of the various [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint sects]] — which may be viewed as extensions of both Christianity and thus Judaism — and the scriptural revelations purportedly given to several leaders over the years within that [[Latter-day Saint Movement|movement]].

==Jewish canon==
{{Main|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] (Hebrew: יהדות רבנית) recognizes the twenty-four books of the [[Masoretic Text]], commonly called the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew: תַּנַ&quot;ךְ) or &quot;Hebrew Bible.&quot; Evidence suggests that the process of canonization occurred between 200 BC and 200 AD, indeed a popular position is that the [[Torah]] was canonized c. 400 BC, the [[Neviim|Prophets]] c. 200 BC, and the [[Ketuvim|Writings]] c. 100 AD&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps at a hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] — however, this position is increasingly criticised by modern scholars.

{{Judaism|state=collapsed}}

[[File:Scroll.jpg|thumb|left|A [[scroll]] of the [[Book of Esther]]; one of the [[five megillot|five ''megillot'']] of the [[Tanakh]].]]

The book of [[Deuteronomy]] includes a prohibition against adding or subtracting ({{bibleverse-nb||Deut|4:2}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|12:32}}) which might apply to the book itself (i.e. a &quot;closed book&quot;, a prohibition against future [[scribe|scribal]] editing) or to the instruction received by [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mt. Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, ed., ''The Canon Debate'', page 60, chapter 4: ''The Formation of the Hebrew Canon: Isaiah as a Test Case'' by Joseph Blenkinsopp.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book of [[2 Maccabees]], itself not a part of the Jewish canon, describes [[Nehemiah]] (c. 400 BC) as having &quot;founded a library and collected books about the kings and prophets, and the writings of David, and letters of kings about votive offerings&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||2Macc|2:13–15|NRSV}}). The [[Book of Nehemiah]] suggests that the priest-scribe [[Ezra]] brought the [[Torah]] back from [[Babylon]] to [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Second Temple]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|8–9}}) around the same time period. Both I and II Maccabees suggest that [[Judas Maccabeus]] (c. 167 BC) likewise collected sacred books ({{bibleverse-nb||1Macc|3:42–50|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||2Macc|2:13–15|NRSV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||2Macc|15:6–9|NRSV}}), indeed some scholars argue that the Jewish canon was fixed by the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies in ''The Canon Debate'', page 50: &quot;With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these [[primary sources]] do not suggest that the canon was at that time ''closed''; moreover, it is not clear that these sacred books were identical to those that later became part of the canon.

The [[Great Assembly]], also known as the Great Synagogue, was, according to Jewish tradition, an assembly of 120 scribes, sages, and prophets, in the period from the end of the Biblical prophets to the time of the development of Rabbinic Judaism, marking a transition from an era of prophets to an era of Rabbis. They lived in a period of about two centuries ending c. 70 AD.
Among the developments in Judaism that are attributed to them are the fixing of the Jewish Biblical canon, including the books of Ezekiel, Daniel, Esther, and the Twelve Minor Prophets; the introduction of the triple classification of the [[oral Torah]], dividing its study into the three branches of [[midrash]], [[halakot]], and [[aggadot]]; the introduction of the Feast of [[Purim]]; and the institution of the prayer known as the [[Amidah|Shemoneh 'Esreh]] as well as the synagogal prayers, rituals, and benedictions.

In addition to the Tanakh, mainstream Judaism considers the [[Talmud]] (Hebrew: תַּלְמוּד ) to be another central, authoritative text. It takes the form of a record of [[rabbi]]nic discussions pertaining to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], [[Jewish ethics|ethics]], philosophy, customs, and history. The Talmud has two components: the [[Mishnah]] (c. 200 AD), the first written compendium of Judaism's oral Law; and the [[Gemara]] (c. 500 AD), an elucidation of the Mishnah and related [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] writings that often ventures onto other subjects and expounds broadly on the Tanakh. The Talmud is the basis for all codes of [[Halakha|rabbinic law]] and is often quoted in other [[rabbinic literature]].

==Samaritan canon==
{{Main|Samaritan Torah}}

Another version of the Torah in the [[Samaritan alphabet]], also exists. This text is associated with the [[Samaritans]] (Hebrew: שומרונים; Arabic: السامريون), a people of whom the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states: &quot;Their history as a distinct community begins with the taking of Samaria by the Assyrians in 722 BC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=110&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Samaritan Jewish Encyclopedia: Samaritans]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samaritan Pentateuch (detail).jpg|thumb|right|The Abisha Scroll; the oldest scroll among the Samaritans in Nablus and possibly the oldest surviving Pentateuch scroll on [[Earth]].]]

The Samaritan Pentateuch's relationship to the Masoretic Text is still disputed. Some differences are minor, such as the ages of different people mentioned in genealogy, while others are major, such as a commandment to be monogamous, which only appears in the Samaritan version. More importantly, the Samaritan text also diverges from the Masoretic in stating that Moses received the [[Ten Commandments]] on [[Mount Gerizim]] — not [[biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] — and that it is upon this mountain (Gerizim) that sacrifices to God should be made — not in Jerusalem. Scholars nonetheless consult the Samaritan version when trying to determine the meaning of text of the original Pentateuch, as well as to trace the development of text-families. Some scrolls among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] have been identified as proto-Samaritan Pentateuch text-type.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canon Debate'', McDonald &amp; Sanders editors, 2002, chapter 6: ''Questions of Canon through the Dead Sea Scrolls'' by James C. VanderKam, page 94, citing private communication with Emanuel Tov on ''biblical manuscripts'': Qumran scribe type c.25%, proto-Masoretic Text c. 40%, pre-Samaritan texts c.5%, texts close to the Hebrew model for the Septuagint c.5% and nonaligned c.25%.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons have also been made between the Samaritan Torah and the Septuagint version.

Samaritans consider the Torah to be inspired scripture, but do not accept any other parts of the Bible — probably a position also held by the [[Sadducees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=40&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Sadducees Jewish Encyclopedia: Sadducees]: &quot;With the destruction of the Temple and the state the Sadducees as a party no longer had an object for which to live. They disappear from history, though their views are partly maintained and echoed by the Samaritans, with whom they are frequently identified (see Hippolytus, &quot;Refutatio Hæresium,&quot; ix. 29; Epiphanius, l.c. xiv.; and other Church Fathers, who ascribe to the Sadducees the rejection of the Prophets and the Hagiographa; comp. also Sanh. 90b, where &quot;Ẓadduḳim&quot; stands for &quot;Kutim&quot; [Samaritans]; Sifre, Num. 112; Geiger, l.c. pp. 128–129), and by the Karaites (see Maimonides, commentary on Ab. i. 3; Geiger, &quot;Gesammelte Schriften,&quot; iii. 283–321; also Anan ben David; Karaites).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; They did not expand their canon by adding any Samaritan compositions. There is a [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|Samaritan Book of Joshua]], however this is a popular chronicle written in Arabic and is not considered to be scripture. Other non-canonical [[Samaritans#Religious texts|Samaritan religious texts]] include the Memar Markah (Teaching of Markah) and the Defter (Prayerbook) — both from the 4th century or later.&lt;ref&gt;''Samaritan Documents, Relating To Their History, Religion and Life'', translated and edited by John Bowman, Pittsburgh Original Texts &amp; Translations Series Number 2, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of the remnants of the Samaritans in modern-day [[Israel]]/[[Palestine]] retain their version of the Torah as fully and authoritatively canonical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=110&amp;letter=S#437 JewishEncyclopedia.com – SAMARITANS]&lt;/ref&gt; They regard themselves as the true &quot;guardians of the Law.&quot; This assertion is only re-enforced by the claim of the Samaritan community in [[Nablus]] (an area traditionally associated with the ancient city of [[Shechem]]) to possess the oldest existing copy of the Torah — one that they believe to have been penned by Abisha, a grandson of [[Aaron]].&lt;ref&gt;Crown, Alan D. (October 1991). &quot;The Abisha Scroll - 3,000 Years Old?&quot; in ''Bible Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Christian biblical canons|Development of the Christian biblical canon|Canonical gospels}}

===Early Church===

====Earliest Christian communities====

Though the [[Early Church]] used the [[Old Testament]] according to the canon of the [[Septuagint]] (LXX),&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders's 2002 ''The Canon Debate'', page 259: &quot;the so-called Septuagint was not in itself formally closed.&quot; &amp;mdash; attributed to Albert Sundberg's 1964 Harvard dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as found in the [[Development of the old testament canon#Bryennios List|Bryennios List]] or [[Melito's canon]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] did not otherwise leave a defined set of new [[scriptures]]; instead, the [[New Testament]] developed over time.

Writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest [[Christian]] communities. The [[Pauline epistles]] were circulating in collected forms by the end of the 1st century AD. [[Justin Martyr]], in the early 2nd century, mentions the &quot;memoirs of the Apostles,&quot; which Christians (Greek: Χριστιανός) called &quot;gospels,&quot; and which were considered to be authoritatively equal to the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Ferguson, &quot;Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon,&quot; in ''The Canon Debate''. eds. L. M. McDonald &amp; J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002) pp. 302–303; cf. Justin Martyr, ''[[First Apology]]'' 67.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marcion's canon====

[[Marcion of Sinope]] was the first Christian leader in recorded history (though later, considered [[heresy|heretical]]) to propose and delineate a uniquely Christian canon&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''The canon of the New Testament'', 1997, Oxford University Press, page 98: &quot;The question whether the Church's canon preceded or followed Marcion's canon continues to be debated. ...Harnack...John Knox...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 140 AD). This included 10 epistles from [[St. Paul]], as well as a version of the [[Gospel of Luke]], which today is known as the [[Gospel of Marcion]]. In so doing, he established a particular way of looking at religious texts that persists in Christian thought today. After Marcion, Christians began to divide texts into those that aligned well with the &quot;canon&quot; (measuring stick) of accepted theological thought and those that promoted heresy. This played a major role in finalizing the structure of the collection of works called the Bible. It has been proposed that the initial impetus for the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Christian]] project of canonization flowed from opposition to the canonization of Marcion.&lt;ref name = &quot;Harnack&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=von Harnack |first=Adolf |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html |title=Origin of the New Testament |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostolic Fathers====

A four-gospel canon (the ''Tetramorph'') was asserted by [[Irenaeus]] in the following quote: &quot;It is not possible that the gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For, since there are four quarters of the earth in which we live, and four universal winds, while the church is scattered throughout all the world, and the 'pillar and ground' of the church is the gospel and the spirit of life, it is fitting that she should have four pillars breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh… Therefore the gospels are in accord with these things… For the living creatures are quadriform and the gospel is quadriform… These things being so, all who destroy the form of the gospel are vain, unlearned, and also audacious; those [I mean] who represent the aspects of the gospel as being either more in number than as aforesaid, or, on the other hand, fewer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Adv. Haer., iii. x. 8 &amp; 9) Everett Ferguson, &quot;Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon,&quot; in ''The Canon Debate''. eds. L. M. McDonald &amp; J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002) pp. 301; cf. Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' 3.11.8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A folio from [[Papyrus 46|P46]]; an early 3rd century collection of [[Pauline epistles]].]]

By the early 3rd century, Christian theologians like [[Origen of Alexandria]] may have been using — or at least were familiar with — the same 27 books found in modern New Testament editions, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of some of the writings (see also [[Antilegomena]]).&lt;ref&gt;Both points taken from Mark A. Noll's ''Turning Points'', (Baker Academic, 1997) pp 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise by 200, the [[Muratorian fragment]] shows that there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to what is now the New Testament, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. De Jonge, &quot;The New Testament Canon,&quot; in ''The Biblical Canons''. eds. de Jonge &amp; J. M. Auwers (Leuven University Press, 2003) p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while there was a good measure of debate in the Early Church over the New Testament canon, the major writings were accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of the Bible'' (volume 1) eds. P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans (Cambridge University Press, 1970) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Church===

====Alexandrian Fathers====

Origen of Alexandria was an early figure in the codification of the Biblical canon. He was a scholar well educated in the realm of both theology and pagan philosophy but was posthumously condemned at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553. Origen decided to make his canon include all of the books in the current Catholic canon except for four books: [[Epistle of James|James]], [[Second Epistle of Peter|2nd Peter]], and the [[Second Epistle of John|2nd]] and [[Third Epistle of John|3rd epistles of John]].&lt;ref&gt;Prat, Ferdinand. &quot;Origen and Origenism.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 July 2008.&lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11306b.htm&gt;.  According to [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxv.html Eusebius' Church History 6.25]: a 22 book OT [though Eusebius doesn't name Minor Prophets, presumably just an oversight?] + 1 DeuteroCanon [&quot;And outside these are the [[Books of the Maccabees|Maccabees]], which are entitled S&lt;ph?&gt;ar beth sabanai el.&quot;] + 4 Gospels but on the Apostle &quot;Paul ... did not so much as write to all the churches that he taught; and even to those to which he wrote he sent but a few lines.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He also included the [[Shepherd of Hermas]] which was later rejected.  The religious scholar [[Bruce Metzger]] described Origen's efforts, saying “The process of canonization represented by Origen proceeded by way of selection, moving from many candidates for inclusion to fewer.”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Manning Metzger, &quot;The canon of the New Testament: its origin, development, and significance&quot;, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first major attempts at the compilation of certain books and letters as authoritative and inspired teaching for the Early Church at the time, although it is unclear whether Origen intended for his list to be authoritative itself.

In his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of exactly the same books that would become the [[New Testament]]–27 book–proto-canon,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg 2006 15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity|first=Carter|last=Lindberg|page=15|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=1-4051-1078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the phrase &quot;being canonized&quot; (''kanonizomena'') in regard to them.&lt;ref&gt;David Brakke, &quot;Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter,&quot; in ''Harvard Theological Review'' 87 (1994) pp. 395–419&lt;/ref&gt;
Athanasius also included the [[Book of Baruch]], as well as the [[Letter of Jeremiah]], in his Old Testament canon. However, from this canon, he omitted the book of [[Esther]].

====Eastern canons====

The eastern churches had, in general, a weaker feeling than those in the west for the necessity of making a sharp delineation with regard to the canon. It was more conscious of the gradation of spiritual quality among the books that it accepted (e.g. the classification of Eusebius, see also [[Antilegomena]]) and was less often disposed to assert that the books which it rejected possessed no spiritual quality at all. For example, the [[Quinisext Council|Trullan Synod of 691-692]], which was rejected by [[Pope Constantine]] (see also [[Pentarchy]]), endorsed the following lists of canonical writings: the [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canons]] (c. 385), the Synod of Laodicea (c. 363), the Third Synod of Carthage (c. 397), and the 39th Festal Letter of Athanasius (367). And yet, these lists do not agree. Similarly, the New Testament canons of the national churches of [[Syrian Orthodox|Syria]], [[Armenian Orthodox|Armenia]], [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgia]], Egypt ([[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|The Coptic Church]]), and [[Ethiopian Orthodoxy|Ethiopia]] all have minor differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Revelation of John]] is one of the most uncertain books; it was not translated into Georgian until the 10th century, and it has never been included in the official lectionary of the Greek Church, whether [[Byzantine Church|Byzantine]] or [[Greek Orthodox Church|modern]].

===Western Church===

====Latin Fathers====

The first council that accepted the present Catholic canon (the [[Canon of Trent]]) may have been the [[Synod of Hippo|Synod of Hippo Regius]] in North Africa (393); the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the [[Councils of Carthage]] in 397 and 419.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders' ''The Canon Debate'', Appendix D-2, note 19: &quot;[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] was added later in 419 at the subsequent synod of Carthage.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  These councils were under the authority of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who regarded the canon as already closed.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Ferguson, &quot;Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon,&quot; in ''The Canon Debate''. eds. L. M. McDonald &amp; J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002) p. 320; F. F. Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture'' (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 230; cf. Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 22.8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Damasus I]]'s [[Council of Rome]] in 382, if the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg 2006 15&quot; /&gt; or if not, the list is at least a 6th century compilation.&lt;ref&gt;F. F.

====Luther's canon====
{{Main|Luther's canon}}

[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) made an attempt to remove the books of [[Antilegomena#Reformation|Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation]] from the canon (echoing the consensus of several Catholics, also labeled [[Christian humanism|Christian Humanists]] — such as [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Ximenez]], [[Cardinal Cajetan]], and [[Erasmus]] — and partially because they were perceived to go against certain Protestant doctrines such as [[sola scriptura]] and [[sola fide]]{{Citation needed| date=October 2012}}), but this was not generally accepted among his followers. However, these books are ordered last in the [[German language|German-language]] [[Luther Bible]] to this day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bibelcenter.de/bibel/lu1545/ note order: ... Hebr�er, Jakobus, Judas, Offenbarung; see also http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Luther moved the books that later became the [[Deuterocanonicals]] into a section he called the [[Biblical Apocrypha#Luther Bible|Apocrypha]].

====Protestant canon====

Protestants accept the original texts in Hebrew and Aramaic as the inspired Hebrew Bible, rather than the [[Septuagint]] translation into Greek, though many recognize the latter's  wide use by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] in the 1st century. They note that early Christians evidenced a knowledge of a canon of Scripture, based upon internal evidence, as well as by the existence of a list of Old Testament books by [[Melito of Sardis]], compiled around 170 AD (see [[Melito's canon]]).&lt;ref&gt;While Melito did not include the Hebrew book of Esther in his canon, Protestants accept it as fully canonical. It appears in every modern version of the Old Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern Protestants point to the following four &quot;Criteria for Canonicity&quot; to justify the selection of the books that have been included in the New Testament — though these ideas aren't isolated to Protestant theology, but extend to or are derived from other Christian traditions:

# Apostolic Origin — attributed to and based upon the preaching/teaching of the first-generation apostles (or their close companions).
# Universal Acceptance — acknowledged by all major Christian communities in the ancient world (by the end of the 4th century) as well as accepted canon by Jewish authorities (for the Old Testament).
# Liturgical Use — read publicly when early Christian communities gathered for the Lord's Supper (their weekly worship services).
# Consistent Message — containing a theological outlook similar to or complementary to other accepted Christian writings.&lt;ref&gt;Just, Felix, S.J. Ph.D. 2006. &quot;The New Teatament Canon.&quot; Available online at http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/NT_Canon.htm#Canonicity &lt;3 February 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes difficult to apply these criteria to all of the books in the accepted canon, however, and one can point to writings that Protestants consider to be unscriptural, which would fulfill these requirements. In practice, most Protestants hold to the Jewish Tanakh for the Old Testament and the Roman Catholic canon for the New Testament.

===Canons of various Christian traditions===

Full dogmatic articulations of the canons were not made until the [[Council of Trent]] of 1546 for Roman Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm Canon of the New Testament]''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]]. Other traditions, while also having closed canons, may not be able to point to the exact years in which their respective canons were considered to be complete. The following tables reflect the current state of various Christian canons.

====Old Testament====
{{Main|Development of the Old Testament canon}}

All of the major Christian traditions accept the books of the [[Protocanonical books|Hebrew protocanon]] in its entirety as divinely inspired and authoritative. Furthermore, all of these traditions, with the exception of the Protestants, add to this number various [[deuterocanonical books]]. However, in some Protestant Bibles — especially the English King James Bible and the Lutheran Bible — many of these deuterocanonical books are retained as part of the tradition in a section called the &quot;[[Apocrypha]].&quot;

Some books listed here, like the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]] for the Armenian Apostolic Church, may have once been a vital part of a Biblical tradition, may even still hold a place of honor, but are no longer considered to be part of the Bible. Other books, like the [[Prayer of Manasseh]] for the Roman Catholic Church, may have been included in manuscripts, but never really attained a high level of importance within that particular tradition. The levels of traditional prominence for others, like [[Psalms 152–155]] and the [[Psalms of Solomon]] of the Syriac churches, remain unclear.

In so far as the [[Ethiopian Biblical canon|Ethiopian Orthodox canon]] is concerned, some points of clarity should be made. First, the books of [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], and Baruch, as well as the Letter of Jeremiah and [[4 Baruch]], are all considered canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. It is not always clear as to how these writings are arranged or divided in the Ethiopian canon, however. In some lists, they may simply fall under the title &quot;Jeremiah,&quot; while in others, they are divided various ways into separate books. Moreover, the book of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] is divided into two books — Messale (Prov. 1–24) and Tägsas (Prov. 25–31). Additionally, while the books of [[Jubilees]] and [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]]&lt;ref&gt;The canonical Enoch may differ in various ways from certain versions known in the west.&lt;/ref&gt; are fairly well-known among western scholars, 1, 2, and 3 [[Meqabyan]] are not. The three books of Meqabyan are often called the &quot;Ethiopian Maccabees,&quot; but are completely different in content from the [[books of Maccabees]] that are known and/or have been canonized in other traditions. Finally, the Book of Joseph ben Gurion, or [[Josippon|Pseudo-Josephus]], is a history of the Jewish people thought to be based upon the writings of [[Josephus|Josephus.]]&lt;ref&gt;Josephus's ''[[The Jewish War]]'' and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' are highly regarded by Christians because they provide valuable insight into 1st century Judaism and early Christianity. Morover, in ''Antiquities'', Josephus made two extra-Biblical references to Jesus, which have played a crucial role in establishing him as a historical figure.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopic version (1–8 Yosëf wäldä Koryon) has eight parts and is included in the [[Ethiopian Biblical canon#Ethiopian broader Biblical Canon|Ethiopian broader canon]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ethiopian broader canon in its fullest form — which includes the narrower canon in its entirety, as well as nine additional books — is not known to exist at this time as one published compilation. Some books, though considered canonical, are nonetheless difficult to locate and are not even widely available in Ethiopia. While the narrower canon has indeed been published as one compilation, there may be no real ''emic'' distinction between the broader canon and the narrower canon, especially in so far as divine inspiration and scriptural authority are concerned. The idea of two such classifications may be nothing more than [[Emic and etic|etic]] taxonomic conjecture.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. 2003. &quot;The Bible.&quot; Online at http://www.ethiopianorthodox.org/english/canonical/books.html &lt;20 January 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Testament====
{{Main|Development of the New Testament canon}}

Among the various [[Christian denominations]], the New Testament canon is a generally agreed-upon list of 27 books. However, the way in which those books are arranged may vary from tradition to tradition. For instance, in the Lutheran, Slavonic, Ethiopian, Syriac, and Armenian traditions, the New Testament is ordered differently from what is considered to be the standard arrangement. Protestant Bibles in Russia and Ethiopia usually follow the local Orthodox order for the New Testament. The Syriac Orthodox Church and the Assyrian Church of the East both adhere to the [[Peshitta]] liturgical tradition, which historically excludes five books of the New Testament [[Antilegomena]]: 2 John, 3 John, 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation. However, those books are included in certain Bibles of the modern Syriac traditions.

Other New Testament works that are generally considered apocryphal nonetheless appear in some Bibles and manuscripts. For instance, the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]]&lt;ref&gt;A translation of the Epistle to the Laodiceans can be accessed online at http://sacred-texts.com/bib/lbob/lbob12.htm &lt;25 January 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was included in numerous Latin Vulgate manuscripts, in the eighteen German Bibles prior to [[Martin Luther|Luther's]] translation, and also a number of early English Bibles, such as Gundulf's Bible and John Wycliffe's English translation — even as recently as 1728, [[William Whiston]] considered this epistle to be genuinely Pauline. Likewise, the [[Third Epistle to the Corinthians]]&lt;ref&gt;The Third Epistle to the Corinthians can be found as a section within the [[Acts of Paul]], which has survived only in fragments. A translation of the entire remaining Acts of Paul can be accessed online at http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspaul.html &lt;26 January 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was once considered to be part of the Armenian Orthodox Bible,&lt;ref&gt;Saifullah, M.S.M. 2006. &quot;Canons &amp; Recensions Of The Armenian Bible.&quot; Online at http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Bible/Text/Canon/armenianlist.html &lt;25 January 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but is no longer printed in modern editions. Within the Syriac Orthodox tradition, the Third Epistle to the Corinthians also has a history of significance. Both [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephraem of Syria]] held it in high regard and treated it as if it were canonical.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M. ''Canon of the New Testament''. pp 219, 223; cf. 7, 176, 182. Cited in McDonald &amp; Sanders, eds. 2002. ''The Canon Debate''. p 492.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was left-out of the Peshitta and ultimately excluded from the canon altogether.

The [[Didache]],&lt;ref&gt;Various translations of the Didache can be accessed online at http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/didache.html &lt;26 January 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Shepherd of Hermas]],&lt;ref&gt;A translation of the Shepherd of Hermas can be accessed online at http://sacred-texts.com/bib/lbob/lbob26.htm &lt;25 January 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and other writings attributed to the [[Apostolic Fathers]], were once considered scriptural by various early [[Church fathers]]. They are still being honored in some traditions, though they are no longer considered to be canonical. However, certain canonical books within the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition find their origin in the writings of the Apostolic Fathers as well as the [[Ancient Church Orders]]. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church recognizes these eight additional New Testament books in its broader canon. They are as follows: the four books of Sinodos, the two books of the Covenant, Ethiopic Clement, and the Ethiopic Didascalia.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, R.W. 1974. &quot;The Biblical Canon Of The Ethiopian Orthodox Church Today&quot; in Ostkirchliche Studien, Volume 23, pp. 318-323. Online at http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Bible/Text/Canon/ethiopican.html &lt;20 January 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

! style=&quot;width:123px;&quot;| Armenian Apostolic tradition&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref group=N name=Armenian&gt;The growth and development of the Armenian Biblical canon is complex. Extra-canonical New Testament books appear in historical canon lists and recensions that are either distinct to this tradition, or where they do exist elsewhere, never achieved the same status. Some of the books are not listed in this table. These include the Prayer of [[Euthalius]], the Repose of [[St. John the Evangelist]], the [[Doctrine of Addai]], a reading from the [[Gospel of James]], [[Apostolic Canons|the Second Apostolic Canons]], the Words of [[Joseph Barsabbas|Justus]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius Aeropagite]], the [[Preaching of Peter]], and a Poem by [[Ghazar Parpetsi|Ghazar]]. A possible exception here to canonical exclusivity is the Second Apostolic Canons, which share a common source — the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] — with certain parts of the Ethiopian New Testament broader canon. There is some uncertainty about whether it is actually the Doctrine of Addai, or rather a related work called the Acts of Thaddeus, that appears in Armenian canon lists. Moreover, the correspondence between King [[Agbar]] and Jesus Christ, which is found in various forms — including within both the Doctrine of Addai and the Acts of Thaddeus — sometimes appears separately (see this [http://www.looys.net/BIBCANON.DOC list]). It is noteworthy that the Prayer of Euthalius and the Repose of St. John the Evangelist appear in the appendix of the 1805 Armenian Zohrab Bible. However, some of the aforementioned books, though they are found within canon lists, have nonetheless never been discovered to be part of any Armenian Biblical manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{Main|Standard works}}

The standard works of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) consists of several books that constitute its [[continuous revelation|open]] [[sacred text|scriptural]] canon, and include the following:

* The [[King James Version of the Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church uses the King James Version (KJV) in English-speaking countries; other versions are used in non-English speaking countries.&lt;/ref&gt; — without the Apocrypha
* The [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ]]
* The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
* The [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]

The Pearl of Great Price contains five sections: &quot;Selections from the [[Book of Moses]]&quot;, &quot;The [[Book of Abraham]]&quot;, &quot;[[Joseph Smith—Matthew]]&quot;, &quot;[[Joseph Smith—History]]&quot; and &quot;The [[Articles of Faith]]&quot;. The Book of Moses and Joseph Smith—Matthew are portions of the Book of Genesis and the Book of Matthew (respectively) from the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]].

The manuscripts of the unfinished Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible (JST) state that &quot;the [[Song of Solomon]] is not inspired scripture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church, ''Bible Dictionary'' p.776, [http://lds.org/scriptures/bd/song-of-solomon?lang=eng Song of Solomon]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still printed in every version of the King James Bible published by the church.

The Standard Works are printed and distributed by the LDS church in a single binding called a &quot;Quadruple Combination&quot; or a set of two books, with [[LDS edition of the Bible|the Bible in one binding]], and the other three books in a second binding called a &quot;Triple Combination&quot;. Current editions of the Standard Works include a [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|bible dictionary]], photographs, maps and [[gazetteer]], topical guide, index, footnotes, cross references, excerpts from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and other study aids.

===Other Latter Day Saint sects===

Canons of various Latter Day Saint denominations diverge from the LDS Standard Works. For instance, the [[Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|Bickertonite]] sect does not consider the Pearl of Great Price or Doctrines and Covenants to be scriptural. Rather, they believe that the [[New Testament]] scriptures contain a true description of the church as established by Jesus Christ. Both the King James Bible and Book of Mormon are considered to be the inspired word of God, as all doctrines and faith of the church are referenced with these two books.&lt;ref name=&quot;V James Lovalvo&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lovalvo |first=V James |title=Dissertation on the Faith and Doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ |url= http://www.thechurchofjesuschrist.com/images/Hi_Res_Book.pdf |year=1986 |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ|location=Bridgewater, MI|pages= 115–16 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Community of Christ]] points to Jesus Christ as the living Word of God,&lt;ref&gt;Community of Christ Theology Task Force, ''Scripture in the Community of Christ,'' Saints Herald, August 2006, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and it affirms the Bible, along with the Book of Mormon, as well as its own version of the Doctrine and Covenants as scripture for the church. While it publishes a version of the Joseph Smith Translation — which includes material from the Book of Moses — the Community of Christ also accepts the use of other translations of the Bible, such as the standard King James Version and the [[New Revised Standard Version]].

Like the aforementioned Bickertonites, the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] rejects the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, as well as the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, preferring to use only the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon as doctrinal standards. The [[Book of Commandments]] is accepted as being superior to the Doctrine and Covenants as a compendium of Joseph Smith's early revelations, but is not accorded the same status as the Bible or Book of Mormon.

[[The Word of the Lord]] and [[The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel]] are two related books considered to be scriptural by certain (Fettingite) factions that separated from the Temple Lot church. Both books contain revelations allegedly given to former Church of Christ (Temple Lot) Apostle [[Otto Fetting]] by an angelic being who claimed to be [[John the Baptist]]. The latter title (120 messages) contains the entirety of the former's material (30 msgs.) with additional revelations (90 msgs.) purportedly given to [[W. A. Draves|William A. Draves]] by this same being, after Fetting's death. Neither are accepted by the larger Temple Lot body of believers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.ca/mor-church-of-christ-temple-lot-mormons-1830.htm A Synopsis of the Church of Christ Beliefs and Practices as Compared to Other Latter Day Saint Churches], by Apostle William Sheldon. Refers to the Bible and Book of Mormon as &quot;the only safe standards&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|Strangite sect]] consider the Bible (when correctly translated), the Book of Mormon, and editions of the Doctrine and Covenants published prior to Joseph Smith's death (which contained the [[Lectures on Faith]]) to be inspired scripture. They also hold the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible to be inspired, but do not believe modern publications of the text are accurate. Other portions of The Pearl of Great Price, however, are not considered to be scriptural — though are not necessarily fully rejected either. The [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Book of Jasher]] was consistently used by both Joseph Smith and [[James Strang]], but as with other Latter Day Saint denominations and sects, there is no official stance on its authenticity, and it is not considered canonical.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.strangite.org/Scriptures.htm Strangite Scriptures].&quot; Retrieved 3 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional work called [[The Book of the Law of the Lord]] is also accepted as inspired scripture by the Strangites. They likewise hold as scriptural several prophecies, visions, revelations, and translations printed by James Strang, and published in the ''Revelations of James J. Strang''. Among other things, this text contains his purported &quot;[[Letter of appointment|Letter of Appointment]]&quot; from Joseph Smith and his translation of the [[Voree plates]].

Many Latter Day Saint denominations have also either adopted the [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]] or at least view them as a statement of basic [[theology]]. (They are considered scriptural by the larger LDS church and are included in The Pearl of Great Price.) At times, the Articles have been adapted to fit the respective belief systems of various faith communities.
