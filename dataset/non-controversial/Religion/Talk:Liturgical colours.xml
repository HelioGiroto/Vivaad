==Untitled==
I've done some work on the Roman Catholic part: Black is no longer allowed on Good Friday (it's no longer included in the &quot;General Instruction for the Roman Missal&quot; or the &quot;Ordo&quot;). I've also added information about the use of blue and a special case in the Philippines. - [[User:Cnyborg|Cnyborg]] 22:13, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Is the difference between &quot;scarlet&quot;, &quot;crimson&quot;, and &quot;red&quot; so important?--[[User:Bhuck|Bhuck]] 21:57, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
::I remember my parish in Boston (a rather small one) used Pentecost paraments during Holy Week because they were the only &quot;reddish&quot; ones they had. My current church is larger and they have crimson for Holy Week and a separate red for Pentecost. In short, I think there is some leeway, but a deeper red is preferred for Holy Week. As for scarlet/crimson, I think that's a matter of semantics. Technically scarlet is more orangey and crimson is more purply, but they're both a deep shade of red.[[User:Rockhopper10r|Rockhopper10r]] 22:30, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

==Purple==
I suggest removing mention of [[purple]] from the ''Roman Catholic'' section of this article. The documents all mention [[violet (color)|violet]], which is technically a different color. (In Latin, ''purpureus'' is not ''violaceus''.)

: Just noting that [[Anathema]] says &quot;a purple cope (the liturgical color of penitence)&quot;.  So usage needs to be made canonical, i.e., standardized, throughout the wiki.  Also interesting is the statement of an association between color and mood (e.g., penitence) which is not included in the main page.  Are there more recognized associations of colors to aspects other than feast days than are noted in the &quot;situational exceptions&quot; section?

==Symbolism==
I'd like to see the '''Symbolism''' column removed from the table of Roman Catholic colors. There is no source for it, and I do not think that an authoritative source exists for it. The whole column is original research at best, and nonsense at worst. [[User:Rwflammang|Rwflammang]] ([[User talk:Rwflammang|talk]]) 21:06, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

==Roman Catholic Extraordinary Rite==
The Roman Catholic section would be more useful if the table was in the same format as the Anglican table, comparing the liturgical colors of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Rites.  [[User:Dgf32|Dgf32]] ([[User talk:Dgf32|talk]]) 00:58, 7 January 2008 (UTC)
:On second thought, given the differences in calendars, a table would be difficult to produce.  I've added a section on the [[Extraordinary Form]] to the [[Roman Catholic]] section.  [[User:Dgf32|Dgf32]] ([[User talk:Dgf32|talk]]) 02:07, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

==Names for Catholics==

An editor seems to want to change the section on Roman Catholics to &quot;Catholics&quot; or &quot;Latin Rite Catholics&quot;, which is incorrect.  The information given is specifically about the Roman Rite, and not about the other Latin Rites.  I understand the usual POV-spinning in which only those in communion with the pope get to be Catholic, and it's out-of-place in general on Wikipedia, but here it's especially out of place, because the section is, in fact, only about the '''Roman''' Rite.  [[User:Tb|Tb]] ([[User talk:Tb|talk]]) 12:54, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

:I second that. [[User:InfernoXV|InfernoXV]] ([[User talk:InfernoXV|talk]]) 17:16, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
 
::At the moment, there seems to be a bit of an editing war between &quot;Roman Catholic Church&quot; and &quot;Roman Rite&quot; for the name of the Roman section.  Which is the most suitable?  --[[User:Dulcimerist|Dulcimerist]] ([[User talk:Dulcimerist|talk]]) 12:48, 30 August 2012 (UTC)

== Coptic colours ==

I undid the additions i made to the Coptic Liturgical colours after realising the sources really need to be checked. [[User:The Cake 2|The Cake 2]] ([[User talk:The Cake 2|talk]]) 05:28, 30 March 2011 (UTC)</text>
