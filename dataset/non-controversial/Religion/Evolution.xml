'''Evolution''' is the change in the [[Heredity|inherited]] [[Phenotypic trait|characteristics]] of [[biology|biological]] [[population]]s over successive [[generation]]s. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every [[biological organisation|level of biological organisation]], including [[biodiversity|species]], [[organism|individual organisms]] and [[molecular evolution|molecules]] such as [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall08&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Hall | editor1-first=B.

Life on Earth [[abiogenesis|originated]] and then evolved from a [[last universal ancestor|universal common ancestor]] approximately 3.8 billion years ago. Repeated [[speciation]] and the [[anagenesis|divergence]] of life can be [[inference|inferred]] from shared sets of biochemical and morphological traits, or by shared [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]]. These [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] traits and sequences are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and can be used to [[phylogenetics|reconstruct]] [[Tree of life (biology)|evolutionary histories]], using both existing species and the [[fossil record]]. Existing patterns of [[biodiversity]] have been shaped both by [[speciation]] and by [[extinction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cracraft05&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Cracraft | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=Donoghue | editor2-first=M.

[[Charles Darwin]] was the first to formulate [[On the Origin of Species|a scientific argument]] for the [[scientific theory|theory]] of evolution by means of [[natural selection]]. Evolution by natural selection is a process that is inferred from three [[fact]]s about populations: 1) more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, 2) traits vary among individuals, leading to differential rates of survival and reproduction, and 3) trait differences are [[Heritability|heritable]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewontin70&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Lewontin |first1 = R. C. |title = The units of selection |journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |year = 1970 |volume = 1 |pages = 1–18 |jstor = 2096764 |doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.01.110170.000245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when members of a population die they are replaced by the [[offspring|progeny]] of parents that were better [[adaptation|adapted]] to survive and reproduce in the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which natural selection took place. This process creates and preserves traits that are [[teleonomy|seemingly fitted]] for the [[function (biology)|functional]] roles they perform.&lt;ref name=&quot;On The Origin of Species&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Darwin |first1 = Charles |title = On The Origin of Species |chapter = XIV |year = 1859 |page = 503 |url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species_(1859)/Chapter_XIV |isbn = 0-8014-1319-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection is the only known cause of [[adaptation]], but not the only known cause of evolution. Other, nonadaptive causes of [[microevolution|evolution]] include [[mutation]] and [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimura M 1991 367–86&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author = Kimura M |title = The neutral theory of molecular evolution: a review of recent evidence |url = http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjg/66/4/66_367/_article |journal = Jpn.

In the early 20th century, [[Classical genetics|genetics]] was [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|integrated]] with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of [[population genetics]]. The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of [[biology]]. Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as [[orthogenesis]] and [[Largest-scale trends in evolution|&quot;progress&quot;]] became [[Obsolete scientific theory|obsolete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Provine |first = W. B. |year = 1988 |title = Evolutionary progress |chapter = Progress in evolution and meaning in life |pages = 49–79 |publisher = University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists continue to [[current research in evolutionary biology|study various aspects of evolution]] by forming and testing hypotheses, constructing [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|scientific theories]], using [[observational study|observational data]], and performing [[experiments]] in both the [[habitat|field]] and the laboratory. Biologists [[Scientific consensus|agree]] that descent with modification is one of the most reliably established [[evolution as fact and theory|facts]] in science.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAS&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine |title = Science, Evolution, and Creationism |publisher = National Academy Press |year = 2008|isbn=0-309-10586-2 |url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (e.g., [[biological anthropology|anthropology]] and [[evolutionary psychology|psychology]]) and on society at large.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore09&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Moore |first1 = R. |last2 = Decker |first2 = M. |last3 = Cotner |first3 = S. |title = Chronology of the Evolution-Creationism Controversy |publisher = Greenwood |year = 2009 |page = 454 |isbn = 0-313-36287-4 |url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=4KwJRNgscdEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Chronology+of+the+Evolution-Creationism+Controversy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Futuyma99&quot;&gt;{{cite web | editor1-last=Futuyma | editor1-first=Douglas J. |title = Evolution, Science, and Society: Evolutionary Biology and the National Research Agenda |publisher = Office of University Publications, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey |year = 1999 |url = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~ecolevol/fulldoc.pdf }} {{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of evolutionary thought ==

{{Further|History of evolutionary thought}}
The proposal that one type of animal could descend from an animal of another type goes back to some of the first [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers, such as [[Anaximander#Origin of humankind|Anaximander]] and [[Empedocles#Cosmogony|Empedocles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Kirk |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Raven |first2 = John |last3 = Schofield |first3 = John |title = The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts |edition=3rd |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |location = Chicago |year = 1984a |isbn = 0-521-27455-9 |pages=100–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Kirk |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Raven |first2 = John |last3 = Schofield |first3 = John |title = The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts |edition=3rd |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |location = Chicago |year = 1984b |isbn = 0-521-27455-9 |pages=280–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to these [[Materialism|materialistic]] views, Aristotle understood all natural things, not only [[life|living]] things, as being imperfect [[actuality|actualisations]] of different fixed natural possibilities, known as &quot;[[Theory of forms|forms]]&quot;, &quot;[[idealism|ideas]]&quot;, or (in Latin translations) &quot;species&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torrey37&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torrey | first1 = Harry Beal | last2 = Felin | first2 = Frances | title = Was Aristotle an evolutionist? | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | year = 1937 | month = March | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | jstor = 2808399 | doi = 10.1086/394520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull67&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hull | first1=D.

The Roman [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] [[Lucretius|Titus Lucretius Carus]] proposed the possibility of evolutionary changes of organisms.&lt;ref name=Carus2011&gt;Carus TL (2011) ''De Rerum Natura''. New York, NY: Nabu Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the [[Middle Ages]], and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of animals corresponded one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms, and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century the new [[scientific method|method]] of [[modern science]] rejected Aristotle's approach, and sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of [[laws of nature]] which were the same for all visible things, and did not need to assume any fixed natural categories, nor any divine cosmic order. But this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, which became the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. [[John Ray]] used one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, &quot;species&quot;, to apply to animal and plant types, but unlike Aristotle he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species, and proposed that each species can be defined by the features that perpetuate themselves each generation.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr ''Growth of biological thought'' p256; original was Ray, ''History of Plants''. 1686, trans E. Silk.&lt;/ref&gt; These species were designed by God, but showing differences caused by local conditions. The biological classification introduced by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html|title=Carl Linnaeus - berkeley.edu|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other naturalists of this time speculated on evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws. [[Maupertuis]] wrote in 1751 of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. 2003. ''Evolution: the history of an idea''. Berkeley, CA. p73–75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and [[Erasmus Darwin]] proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single micro-organism (or &quot;filament&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html|title=Erasmus Darwin - berkeley.edu|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was [[Lamarck]]'s &quot;transmutation&quot; theory of 1809&lt;ref name=Lamarck1809&gt;Lamarck (1809) Philosophie Zoologique&lt;/ref&gt; which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by use or disuse in parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Margulis91&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould02&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Gould | first = S.J. | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title = [[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] | publisher = Belknap Press ([[Harvard University Press]]) | location = Cambridge | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-674-00613-3 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The latter process was later called Lamarckism.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Margulis91&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Margulis | first1 = Lynn | last2 = Fester | first2 = René | title = Symbiosis as a source of evolutionary innovation: Speciation and morphogenesis | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 1991 | page = 470 | isbn = 0-262-13269-9 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=3sKzeiHUIUQC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Lynn+Margulis%22+lamarck#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor%3A%22Lynn%20Margulis%22%20lamarck&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ImaginaryLamarck&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Ghiselin |first = Michael T. |authorlink = Michael Ghiselin|publication-date = September/October 1994 |contribution = Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck'|contribution-url =http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |title = The Textbook Letter |publisher = The Textbook League |url = http://www.textbookleague.org/ |accessdate = January 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Magner |first = Lois N. |title = A History of the Life Sciences |edition = Third |publisher = [[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-203-91100-6 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jablonka07&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Jablonka |first1 = E. |last2 = Lamb |first2 = M.

In particular [[Georges Cuvier]] insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by [[William Paley]] into a [[natural theology]] which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design, and was admired by Charles Darwin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darwin91&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Burkhardt | editor1-first=F. | editor2-last=Smith | editor2-first=S. |year = 1991 |title = The correspondence of Charles Darwin |volume = 7 |pages = 1858–1859 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |place = Cambridge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulloway09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Sulloway |first1 = F.

The critical break from the concept of fixed species in biology began with the theory of evolution by natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin. Partly influenced by ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a &quot;struggle for existence&quot; where favorable variations could prevail as others perished. Each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of animals and plants from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws working the same for all types of thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sober09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Sober |first1 = E. |year = 2009 |title = Did Darwin write the origin backwards? |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume = 106 |issue = S1 |pages = 10048–10055 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0901109106 |url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/suppl.1/10048.full.pdf+html |bibcode = 2009PNAS..10610048S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (2001) ''What evolution is''.

Both men presented their [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|separate papers]] to the [[Linnean Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Darwin | first1 = Charles | last2 = Wallace | first2 = Alfred | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F350&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 | title = On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection | journal = Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using [[paleontology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] to provide strong evidence that humans and [[apes]] shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277746/T-H-Huxley |title = Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher = Britannica.com |date =  |accessdate = January 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of [[pangenesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Liu |first1 = Y. S. |last2 = Zhou |first2 = X.

Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.&lt;ref name=Weiling&gt;{{cite journal |author = Weiling F |title = Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822–1884 |journal = Am.

[[Hugo de Vries]] connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Wiesman's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the [[cell nucleus]] and when expressed they could move into the [[cytoplasm]] to change the cells structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright84&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wright |first1 = S. |title = Evolution and the Genetics of Populations, Volume 1: Genetic and Biometric Foundations |page = 480 |publisher = University of Chicago Press |isbn = 0-226-91038-5 |url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=4pTdTWi83ecC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sewall+wright+volume+1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date = 1984-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how new variants originate, De Vries developed a [[mutation]] theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Will Provine]] |title = The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics |year = 1971 |isbn = 0-226-68464-4 |publisher = University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stamhuis, Meijer and Zevenhuizen.

In the 1920s and 1930s a [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] connected natural selection, mutation theory, and Mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis was able to explain patterns observed across species in populations, through [[transitional fossils|fossil transitions]] in palaeontology, and even complex cellular mechanisms in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bowler |first = Peter J. |authorlink = Peter J.

[[File:ADN static.png|thumb|upright|[[DNA]] structure. [[nucleobase|Bases]] are in the centre, surrounded by phosphate–sugar chains in a [[double helix]].]]
Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable [[trait (biology)|traits]]&amp;nbsp;– particular characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[eye colour]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the &quot;brown-eye trait&quot; from one of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title = Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal = Trends Genet. |volume = 20 |issue = 8 |pages = 327–32 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15262401 |doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by [[gene]]s and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006&gt;{{cite journal |author = Pearson H |title = Genetics: what is a gene? |journal = Nature |volume = 441 |issue = 7092 |pages = 398–401 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16724031 |doi = 10.1038/441398a |ref = harv |bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its [[phenotype]]. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title = Heritability in the genomics era—concepts and misconceptions |journal = Nat.

For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title = The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal = Molecular medicine today |volume = 2 |issue = 8 |pages = 330–5 |year = 1996 |pmid = 8796918 |doi = 10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via [[DNA]], a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006/&gt; DNA is a long [[polymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called [[gene]]s; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within [[cell (biology)|cells]], the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called [[allele]]s. DNA sequences can change through [[mutation]]s, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last = Futuyma |first = Douglas J. |authorlink = Douglas J. Futuyma |year = 2005 |title = Evolution |publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc |location = Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn = 0-87893-187-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|multiple interacting genes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Phillips PC |title = Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal = Nat.

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA.

For example, ecological inheritance through the process of [[niche construction]] is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laland06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Perspective: Seven reasons (not) to neglect niche construction |last1 = Laland |first1 = K.

== Variation ==

{{Further|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's [[phenotype]] results from both its [[genotype]] and the influence from the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] it has lived in. A substantial part of the variation in phenotypes in a population is caused by the differences between their genotypes.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; The [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]&amp;nbsp;— when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;{{cite journal |author = Harwood AJ |title = Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal = Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume = 353 |issue = 1366 |pages = 177–86 |year = 1998 |pmid = 9533122 |pmc = 1692205 |doi = 10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |last2 = Harwood |first2 = J |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of [[Mendelian genetics]], one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The ''[[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]'' provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with [[Mendelian inheritance]]. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewens W.J. 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = Ewens W.J. |year = 2004 |title = Mathematical Population Genetics (2nd Edition) |publisher = Springer-Verlag, New York |isbn = 0-387-20191-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation comes from [[mutation]]s in [[genetic material]], reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]] and migration between populations ([[gene flow]]). Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the [[genome]] of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Butlin RK, Tregenza T |title = Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal = Philos.

=== Mutation ===

{{Further|Mutation}}
[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|100px|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]].]]
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they can either have no effect, alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning. Based on studies in the fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Sawyer SA, Parsch J, Zhang Z, Hartl DL |title = Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in Drosophila |journal = Proc.

Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming [[gene duplication|duplicated]] (usually by [[genetic recombination]]), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nrg2593 |pmid = 19597530 |volume = 10 |issue = 8 |pages = 551–564 |last = Hastings |first = P J |title = Mechanisms of change in gene copy number |journal = Nature Reviews.

Weatherbee. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because most new genes evolve within [[gene family|gene families]] from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Harrison P, Gerstein M |title = Studying genomes through the aeons: protein families, pseudogenes and proteome evolution |journal = J Mol Biol |volume = 318 |issue = 5 |pages = 1155–74 |year = 2002 |pmid = 12083509 |doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00109-2 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for [[Cone cell|colour vision]] and one for [[Rod cell|night vision]]; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bowmaker JK |title = Evolution of colour vision in vertebrates |journal = Eye (London, England) |volume = 12 |issue = Pt 3b |pages = 541–7 |year = 1998 |pmid = 9775215 |ref = harv |doi = 10.1038/eye.1998.143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1101/gr.9.4.317 |author = Gregory TR, Hebert PD |title = The modulation of DNA content: proximate causes and ultimate consequences |url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/9/4/317.full |journal = Genome Res. |volume = 9 |issue = 4 |pages = 317–24 |year = 1999 |pmid = 10207154 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Hurles M |title = Gene duplication: the genomic trade in spare parts |journal = PLoS Biol. |volume = 2 |issue = 7 |pages = E206 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15252449 |pmc = 449868 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The evolution and functional diversification of animal microRNA genes |author = Liu N, Okamura K, Tyler DM |journal = Cell Res. |year = 2008 |volume = 18 |pages = 985–96 |doi = 10.1038/cr.2008.278 |url = http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v18/n10/full/cr2008278a.html |pmid = 18711447 |issue = 10 |pmc = 2712117 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Siepel A |title = Darwinian alchemy: Human genes from noncoding DNA |journal = Genome Res. |volume = 19 |issue = 10 |pages = 1693–5 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19797681 |doi = 10.1101/gr.098376.109 |url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1693.full |pmc = 2765273 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex and recombination ===

{{Further|Sexual reproduction|Genetic recombination|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}

In asexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the offspring of [[sex]]ual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through [[independent assortment]]. In a related process called [[homologous recombination]], sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Radding C |title = Homologous pairing and strand exchange in genetic recombination |journal = Annu.

=== Gene flow ===

{{Further|Gene flow}}

[[Gene flow]] is the exchange of genes between populations and between species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author = Morjan C, Rieseberg L |title = How species evolve collectively: implications of gene flow and selection for the spread of advantageous alleles |journal = Mol.

[[Gene flow]] can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of [[pollen]] between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.

Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. [[Horizontal gene transfer]] is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Boucher Y, Douady CJ, Papke RT, Walsh DA, Boudreau ME, Nesbo CL, Case RJ, Doolittle WF |title = Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups |doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247 |journal = Annu Rev Genet |volume = 37 |issue = 1 |pages = 283–328 |year = 2003 |pmid = 14616063 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, this contributes to the spread of [[antibiotic resistance]], as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species.&lt;ref name=GeneticEvolution&gt;{{cite journal |author = Walsh T |title = Combinatorial genetic evolution of multiresistance |journal = Curr.

== Mechanisms ==

[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|300px|[[Mutation]] followed by [[natural selection]], results in a population with darker colouration.]]
From a [[Neo-Darwinian]] perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewens W.J. 2004&quot; /&gt; For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include [[natural selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[genetic hitchhiking]], [[mutation]] and [[gene flow]].

=== Natural selection ===

{{Further|Natural selection|Fitness (biology)}}
Evolution by means of [[natural selection]] is the process by which genetic mutations that enhance reproduction become and remain, more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a &quot;self-evident&quot; mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:
* Heritable variation exists within populations of organisms.
* Organisms produce more progeny than can survive.
* These offspring vary in their ability to survive and reproduce.

These conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors pass these advantageous traits on, while traits that do not confer an advantage are not passed on to the next generation.&lt;ref name=Hurst&gt;{{cite journal |author = Hurst LD |title = Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |journal = Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume = 10 |issue = 2 |pages = 83–93 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19119264 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2506 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism.&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite journal |author = Orr HA |title = Fitness and its role in evolutionary genetics |journal = Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume = 10 |issue = 8 |pages = 531–9 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19546856 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2603 |pmc = 2753274 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation.&lt;ref name=Orr/&gt; However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal |author = Haldane J |title = The theory of natural selection today |journal = Nature |volume = 183 |issue = 4663 |pages = 710–3 |year = 1959 |pmid = 13644170 |doi = 10.1038/183710a0 |ref = harv |bibcode = 1959Natur.183..710H }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.&lt;ref name=Orr/&gt;

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be &quot;selected ''for''&quot;. Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer&amp;nbsp;— they are &quot;selected ''against''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lande&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lande R, Arnold SJ |year = 1983 |title = The measurement of selection on correlated characters |journal = Evolution |volume = 37 |pages = 1210–26 |doi = 10.2307/2408842 |issue = 6 |ref = harv |jstor = 2408842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Futuyma&quot; /&gt; However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see [[Dollo's law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x |pmid = 18764918 |volume = 62 |issue = 11 |pages = 2727–2741 |last = Goldberg |first = Emma E |title = On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution |journal = Evolution |year = 2008 |last2 = Igić |first2 = B |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 |pmid = 18814933 |volume = 23 |issue = 11 |pages = 602–609 |last = Collin |first = Rachel |title = Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law |journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |year = 2008 |last2 = Miglietta |first2 = MP |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selection Types Chart.png|thumb|left|A chart showing three types of selection.
1. [[Disruptive selection]]
2. [[Stabilizing selection]]
3. [[Directional selection]]]]

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time&amp;nbsp;— for example, organisms slowly getting taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Hoekstra H, Hoekstra J, Berrigan D, Vignieri S, Hoang A, Hill C, Beerli P, Kingsolver J |title = Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume = 98 |issue = 16 |pages = 9157–60 |year = 2001 |pmid = 11470913 |pmc = 55389 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.161281098 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.9157H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, [[disruptive selection]] is selection for extreme trait values and often results in [[bimodal distribution|two different values]] becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilizing selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.&lt;ref name=Hurst/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Felsenstein |title = Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal = Genetics |volume = 93 |issue = 3 |pages = 773–95 |date = November 1, 1979 |pmid = 17248980 |pmc = 1214112 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.

A special case of natural selection is [[sexual selection]], which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Andersson M, Simmons L |title = Sexual selection and mate choice |journal = Trends Ecol. Evol. (Amst.) |volume = 21 |issue = 6 |pages = 296–302 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16769428 |doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.015 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent in males of some animal species, despite traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls or bright colours that attract predators, decreasing the survival of individual males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Kokko H, Brooks R, McNamara J, Houston A |title = The sexual selection continuum |pmc = 1691039 |journal = Proc. Biol.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. &quot;Nature&quot; in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[abiotic|physical]] as well as [[biotic component|biological]], in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as: &quot;Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity and material cycles (ie: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odum1971&quot;&gt;Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]] and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

Natural selection can act at [[unit of selection|different levels of organisation]], such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Okasha07&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Okasha |first1 = S. |year = 2007 |title = Evolution and the Levels of Selection |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 0-19-926797-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite journal |author = Gould SJ |title = Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |journal = Philos.

=== Biased mutation ===

In addition to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lynch, M. |year = 2007 |title = The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity |journal = PNAS |volume = 104 |pages = 8597–8604 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0702207104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.8597L |pmid = 17494740 |pmc = 1876435 |issue = suppl. 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Deterministic Mutation Rate Variation in the Human Genome |journal = Genome Research |author = Smith N.G.C., Webster M.T., Ellegren, H. |year = 2002 |volume = 12 |pages = 1350–1356 |doi = 10.1101/gr.220502 |url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/9/1350.abstract |issue = 9 |pmid = 12213772 |pmc = 186654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Petrov DA, Sangster TA, Johnston JS, Hartl DL, Shaw KL |year = 2000 |title = Evidence for DNA loss as a determinant of genome size |journal = Science |volume = 287 |pages = 1060–1062 |doi = 10.1126/science.287.5455.1060 |issue = 5455 |bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1060P |pmid = 10669421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Petrov DA |year = 2002 |title = DNA loss and evolution of genome size in Drosophila |journal = Genetica |volume = 115 |pages = 81–91 |doi = 10.1023/A:1016076215168 |issue = 1 |pmid = 12188050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Kiontke K, Barriere A , Kolotuev I, Podbilewicz B , Sommer R, Fitch DHA , Felix MA |year = 2007 |title = Trends, stasis, and drift in the evolution of nematode vulva development |journal = Current Biology |volume = 17 |pages = 1925–1937 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.061 |issue = 22 |pmid = 18024125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Braendle C, Baer CF, Felix MA |year = 2010 |title = Bias and Evolution of the Mutationally Accessible Phenotypic Space in a Developmental System |journal = PLoS Genetics |volume = 6 | id = e1000877 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000877 |issue = 3 |editor1-last = Barsh |editor1-first = Gregory S |pages = e1000877 |pmid = 20300655 |pmc = 2837400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the [[Baldwin effect|phenotype-first theory of evolution]], mutations can eventually cause the [[genetic assimilation]] of traits that were previously [[phenotypic plasticity|induced by the environment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Palmer |first = RA |title = Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development |journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |year = 2004 |pages = 828–833 |volume = 306 |doi = 10.1126/science.1103707 |pmid = 15514148 |issue = 5697 |bibcode = 2004Sci...306..828P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;West-Eberhard 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = West-Eberhard |first = M-J. |year = 2003 |title = Developmental plasticity and evolution |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-19-512235-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic drift is the change in [[allele frequency]] from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles are subject to [[sampling error]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Masel 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |volume = 21 |pages = R837–R838 |author = Masel J |title = Genetic drift |journal = Current Biology |year = 2011 |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.007 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008827 |issue = 20 |pmid = 22032182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to &quot;drift&quot; upward or downward randomly (in a [[random walk]]). This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixed]], either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lande R |title = Fisherian and Wrightian theories of speciation |journal = Genome |volume = 31 |issue = 1 |pages = 221–7 |year = 1989 |pmid = 2687093 |ref = harv |doi = 10.1139/g89-037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic hitchhiking ===

{{Further|Genetic hitchhiking|Hill-Robertson effect|Selective sweep|Genetic drift}}

Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lien S, Szyda J, Schechinger B, Rappold G, Arnheim N |title = Evidence for heterogeneity in recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region: high resolution analysis by sperm typing and radiation-hybrid mapping |journal = Am.

Genet. |volume = 66 |issue = 2 |pages = 557–66 |year = 2000 |pmid = 10677316 |pmc = 1288109 |doi = 10.1086/302754 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to [[independence (probability theory)|expectations]], which is called their [[linkage disequilibrium]]. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a [[haplotype]]. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a [[selective sweep]] that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called [[genetic hitchhiking]] or genetic draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rstb.2000.0716 |pmid = 11127900 |volume = 355 |issue = 1403 |pages = 1553–1562 |last = Barton |first = N H |title = Genetic hitchhiking |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |year = 2000 |pmc = 1692896 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.&lt;ref name=&quot;gillespie 2001&quot; /&gt;

=== Gene flow ===

{{Further|Gene flow|Hybrid (biology)|Horizontal gene transfer}}
[[Gene flow]] is the exchange of genes between populations and between species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56&quot; /&gt; The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.

If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organism within these populations to evolve mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the biological species concept (BSC).

During the development of the modern synthesis, [[Sewall Wright]]'s developed his [[shifting balance theory]] that gene flow between partially isolated populations was an important aspect of adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Wright |first1 = Sewall |year = 1932 |title = The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution |url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |journal = Proc. 6th Int. Cong. Genet |volume = 1 |issue =  |pages = 356–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the [[shifting balance theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coyne 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coyne | first1 = Jerry A. | coauthors = Barton, Turelli | title = Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution | journal = Evolution | year = 1997 | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | series = 3 | pages = 643–671 | doi = 10.2307/2411143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==

Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical [[adaptation]]s that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|co-operating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are sometimes divided into [[macroevolution]], which is evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, such as [[extinction]] and [[speciation]] and [[microevolution]], which is smaller evolutionary changes, such as adaptations, within a species or population.&lt;ref name=ScottEC&gt;{{cite journal |author = Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title = Biological design in science classrooms |volume = 104 |journal = Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels&amp;nbsp;– with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657–658}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Gould SJ |title = Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal = Proc.

Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their [[habitat]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst 1982. ''The growth of biological thought''. Harvard. p483: &quot;Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' defines ''adaptation'' as &quot;Any change in the structure or functioning of an organism that makes it better suited to its environment&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term adaptation may refer to a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of horses' teeth to the grinding of grass. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Orr H |title = The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history |journal = Nat. Rev.

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single [[homology (biology)|ancestral structure]] being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within [[bat]] wings, for example, are very similar to those in [[mouse|mice]] feet and [[primate]] hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1554/05-233.1 |pmid = 16526515 |volume = 59 |issue = 12 |pages = 2691–704 |last = Young |first = Nathan M. |title = Serial homology and the evolution of mammalian limb covariation structure |journal = Evolution |accessdate = September 24, 2009 |year = 2005 |url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1554/05-233.1 |last2 = Hallgrímsson |first2 = B |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since all living organisms are related to some extent,&lt;ref name=Penny1999/&gt; even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as [[arthropod]], squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called [[deep homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1017/S1464793102006097 |pmid = 14558591 |volume = 78 |issue = 3 |pages = 409–433 |last = Hall |first = Brian K |title = Descent with modification: the unity underlying homology and homoplasy as seen through an analysis of development and evolution |journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |year = 2003 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature07891 |pmid = 19212399 |volume = 457 |issue = 7231 |pages = 818–823 |last = Shubin |first = Neil |title = Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty |journal = Nature |year = 2009 |last2 = Tabin |first2 = C |last3 = Carroll |first3 = S |ref = harv |bibcode = 2009Natur.457..818S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact [[exaptation]]s: structures originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=1235–1236}} One example is the African lizard ''Holaspis guentheri'', which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives.

{{Further|Co-evolution}}
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and co-operation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a [[Predation|predator]] and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called [[co-evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Wade MJ |title = The co-evolutionary genetics of ecological communities |journal = Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume = 8 |issue = 3 |pages = 185–95 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17279094 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2031 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the production of [[tetrodotoxin]] in the [[rough-skinned newt]] and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the [[Common Garter Snake|common garter snake]].

=== Co-operation ===

{{Further|Co-operation (evolution)}}
Not all co-evolved interactions between species involve conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Sachs J |title = Cooperation within and among species |journal = J. Evol.

For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]] that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Paszkowski U |title = Mutualism and parasitism: the yin and yang of plant symbioses |journal = Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. |volume = 9 |issue = 4 |pages = 364–70 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16713732 |doi = 10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.008 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocal]] relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending [[signal transduction|signals]] that suppress the plant [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Hause B, Fester T |title = Molecular and cell biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis |journal = Planta |volume = 221 |issue = 2 |pages = 184–96 |year = 2005 |pmid = 15871030 |doi = 10.1007/s00425-004-1436-x |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in [[Eusociality|social insects]], such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the [[somatic cell]]s that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's [[germ cell]]s to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bertram J |title = The molecular biology of cancer |journal = Mol. Aspects Med. |volume = 21 |issue = 6 |pages = 167–223 |year = 2000 |pmid = 11173079 |doi = 10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of [[kin selection]], which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Reeve HK, Hölldobler B |title = The emergence of a superorganism through intergroup competition |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0703466104 |journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |volume = 104 |issue = 23 |pages = 9736–40 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17517608 |pmc = 1887545 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.9736R }}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity is selected for because if the ''helping'' individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will ''also'' contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Axelrod R, Hamilton W |title = The evolution of cooperation |journal = Science |volume = 211 |issue = 4489 |pages = 1390–6 |year = 2005 |pmid = 7466396 |doi = 10.1126/science.7466396 |ref = harv |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other processes that may promote cooperation include [[group selection]], where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Wilson EO, Hölldobler B |title = Eusociality: origin and consequences |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0505858102 |journal = Proc.

=== Speciation ===

{{Further|Speciation}}
[[File:Speciation modes edit.svg|left|thumb|350px|The four mechanisms of speciation.]]
[[Speciation]] is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.&lt;ref name=Gavrilets&gt;{{cite journal |author = Gavrilets S |title = Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal = Evolution |volume = 57 |issue = 10 |pages = 2197–215 |year = 2003 |pmid = 14628909 |doi = 10.1554/02-727 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways to define the concept of &quot;species&quot;. The choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned.&lt;ref name=Queiroz&gt;{{cite journal |author = de Queiroz K |title = Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species |journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume = 102 |issue = Suppl 1 |pages = 6600–7 |year = 2005 |pmid = 15851674 |pmc = 1131873 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0502030102 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6600D }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ereshsefsky92&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1086/289701 |last = Ereshefsky |first = M. |title = Eliminative pluralism |journal = Philosophy of Science |volume = 59 |issue = 4 |pages = 671–690 |year = 1992 |jstor = 188136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological species concept (BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach. Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that &quot;species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayr42&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = Mayr, E. |title = Systematics and the Origin of Species |year = 1942 |publisher = Columbia Univ. Press |place = New York |isbn = 978-0-231-05449-2 | page = 120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Fraser C, Alm EJ, Polz MF, Spratt BG, Hanage WP |title = The bacterial species challenge: making sense of genetic and ecological diversity |journal = Science |volume = 323 |issue = 5915 |pages = 741–6 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19197054 |doi = 10.1126/science.1159388 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2009Sci...323..741F }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is called the [[species problem]].&lt;ref name=Queiroz /&gt; Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be a different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.&lt;ref name=Queiroz /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ereshsefsky92&quot; /&gt; &quot;

[[reproductive isolation|Barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to [[speciation|become new species]]. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their [[most recent common ancestor]], it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s mating to produce [[mule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Short RV |title = The contribution of the mule to scientific thought |journal = J.

In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct.

There are four mechanisms for speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year = 2008 |title = Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume = 105 |issue = 12 |pages = 4792–5 |pmid = 18344323 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711998105 |author = Herrel, A.; Huyghe, K.; Vanhooydonck, B.; Backeljau, T.; Breugelmans, K.; Grbac, I.; Van Damme, R.; Irschick, D.J. |pmc = 2290806 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.4792H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Losos1997&gt;{{cite journal |year = 1997 |title = Adaptive differentiation following experimental island colonization in Anolis lizards |journal = Nature |volume = 387 |issue = 6628 |pages = 70–3 |doi = 10.1038/387070a0 |author = Losos, J.B. Warhelt, K.I. Schoener, T.W. |ref = harv |bibcode = 1997Natur.387...70L }}&lt;/ref&gt; As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Hoskin CJ, Higgle M, McDonald KR, Moritz C |year = 2005 |title = Reinforcement drives rapid allopatric speciation |journal = Nature |pmid = 16251964 |volume = 437 |issue = 7063 |pages = 1353–356 |doi = 10.1038/nature04004 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1353H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second mechanism of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation after an increase in [[inbreeding]] increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Templeton AR |title = The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal = Genetics |volume = 94 |issue = 4 |pages = 1011–38 |date = April 1, 1980 |pmid = 6777243 |pmc = 1214177 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third mechanism of speciation is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.&lt;ref name=Gavrilets/&gt; Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Antonovics J |title = Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |journal = Heredity |volume = 97 |issue = 1 |pages = 33–7 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16639420 |url = http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause ''reinforcement'', which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Nosil P, Crespi B, Gries R, Gries G |title = Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal = Genetica |volume = 129 |issue = 3 |pages = 309–27 |year = 2007 |pmid = 16900317 |doi = 10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|frame|[[Geographical isolation]] of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] on the [[Galápagos Islands]] produced over a dozen new species.]]

One type of sympatric speciation involves cross-breeding of two related species to produce a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form [[polyploidy|polyploids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Wood TE, Takebayashi N, Barker MS, Mayrose I, Greenspoon PB, Rieseberg LH |title = The frequency of polyploid speciation in vascular plants |journal = Proc.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short &quot;bursts&quot; of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.&lt;ref name=pe1972&gt;Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould, 1972.

Press. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Gould SJ |title = Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6764 |journal = Proc.

Soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the [[Cambrian explosion]].

== Applications ==
{{Main|Applications of evolution|Artificial selection|Evolutionary computation}}
Concepts and models used in evolutionary biology, such as natural selection, have many applications.&lt;ref name=Bull&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bull JJ, Wichman HA |title = Applied evolution |journal = Annu Rev Ecol Syst |volume = 32 |issue = 1 |pages = 183–217 |year = 2001 |doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114020 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms. This has been used for thousands of years in the [[domestication]] of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Doebley JF, Gaut BS, Smith BD |title = The molecular genetics of crop domestication |journal = Cell |volume = 127 |issue = 7 |pages = 1309–21 |year = 2006 |pmid = 17190597 |doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.006 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, such selection has become a vital part of [[genetic engineering]], with [[selectable marker]]s such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. In repeated rounds of mutation and selection proteins with valuable properties have evolved, for example modified [[enzyme]]s and new [[antibody|antibodies]], in a process called [[directed evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Jäckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D |title = Protein design by directed evolution |journal = Annu Rev Biophys |volume = 37 |issue = 1 |pages = 153–73 |year = 2008 |pmid = 18573077 |doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the changes that have occurred during organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human [[genetic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Maher B. |title = Evolution: Biology's next top model? |journal = Nature |volume = 458 |issue = 7239 |pages = 695–8 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1038/458695a |pmid = 19360058 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[mexican tetra]] is an [[albino]] cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution.

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century. The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced about a generation later and legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v.

Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] form as [[intelligent design]], to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v.
