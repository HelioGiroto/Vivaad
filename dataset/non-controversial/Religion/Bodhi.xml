{{See also|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}
'''''Bodhi''''' (Sanskrit: [[wikt:बोधि#Sanskrit|बोधि]]; and [[Pali]]) in Buddhism is the understanding possessed by a Buddha regarding [[dharma|the nature of things]]. It is traditionally translated into English with the word [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] and literally means awakened. Bodhi is knowledge into [[Dependent origination|the causal mechanism]] by which beings [[incarnation|incarnate]] into material form and experience [[dukkha|suffering]]. Although its most common usage is in the context of [[Buddhism]], bodhi is [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|also present]] as a concept in other Indian philosophies and traditions.

==Etymology==
''Bodhi'' is an abstract noun formed from the verbal root ''budh'' (to awake, become aware, notice, know or understand) corresponding to the verbs ''bujjhati'' (Pāli) and ''bodhati'' or ''budhyate'' (Sanskrit). Also from the same root are the Sanskrit words ''bodha'' (also meaning knowledge or intelligence) and ''[[buddhi]]'' which is the exact equivalent to the Greek word ''[[nous]]''.

==Soteriological meaning==
The soteriological goal of Indian religions is liberation or ''[[moksha]]'' (also called ''mukti''). Liberation is simultaneously freedom from [[Dukkha|suffering]] and the endless round of [[Samsara|existences]]. Within the [[Sramana|Sramanic]] traditions one who has attained liberation is called an ''[[arhat]]'' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''arahant''), an honorific term meaning 'worthy' acknowledging the skill and effort required to overcome the obstacles to the goal of ''[[nirvana]]''. 

According to the Buddha the path to liberation is one of progressively coming out of delusion (Pali: ''Moha''). This path is therefore regarded as a path of awakening. Progressing along the path towards [[Nirvana]] one gains insight into the true nature of [[Dharma|things]]. A Buddha is one who has attained [[Nirvana|liberation]] and an understanding of the causal mechanism by means of which sentient beings come into existence. This mechanism is called ''pratitya samutpada'' or [[dependent origination]]. The knowledge or understanding of this is called ''bodhi''.

==Buddha's awakening==
In the [[suttapitaka]], the Buddhist canon as preserved in the [[Theravada|Theravada-tradition]], a number of texts can be found in which the Buddha tells about his own awakening.{{sfn|Wardner|2000|p=45-50}}{{sfn|Faure|1991}}

In the ''Vanapattha Sutta'' (Majjhima, chapter 17){{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1995}} the Buddha describes life in the jungle, and the attainment of awakening. After destroying the [[Sankhara|disturbances of the mind]], and the [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|concentration of the mind]], he attained three knowledges (vidhya):{{sfn|Wardner|2000|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=27}}
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]
# Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]]

Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]] is here called awakening.{{sfn|Wardner|2000|p=47-48}} The monk (''[[bhikkhu]]'') has {{quote|...attained the unattained supreme security from bondage&quot;{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1996|p=199}}}}

Awakening is also described as synonymous with [[Nirvana]], the extinction of the passions whereby suffering is ended and no more rebirths take place.{{sfn|Wardner|2000p=49}} The insight arises that this liberation is certain: 

{{quote|Knowledge arose in me, and insight: my freedom is certain, this is my last birth, now there is no rebirth&quot;.{{sfn|Wardner|2000|p=49}}}}

So awakening is insight into karma and rebirth, insight into the Four Noble Truths, the extinction of the passions whereby Nirvana is reached, ànd the certainty thàt liberation has been reached.{{sfn|Wardner|2000|p=49}}

==The Buddhist Path==
{{Main|Buddhist Paths to liberation}}

The Buddhist tradition gives a wide variety of descriptions of the Buddhist Path (''magga'') to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]].{{sfn|Buswell|1994|p=1-36}} Tradition describes the Buddha's awakening,{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=21-25}} and the descriptions of the path given in the [[Sutta Pitaka]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html Samyutta Nikaya 56.11 Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html Digha Nikaya 2 Samaññaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life]&lt;/ref&gt; By following this path [[Buddhahood]] can be attained. Following this path dissolves the [[ten fetters]]{{sfn|Walsh (translator)|1995|p=25-27}} and terminates [[Sankhara|volitional actions]] that bind a human being to the [[Saṃsāra|wheel of samsara]].

The Theravada-tradition follows the [[Visuddhimagga|Path to purification]] described by [[Buddhaghosa]] in his [[Visuddhimagga]]. It features [[Four stages of enlightenment|four progressive stages]] culminating in full [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. The four stages are [[Sotāpanna|Sotapanna]], [[Sakadagami]], [[Anagami]] and [[Arahat]].{{sfn|Walsh (translator)|1995|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=71-72}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/stream.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu: Stream Entry Part 1: The Way to Stream-entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhahood#Types of Buddhahood|Three types of buddha]] are recognized{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}: 
* [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arhat]] ([[Pali]]: ''arahant''), those who reach Nirvana by following the teachings of the Buddha.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}} Sometimes the term [[Savakabuddha|Śrāvakabuddha]] (Pali: ''sāvakabuddha'') is used to designate this kind of awakened person{{citation needed|date=December 2011}};
* [[Pratyekabuddha]]s (Pali: ''paccekabuddha''), those who reach Nirvana through self-realisation, without the aid of spiritual guides and teachers, but don't teach the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}};
* Samyaksambuddha (Pali: ''samma sambuddha''), often simply referred to as ''Buddha'', one who has reached Nirvana by his own efforts and wisdom and teach it skillfully to others{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}.

==Development of the concept==
The term bodhi acquired a variety of meanings and connotations during the development of Buddhist thoughts in the various schools.

===Early Buddhism===
{{Main|Early Buddhism}}

In early Buddhism, ''bodhi'' carried a meaning synonymous to ''[[nirvana]]'', using only some different metaphors to describe the insight, which implied the extinction of ''[[lobha]]'' (greed), ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]]'' (hate) and ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' (delusion). In [[Theravada Buddhism]], bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion.

===Mahayana===
{{Main|Mahayana}}

In Mahayana-thought, bodhi is the realisation of the inseparability of [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]]{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}}, and the unity of subject and object.{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}} It is similar to [[prajna]], to [[kensho|realizing the Buddha-nature]], realizing [[sunyata]] and realizing [[suchness]].{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}}

Mahayana discerns three forms of bodhi:{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}}
# [[Arahat]] - Liberation for oneself;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This also includes [[Pratyekabuddha]], but is not being mentioned by Screiber et al.}}
# [[Bodhisattva]] - Liberation for living beings;
# [[Buddhahood|Full Buddhahood]].

Within the various Mahayana-schools exist various further explanations and interpretations.{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}}

====Buddha-nature====
In the [[Tathagatagarbha]] and [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines bodhi becomes equivalent to the universal, natural and pure state of the mind:
{{quote|''Bodhi'' is the final goal of a Bodhisattva's career [...] ''Bodhi'' is pure universal and immediate knowledge, which extends over all time, all universes, all beings and elements, conditioned and unconditioned. It is absolute and identical with Reality and thus it is [[Tathata]]. ''Bodhi'' is immaculate and non-conceptual, and it, being not an outer object, cannot be understood by discursive thought. It has neither beginning, nor middle nor end and it is indivisible. It is non-dual (''advayam'') [...] The only possible way to comprehend it is through [[samadhi]] by the yogin.{{sfn|Sebastian|2005|p=274}}}}

According to these doctrines bodhi is always there within one's mind, but requires the defilements to be removed. This vision is expounded in texts such as the [[Shurangama Sutra]] and the [[Uttaratantra]].

In [[Shingon]] Buddhism, the state of Bodhi is also seen as naturally inherent in the mind. It is the mind's natural and pure state, where no distinction is being made between a perceiving subject and perceived objects. This is also the understanding of Bodhi found in [[Yogacara]] Buddhism and the mind's natural and pure state as in [[Dzogchen]]. 

To achieve this vision of non-duality, it is necessary to recognise one's own mind:
{{quote|... it means that you are to know the inherent natural state of the mind by eliminating the split into a perceiving subject and perceived objects which normally occurs in the world and is wrongly thought to be real. This also corresponds to the Yogacara definition&amp;nbsp;... that emptiness (''sunyata'') is the absence of this imaginary split{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}

====Harmonisation of the various terms and meanings====
During the development of Mahayana Buddhism the various strands of thought on Bodhi were continuously being elaborated. Attempts were made to harmonize the various terms. The Buddhist commentator [[Buddhaguhya]] treats various terms as synonyms:
{{quote|For example, he defines emptiness (''sunyata'') as suchness (''tathata'') and says that suchness is the intrinsic nature (''svabhava'') of the mind which is Enlightenment (''[[Bodhicitta|bodhi-citta]]''). Moreover, he frequently uses the terms suchness (''tathata'') and Suchness-Awareness (''tathata-jnana'') interchangeably. But since Awareness (''jnana'') is non-dual, Suchness-Awareness is not so much the Awareness of Suchness, but the Awareness which ''is'' Suchness. In other words, the term Suchness-Awareness is functionally equivalent to Enlightenment. Finally, it must not be forgotten that this Suchness-Awareness or Perfect Enlightenment ''is'' Mahavairocana [the Primal Buddha, uncreated and forever existent]. In other words, the mind in its intrinsic nature is Mahavairocana, whom one &quot;becomes&quot; (or vice-versa) when one is perfectly enlightened.{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}
