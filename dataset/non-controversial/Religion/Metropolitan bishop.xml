[[Image:Metropolitan of Moscow Makariy Nevskiy.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Macarius II]], [[Metropolitan of Moscow]]. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] a white [[klobuk]] is distinctive of a metropolitan.]]

In [[Christian]] churches with [[episcopal polity]], the rank of '''metropolitan bishop''', or simply '''metropolitan''', pertains to the [[diocesan bishop]] or [[archbishop]] (then more precisely called '''metropolitan archbishop''') of a [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]]; that is, the chief city of a historical [[Roman province]], [[ecclesiastical province]], or regional capital.

Before the establishment of [[patriarch]]s (beginning in AD 325), metropolitan was the highest [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] rank in the Eastern rites of the Church. They presided over [[synod]]s of bishops, and were granted special [[privilege]]s by [[canon law]] and [[sacred tradition]].

The [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] structure generally followed the Roman imperial practice, with one bishop ruling each city and its territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; The bishop of the provincial capital, the metropolitan, enjoyed certain rights over other bishops in the province, later called [[Suffragan bishop|suffragans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;&quot;metropolitan.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox==
[[File:Mitropolit Vladimir Petersburg.jpg|thumb|left|Metropolitan Vladimir of [[Saint Petersburg]] wearing the light blue [[mandyas]] of a [[Russian Orthodox]] metropolitan.]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, the title is used variously.  In the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Churches]] archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in [[Order of precedence|precedence]], as in the case of Archbishop Demetrios of America, who is the Primate of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, and primates of [[local church]]es below [[patriarchal]] rank are generally designated as archbishops. The reverse is true for the Slavic Churches ([[Russian Orthodox]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox]], etc. with exception of [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpc.org.mk/English/mpc-today.asp, Macedonian Orthodox Church official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; where Archbishop is ranked above Metropolitans) and for the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], where metropolitans rank above archbishops and the title can be used for primatial [[Episcopal see|sees]] as well as important cities. 

In neither case do metropolitans have any special authority over other ruling bishops within their provinces. However, metropolitans (archbishops in the Greek Orthodox Church) are the chairmen of their respective synods of bishops, and have special privileges.

==Roman Catholic==

[[File:Archbishop Daniel Dinardo.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinal [[Daniel DiNardo]] is the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston|Metropolitan Archbishop of Galveston-Houston]]. In the Catholic Church, the [[pallium]] is unique to a metropolitan bishop.]]
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[ecclesiastical province]]s, composed of several neighbouring dioceses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 431]&lt;/ref&gt; are each headed by a metropolitan, the [[archbishop]] of the diocese designated by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 435]&lt;/ref&gt; The other bishops are known as [[suffragan bishop]]s.

The metropolitan's powers over dioceses other than his own are normally limited to
# supervising observance of faith and ecclesiastical discipline and notifying the [[Supreme Pontiff]] of any abuses;
# carrying out, for reasons approved beforehand by the [[Holy See]], a canonical inspection that the suffragan bishop has neglected to perform;
# appointing a [[diocesan administrator]] if the college of consultors fails to elect an at least 35-year-old priest within eight days after the vacancy of the see becomes known;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 436 §1–2]&lt;/ref&gt; and
# serving as the default [[ecclesiastical court]] for [[appeal]]s from decisions of the tribunals of the suffragan bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 1438 no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The metropolitan also has the liturgical privilege of celebrating sacred functions throughout the province, as if he were a bishop in his own diocese, provided only that, if he celebrates in a cathedral church, the diocesan bishop has been informed beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 436 §3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The metropolitan is obliged to request the [[pallium]], a symbol of the power that, in communion with the Church of Rome, he possesses over his ecclesiastical province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 437]&lt;/ref&gt; This holds even if he had the pallium in another metropolitan see.

It is the responsibility of the metropolitan, with the consent of the majority of the suffragan bishops to call a provincial council, decide where to convene it, and determine the agenda. It is his prerogative to preside over the provincial council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 442]&lt;/ref&gt; No provincial council can be called if the metropolitan see is vacant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 440 §2]&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Latin Rite]] metropolitans are [[archbishop]]s; however, some archbishops are not metropolitans, as there are a few instances where an [[archdiocese]] has no suffragans or is itself suffragan to another archdiocese. [[Titular bishop|Titular archbishops]] (i.e. ordained bishops who are given an honorary title to a now-defunct archdiocese; e.g. many Vatican officials and [[papal nuncio]]s and [[apostolic delegate]]s are titular archbishops) are never metropolitans. 

As of April 2006, 508 archdioceses were headed by metropolitan archbishops, 27 archbishops were not metropolitans, and there were 89 titular archbishops. See also [[Catholic Church hierarchy]] for the distinctions.

==Eastern Catholic==

In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the metropolitan is the head of those autonomous [[particular Church]]es that, though they consist of several [[eparchy|eparchies]], are not large enough to be placed under the authority of a [[patriarch]] or a [[major archbishop]]. They are therefore somewhat more subject than patriarchal or major archiepiscopal Churches to oversight by the pope and the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]].

==Anglican==
In the [[Anglican Communion]], a metropolitan is generally the head of an [[ecclesiastical province]] (or cluster of [[dioceses]]) and ranks immediately under the [[primate (religion)|primate]] of the national church (who is often also a metropolitan). Most metropolitans, but not all, are styled [[archbishop]].
