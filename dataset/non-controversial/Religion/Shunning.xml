      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24230">'''Shunning''' can be the act of [[social rejection]], or mental rejection. Social rejection is when a person or group deliberately avoids association with, and habitually keeps away from an individual or group. This can be a formal decision by a group, or a less formal group action which will spread to all members of the group as a form of solidarity. It is a sanction against association, often associated with [[religious]] groups and other tightly knit organizations and communities. Targets of shunning can include persons who have been labeled as, [[apostates]], [[whistleblowers]], [[dissidents]], [[strikebreakers]], or anyone the group perceives as a threat or source of conflict. Social rejection has been established to cause psychological damage and has been categorized as torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychotorture&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/resources/library/documents-and-reports/ojeda.pdf | title=What is Psychological Torture? | publisher=humanrights.ucdavis.edu | date=September 30, 2006 | accessdate=August 31, 2011 | author=Ojeda, Almerindo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental rejection is a more individual action, where a person subconsciously or willfully ignores an idea, or a set of information related to a particular viewpoint. Some groups are made up of people who shun the same ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flat Earth Society|url=http://theflatearthsociety.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=65 |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-11-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social rejection was and is a punishment used by many [[customary law|customary legal systems]]. Such sanctions include the [[ostracism]] of ancient Athens and the still-used ''[[kasepekang]]'' in [[Bali]]nese society.

==Overview==

===Shunning===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
Shunning can be broken down into behaviours and practices that seek to accomplish either or both of two primary goals.
# To modify the behaviour of a member. This approach seeks to influence, encourage, or coerce normative behaviours from members, and may seek to dissuade, provide disincentives for, or to compel avoidance of certain behaviours. Shunning may include disassociating from a member by other members of the community who are in good standing. It may include more antagonistic psychological behaviours (described below). This approach may be seen as either ''corrective'' or ''punitive'' (or both) by the group membership or leadership, and may also be intended as a deterrent.
# To remove or limit the influence of a member (or former member) over other members in a community. This approach may seek to isolate, to discredit, or otherwise dis-empower such a member, often in the context of actions or positions advocated by that member. For groups with defined membership criteria, especially based on key behaviours or ideological precepts, this approach may be seen as ''limiting damage'' to the community or its leadership. This is often paired with some form of [[excommunication]].

Some less often practiced variants may seek to:
* Remove a specific member from general external influence to provide an ideological or psychological buffer against external views or behaviour. The amount can vary from severing ties to opponents of the group up to and including severing all non-group-affiliated intercourse.

Shunning is usually approved of (if sometimes with regret) by the group engaging in the shunning, and usually highly disapproved of by the target of the shunning, resulting in a polarization of views. Those subject to the practice respond differently, usually depending both on the circumstances of the event, and the nature of the practices being applied. Extreme forms of shunning have damaged some individuals' psychological and relational health. Responses to the practice have developed, mostly around anti-shunning advocacy; such advocates highlight the detrimental effects of many of such behaviors, and seek to limit the practice through pressure or law. Such groups often operate supportive organizations or institutions to help victims of shunning to recover from damaging effects, and sometimes to attack the organizations practicing shunning, as a part of their advocacy.

In many civil societies, kinds of shunning are practiced [[de facto]] or [[De_jure#De_jure|de jure]], to coerce or avert behaviours or associations deemed unhealthy. This can include:
*restraining orders or peace bonds (to avoid abusive relationships)
*court injunctions to disassociate (to avoid criminal association or temptation)
*medical or psychological instructing to avoid associating (to avoid hazardous relations, i.e. alcoholics being instructed to avoid friendship with non-recovering alcoholics, or asthmatics being medically instructed to keep to smoke-free environs)
*using background checks to avoid hiring people who have criminal records (to avoid association with felons, even when the crimes have nothing to do with the job description)

===Stealth shunning===
Stealth shunning is a practice where a person or an action is silently banned.
When a person is silently banned, the group they have been banned from doesn't interact with them. This can be done by secretly announcing the policy to all except the banned individual, or it can happen informally when all people in a group or email list each conclude that they do not want to interact with the person.
When an action is silently banned, requests for that action are either ignored or turned down with faked explanations.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowletter&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/ayurveda-health-wellbeing/1093373-now-letter-writing-stealth-ban-correction.html | title=now-letter-writing-stealth-ban-correction | publisher=www.indiadivine.org | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ranks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Custom_servers/MCSharp#Ranks | title=Minecraft: McSharp Server; Ranks | publisher=www.minecraftwiki.net|accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PZ1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noobonicplague.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=5391&amp;start=10 | title=Re: PZ Stealth Ban Request | publisher=www.noobonicplague.com |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stb&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/ayurveda-health-wellbeing/1093369-stealth-ban.html | title=stealth-ban | publisher=www.indiadivine.org | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tactic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.flamewarriors.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=282&amp;sid=8d6666f22980a1cd39d0e9699d11ef39 | title=Tactic: Stealth Ban | publisher=www.flamewarriors.com | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reddit&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.codeunit.co.za/2011/08/03/how-do-you-know-if-your-reddit-account-has-been-stealth-banned | title=How do you know if your Reddit account has been stealth banned? | publisher=www.codeunit.co.za | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
Shunning is often used as a [[pejorative]] term to describe any organizationally mandated disassociation, and has acquired a connotation of [[Psychological abuse|abuse]] and [[relational aggression]]. This is due to the sometimes extreme damage caused by its disruption to normal relationships between individuals, such as friendships and family relations. Disruption of established relationships certainly causes pain, which is at least an [[unintended consequence]] of the practices described here, though it may also in many cases be an intended, coercive consequence. This pain, especially when seen as unjustly inflicted, can have secondary general psychological effects on self-worth and self-confidence, trust and trustworthiness, and can, as with other types of [[psychological trauma|trauma]], impair psychological function.

Shunning often involves implicit or explicit [[shame]] for a member who commits acts seen as wrong by the group or its leadership. Such shame may not be psychologically damaging if the membership is voluntary and the rules of behavior were clear before the person joined. However, if the rules are arbitrary, if the group membership is seen as essential for personal security, safety, or health, or if the application of the rules is inconsistent, such shame can be highly destructive. This can be especially damaging if perceptions are attacked or controlled, or various tools of psychological pressure applied. Extremes of this cross over the line into [[psychological torture]] and can be permanently scarring.

A key detrimental effect of some of the practices associated with shunning relate to their effect on relationships, especially family relationships. At its extremes, the practices may destroy marriages, break up families, and separate children and their parents. The effect of shunning can be very dramatic or even devastating on the shunned, as it can damage or destroy the shunned member's closest familial, spousal, social, emotional, and economic bonds.

Shunning contains aspects of what is known as [[relational aggression]] in psychological literature. When used by church members and member-spouse parents against excommunicant parents it contains elements of what psychologists call [[parental alienation]]. Extreme shunning may cause traumas to the shunned (and to their dependents) similar to what is studied in the [[psychology of torture]].

===Civil rights implications===
Some aspects of shunning may also be seen as being at odds with civil rights or [[human rights]], especially those behaviours that coerce and attack. When a group seeks to have an effect through such practices outside its own membership, for instance when a group seeks to cause financial harm through isolation and disassociation, they can come at odds with their surrounding civil society, if such a society enshrines rights such as freedom of association, conscience, or belief. Many civil societies do not extend such protections to the internal operations of communities or organizations so long as an ex-member has the same rights, prerogatives, and power as any other member of the civil society.

In cases where a group or religion is state-sanctioned, a key power, or in the majority ([[Singapore]]), a shunned former member may face severe social, political, and/or financial costs.

==In religious practice==

===Christianity===

====Early Christianity====
{{Synthesis|date=December 2010}}
Passages in the [[New Testament]], such as {{bibleref|1_Corinthians|5:11-13}}. and {{bibleref|Matthew|18:15–17}}, suggest shunning as a practice of early Christians,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and are cited as such by its modern-day practitioners within Christianity. However, not all Christian scholars or denominations agree on this interpretation of these verses.

Policies governing the use of shunning vary from one organization to another.

====Catholicism====
Prior to the [[Code of Canon Law]] of 1983{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, the Catholic Church expected in rare cases (known as excommunication ''[[Vitandus|vitandi]]'') the faithful to shun an [[excommunication|excommunicated]] member in secular matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05678a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, Entry Excommunication, read on April 23, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the distinction between ''vitandi'' and others (''tolerandi'') was abolished, and thus the expectation is not made any more{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

====Anabaptism====
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

Shunning occurs in Old Order [[Amish]] and some [[Mennonite]] churches.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Shunning can be particularly painful for the shunned individuals in these denominations, which are generally very close-knit, as the shunned person may have no significant social contact with anyone other than those in their denomination.

Upon taking instruction classes, each applicant must make a confession to uphold shunning of all excommunicated adult members, and also submit to being shunned if they are excommunicated. The stated intention is not to punish, but to be used in love to win the member back by showing them their error. (Ref Johns Hopkins Press, below).

The Amish call shunning ''Meidung'', the German word for ''avoidance''. Shunning was a key issue of disagreement in the Amish-Mennonite split. Former Amish Ruth Irene Garrett provides an account of Amish shunning in her community from perspective of shunned individuals in ''Crossing Over: One Woman's Escape from Amish Life''. Amish shunning is also the subject of popular fiction novels about shunning. Different Amish communities vary in the severity and strictness of shunning employed.

The Mennonite ban does not usually involve shunning, but excommunicated members are banned from participation in [[Eucharist|communion]]. A few Mennonite groups do practice shunning, or have in the past. Mainstream and progressive Mennonites either do not shun, or employ less extreme forms of shunning. Some very conservative Mennonite churches use shunning to exclude, punish, and shame excommunicated members. In its extreme form, Mennonites who practice shunning do so by condemning, snubbing, and [[shaming]] excommunicated individuals in all social, spousal, and familial contexts without regard for family ties. When a member is excommunicated, shunning continues until the individual's death unless they repent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] practise a form of shunning which they refer to as &quot;disfellowshipping&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/19880415/article_01.htm Discipline That Can Yield Peaceable Fruit - Jehovah's Witnesses Official Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; A disfellowshipped person is not to be greeted either socially or at their meetings. Disfellowshipping follows a decision of a judicial committee established by a local congregation that a member is guilty of a &quot;serious sin&quot;, including &quot;[[fornication]], [[adultery]], [[homosexuality]], [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]], [[extortion]], [[theft|thievery]], [[lie|lying]], [[drunkenness]], [[verbal abuse|reviling]], [[spiritism]], [[murder]], [[idolatry]], [[apostasy]], and the causing of divisions in the congregation&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insight on the Scriptures, volume 1|page=788|chapter=Expelling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower publications cite sexual immorality as the most common reason.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', page 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1993, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watch Tower Society directs that those who voluntarily renounce membership of the religion (&quot;disassociation&quot;) are also to be shunned.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Disfellowshiping—How to View It&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', July 1, 1984, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization cites their interpretation of various passages in the Bible, such as 1 Corinthians 5:11-13, and 2 John 10-11 to support their practice of shunning. Total shunning is not enforced in the case of disfellowshipped members living in the same household, although in this case the remaining members will not usually discuss spiritual matters with the disfellowshipped person. Parents are still expected to give Bible instruction to a disfellowshipped minor.&lt;ref&gt;“Helping Others to Worship God”, The Watchtower, Nov 15 1988, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“When a Minor Is Disfellowshipped”, The Watchtower, Oct. 1 2001, p.16. par. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with family members not living in the family home is to be kept to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Discipline That Can Yield Peaceable Fruit&quot;, The Watchtower, April 15, 1988, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Andrew Holden claims his research indicated many Witnesses who would otherwise defect because of disillusionment with the organization and its teachings retain affiliation out of fear of being shunned and losing contact with friends and family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Holden | first = Andrew | title = Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | pages = 250–270 | isbn = 0-415-26609-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main|Herem (censure)}}
[[Herem (censure)|Cherem]] is the highest ecclesiastical censure in the [[Jew]]ish community. It is the total exclusion of a person from the Jewish community. Except in rare cases in the Ultra-Orthodox and Chassidic community, the practice of cherem ceased in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy and Jews were legally enfranchised into the Gentile nations in which they lived.

===Bahá'í faith===
{{Main|Covenant breaker}}
Members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are expected to shun those that have been declared [[Covenant-breaker]]s, and expelled from the religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The origins of the Bahá'í community of Canada, 1898-1948 | first = Willy Carl | last = Van den Hoonaard | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press | year = 1996 |isbn = 0-88920-272-9 | page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Bahá'í administration|head of their faith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |pages = 114–116 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Covenant-breakers are defined as leaders of schismatic groups that resulted from [[Bahá'í divisions|challenges to legitimacy of Bahá'í leadership]], as well as those who follow or refuse to shun them.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith&quot;/&gt; Unity is considered the highest value in the Bahá'í Faith, and any attempt at schism by a Bahá'í is considered a spiritual sickness, and a negation of that for which the religion stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith&quot; /&gt;

===Church of Scientology===
{{details|Disconnection}}
The [[Church of Scientology]] asks its members to quit all communication with [[Suppressive Person]]s (those whom the Church deems antagonistic to Scientology). The practice of shunning in Scientology is termed [[disconnection]]. Members can disconnect from any person they already know, including existing family members. Many examples of this policy's application have been established in court.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement of Mr Justice Latey, Re: B &amp; G (Minors) (Custody) Delivered in the High Court
(Family Division), London, 23 July 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sinister&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The Times |publisher= |title=Judge brands Scientology 'sinister' as mother is given custody of children |date=24 July 1984 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bmj1971&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| work=British Medical Journal | date=30 January 1971| pages=297–298| title=News and Notes: Scientology Libel Action|issn=0007-1447|volume=1| pmid=5294085|issue=5743| pmc=1794922|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5743.297| journal=BMJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be customary to write a &quot;disconnection letter&quot; to the person being disconnected from, and to write a public disconnection notice, but these practices have not continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;wallis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy|title=[[The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology]]|publisher=Heinemann Educational Books|location=London|year=1976|pages=144–145|isbn=0-435-82916-5|oclc=310565311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acts&quot;&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (23 December 1965) HCO Policy Letter &quot;Suppressive Acts&quot; reproduced in {{cite book |title = Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand and any associated Scientology organisation or bodies in New Zealand; report of the Commission of Inquiry| first= Sir Guy Richardson |last=Powles |coauthor= E. V. Dumbleton |date = 30 June 1969|oclc= 147661 |location=Wellington|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church states that typically only people with &quot;false data&quot; about Scientology are antagonistic, so it encourages members to first attempt to provide &quot;true data&quot; to these people. According to official Church statements, disconnection is only used as a last resort and only lasts until the antagonism ceases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faq.scientology.org/discon.htm What is Disconnection?] (Accessed 5/29/11)&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to disconnect from a Suppressive Person is itself labelled a Suppressive act.&lt;ref name=&quot;SciEth209&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hubbard | first = L.

However, this argument was rejected because the pressure put on individual Scientologists to disconnect means it is not voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;California appellate court, 2nd district, 7th division, Wollersheim v.
