==Distracting blank spaces==
Formatting that encases the framed table of contents in text, in just the way a framed map or image is enclosed within the text, is now available: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TOCleft}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the HTML does the job. 

Blank space opposite the ToC, besides being unsightly and distracting, suggests that there is a major break in the continuity of the text, which may not be the case. Blanks in page layout are ''voids'' and they have meanings to the experienced reader. The space betweeen paragraphs marks a brief pause between separate blocks of thought.  A deeper space, in a well-printed text, signifies a more complete shift in thought: note the spaces that separate sub-headings in Wikipedia articles. 

A handful of thoughtless and aggressive Wikipedians revert the &quot;TOCleft&quot; format at will. A particularly aggressive de-formatter is [[User:Ed g2s]]

The reader may want to compare versions at the Page history. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 20:17, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Christian Sacramental Usage ==

I've broken this section down into subsections and added a bit more about modern Pentecostal usage. The section marked &quot;Other&quot; originally started &quot;In the Christian religion&quot; but I've changed that to &quot;In some denominations.&quot; I'm not sure exactly which denominations it refers to though, or how accurate it is, so I've just left it. Perhaps someone could clarify it a bit? [[User:Jammycakes|Jammycakes]] 09:37, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

== Pentecostal usage ==

The expression &quot;The anointing that breaks the yoke&quot; is a very popular [[catchphrase]] in Pentecostal/Charismatic circles. It is derived from Isaiah 10:27 and is frequently believed to be a direct quote from Scripture. One translation (can't remember which one) does actually say &quot;The yoke will be broken because of the anointing oil&quot; but the NIV translates it more accurately as &quot;the yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat&quot;. The original Hebrew does not actually uses the word for &quot;anointing&quot; (''maschiach'') in the verse at all. [[User:Jammycakes|Jammycakes]] 09:37, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

== Christian Monarchy ==

This section needs to be looked at again.  The Merovingian kings were thought to be descendents of a Roman or even a &quot;Sea Monster&quot;.  Thus they were of a rare bloodline that was thought to stay in power.  It is the Carolingian kings who are the first to get annointed so as to justify their rule since they are not of this rare bloodline of the Merovingians.

== JESUS  ==

I LOVE JESUS  AND I BELIVE IN HIM  &lt;small&gt;â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.194.162.225|80.194.162.225]] ([[User talk:80.194.162.225|talk]]) 20:05, 14 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

HIS WONDROUS STORY lives throughout our world-&amp; times before. Our ancient African wisdom of the god who died and was reborn after 3 days... well, y'all will be sure to study your history and Joseph Campbell mono-mythologies on  your own. Belief is a weird thing next to the knowledge at hand. Still it has uses, keeping the masses predictable. [[User:Hilarleo|Hilarleo]] ([[User talk:Hilarleo|talk]]) 21:37, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

== ANTECEDENTS  ==

the first lines of this section  ['ANTECEDENTS']   read:

&quot;Abhishek has done a target of nearly 1cr in one month during his 15 days tenure in DBS chola. 
believed [sic] that the virtues of one killed could be transferred to survivors if the latter rubbed themselves with his caul-fat. 
So the Arabs of East Africa anoint themselves with lion's fat in order to gain courage and inspire the animals with awe of themselves.&quot; . . . etc.
 
Numerous problems here.
Does this represent a cut-n-paste error?  Are numerous hyertext-links missing?
This opening reads like it's been copied from another source which the copier didn't fully understand.

If this is the case please recall this remains the ENGLISH version of Wikipedia.
Non-english proficient editors are advised to write in native-language wikis for best sense,
Then request translation into English, for inclusion into English-language Wikipedia.
Please do not try to distort natural processes- nor ENGLISH wikipedia.

Will one who understands this entry above &amp;  the intended meaning please render it into English.... 
Please? Otherwise being nonsnese however poetic it's rilly gotta go, &quot;with awe of themselves&quot; or no.
Thanks in advance 8-) [[User:Hilarleo|Hilarleo]] ([[User talk:Hilarleo|talk]]) 21:28, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

== Spelling ==

The correct spelling of the word is &quot;Anointing.&quot; [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anointing] [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/anoint?view=uk] &quot;Annointing&quot; is a common mis-spelling and should be a redirect to the correct version. [[Special:Contributions/81.157.133.102|81.157.133.102]] ([[User talk:81.157.133.102|talk]]) 20:43, 23 August 2009 (UTC)
:I think that is correct and someone recently changed the spelling of this article without establishing consensus. &amp;mdash;[[User:Whig|Whig]] ('''[[User talk:Whig|talk]]''') 22:38, 23 August 2009 (UTC)
::Can somebody move it back to the correct place then? (IIRC you need to be an administrator to do this properly, preserving the page's history) [[Special:Contributions/81.157.133.102|81.157.133.102]] ([[User talk:81.157.133.102|talk]]) 18:28, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
:::I made a request at [[WP:RM]]. &amp;mdash;[[User:Whig|Whig]] ('''[[User talk:Whig|talk]]''') 20:57, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
{{done}}. In many cases any logged-in editor can move an article by clicking on the Move tab. Only when that doesn't work, due to edit history at the target or other reasons, you need to go to [[WP:RM]] rather than do a cut-and-paste move which will mess up the page's history. [[User:Station1|Station1]] ([[User talk:Station1|talk]]) 21:43, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
:Thanks Station1. Of course in this case we couldn't move it directly because there was a redirect page that needed to be removed. &amp;mdash;[[User:Whig|Whig]] ('''[[User talk:Whig|talk]]''') 16:37, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

== The Messiah ==
I think to put a 'who?' [weasel words] after Christians in the following sentence -'Distinct from the Jewish view, Christians believe the &quot;anointed&quot; one'- is a bit over-zealously pernickety. CHRISTOS is Greek for 'Anointed One'.  So I deleted the query.  [[User:Mens Sana|Mens Sana]] ([[User talk:Mens Sana|talk]]) 16:42, 23 August 2010 (UTC)
