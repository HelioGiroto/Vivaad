== Crucifixion or Cruicifiction ==

Shouldn't something about Deedat's &quot;Crucifixion or Crucifiction&quot; be mentioned here somewhere? [http://www.jamaat.net/crux/Crux1-5.html] It's a study by a muslim scholar of the bible. [[User:Faro0485|Faro0485]] ([[User talk:Faro0485|talk]]) 06:11, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

== Why is the Latter-day Saint view included? ==
The Book of Mormon has no historical value. Its origin is unknown. Its history is demonstrably false (i.e., native Americans are not tribes of Israel). This should be removed.

You might as well quote what the moonies think about the resurrection as evidence.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/84.112.64.30|84.112.64.30]] ([[User talk:84.112.64.30|talk]]) 07:01, 26 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::I'd love to hear how the Book of Mormon is any less valid than the Gospels.  There are no originals of the Gospels, and scientific and historical evidence disputes many things in them.  So what makes one fairy tale book less believable than the other?[[User:SuperAtheist|SuperAtheist]] ([[User talk:SuperAtheist|talk]]) 15:11, 10 September 2010 (UTC)
:::Well, for one thing, the Book of Mormon doesn't date to the historical period or location it purports to provide information about--in order to believe it as a narrative, you have to presuppose a supernatural explanation for the origin of the text. The Gospels, on the other hand, were written in the part of the world they describe, and within the lifetimes of some of the people who knew Jesus. They may represent second- or third-hand oral history rather than direct eyewitness testimony, and they may have been added to and tweaked in the ensuing century or two, but their provenance is much more objectively plausible (from a naturalist/materialist point of view) than that of the Book of Mormon. Their ''contents,'' obviously, contain much that's supernatural, but that's a different matter.

== Regarding inclusion of link to Mythography of Jesus article ==

This link was removed with the pretext &quot;Myths take several generations to take hold&quot;.  This assertion, if it were true (and it isn't, as analytical psychology has repeatedly demonstrated -- new myths can take hold within a single mind, in a single lifetime), is a non-sequitur to the article content, which discusses the archetypal dynamics of the Jesus resurrection story.  This link should stay, as the article it links to contributes important insights to the psychological dynamics of the resurrection, and why it is that the story, as told in the Bible, has persisted for millenia despite inconclusive verifiable evidence of its literal historicity.

==Resurrection vs. Incarnation==
Although Christianity is commonly described as the ''religion of the Resurrection'', there is an older tradition that places more emphasis on the dogma of the [[Incarnation]], hence the title ''religion of the Incarnation''. This is very much apparent when reading the works of the Church Fathers, such as [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who mentioned the Incarnation when debating against Arians in order to prove the divinity of Christ. It could therefore be argued that the original apostles already believed in Jesus's divinity before his crucifixion/resurrection because they had been taught about the incarnation doctrine. [[User:ADM|ADM]] ([[User talk:ADM|talk]]) 21:16, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

== NPOV ==

Please fix this: &quot;It is, of course, critically important whether or not Jesus did actually rise from the dead: for if he did, then his teachings are worthy of serious consideration. &quot; -- [[Special:Contributions/200.226.152.206|200.226.152.206]] ([[User talk:200.226.152.206|talk]]) 05:55, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

Skepticism is not NPOV. I made a couple of edits to provide a more-neutral POV, and they were removed because someone considered them &quot;unsourced and POV.&quot; Skepticism is a POV. For an article to be NPOV, it must fairly represent all views. In  the section &quot;Jesus Resurrection,&quot; A fanciful account from the &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot; is presented alongside a reference to the canonical Gospels. This juxtaposition implies that the accounts are on more or less equal footing. This is not an objective POV. Whatever, one's view of the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus, he or she must admit that documents such as the Gospel of Peter have a very different quality than the four canonical Gospels.

In the section &quot;Tomb Discovery,&quot; there is the following statement: &quot;However, such an argument has an obvious flaw: the very fact that people consider the story to be 'self-authenticating' due to these elements provides a motive for their inclusion.&quot; First of all, this is not NPOV. Second, it misses the point of the argument. The point is that it is extremely unlikely that anyone ''at that time'' would have invented such an account. Even those who were reporting history frequently embellished the facts to make their patrons or friends appear more heroic. It is a very modern idea to design an account so that it contains unflattering elements to make it appear authentic even though it is fabricated. The above statement is clearly not NPOV and commits an anachronistic fallacy.[[User:RodPickett|RodPickett]] ([[User talk:RodPickett|talk]]) 21:39, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

: I am not sure if I follow the argument, but we think matters not, Wikipedia works on references. Are there sources for these? And let us wait to see what others may say. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 22:27, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

::I removed it - it had no source, was written in a polemical way and seems to be the magic exception to the criterion of embarrassment. &quot;The gospels authors made the women a witness, not so that their own audience will find it convincing, but so that 2000 years in the future historians utilising something called &quot;the criterion of embarrassment&quot; will.&quot; If someone believes it was a premature removal, find a scholarly source and fix up the wording. --[[User:Ari89|Ari]] ([[User talk:Ari89|talk]]) 23:44, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

This sentence/phrase &quot;Some contemporary scholars still express doubts about the historicity of the resurrection accounts and have debated their origin&quot; seems to take a NPOV and reads as if the author believes in the resurrection of Jesus. Essentially, to me, the sentence reads as if most people, by now, accept the resurrection of Jesus as historical fact and that only some small minority of people think it didn't happen. (edit by IP 95, etc.)

:Yes, that needed to be fixed. I fixed it, Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 17:28, 26 March 2012 (UTC)

== Recent change to definition ==

Recently, a user has changed the definition of the resurrection (which is an event), to a belief.  Such a change is inaccurate and no valid reason has been given.  [[User:ReaverFlash|ReaverFlash]] ([[User talk:ReaverFlash|talk]]) 15:22, 14 August 2009 (UTC)

== First sentence of lead ==
The first sentence currently reads: &quot;According to [[Christianity|Christians]], the '''resurrection of Jesus,''' following his death as result of crucifixion, is the event upon which Christian doctrine, ritual and theology is based.&quot; It seems to keep changing every few hours, but basically that's the sentence.

I humbly submit that this isn't what the first sentence should be. It's a statement of why the Resurrection is important, not a definition of what it actually is (or was, according to taste). A definition of the Resurrection should point out that it's the return to bodily life of Jesus after his death (crucifixion).  Just a single sentence. After that, by all means this material about the importance should go in. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 07:25, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

:EXCELLENT point, PiCo. Very constructive! Thank you! [[User:Afaprof01|Afaprof01]] ([[User talk:Afaprof01|talk]]) 13:43, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

==Holy Spirit==
The article should probably mention the fact that many theologians have tradtionally explained the resurrection by a supernatural action of the Holy Spirit. In the divine Trinity, there is the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. If the Son, who is physically incarnated, happens to die for some tragic reason, then it is possible to explain an eventual resurrection of the Son through the logic of trinitarian doctrine. Hence, the Holy Spirit, who is the Incarnator and the Paraclete, might also deserve to be given the title of Resurrector for his soteriological role in the Resurrection of Jesus. [[User:ADM|ADM]] ([[User talk:ADM|talk]]) 20:21, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

Can you give an example of such a theologian?  That might be helpful here. [[User:Jacor2|Jacor2]] ([[User talk:Jacor2|talk]]) 14:15, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

==Lorenzen's ''opinion''==
''According to international scholar Thorwald Lorenzen, the first Easter led to a shift in emphasis from faith &quot;in God&quot; to faith &quot;in Christ.&quot; Today, Lorenzen finds &quot;a strange silence about the resurrection in many pulpits.&quot; He writes that among some Christians, minsters, and professors, it seems to have to have become &quot;a cause for embarrassment or the topic of apologetics.&quot;''

I deleted this for two reasons.  One, the second part is just the man's opinion on things, given without any evidence other than that he &quot;finds&quot; it to be true.  He says he finds it to be true in ''many'' churches, which is a [[weasel word]] as many could mean anything from two to all but one.  I personally don't go to Church much but when I do I never experience people silent or embarrassed about the resurrection of Jesus.  Any Church that recites the [[Nicene Creed]] says they believe in the resurrection every week.  But again, that's just my personal experience, as his experiences are just his.

His first statement is an actual argument about what belief in the resurrection did to religion in general and, if any actual arguments are included with it, could be put into the article.  However his second statement is clearly just his ''personal opinion'' given with no evidence to back it up whatsoever.  No polls, no anecdotes, just his statement that he ''finds'' it to be true, which makes it just the personal opinion of one theologian.  If you guys find his point interesting, so be it, but that does not mean it should be included in an ''encyclopedia'' article on the subject with out any kind of evidence or argument.  What if some other theologian ''found'' it to be generally true that the opposite was the case and that the majority of Churches and Christians boldly proclaim the resurrection?  Without any other evidence than that being his personal opinion it would be wrong to include that as well as then we're just saying &quot;is so&quot; and &quot;is not&quot; back and forth without any side making any actual arguments.  I therefore think that this section should be eliminated or changed to include any actual evidence he has to make his case.[[User:Roy Brumback|Roy Brumback]] ([[User talk:Roy Brumback|talk]]) 19:50, 4 October 2009 (UTC)

:Sorry, but that is not how Wikipedia works. That is a valid reference and if there are dissenting opinions with references you can include them. Personal opinion relates to you and me, not quoted sources: what ''we think'' matters not. Today [[Alan Greenspan]] said that he thinks that US unemployment will reach 10%. Is that his opinion? Yes. Can it be included in Wikipedia? Sure, for he is an expert. As is, I see no reason for the deletion. Cheers. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 20:35, 4 October 2009 (UTC)

::This doesn't reference anything but his personal opinion, and this dude isn't Alan Greenspan. Of course it's &quot;valid&quot; in the sense he probably really said it.  That's not the issue.  He's some random theology prof.  Knowing a lot about theology doesn't give you the ability to claim to know what's in the hearts and minds of ''many'' Christians without, you know, actually asking them.  Again, does he have any, you know, ''evidence'' for these assertions?  Should we include another theologian with a different assertion also without any evidence?  How about the opinions of a lot of theologians?  How many is too many?  They're &quot;experts&quot;, but so what?  Just listing their opinions without any backing evidence is pretty pointless.  Is something true simply because they assert it, especially if they don't give any anecdotes or polls to back up the claim.  Of course not.  And again, how can the majority of Churches be embarrassed by the claim of the resurrection if they proclaim it with the Nicene Creed every Church service?  I could waste a lot of my time putting in counter claims to his, but I'm pretty sure that unless he has evidence for these claims they should not be on the page.[[User:Roy Brumback|Roy Brumback]] ([[User talk:Roy Brumback|talk]]) 22:36, 4 October 2009 (UTC)

:::Let us see what others have to say as well. As for &quot;evidence&quot;, in theology that is a different measure. If you have dissenting opinions, please feel free to add them. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 23:35, 4 October 2009 (UTC)

We're not talking about theology, that's the whole point.  He isn't making a theological argument, he's stating his opinion about what other people think and feel, which would make this a psychological issue or an issue for statistical polling, not theology.  Thus his theological expertise has zero bearing on the issue he's addressing[[User:Roy Brumback|Roy Brumback]] ([[User talk:Roy Brumback|talk]]) 01:47, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

==Main Image==
There is a current dispute about the main image on this page. The repeated use of Bloch images as the leading image on many pages seems to me to be against NPOV given that it has a clear association with the [[Mormon church]], as Wikipedia itself states: &quot;For over 40 years the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has made heavy use of Carl Bloch's paintings, mostly from the Frederiksborg Palace collection, in its church buildings and printed media.&quot;

I think a non-Bloch image will be more neutral. User Reaver Flash has already crossed the 3 revert line on this, adding Bloch. Suggestions will be appreciated from 3rd parties, else I will seek an official 3rd opinion. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 22:02, 19 December 2009 (UTC)

:Bloch is not a member of the LDS.  Although the Mormon church has used his images, many other parties have used it as well.&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 22:26, 19 December 2009 (UTC)

::But the LDS has made a point of using Bloch heavily and now the association is pretty strong. What is the reason for &quot;insisting&quot; on these Bloch images all over Wikipedia on your part? [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 22:46, 19 December 2009 (UTC)

As I've said before, Bloch is not even LDS.  Furthermore, there are hundreds of images on wikipedia that were used by EXCLUSIVELY by the Catholic Church.  The art style is exclusive to the catholic church as well.  Should THOSE images be removed as well? &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 05:42, 20 December 2009 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:ReaverFlash|ReaverFlash]] ([[User talk:ReaverFlash|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ReaverFlash|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:You avoided the question. What is your attachment to Bloch? And no, the Cath Church is not promoting artists as LDS does Bloch. I will seek a 3rd opinion. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 23:11, 21 December 2009 (UTC)

I'm not &quot;attached&quot; to Bloch, I just think it's ridiculous to remove images based on some &quot;association&quot;.  And you're the one avoiding my point.  There are hundreds of images that are DIRECTLY associated with the Catholic Church used on wikipedia.  And you want to exclude paintings even though the artist is not LDS and the art style is not based on LDS either.  There are hundreds of images that are strongly associated with the Catholic Church used on wikipedia, when as you say it, many more &quot;neutral&quot; images can be used.  Should THEY be removed as well? &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 00:17, 22 December 2009 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:ReaverFlash|ReaverFlash]] ([[User talk:ReaverFlash|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ReaverFlash|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Furthermore, the Catholic church has promoted artists.

::We are going in circles. I am not promoting any single artist. That is clear. As you well know, the issue started on the talk page for [[Baptism]], and Bloch was changed there by other users, not myself. I started to object to this Bloch image only after another editor (User:Lima) had made an objection on that page to your ''continued insistence'' in plastering Bloch on that page, which was just one of the pages where you were adding Bloch. As you recall, I was even alerted to that page because &quot;you asked me to comment on it&quot;. You could not make your point there, so hoped I would make it. I was NOT watching that page until you ran into obstacles there. This issue goes beyond this page alone. We must wait for a 3rd opinion. My suggestion is to let a 3rd party pick a 3rd image for this page, neither mine nor yours. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 03:47, 22 December 2009 (UTC)

Only YOU had a problem with Carl Bloch the artist.  I don't appreciate you systematically removing Carl Bloch images from wikipedia just as I'm sure you will not appreciate me removing William Adolphe Bougoureau images from wikipedia.

''Opinion:'' Unless the Bloch image either (a) depicts a particular sectarian point of view or (b) is so clearly identified with some particular sect that the average reader would recognize it as such, I do not think that it is objectionable under NPOV, nor do I feel that the frequent or common use of any particular artist's work as the lead image is objectionable unless there is a clear effort to merchandise the artist or unless (a) or (b) applies. What is of importance is whether the image improves the article by illustrating it or some element of it. If it does that, then as between images portraying essentially the same content, the image which has the highest conceptual clarity and visual clarity should be used. Having set those principles, I believe that the Bloch image is not objectionable for NPOV, but the Raphael is nonetheless the better image because it is visually a sharper image, but even more so because it is not clear in the Bloch image that Jesus is coming out of a tomb - it could be any doorway. The Raphael image isn't entirely desirable, either, because it diverges from the typical Gospel images (the rolling door, the cavelike tomb), but at least it is clearly a grave or tomb. In short, the Raphael image is better in both its conceptual clarity and its visual clarity and ''as between those two images'' should be the image used. A better image might well, however, be found than either of these.

== More on historical Jesus? ==

I would like to read more about historians' opinions about what might factually have happened after Jesus was Crucified, assuming no specific Christian beliefs -- this is neither addressed in the Crucifixion of Jesus article, nor here, not anywhere, as far as I can see. If one is not Christian and is a skeptic, rationalist, but believes Jesus existed, what are the alternatives to a belief in literal resurrection of a &quot;glorious&quot;, renewewed and all-powerful body (that later ascended to Heaven). I am familiar with, for example, the theory someone stole the body, or Crossan's theory that it was thrown in a common grave and/or eaten by animals and birds - and then some people claim he resuscitated and lived out his life somewhere... maybe someone more knowledgeable could add something?

:[[Frank J. Tipler]] is hardly a fringe theorist--he is the world's leading expert on [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

[[User:Keraunos|Keraunos]] ([[User talk:Keraunos|talk]]) 06:43, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

::Tipler certainly knows physics, but calling him &quot;the world's leading expert&quot; would probably be a &quot;fringe assertion&quot; on its own and would make [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Edward Witten]] and a whole pile of other physicists ''scream in pain''. And of course General Relativity is a completely &quot;biology free&quot; theory anyway, and NONE of the gentlemen mentioned above (Einstein included) ever claimed a detailed knowledge of biology. However, that aside, a good test for &quot;not being fringe&quot; is the number of OTHER scientists that have written about it, or even bothered to strongly criticize it in the &quot;main stream&quot; referred journals. Any professor can publish a book, but if it is not fringe, others will discuss it in &quot;main stream&quot; publications, say [[Physical Review]], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], etc. Do you have a list of others big time physicists who support this theory, or even bother to debate it in mainstream publications?

I thought the title of the review in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] was quite funny: &quot;''Piety in the sky''&quot;. The Nature review calls the book: &quot;a masterpiece of pseudoscience&quot;.

== ANE background to resurrection ==

I've added this sentence to the opening of the second para of the Background section:

:The idea of rising from the dead on the third day was deeply rooted in ancient Near Eastern culture, with precedents as ancient as the [[Sumer]]ian [[Inanna]] and Egyptian [[Osiris]] myths. (FROM[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=IGcI-F0pxswC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=lester+grabbe+2004&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cdz6J9d_bq&amp;sig=9eAdKy4Sm7r13zMpLU2V5ObGou0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_-QETNjQPJmvcPj-nfQE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=lester%20grabbe%202004&amp;f=false David L. Petersen, Joel M. LeMon, Kent Harold Richards (eds), &quot;Method Matters: Essays on the Interpretation of the Hebrew Bible&quot;, p.186])

As you can see, it's from a reliable academic source, and is relevant to the subject as a lead-in to the Hellenistic-period Jewish belief in afterlife and resurrection. 

I'd also like to take this section a little further - there was quite a lot of discussion in late-period Judaism on this subject, and there's far more that can be said to put the Christian belief into its cultural perspective. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 23:25, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

:You are right, it is an academic source. But the quote goes against mainstream scholarship so it has to be nuanced to reflect this. The category of so-called rising gods is a remnant of an older era of scholarship and as far as I know of no scholarship on the resurrection in a long time has made the connection being made here. --[[User:Ari89|Ari]] ([[User talk:Ari89|talk]]) 01:50, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

::Just to make clear, it's dealing with the question of whether or not Hosea describes Yahweh as having dominion over death. On that matter, the usual opinion is that he does not, but the author is arguing that he does. He quotes Wolff as the source for the sentence about ANE resurrection myths. Wolff wrote what is still the major commentary on Hosea (published 1974) - so it's pretty hard to argue that it's not mainstream. Do you have any major sources to the contrary? [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 04:17, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:::On the outdated concept of ANE rising deity e.g. [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], &quot;Dying and Rising Gods.&quot; who brands the category largely a misnomer; for an extensive study on the historical context for resurrection beliefs see [[N.T. Wright]], ''Resurrection of the Son of God'' which finds no such three day resurrection belief in extensively dealing with the primary data. --[[User:Ari89|Ari]] ([[User talk:Ari89|talk]]) 12:47, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

::::J.Z.Smith isn't quite relevant - he was arguing against a certain explanation of ancient myth, not the existence of those myths. In brief, the paradigm of his time was set by Frazer's argument that certain myths of a dying/resurrected god reflected the annual cycle of vegetation, esp. for crops, and that this in turn reflected an ancient practice of peoples ritually sacrificing their king in order to renew the fertility of the land. Frazer, in short, was advancing a historical source for myth, and this was what Smith demolished. For a good explanation, see [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Vlkb0cSBGlIC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=Jonathan+Z.+Smith,+%22Dying+and+Rising+Gods&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gdLDb5Os35&amp;sig=dq7vPTGU610Gkz_rVl-4aPKOpC8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FTYITKCdLYiXcdaboIMO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jonathan%20Z.%20Smith%2C%20%22Dying%20and%20Rising%20Gods&amp;f=false Bernard Frank Batto, Kathryn L. Roberts, Jimmy Jack McBee Roberts (eds), &quot;David and Zion: biblical studies in honor of J.J.M. Roberts&quot;]. As for Wright, he advances a view which is not within the dominant consensus, as he himself admits - he's setting out to challenge the idea that resurrection was part of the framework of beliefs in 1st century Palestine. He might be right, but so far his book hasn't swept all before it. We should also bear in mind that Wright is an Evangelical with a theological agenda (he honestly believes in the Resurrection), and also note that he's been accused of circular reasoning. All in all, I don't find your arguments against my sentence convincing. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 23:23, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
:::::Mettinger notes in quite explicit terms that to argue in favour of the category was very much against consensus (''The Riddle of the Resurrection.'')

::::::''The Lord gave me life

:[[User:Ari89|Ari]] believes that the resurrection is a unique event, with no parallels in the beliefs of the ancient world - if it did have parallels, there's a chance that the early believers might have been just building on their beliefs, like people today interpreting clouds and flocks of birds as flying saucers.

PiCo should add the material.

:I agree with the statement that ''This article needs a good deal of work'' but it is not the type of work that I predict is about to be proposed. What I see happening is that this article will continue to devolve towards a debate about the ''historicity of the Resurrection'', quot emore from Josephus, Davidus, Markus, or WhoknowsWhus and get a lot of new references from academics who are more obscure than ever. And it will totally fail in the way that it is already failing: to address the spiritual component of Christian beliefs on Resurrection.

:It is a fact that by some Wikipedia policies quoting pompous academics such as the Jesus seminar is encouraged, but that should not become the key focus. But I think as in all cases WP:UYB (WP:use your brain) should be the first policy. What are we trying to ''teach the reader'' and what are the demographics of the readers we are addressing?. How many of them are theology students and how many are new comers to Christianity who want to grasp the basic ideas? I think WP:UYB suggests that there are fewer theology students than the general public. Hence this over-riding desire top load the article with obscure debates about the historicity of the Resurrection will just add enough trees to obscure the wood. And let me state, as I have stated elsewhere that personally I find these debates about historicity to be at best idiotic. We are talking about events that took place 2,000 years ago and as of today there are 20 different theories about who did JFK or MLK - events that were witnessed by people who are currently walking the streets. So personally, I find these pompous Jesus seminar or other determinations to be laughable. I wonder how many other readers feel the same way. Again, one can bring up the &quot;it is academic&quot; flag, but then let me point out that most readers in the world do not visit theology libraries - because those types of books bore them to death. Turning this article into a purely theological or historical debate will also bore readers and they will just click away - you can not stop them from doing that by adding more references. So that trend will make this article have the fate of all those thick theology books that are gathering dust in the corner of the library. Of course trying to debate that with the authors of those books is a waste of time, for they will just bring up more obscure theological angles. 

:By the way, the same is true of the more useless parts of physics such as [[M-theory]] which can not even be subject to a real test. So perhaps we should let the Jesus seminar crowd get together with the M-theorists and talk each other to death, then see if they can get resurrected. However, letting a general article on physics get lost in M-theory is a mistake. And letting a general article on Resurrection get lost in historicity and the Jesus seminar is even a bigger mistake.

:::Gosh, I seem to have touched a nerve. Sorry. I didn't realize that citing the Jesus Seminar would cause such a stir.

If you prefer another RS on the topic, please cite it. And I'll agree with you this far: this article should explain the meaning and significance of Jesus' resurrection, and not focus on the issue of historicity.

The article lead should mention that there is a debate about historicity, but getting lost in the details of that debate will just stop most people from reading, as I said above.

== restored material ==

An editor restored this text regarding reference to Jesus' resurrection in 1 Corinthians: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;Concerning this creed, Campenhausen wrote, &quot;This account meets all the demands of historical reliability that could possibly be made of such a text,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Von Campenhausen, &quot;The Events of Easter and the Empty Tomb,&quot; in ''Tradition and Life in the Church'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; whilst A. M. Hunter said, &quot;The passage therefore preserves uniquely early and verifiable testimony. It meets every reasonable demand of historical reliability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hunter, ''Works and Words of Jesus'' (1973) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sources. These two authors are making the extraordinary claim that Jesus rose from the dead, but they are neither of them extraordinary, or even contemporary, sources. If we need to go back 40 years to find unremarkable scholars to say this, then let's not say it at all. [[User:Leadwind|Leadwind]] ([[User talk:Leadwind|talk]]) 03:25, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

:Without getting involved in that specific passage, I should point out much of the Bible is one extraordinary claim after another (for it violates the known laws of physics and biology) if one assumes it to be a statement of scientific facts, e.g. Raising Lazarus, Walking on Water, etc. Walking on Water and &quot;''action at a distance''&quot; to make another person (Apostle Peter) walk on water is as much an extraordinary claim as the resurrection. If we go down that path all that will be debated is the historicity of the Bible. However, teaching the reader about what the Bible says about it is a separate issue from debating if there were stones that they walked on or not - and again regardless of all scholarship, how is ''anyone'' going to determine what happened that night on a lake 2,000 years ago. So all Wikipedia can do is the following:

::* First, state the account of the episode in the Bible, clearly in simple English
::* State the interaction of that episode with other related biblical episodes
::* State that Christians believe these, but scholars continue debating its historicity and will probably do so for ever.

:No claim should be made as to whether it actually happened (as an extraordinary event) or not, for that will turn the article into a battleground of ideas instead of a page intended to inform the reader about the episode.

So what is becoming clear is that there are a whole pile of authors/historians/commentators etc. who have specific (and often incompatible) views on the historicity of the resurrection, call them pro/con/decided/undecided/whatever. Are the views of most of them who are not total jokes (like the Tipler item above that was deleted) eventually going to have to get mentioned? Probably so. It seems clear that there is a lot of interest in discussing the historicity of the resurrection, and that it is in fact a topic unto itself, and as I mentioned above in April 2006 it became an article on its own, then got merged with crucifixion that got absorbed elsewere and then back here. I think the best way is to simply populate the page [[Historicity of the Resurrection of Jesus]] that already exists and redirects here, so the discussion can take place at length with almost all major authors given a few paragraphs. Then we have a main here that refers to that. And it may take 200 keystrokes to do that and 2,000 keystrokes to discuss it here.

:&quot;Are the views of most of them who are not total jokes (like the Tipler item above that was deleted) eventually going to have to get mentioned?&quot; Most certainly not. Let's just stick with top names among current scholarship. Now let's return to the topic on hand.

::I looked at those specific authors, and it is clear that the argument to remove the statements based on extraordinary claims is 200% incorrect. The first 100% is because neither author makes a claim about the resurrection but about the historicity of a document, namely the creed. There is nothing, nothing, nothing extraordinary for a historian to comment on the historicity of an ancient document. The second 100% is due to the fact that as discussed above this article is primarily about what the New Testament states about the resurrection, not the scientific analysis of the resurrection, and as stated above the Bible is effectively a collection of extraordinary claims anyway, and its discussion can not be banned based on claims of extraordinality. The article needs to educate the reader about teachings of the Church on the resurrection, without endorsing or rejecting them as scientific issues for that would be &quot;waging a surrogate war&quot; on the issue of science and religion on this page. The policy regarding the claims of extraordinality does not ban discussions of what the Indians teach about [[Shiva]] and can not ban discussions of what the Christians teach about the resurrection. Now, about quoting people at length, given that this document's focus is not the &quot;historicity debate&quot; neither those pro, nor against historicity should be quoted at length, so I trimmed that, and the same needs to be done to anti-historicity quotes.

== Origin of the narrative section ==

It doesn't seem to have any structure. Take a look. It bounces around from paragraph to paragraph. I'd have put it in chronological order, but I want to be sensitive to those editors who wish I would just stop already. How about we put the Origin of the Narrative section into chronological order? That would be kerygma, Paul, Gospels. That gives you virtually the whole NT narrative. [[User:Leadwind|Leadwind]] ([[User talk:Leadwind|talk]]) 04:18, 10 June 2010 (UTC)

:Well, what exactly do you mean by chronological order? The early Christian kerygma is present throughout the sources. Furthermore, the primitive nature of, say the pre-Pauline creed in 1 Cor 15 although put to paper earlier doesn't make it any more or less primitive than the Markan narrative that was put to paper later. Most scholars will tell you the resurrection narrative is not a Markan creation, such as for the empty tomb: &quot;The empty tomb story was not the Evangelist's creation but tradition with a long history behind it.&quot; (Reginald Fuller, ''The Formation of the Resurrection Narratives'' (SPCK, 1972) p. 171.) --[[User:Ari89|Ari]] ([[User talk:Ari89|talk]]) 10:20, 10 June 2010 (UTC)

::Agreed that the resurrection narrative is not a Markan invention.

[[User:Leadwind|Leadwind]] ([[User talk:Leadwind|talk]]) 15:06, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

== Some suggestions ==
Just a few ideas that I have for the article:
# Expand the Background to the resurrection - e.g. contemporary beliefs about resurrection
# The resurrection in the church practice - something about Easter services and more on the theology of it. This seems to be lacking in favour of a historical debate. (Note, the historical question has little to do with many people's experience of the resurrection in the Church).
# Focus the key historical debates in the Origins of the Narrative section.

:Translation: a breath of the fresh air of logic at last. I agree and think this article has missed the boat and does not address what most people think of when they search for resurrection. The discussion on historicity and origin should be centralized and be a world unto itself. A key sign that the article has missed the boat in addressing its topic is that term &quot;redemption&quot; appears exactly once in the intro and nowhere else. Yet that is a fundamental element of the teachings on the resurrection. I should say that I found the discussion on the Markian issues informative, and I think that should be preserved somewhere - but I think eventually origin and historicity will become an article on their own.

==Christian tradition==
I think this section has missed its turn, searching for direction. Exactly what does the Shroud have to do with the resurrection? The Shroud could be there, sans resurrection. The Shroud has zero, zero evidence of resurrection. And it is the most controversial artifact in history, so what does it buy in this article?

:The shroud is a notable artifact related to Jesus' resurrection. Maybe it's a fake, but maybe the stories of Jesus' resurrection are fakes, too.

== Sunday ==

Isn't it the case that Christians worship on Sunday because that's the day of the week on which God raised Jesus from the dead? If so, that information belongs here.

==Christian mythology==
Explaining my removable of this category, there are multiple reasons that the resurrection of Christ can't be called 'mythology'.
*1. Myths do not develop within the lifetime of witnesses. There is no example anywhere of a great myth becoming established within 30 years of an event.
*2. The style of the gospels is radically different from all ancient myths.
*3. No relic of a non-miraculous story exists. That the original story should be lost and replaced by another goes beyond any known example of corruption of even oral tradition.
*4. The New Testament claims that the resurrection is not a myth. If it was a lie by the writers, we have a conspiracy with all its related difficulties.
*5. The New Testament as we now have it is written by eyewitnesses to the facts they report.
*6. The myth theory cannot account for the empty tomb.
*7. The myth theory cannot explain the sudden conversion of Saul(Paul) to Christianity.

::Actually, the resurrection of Jesus Christ can be called mythology because no proof exists for it outside of the Bible. Also, it is a supernatural event, which typically isn't associated with real life, but rather with mythology. The New Testament was not written by direct sources, but rather by second and thirdhand accounts which could have been manipulated. As for the empty tomb, graverobbers or Jesus's family might have stolen the body, or the Romans could have secretly buried the body somewhere else. As for Saint Paul, he was hallucinating, just like Joan of Arc was. And yes, accounts can be manipulated. For instance, many people believe in conspiracy theories and doubt historical narratives of particular events. It wouldn't surprise me if someone made up a story of how Jesus secretly escaped, which was then converted into the resurrection story over time. It also wouldn't surprise me if this story spread to other places since many Christians believed in Jesus and hoped that he was still alive. Thus, since the Bible has been proven false numerous times before, and since contemporary accounts other than the Bible do not confirm the resurrection, the resurrection story should be treated as Christian mythology. And until someone develops a time machine and allows us to travel back in time to see what really happened to Jesus, the resurrection story of Jesus Christ will continue to be regarded as Christian mythology.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/169.235.86.70|169.235.86.70]] ([[User talk:169.235.86.70|talk]]) 05:18, 19 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Most modern secular scholars do not think that Jesus rose from the dead. This view is entirely lacking from the article. We need some of these critical sources in the article. Here is an example source: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444327946.ch18/summary

:I added that ref anyway, but there was/is a discussion about Sanders etc. so that view was not entirely lacking.

:::I did explain that above. Primary source means the Bible itself. As in [[WP:Primary]]: ''Primary sources are very close to an event, often accounts written by people who are directly involved.'' So the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a primary source, but ''The encyclopedia of Christianity'', ''Carl Jung'' and ''Geza Vermes'' all written in the 20th century are not. The article is about the &quot;Christian belief&quot; as it starts at the top. This comes about all the time, e.g. [[Gautama Buddha]] does not have a tag either because it is about the Buddhist belief. [[Historicity of Jesus]] is the article you are thinking about I guess - a separate issue not about the explanation of beliefs but about deductive reasoning about them.

::::This isn't the article about [[Jesus of Nazareth]], this is the article about the claims of resurrection. To that end, it is important that we present a detailed and scholarly evaluation of the claim that Jesus resurrected. Using Christian sources primarily to evaluate this is problematic for the reasons explained in the tag. Namely, Christian sources are simply not well-balanced with regards to the subject. The problem we have with this article is the very fact that no rational sources think there is anything more here than base mythology is swept under the rug. That's why the tag is appropriate and why I think the article could use a major rewrite.

::::: In the [[Historical Jesus]] article there is a section [[Historical_Jesus#Resurrection_appearances|historicity of resurrection appearances]]. That is the place where historicity is discussed. And there is a section on [[Historical_Jesus#Burial_and_empty_tomb|Burial and empty tomb]] and a section on [[Historical_Jesus#Disciples_abandon_Jesus|Disciples abandon Jesus]] there. So there is a specific section on the historicity of each specific incident. And if you read those carefully, you will see that they directly quote what ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' says as well. So they do have general encyclopedic support. The way these articles are structured, be it for Jesus or [[Muhammad]] or [[Gautama Buddha]] the historicity issues are kept in one place to keep focus, and the other issues together. And it does not take much to say: &quot;it never happened&quot;. That is what those sections already say. In general, ''modern scientific thought'' not only dismisses the resurrection of the dead, but all other religious phenomena, so what you are saying is not going to surprise anyone. That is why the articles on Muhammad, Buddha etc. are also all there, and scientists dismiss them all. But the encyclopedia does need to include a description of the beliefs about them, regardless of their dismissal by the scientific community. So this is not just a resurrection issue, but a general issue about all religious articles - across religions. And this article is no exception.

[[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 06:47, 24 July 2011 (UTC)

:I agree. That is the [[WP:Primary]] philosophy. And the question of the historicity of this episode can not even be addressed by the Bible. The Bible states that a set of &quot;actions&quot; took place but said actions do not match modern science since they require the regeneration of life. The bible can not discuss that, because it was written pre-science. So the question of historicity is somewhat obvious I think. It is like asking: &quot;is it historical that an angel appeared at the tomb?&quot; But the very existence of angels is not historical, so the whole issue of whether this is a historical/scientific account seems obvious. It is a primarily religious document. The faithful happen to believe it as events, based on their belief in God who can over-rule science, but that in itself is neither scientific in the 21st century sense. In any case, the article has dozens of non-primary sources. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 09:22, 24 July 2011 (UTC)

::How can you address the historicity of supernatural claims? By definition they're outside the normal. Though it could be good to compare the resurrection of Jesus with the several other resurrections that have happened in history, most of them much more recent. One of the most interesting of these was the appearance of a dragon in the skies over Yunnanfu, the capital of Yunnan province, China, when the last pretender to the Ming throne was executed there in the year 1660-something - this was witnessed by many hundreds of individual witnesses, and written down immediately after the event. Not quite a resurrection of course - the poor dead emperor never came back to life), but it does illustrate that supernatural events are reliably described from all periods of history, and if we can believe this account, then why not that of the Resurrection, which had far fewer witnesses and happened so much longer ago?

== Many Christians don't really believe that resurrection happened in the biological sense. ==

In this article about Jesus' resurrection, only non-believers of sorts are purported to not literally believe in the post crucifixion live appearing of Jesus. But most Christians in my family and social network would accept that resurrection in the biological sense likely did not happen. Apparently, many Dutch laymen and students of Christian religion, believe that the resurrection is a metaphor expressing the strength of the bond between Jesus and his disciples and friends, inducing experiences of his followers as if Jesus appeared to them alive. For many modern Christians such an explanation would not diminish the value of the new testament, only increase it, because it takes away the strain of difficult to dispute scientific ideas about live and death.

One seriously Christian friend of mine explained this contradiction as believing in resurrection with your heart, while an other part of you knows that factually it didn't happen in the literal sense. For her, this contradiction only increases the intensity of her Christianity, while leaving undisputed her understanding about the physical world. I think that, at least in modern Europe, this is, also amongst Christians, a very common view of the resurrection. So I think the article could include a line or two about different views taken by different Christians about how literally the resurrection happened.

Before reverting any of these properly sourced edits, please first explain how any of them do not meet the requirements in [[WP:RS]]. And, regardless of his own POV (as if the writers of the Bible and the other religious sources in the references do not have a POV), he was an evangelical minister for 19 years with a degree in theology.

RE: Further opinions: I think Harizotoh9 is correct on both counts: 1. Barker is not a scholar, and his work is not WP:RS. I had never heard of him until now, but it seems that maybe he can play the piano, but a scholar he is not. One would be lowering the standards of Wikipedia by using him. 2. There are far better sources than him. e.g. Bart Ehrman as stated above

Now, regarding the general statement that the Resurrection is not a &quot;historical event&quot;, what is the big deal? The article starts by saying that it is a &quot;Christian belief&quot;. In general &quot;supernatural claims&quot; be they the Resurrection of Jesus in the New Testament or the resurrection of a widow's dead son (1 Kings 17:17–24) by Elijah in the Hebrew Bible are not considered &quot;historical&quot; in a secular encyclopedia. They are to be presented as teachings and religious beliefs, not events. This is unlike episodes such as the Baptism of Jesus (excluding the dove, etc.) which are considered historical by scholars (via correlation with other sources), regardless of any belief in the divinity of Jesus, or his teachings, etc. So Barker brings nothing new to the party except a lowering of standards.

==WP:LEAD==
Airborne, I saw that you added some material to the lede. Per [[WP:LEAD]] the lede should summarize the article in a way that represents the contents, not the other way around. I did not do a knee jerk revert on your addition, but it ''certainly'' does not sit well there and needs to be modified. As is, you have modified the lede to be a debate about the historicity of the resurrection, while the article is about the explanation of the Christian belief, not a debate on its historicity. 

You should move that down to a historicity section below and leave a sentence about it in the lede, not let the lede be dominated by a historicity debate - which is not the subject of the article. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 01:54, 19 November 2011 (UTC)

:I agree that the historicity of the event is not the main theme in the article. However, it is one aspect of the topic. Hopefully we can come to a reasonable consensus about what the right amount of weight is for this aspect. I certainly do not plan to try to overpower the article with skepticism. I'd just like to add another aspect of this topic which interests me and may interest some others. 
:It might well turn out that that lede paragraph is too long. Perhaps we could give it some time. I'll work for a bit on the section below and if it turns out it needs to be cut down, that's no problem at all. Thanks. --[[User:Airborne84|Airborne84]] ([[User talk:Airborne84|talk]]) 02:40, 19 November 2011 (UTC)
::By the way, I'd suggest that the rest of the lede is a bit sparse. If the article were to be nominated as a Featured Article, I think the reviewers might ask for a fuller summary of the article in the other lede paragraphs. In that light, the final paragraph might just be more fully developed right now. --[[User:Airborne84|Airborne84]] ([[User talk:Airborne84|talk]]) 02:43, 19 November 2011 (UTC)
::If the other editors are agreeable, I'd be happy to help develop the rest of the lede to better summarize the entire article. --[[User:Airborne84|Airborne84]] ([[User talk:Airborne84|talk]]) 02:45, 19 November 2011 (UTC)

:::I have been trying not to work on this article. But I guess it needs to get fixed anyway. The lede is not representative of the text as is, partly because there are so many small changes in &quot;drive by edits&quot;. The section &quot;resurrection skepticism&quot; should probably be called Historicity and should include the scholarly &quot;it is not true&quot; arguments. Those arguments are generally [[flogging a dead horse]] anyway, because most scholars do not consider the resurrection as historically provable - but a subject of &quot;Christian teachings&quot;. There is not a single non-Christian document that refers to the Resurrection. So again, I do not know what the big deal is. But EarlyChristianWritings.com etc. is not [[WP:RS]]. The serious non-believing scholars are people like Vermes, etc. Richard Carrier is a small time player and says nothing new compared to Vermes and Froedricksen who are also non-believers, but far more respected. They are the ones to get quoted, not the colloquial web sites. But they all say the same thing anyway: there is no historical record to prove it: it is a religious belief. But the scholars should be used rather than the others.

:::Let us do this: please develop that section with non-believing scholars such as Vermes, Sanders and Freidriksen and in a day or so I will think of what the rest of the lede should look like. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 03:49, 19 November 2011 (UTC)
::::Unfortunately, until I get more sources, I have to bake the cake with what I have on hand, so to speak. In the case of the EarlyChristianWritings.com founder, his essay is in a work with editorial oversight by [[Robert M. Price]], a noted scholar in this area, and it isn't self-published. In this case, the book it is in is a reliable source. 
::::I have no issue with calling the section Historicity if you prefer though.
::::The rest of what you say is true. However, I can tell that you have a far greater grasp of the historicity discussions than the average Wikipedia reader will. Since most scholars don't consider the resurrection as historically provable, as you rightly note, that's a worthy addition to an encyclopedia article on the topic. Readers then will come to know what you already know by reading the article. 
::::Thanks for the notes on the other scholarly sources though. I appreciate it. I'll hold off on making further additions until I get some of their works. It may take me some time. --[[User:Airborne84|Airborne84]] ([[User talk:Airborne84|talk]]) 04:28, 19 November 2011 (UTC)

:::::Ok, let us do that. In parallel, I will think of how to make further fixes. The point is that the lack of historicity is a &quot;generally accepted&quot; scholarly element. However, the views of people like Richard Carrier are just not noteworthy. Price is slightly better than Carrier  but generally a myth theory advocate not a top level biblical scholar like Fredriksen etc. who also doubt the resurrection. And Carrier has absolutely no sources to prove what he says. He just ''hypothesizes'' that somethings may have happened in a certain way, without any historical records to support his theory. So the two sides of that debate have ''exactly'', ''exactly'' the same number of historical records: zero. That should be pointed out and is a simple issue that most readers can understand.

==Separate article on the long historicity discussion==
As material started to get added to the historicity section, two things happened:

:* It clearly overlapped with the origin of the narrative accounts text that was in the article already. These could not be in two separate sections because they discuss the same issues.

:* The length of the historicity discussions overwhelmed the rest of the text, directly resulting in a [[WP:UNDUE]] issue, in that in an article that is about the &quot;Christian beliefs and teachings&quot; as its first sentence states historicity can not dominate the page.

I had to consolidate the related material and made a separate page with a Main. I kept the size of the summary of that here to the same size as the artistic depictions material that is about one screen worth of info.

Wikipedia policies permit the development of a dissertation on the &quot;historicity of the resurrection&quot; but [[WP:UNDUE]] does prohibit such a dissertation from overwhelming the main topic of the article. When I wrote the &quot;Resurrection in art&quot; article, I did not include all that material in this page, because it would run against WP:UNDUE. Just as the artistic issues about the Resurrection have a page of their own and a Main so should the historicity discussions. And the size of these Main summaries should be roughly the same, given that there is a separate article that includes the information. An article on a given topic can not include a separate dissertation on a peripheral issue, and a Main must be used.

As a general point, the discussion of ''any'' religious teaching (be it Christianity, Judaism or Islam) can not be overwhelmed by a separate discussion of its denial for that would effectively stop Wikipedia from providing an account of the the religious teachings. For instance, a discussion of many Old Testament accounts about angels passing over, etc. can not be overwhelmed by a long discussion on the existence of angels and their historicity. The Biblical accounts need to be presented in an encyclopedic form, as religious teachings, as this article states at the top. Then a pointer to a Main about the historicity issues needs to be there because those are also encyclopedic topics. However, the main focus of the article which is the &quot;teachings&quot; should remain as such.

In writing the summary of the historicity, I deliberately included Vermes, Sanders, Dunn and Koester and excluded Price, because Price is really a 3rd rate player at best, unlike Koester who also doubts the resurrection, but is a respected scholar. As stated above, material about those who doubt the Resurrection should come from the likes of Vermes and Koester who are serious scholars. I think in the Main page about the historicity of the Resurrection the material from Price should be replaced by material from the likes of Koester, to increase the quality of that page.

:I will say that just because the first sentence says this article is about the Christian teachings of the resurrection, does not mean that this article has to be defined in that way. It's also possible for editors here to decide that the article's topic will simply be about the &quot;resurrection of Jesus&quot;, as broadly defined in the title. Modifying the first sentence is easy. 
:However, what you did seems reasonable to me at this time. --[[User:Airborne84|Airborne84]] ([[User talk:Airborne84|talk]]) 11:26, 7 December 2011 (UTC)

::Ok, fine. There is, however, a need for some article that presents and defines basic religious teachings in any religion, say [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] as a fundamental element in Buddhism, which is a [[WP:Notable]] topic. Given [[WP:RS]] sources, one can write an article on how Pratītyasamutpāda may or may not be invalidated by the principles of [[Causality (physics)]] or how it may interact with the [[Bose–Einstein correlations]] but those are discussions about the relationship between the religious teachings and other, in this case scientific, arguments. There may be a section in the Pratītyasamutpāda article about &quot;Causality and Buddhism&quot;, with a Main link to the article that discusses scientific causality and Buddhist teachings. There is none there, however, and it is not up to me to write that. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 12:37, 7 December 2011 (UTC)

== this qoute ==

&quot;The majority consensus among biblical scholars is that the genre of the Gospels is a kind of ancient biography and not myth&quot; What does those sentence have to do with the resurrection? Its talking about the gosepls in general. [[Special:Contributions/75.133.90.25|75.133.90.25]] ([[User talk:75.133.90.25|talk]]) 18:17, 27 May 2012 (UTC)

:The section where that statement is found is not dealing with resurrection per se, but: &quot;Historicity and origin of the narrative&quot;. The statement appears to be properly sourced and it fits that context. (Perhaps the editor who first added the statement would explain further?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;[[User:Telpardec|—Telpardec]] [[User talk:Telpardec|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;color:#ff6;background:#090;border:3px double;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;TALK&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:20, 28 May 2012 (UTC)

::I did not add that, but I agree that it can fit, and maybe should be rworked a little to fit better. Perhaps you can just touch it up. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 05:12, 28 May 2012 (UTC)</text>
