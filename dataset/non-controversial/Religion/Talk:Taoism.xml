__TOC__

== Quasi-Scientific??? ==

In the intro section of the article it claims that Taoism is quasi-scientific.  Then there is nothing below about quasi-science.  The term quasi-scientific sounds biased to begin with, and I recommend removing it.  It doesn't seem like I can edit that first section.[[Special:Contributions/69.255.44.231|69.255.44.231]] ([[User talk:69.255.44.231|talk]]) 16:04, 26 July 2011 (UTC)

Wing Chun and Bak mei are not daoist styles.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.23.239.130|108.23.239.130]] ([[User talk:108.23.239.130|talk]]) 06:45, 8 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

In the section about &quot;Relations with other religions and philosophies&quot; the citations of ''Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. &amp; Knitter, Paul. Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)'' don't match the passages which are cited. They have vague similarities, but i was hoping for more details on the specifics given in the wiki article, and I couldn't even find those specifics there in the book.  It matches what my professor said in class, but there we are.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Leostaley|Leostaley]] ([[User talk:Leostaley|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Leostaley|contribs]]) 04:44, 7 April 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Tao Te Ching interpretations==
This passage in the Tao Te Ching section:&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;A common interpretation of thi to [[Korzybski]]'s observation &quot;[[Map/territory relation|the map is not the territory]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett (2006), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;, One view states that the paradoxical opening is intended to prepare the reader for teachings about the unteachable Tao.&lt;ref&gt;Kim (2003), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Tao is believed to be [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], indistinct and without form. Hence, it cannot be named or categorized. Even the word &quot;Tao&quot; can be considered a dangerous temptation to make ''Tao'' a limiting &quot;name&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn &amp; LaFargue (1998), pp. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
seems somewhat confused to me (Chinglish?). Even more importantly, I don't think it's a good idea to go into detail about interpretations of certain sentences of the Tao Te Ching - obviously, that'd be a bottomless pit. Thus, I deleted the whole passage. If you disagree, please feel free to translate it into good English and re-insert it. Cheers, --[[User:Mallexikon|Mallexikon]] ([[User talk:Mallexikon|talk]]) 07:30, 29 May 2012 (UTC)

==Pinyin vs Wade-Giles: modern?==
I reinstated &quot;Taoism (modernly: Daoism) is a philosophical and religious tradition...&quot; I'm fine with the article (currently) favoring Wade-Giles over Pinyin (eventually and peacefully, it's all gonna change to Pinyin anyway. Cf. &quot;[[Peking]]&quot;). However, [[Wade-Giles]] was developed in the 19th century, while [[Pinyin]] was developed in the 50s. So I'm afraid the Wade-Giles proponents will have to live with the fact of Pinyin being more modern. Cheers, --[[User:Mallexikon|Mallexikon]] ([[User talk:Mallexikon|talk]]) 01:59, 14 June 2012 (UTC)
:Totally agree. Google Ngrams [http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Daoism%2CTaoism&amp;year_start=1980&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=0 here] shows how usage is converging. [[User:Oncenawhile|Oncenawhile]] ([[User talk:Oncenawhile|talk]]) 22:34, 22 July 2012 (UTC)

== Categorization ==

FFS... Please change the Categorization section back to the 3 (philosophical, religion &amp; folk religion). That is as close as you have ever gotten &amp; likely ever going to get. They have traditionally being very intertwine... you don't get to arbitrarily disqualify or uncategorised the folk religion out of it. Has anyone bothered to go into a temple &amp; tell the folks that half of their deities got &quot;disqualify&quot;? Taoism is very diverse &amp; ineffable... You think you are ever going to get academic precision? This is one of the topic that the more precise you try to be... the least correct you are likely to become.

[[User:Bio-capsule|Bio-capsule]] ([[User talk:Bio-capsule|talk]]) 10:49, 6 August 2012 (UTC)

:Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean. Could you clarify? --[[User:Mallexikon|Mallexikon]] ([[User talk:Mallexikon|talk]]) 01:32, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

::The categorization section had been at least for quite sometime divide into 3 categories: 1) Philosophical Taoism 2) Religious Taoism 3) Chinese Folk Religion. Now the chinese folk religion is just exclude on the ground of &quot;outside of the tenets and core teachings of Taoism&quot;. The thing is the 3 categories have being so intertwine for so long that it makes no different. For example: under 'Taoism in singapore' article it state that they are mainly associated with the Zhen Yi school, but such specifics tend not to concern the temple followers. Most of the temples are as much Taoism as it is Chinese Folk Religions &amp; the people see themselves as practising Taoist. There is no dispute within Taoist community about that... 

::The current article as it stand make is as if the folk religion part can be disregard... that's just not right. I understand Wikipedia's requirement for academic accuracy but if it had to be just categorize it as philosophical &amp; religious only, the chinese folk religion should be at least a sub-category of Religious Taoism. [[User:Bio-capsule|Bio-capsule]] ([[User talk:Bio-capsule|talk]]) 16:52, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

:::Well, I honor your experience, however, my own experience with the Taoist community is completely different. Then again, it doesn't really matter what experiences you and I have made - since wikipedia is all about [[WP:Verifiability|verifiability]], an article's information has to be supported by [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable sources]]. So if you are in possession of some of those, please feel free to change the &quot;Categorization&quot; section's content accordingly. Cheers, --[[User:Mallexikon|Mallexikon]] ([[User talk:Mallexikon|talk]]) 04:37, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

::::When you mean your own experience, do you mean the people practising Chinese Folk Religion don't considered themselves Taoist anymore?? In any case inserting personal experience is not what I meant. Even under section &quot;Adherents&quot; &amp; &quot;Rituals&quot;, what is listed within is as much religious Taoism as it is folk religion &amp; at least acknowledge it cannot be clearly define &amp; separate (Same goes for articles on some of the deities &amp; immortals). The earlier versions list 3 categories... yet now it's only 2 so clearly someone feel the need to took deliberate action to disassociate Chinese Folk Religion. Is it on behalf of 20 - 400 million people? The remaining part of the section is vague at best &amp; yes I do intend to check out Isabelle Robinet's Taoism: Growth of a Religion, which most of the citation on that part came from.

::::I am not so much questioning reliability of the sources, I am questioning that someone just cited a few selected line from a sources &amp; took liberty with a particular narrative. Did the book actually disavow the connection to Chinese Folk Religion as a whole? It may be by accident but in any case it is obscene... I would think that Wikipedia is not about redefining other people's religion for them. [[User:Bio-capsule|Bio-capsule]] ([[User talk:Bio-capsule|talk]]) 15:23, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

:::::No, I don't mean that people practising Chinese Folk religion don't consider themselves Daoist anymore - I mean that professional Daoists (i.e., Daoist scholars, priests, and nuns) go at great lengths to emphasize that Daoism is different from Folk religion. And this is what Robinet (a scholar who put much more time and energy into researching Daoism than you and me) is saying as well. Nobody took liberties here. The information in the article is backed up by reliable sources. This is what we are supposed to do at wikipedia. --[[User:Mallexikon|Mallexikon]] ([[User talk:Mallexikon|talk]]) 03:03, 9 August 2012 (UTC)

could i link my article here as it is mentioned once in the text of this article? - the texts section here navigable thru the table of contents has other texts: &quot;Other texts
See also: Mozi
While the Tao Te Ching is most famous, there are many other important texts in traditional Taoism including Mohism. Taishang Ganying Pian (&quot;Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Retribution&quot;) discusses sin and ethics, and has become a popular morality tract in the last few centuries.[96] It asserts that those in harmony with Tao will live long and fruitful lives. The wicked, and their descendants, will suffer and have shortened lives.[86]&quot;              - my article is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise_On_the_Response_of_the_Tao i.e. the tai shang yingpian...     does anyone object?
it is currently orphan article.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Nathanielfirst|Nathanielfirst]] ([[User talk:Nathanielfirst|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nathanielfirst|contribs]]) 20:37, 21 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
