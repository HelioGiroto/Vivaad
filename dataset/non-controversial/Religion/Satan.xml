'''Satan''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''הַשָּׂטָן''' ''ha-Satan'', &quot;the opposer&quot;,&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;&quot;Satan&quot; under Bible Dictionary result. Dictionary.com.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the supreme evil spirit and adversary to God and humanity, particularly in [[Abrahamic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology |page=347|first= David Adams |last=Leeming |year=2005 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 978-0-19-515669-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the title of various entities, both human and divine, who challenge the faith of humans in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Wray, Gregory Mobley ''The birth of Satan.: tracing the devil's biblical roots'' 2005 specifically ch.2 ''Unsystematic theology – the nature of God in the Hebrew Bible'' ch.3 ''The Devil is in the details – Satan in the Hebrew Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Christianity]], the title became a personal name, and &quot;Satan&quot; changed from an accuser appointed by God to test men's faith to the chief of the rebellious [[fallen angel]]s (&quot;the [[devil]]&quot; in Christianity, &quot;[[Shaitan]]&quot; in Arabic, the term used by [[Arab]] Christians and Muslims).&lt;ref&gt;Scott (1999); Kelly (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, a shayṭān is any evil creature, whether human, animal or [[Jinn|spirit]]. With the definite article, ''the'' Shayṭān is [[Iblis]], the Devil.

==Hebrew Bible==
The original [[Hebrew]] term, ''satan'', is a noun from a verb meaning primarily to, “obstruct, oppose,” as it is found in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22:22, [[1 Samuel]] 29:4, [[Psalms]] 109:6.&lt;ref&gt;ed. [[George Arthur Buttrick|Buttrick, George Arthur]]; ‘’The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible, An illustrated Encyclopedia’’&lt;/ref&gt; Ha-Satan is traditionally translated as “the accuser,” or “the adversary.” The definite article “ha-”, [[English language|English]] “the”, is used to show that this is a title bestowed on a being, versus the name of a being. Thus this being would be referred to as “the satan”.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, James L. ‘’Harper Collins Study Bible’’ (NRSV)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ha-Satan'' with the [[definite article]] occurs 13 times in the [[Masoretic Text]], in two books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:
* [[Book of Job|Job]] ch.1–2 (10x),&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Hooks – 2007 &quot;As in Zechariah 3:1–2 the term here carries the definite article (has'satan=&quot;the satan&quot;) and functions not as a ... the only place in the [[Hebrew Bible]] where the term &quot;Satan&quot; is unquestionably used as a proper name is [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles 21:1]]. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 3:1–2 (3x).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Coogan, Michael D.; ‘’A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context’’&lt;/ref&gt;

''Satan'' without the definite article is used in 10 instances, of which two are translated ''diabolos'' in the Septuagint and &quot;Satan&quot; in the [[King James Bible|King James Version]]:
* 1 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 21:1, &quot;Satan stood up against [[Israel]]&quot; (KJV) or &quot;And there standeth up an adversary against Israel&quot; ([[Young's Literal Translation]])&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Adelman ''The Return of the Repressed: Pirqe De-Rabbi Eliezer'' p65 &quot;However, in the parallel versions of the story in Chronicles, it is Satan (without the definite article),&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psalm 109:6b &quot;and let Satan stand at his right hand&quot; (KJV)&lt;ref&gt;Septuagint 108:6 κατάστησον ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἁμαρτωλόν καὶ διάβολος στήτω ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;let an accuser stand at his right hand.&quot; ([[English Standard Version|ESV]], etc.)

The other eight instances of ''satan'' without the definite article are traditionally translated (in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]] and English) as &quot;an adversary&quot;, etc., and taken to be humans or obedient angels:
* [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22:22,32 &quot;and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.&quot;
* 32 &quot;behold, I went out to withstand thee,&quot;
* 1 [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 29:4 The Philistines say: &quot;lest he [David] be an adversary against us&quot;
* 2 Samuel 19:22 [[King David|David]] says: &quot;[you sons of Zeruaiah] should this day be adversaries (plural) unto me?&quot;
* 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 5:4 [[King Solomon|Solomon]] writes to [[Hiram I|Hiram]]: &quot;there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
* 1 Kings 11:14 &quot;And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, [[Hadad the Edomite]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth R. Brand Adam and Eve p88 – 2005 &quot;Later, however, King Hadad 1 Kings 11:14) and King Rezon (verses 23, ... Numbers 22:22, 23 does not use the definite article but identifies the angel of YHWH as &quot;a satan.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 Kings 11:23 &quot;And God stirred him up an adversary, [[Rezon the son of Eliadah]]&quot;
* 25 &quot;And he [Rezon] was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon&quot;

===Book of Job===
In the ''[[Book of Job]]'', ha-Satan is a member of the [[Divine Council]], &quot;[[sons of God|the sons of God]]&quot; who are subservient to God. Ha-Satan, in this capacity, is many times translated as &quot;the prosecutor&quot;, and is charged by God to tempt humans and to report back to God all who go against His decrees. At the beginning of the book, [[Job (Bible)|Job]] is a good person &quot;who feared God and turned away from evil&quot; (Job 1:1), and has therefore been rewarded by God. When the Divine Council meets, God informs ha-Satan about Job's blameless, morally upright character. Between Job 1:9–10 and 2:4–5, ha-Satan merely points out that God has given Job everything that a man could want, so of course Job would be loyal to God; if all Job has been given, even his health, were to be taken away from him, however, his faith would collapse. God therefore grants ha-Satan the chance to test Job.&lt;ref&gt;''HarperCollins Study Bible'' (NRSV)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, it has been interpreted that ha-Satan is under God's control and cannot act without God's permission. This is further shown in the epilogue of Job in which God is speaking to Job, ha-Satan is absent from these dialogues. &quot;For Job, for [Job's] friends, and for the narrator, it is ultimately [[Yahweh]] himself who is responsible for Job's suffering; as Yahweh says to the 'satan', 'You have incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason.'&quot; (Job 2:3) &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Septuagint]] the Hebrew ''ha-Satan'' in Job and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] is translated by the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''diabolos'' (slanderer), the same word in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] from which the English word [[devil]] is derived. Where ''satan'' is used of human enemies in the [[Hebrew Bible]], such as [[Hadad the Edomite]] and [[Rezon the Syrian]], the word is left untranslated but transliterated in the Greek as ''satan'', a [[neologism]] in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly ''Satan: a biography'' 2006 &quot;However, for Hadad and Rezon they left the Hebrew term untranslated and simply said ''satan''.. in the three passages in which a supra-Human satan appears: namely, Numbers, Job, Zechariah&lt;/ref&gt; In Zechariah 3 this changes the vision of the conflict over [[Joshua the High Priest]] in the Septuagint into a conflict between &quot;[[Jesus]] and the devil&quot;, identical with the Greek text of [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]].

==Apocrypha==
The [[Book of Enoch]] contains references to [[Satariel]], thought also to be [[Sataniel]] and [[Satanel|Satan'el]] (etymology dating back to [[Babylonian]] origins). The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]], [[Uriel]] and [[Gabriel]], previous to the [[Fallen angel|fall from Heaven]].

The [[2 Enoch|Second Book of Enoch]], also called the ''Slavonic Book of Enoch'', contains references to a [[Watcher (angel)|Watcher]] (Grigori) called Satanael.&lt;ref&gt;[[2 Enoch]] 18:3. On this tradition, see A. Orlov, &quot;The Watchers of Satanael: The Fallen Angels Traditions in 2 (Slavonic) Enoch,&quot; in: A. Orlov, ''Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology'' (Albany: SUNY, 2011)85-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[pseudepigraphic]] text of an uncertain date and unknown authorship. The text describes Satanael as being the prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And I threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless&quot; - [[2 Enoch]] 29:4&lt;/ref&gt; and an evil spirit who knew the difference between what was &quot;righteous&quot; and &quot;sinful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The devil is the evil spirit of the lower places, as a fugitive he made Sotona from the heavens as his name was Satanail, thus he became different from the angels, but his nature did not change his intelligence as far as his understanding of righteous and sinful things&quot; – [[2 Enoch]] 31:4&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story is found in the book of [[1 Enoch]]; however, in that book, the leader of the Grigori is called [[Samyaza|Semjâzâ]].

In the [[Book of Wisdom]], the devil is represented as the being who brought death into the world.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world&quot; - Book of Wisdom II. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ascension of Isaiah]] and the [[Life of Adam and Eve]], Satan rules over a host of angels.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Martyrdom of Isaiah]]'', 2:2; ''[[Vita Adæ et Evæ]]'', 16)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mastema]], in the [[Book of Jubilees]], induces God to test [[Abraham]] through the sacrifice of [[Isaac]]. He is identical to Satan in both name and nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Jubilees]], xvii. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology===
Satan as a &quot;deceiver&quot; parallels to the evil spirit in [[Zoroastrianism]], known as the Lie, who directs forces of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winn|first=Shan M.M.|title=Heaven, heroes, and happiness : the Indo-European roots of Western ideology.|year=1995|publisher=University press of America|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0819198609|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==

===Judaism===
In [[Judaism]], Satan is a term used since its earliest biblical contexts, to refer to a ''human opponent''.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the [[Jewish exegesis]] of 1 Samuel 29:4 and 1 Kings 5:18 - [http://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA651&amp;lpg=PA651&amp;dq=Berlin+Grossman%22misinterpretation+of+is%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d8F76bcDpU&amp;sig=NjFhmaLG71fErwgVMcTV0rT-gDI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yvwEUMupK8fs2QXJ17yaBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Berlin%20Grossman%22misinterpretation%20of%20is%22&amp;f=false Oxford dictionary of the Jewish religion, 2011, p.651]&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the term has been used to suggest ''evil influence'' opposing human beings, as in the [[Jewish exegesis]] of 1 Kings 22:22. Thus, Satan is personified as a character in three different places of the [[Tenakh]], serving as an accuser (Zechariah 3:1-2), a seducer (1 Chronicles 21:1), or as a heavenly persecutor who is &quot;among the sons of God&quot; (Job 2:1). In any case, Satan is always subordinate to the power of God, having a role in the divine plan. Satan is rarely mentioned in [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford,651&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Berlin|first=editor in chief, Adele|title=The Oxford dictionary of the Jewish religion|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0199730040|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA651&amp;lpg=PA651&amp;dq=Berlin+Grossman%22misinterpretation+of+is%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d8F76bcDpU&amp;sig=NjFhmaLG71fErwgVMcTV0rT-gDI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yvwEUMupK8fs2QXJ17yaBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Berlin%20Grossman%22misinterpretation%20of%20is%22&amp;f=false|edition=2nd ed.|page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Enochic Judaism, the concept of Satan being an opponent of God and a chief evil figure in among demons, seems to have taken root in Jewish [[pseudepigrapha]] during the [[Second Temple]] period,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson,2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=David R.|title=Enochic Judaism|year=2004|publisher=T&amp;T Clark International|location=London|isbn=0826470890|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the ''apocalypses''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford,651&quot;/&gt; In [[Medieval Judaism]], the Rabbis rejected these Enochic literary works into the [[Biblical canon]], making every attempt to root them out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson,2&quot;/&gt; Traditionalists and philosophers in medieval Judaism, adhered to [[rational theology]], rejecting any belief in rebel or fallen angels, and viewing [[evil]] as abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bamberger|first=Bernard J.|title=Fallen angels : soldiers of satan's realm|year=2006|publisher=Jewish Publ. Soc. of America|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=0827607970|edition=1. paperback ed.|page=148,149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hasidic Judaism]], the [[Kabbalah]] presents Satan as an agent of God whose function is to tempt one into [[sin]], then turn around and accuse the sinner on high. 

The [[Hasidic Judaism|Chasidic Jews]] of the 18th century, associated ha-Satan with ''Baal Davar''.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Angels&quot; by Gustav Davidson, © 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

{{Main|Christian teaching about the Devil}}
{{See also|War in Heaven}}

In Christianity, terms that are synonymous with &quot;Satan&quot; include:
* The most common [[English language|English]] synonym for &quot;Satan&quot; is &quot;[[Devil]]&quot;, which descends from [[Middle English]] ''devel'', from [[Old English]] ''dēofol'', that in turn represents an early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] borrowing of [[Latin]] ''diabolus'' (also the source of &quot;diabolical&quot;). This in turn was borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''diabolos'' &quot;[[slander]]er&quot;, from ''diaballein'' &quot;to slander&quot;: ''dia-'' &quot;across, through&quot; + ''ballein'' &quot;to hurl&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/D0179400.html| title=American Heritage Dictionary: Devil| accessdate=2006-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], &quot;Satan&quot; occurs more than 30 times in passages alongside ''Diabolos'' (Greek for &quot;the devil&quot;), referring to the same person or thing as Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Beelzebub]], meaning &quot;Lord of Flies&quot;, is the contemptuous name given in the Hebrew Bible and [[New Testament]] to a [[Philistine]] god whose original name has been reconstructed as most probably &quot;Ba'al Zabul&quot;, meaning &quot;Baal the Prince&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dictionary+of+deities+and+demons+in+the+bible&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFuwiVr__w&amp;sig=dgryS2h8rvfnVFSI1tdAHwDWl50&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mP09TdbpGcPBcYit3IUH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Baalzebub&amp;f=false K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst, ''Baalzebub'', &quot;Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible&quot;, p.155]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Satan is traditionally identified as the [[serpent (Bible)|serpent]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]]; thus, Satan has often been depicted as a serpent.
* The [[Book of Revelation]] twice refers to &quot;the [[dragon]], that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan,&quot; (12:9, 20:2). The Book of Revelation also refers to &quot;the deceiver,&quot; from which is derived the common epithet &quot;the great deceiver.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/bjohnson/hg1/PNT27-20.HTM|title= The Revelation of John. Chapter XX. The Millennium. |author= B. W. Johnson|date= [1891]|work= The People's New Testament|publisher= [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]|accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other terms identified with Satan include &quot;the prince of this world&quot; in the [[Book of John]] 12:31, 14:30; &quot;the prince of the power of the air&quot; also called Meririm, and &quot;the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience&quot; in the [[Book of Ephesians]] 2:2; and &quot;the god of this world&quot; in [[2 Corinthians]] 4:4.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the fourth Century [[Lucifer]] is sometimes used in Christian theology to refer to Satan, as a result of identifying the fallen &quot;son of the dawn&quot; of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:12 with the &quot;accuser&quot; of other passages in the Old Testament.
[[File:DVinfernoLuciferKingOfHell m.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Satan as depicted in [[Cocytus|the Ninth Circle of Hell]] in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'', illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]].]]
In traditional Christian understanding of the holy Hebrew scriptures, the [[Torah]], Satan is a synonym for the [[Devil]]. For most Christians, he is believed to be an [[angel]] who rebelled against God—and also the one who spoke through the [[serpent (Bible)|serpent]] and seduced Eve into disobeying God's command. His ultimate goal is to lead people away from the love of God—to lead them to fallacies which God opposes. Satan is also identified as the accuser of [[Book of Job|Job]], the tempter in the [[Gospels]], the secret power of lawlessness in {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:7}}, and the dragon in the [[Book of Revelation]]. Before his insurrection, Satan was among the highest of all angels and the &quot;[[Lucifer|brightest in the sky]]&quot;. His pride is considered a reason why he would not bow to God as all other angels did, but sought to rule heaven himself. The popularly held beliefs that Satan was once a prideful angel who eventually rebels against God, however, are not portrayed explicitly in the Bible and are mostly based on inference (e.g., [[Ezekiel]] 28 and [[Isaiah]] 14:12–17). In mainstream Christianity he is called &quot;the ruler of the demons&quot; ([[Book of Matthew|Matt.]] 12:24), &quot;the ruler of the world&quot; and &quot;the god of this world&quot;. (2 Cor. 4:4). The Book of Revelation describes how Satan will be cast out of Heaven, down to the earth, having &quot;great anger&quot; and waging war against &quot;those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of [[Jesus]]&quot;. Ultimately, Satan is thrown into the &quot;[[Lake of fire]]&quot;, not as ruler, but as one among many, being tormented day and night forever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Revelation|20:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the [[Devil in Christianity#Christadelphians|Christadelphians]]) the word &quot;satan&quot; in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any &quot;adversary&quot; and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/devil.htm |title=Do you Believe in a Devil? |accessdate=2007-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Devil (Islam)}}
'''Shaitan''' (شيطان) is the equivalent of Satan in [[Islam]]. While ''Shaitan'' (شيطان, from the root {{unicode|šṭn شط⁬ن}}) is an [[adjective]] (meaning &quot;astray&quot; or &quot;distant&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;devil&quot;) that can be applied to both [[man]] (&quot;al-ins&quot;, الإنس) and [[Genie|Jinn]], [[Iblis]] ({{IPA-ar|ˈibliːs}}) is the personal name of the Devil who is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]ic account of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/i/iblis.html Iblis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Qur'an, [[Iblis]] (the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name used) disobeyed an order from [[Allah]] to bow to Adam and as a result was forced out of heaven and given respite until the [[day of judgment]] from further punishment.

When Allah commanded all of the angels to bow down before Adam (the first Human), Iblis, full of [[hubris]] and jealousy, refused to obey God's command (he could do so because he had [[free will]]), seeing Adam as being inferior in creation due to his being created from clay as compared to him (created of fire).&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|17|61}}; {{quran-usc|2|34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam, and they prostrate; not so Iblis (Lucifer); He refused to be of those who prostrate.&quot;
:(Allah) said: &quot;What prevented thee from prostrating when I commanded thee?&quot; He said: &quot;I am better than he: Thou didst create me from fire, and him from clay.
::Qur'an 7:11–12}}

It was after this that the title of &quot;[[Shaitan]]&quot; was given, which can be roughly translated as &quot;Enemy,&quot; &quot;Rebel,&quot; &quot;Evil&quot; or &quot;Devil&quot;. Shaitan then claims that if the punishment for his act of disobedience is to be delayed until the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]], that he will divert many of Adam's own descendants from the straight path during his period of respite.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|17|62}}&lt;/ref&gt; God accepts the claims of Iblis and guarantees recompense to Iblis and his followers in the form of Hellfire. In order to test mankind and jinn alike, Allah allowed Iblis to roam the earth to attempt to convert others away from his path.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|17|63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to earth along with [[Adam and Eve]], after eventually luring them into eating the fruit from the forbidden tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|7|20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yazidism===
An alternate name for the main deity in the tentatively [[Indo-European]] pantheon of the [[Yazidi]], [[Malek Taus]], is Shaitan.&lt;ref&gt;Drower, E.S. The Peacock Angel. Being Some Account of Votaries of a Secret Cult and their Sanctuaries. London: John Murray, 1941. [http://www.avesta.org/yezidi/peacock.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than Satanic, however, Yazidism is better understood as a remnant of a pre-Islamic [[Middle East]]ern [[Indo-European]] religion, and/or a [[ghulat]] [[Sufi]] movement founded by [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir|Shaykh Adi]]. The connection with Satan, originally made by Muslim outsiders, attracted the interest of 19th century [[Europe]]an travelers and esoteric writers.

===Bahá'í Faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], ''Satan'' is not regarded as an independent evil power as he is in some faiths, but signifies the ''lower nature'' of humans. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] explains: &quot;This lower nature in man is symbolized as Satan — the evil ego within us, not an evil personality outside.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=ʻAbduʾl-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |origyear=1912 |year=1982 |title=The Promulgation of Universal Peace|publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA|isbn=0-87743-172-8 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-97.html| pages= 294–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Psmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2000 | title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith | publisher = Oneworld | place = Oxford, UK | isbn=1-85168-184-1 | pages = 135–136, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other evil spirits described in various faith traditions such as [[fallen angel]]s, demons and jinns are also metaphors for the base character traits a human being may acquire and manifest when he turns away from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Psmith112&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=0-521-86251-5 | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satanism===
{{Main|Satanism}}

Satanic groups have various opinions about Satan, ranging from the conviction that he exists and ought to be worshipped ([[theistic Satanism]]), to [[Anton Szandor LaVey]]'s symbolic interpretation, which emphasizes individual will and pleasure-seeking.

Much &quot;Satanic&quot; lore does not originate from actual Satanists, but from Christians. Best-known is the [[medieval]] folklore and theology surrounding [[demons]] and [[witches]]. A more recent example is the so-called [[Satanic ritual abuse]] scare of the 1980s — beginning with the memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' — which depicts Satanism as a vast (and unproven) [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] of elites with a predilection for [[child abuse]] and [[human sacrifice]]. This genre regularly describes Satan as actually appearing in person in order to receive worship.
