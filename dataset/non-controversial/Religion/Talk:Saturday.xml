==Brown Town?==
Why exactly does 'Brown Town' redirect to Saturday? [[User:Nikandros|Nikandros]] ([[User talk:Nikandros|talk]]) 20:06, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

It's from a Tim and Eric skit. When giving a nonsensical adress, containing the word saturday, he frequently says &quot;saturday aka brown town&quot;; highly esoteric, should probably redirect somewhere else. I didn't make it direct here, though. Just found it by chance  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/199.245.163.1|199.245.163.1]] ([[User talk:199.245.163.1|talk]]) 18:30, 22 April 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Saturn picture==
How about the picture of &quot;Saturn&quot; is not Saturn at all, but his father Kronos.
Kronos is the father of Saturn, Neptune, and Jupiter. These are his three children that lived, the rest were eaten by Kronos.
KRONOS, not Saturn.

----
i'm going to have to agree with you

----
But,[[Saturn]] is [[Chronos]]. Saturn is the Roman form of Chronos.[[User:Dlmccaslin|Dlmccaslin]] 02:09, 10 July 2006 (UTC)



so, saturday is not just the sabbath, but the day of rest for vampires? coincidence? i've been told before that antisemitism is intertwined in vampire folktales. this is just more supporting evidence for that theory.

== NPOV dispute [Day of Worship] ==

The section does not meet with NPOV standards because it merely states that something which is in dispute amongst millions, if not billions, is a fact that can't be argued. It uses Exodus Chapter 20 Verse 8-11 as its proof, yet those verse say nothing about what day is to be considered the Sabbath other than it being the seventh day. Currently, and thoughout history, the seventh day has been considered different by different people, so while Saturday could be the Sabbath according to traditional American calendars, it could just as easily be Sunday, or even Wednesday, according to what someone actually believes to be the seventh day of the week. I suggest that the section just be removed, as it doesn't add anything to the article other than a biased point of view, and the previous section goes into greater detail regarding the dispute of the day in a neutral way.

Looks like that's no problem. It states in the text itself that the Jews use Saturday as their sabbath, that's good enough. [[User:Dlmccaslin|Dlmccaslin]] 03:11, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

Just noting for someone better qualified than me to fix... The article says that both Saturday and Sunday come from Roman mythology. But the article on Sunday doesn't really say that... It looks more like Germanic too (Sonnetag). That corresponds with the Roman Solis, but... So do all the other days of the week. So should this article say that only Saturday came from Roman mythology? Thanks.--[[User:65.95.79.131|65.95.79.131]] 20:40, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

The article states &quot;Saturday and Sunday are the only days of the week in which the English names come from Roman mythology. The English names of all of the other days of the week come from Germanic mythology.&quot;

But in the wiki-page for Sunday, it clearly says the name for sunday is derived from the german goddess Sunne.

I totally agree.  The discussion of Saturday should only be connected to Judaism in controversy because it is an ongoing controversy for the lay person, but for the studied, (Rabbi, Theologist, Historian, etc.) there is no arguement that Saturday has nothing to do with the Sabbath.  The Jewish Torah and Holy Bible both state clearly that it is a holy day that occurs 7 days after the Crescent New Moon.

The only ones who connect the Sabbath to Saturday are those who haven't studied the details and history.  People come to Wikipedia to get the truth apart from urban legends.  

If Saturday is to be connected to religion it should be done in a section titled &quot;Religious Controversies About Saturday&quot; and that's just me being open-minded because Jews have been handling the Sabbath for over 4,000 yrs before they ever knew about Saturday or anything remotely correlated to Saturnus.

The Yom Shaboat really shouldn't be anywhere in this discussion because it's an irrelevant holy day from a completely different culture that was only combined by people who didn't know history or religion.  If it is added is should be as a result of people seeking clarity over Saturday worship such as the Seventh-Day Adventist who believe that Saturday is the mark of Yahweh and Sunday is the mark of the devil even though studies on the diety Yahweh shows that Yahweh would become wrathful with Israel whenever they even considered another god like Saturnus.  The correlation is not historical, biblical or cultural, it's erroneous, but for the sake of arguement I believe if it must stay in it should be put in a section over controversies so people studying through Wikipedia will see the entire picture and both sides of the arguement and be informed enough to make their own decision.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:RSmith1982|RSmith1982]] ([[User talk:RSmith1982|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/RSmith1982|contribs]]) 18:30, 6 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Thank you for registering and giving us your thoughts. See [[WP:NPOV]] about how we handle conflicting points of view (POVs) in scholarly literature about our content. As you probably know, virtually all Jews celebrate ''Shabbat'' on the seventh day of each week, starting at sunset; the fact that this overlaps most of &quot;Saturday&quot; is merely brought in as a conventional way of speaking (WP follows traditional idioms even if they have connotations questioned by small groups), but I hope I corrected the implication by providing a bit of additional text. The POV that ''Shabbat'' was originally lunar-based (i.e., the seventh day from the new moon, and presumably the fourteenth and so on) is described well at [[Shabbat#Origin theories]], as well as the contrary POV that ''Shabbat'' was originally mathematically tied to every seventh day without breaks, and the discrediting of the tie to [[Saturn (planet)]] is covered there too. Hope this helps, and please feel free to continue contributing whenever you have information. [[User:John J. Bulten/Friends|JJB]] 18:43, 6 October 2010 (UTC)

== Saturday songs ==

I am strongly inclined to delete the section [[Saturday#Saturday songs |Saturday songs]] as it has very little encyclopaedic merit.

== Why not Saturn the planet picture? ==

If this article is true, then Saturday was named for the planet and its supposed astrological impact, not for the god Saturn which is pictured, so why not include both pictures of the planet and that illustration, but put the picture of the planet first?[[Special:Contributions/66.41.68.239|66.41.68.239]] ([[User talk:66.41.68.239|talk]]) 02:40, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

I guess you have a point, but of course the planet Saturn remained associated with the deity (while the image of the planet with the ring is an entirely modern meme, in antiquity, the planet was just a dot of light that slowly moved among the background stars). --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(𒁳)]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:23, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

== Saturn == was named after a god who seized divine kingship for his father

== ISO 8601 &amp; non-adherance  ==

hey guys, i live in saudi arabia. the weekend here is thursday and friday, not saturday and sunday. not to mention people do not call the days the same way... same in greek really, where the name of the weeks reflect their order (main, second, third, fourth fifth, &quot;Παρασκευή&quot; (preperation day - for the sabbath). so i think the article should be re-written from an anglosaxon/latin perspective. [[User:Project2501a|Project2501a]] ([[User talk:Project2501a|talk]]) 13:19, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

:I reverted your recent edits for discussion. The article is written from a linguistic point of view, not a cultural point of view. That is, Sunday in Arabic is يوم الأحد (yaum al-aḥad), which literally means the first day [of the week]. See [[week-day names]]. Furthermore, the week is independent of the calendar used. Indeed, the Jews began the numbered seven day week over 500 years years before the Julian calendar was invented. The seven-day week did not reach Rome until a few decades after the Julian calendar was invented. For most purposes, the Gregorian calendar has replaced the Julian calendar. — [[User:Joe Kress|Joe Kress]] ([[User talk:Joe Kress|talk]]) 15:55, 1 December 2010 (UTC)
