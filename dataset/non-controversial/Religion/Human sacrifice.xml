'''Human sacrifice''' is the act of killing one or more human beings as part of a [[religious ritual]] (''ritual killing''). Its typology closely parallels the various practices of [[ritual slaughter]] of [[animal sacrifice|animals]] and of religious [[sacrifice]] in general. Human sacrifice has been practised in various [[culture]]s throughout history. Victims were typically [[ritually]] killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease [[deity|gods]], [[spiritual being|spirits]] or the deceased, for example as a [[propitiatory]] offering, or as a retainer sacrifice when the King's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life. Closely related practices found in some [[tribal societies]] are [[cannibalism]] and [[headhunting]]. By the [[Iron Age]], with the associated developments in religion (the [[Axial Age]]), human sacrifice was becoming less common throughout the [[Old World]], and came to be looked down upon as [[barbaric]] in pre-modern times ([[Classical Antiquity]]). [[Blood libel]] is a false charge of ritual killing.

[[Capital punishment]] has been described by an advocate as a 'thinly disguised manifestation of the ritualized killing of people'.&lt;ref name=&quot;harding&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Roberta M. Harding |title= Capital Punishment As Human Sacrifice: A Societal Ritual As Depicted In George Eliot's Adam Bede |url= https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=48+Buffalo+L.+Rev.+175&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=fc1c8ad931e6b6c7a6cbb0ef06360202 |journal= Buffalo Law Review |volume= 48 |page= 175 |date= Winter 2000 |accessdate= 2011-07-24 |quote= [T]he past and present practice of capital punishment includes a thinly disguised manifestation of the ritualized killing of people, otherwise known as human sacrifice. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Execution by burning|Death by burning]] historically has aspects of both human sacrifice ([[Wicker Man]], [[Tophet]]) and capital punishment ([[Brazen bull]], ''[[tunica molesta]]''). [[Capital punishment debate|Detractors of the death penalty]] may consider all forms of capital punishment as secular variants of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;So [[Benjamin Rush]] (1792), see Louis P. Masur ''Rites of Execution'' Oxford University Press (1989), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[lynching]], [[pogrom]]s and [[genocide]]s are sometimes interpreted as human sacrifice following [[Theodor W. Adorno]].&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, M., Adorno T.W. (1947), Dialektik der Aufklärung. Philosophische Fragmente, Amsterdam: Querido; p. 199ff. Hughes (2007) in reference to the [[Holocaust]] writes, &quot;the great exterminations of the twentieth century [...] have superseded human sacrifice as the ultimate touchstones of barbarity. When we require place names to denote the horror where culture collapses, we no longer think of [[Iphigeneia|Aulis or Taurica]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, even the practice of animal sacrifice has virtually disappeared from all major religions (or has been re-cast in terms of ritual slaughter), and human sacrifice has become extremely rare. Most religions condemn the practice, and present-day [[secular]] laws treat it as [[murder]]. In a society which condemns human sacrifice, the term '''ritual murder''' is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4098172.stm |title=Boys 'used for human sacrifice' |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-06-16 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415502.stm |title=Kenyan arrests for 'witch' deaths |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], the immolation of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre, continued well into the 19th century, but is now [[Sati (practice)#Current incidence|very rare]].

==Evolution and context==
{{Further|Origin of religion|Magical thinking|Anthropology of religion|Homo Necans|The Golden Bough|Life-death-rebirth deity|Crucifixion of Jesus}}

The idea of human sacrifice has its roots in deep prehistory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/070611_human_sacrifice.html |title=Early Europeans Practiced Human Sacrifice |publisher= Livescience.com |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the evolution of [[behavioral modernity|human behaviour]]. Mythologically, it is closely connected, or even fundamentally identical with animal sacrifice. [[Walter Burkert]] has argued for such a fundamental identity of animal and human sacrifice in the connection of a [[hunting hypothesis]] which traces the emergence of human religious behaviour to the beginning of [[behavioural modernity]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (roughly 50,000 years ago).

[[File:Ashanti Yam Ceremony 1817.jpg|thumb|The [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]] yam festival, early 19th century]]
Human sacrifice has been practised on a number of different occasions and in many different cultures. The various rationales behind human sacrifice are the same that motivate religious sacrifice in general. Human sacrifice is intended to bring good fortune and to pacify the gods, for example in the context of the dedication of a completed building like a temple or bridge. There is a Chinese legend that there are thousands of people entombed in the [[Great Wall of China]]. In ancient Japan, legends talk about ''hitobashira'' (&quot;human pillar&quot;), in which maidens were [[premature burial|buried alive]] at the base or near some constructions to protect the buildings against disasters or enemy attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.japanfile.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HistoryofJapaneseCastles&amp;back=CastleSection |title=History of Japanese Castles |publisher=Japanfile.com |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of [[Tenochtitlan]] in 1487, the [[Aztecs]] reported that they killed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. According to [[Ross Hassig]], author of ''Aztec Warfare'', &quot;between 10,000 and 80,400 persons&quot; were sacrificed in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross (2003). &quot;El sacrificio y las guerras floridas&quot;. [[Arqueología mexicana]], p. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sacrifice can also have the intention of winning the gods' favour in warfare. In Homeric legend, [[Iphigeneia]] was to be sacrificed by her father [[Agamemnon]] for success in the [[Trojan War]]. According to the [[Bible]], [[Jephthah]] vowed to sacrifice the first creature to come out of his house to meet him if he won the battle against the [[Ammonites]]. Judges 11:30-31; &quot;And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of [[Ammon]] into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.&quot; Ironically his daughter was the first to come out and meet him. Judges 11:34; &quot;And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.&quot; 

In some notions of an [[afterlife]], the deceased will benefit from victims killed at his funeral. [[Mongols]], [[Scythians]], early [[Egypt]]ians and various [[Mesoamerica]]n chiefs could take most of their household, including servants and [[concubine]]s, with them to the next world. This is sometimes called a &quot;[[retainer sacrifice]]&quot;, as the leader's retainers would be sacrificed along with their master, so that they could continue to serve him in the afterlife.

[[File:Arago – 'Supplice Sandwich'.jpg|thumb|[[Hawaii]]an sacrifice, from [[Jacques Arago]]'s account of [[Louis de Freycinet|Freycinet]]'s travels around the world from 1817 to 1820.]]
Another purpose is [[divination]] from the body parts of the victim. According to [[Strabo]], [[Celt]]s stabbed a victim with a sword and divined the future from his death spasms.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Strabo Geography&quot;, Book IV Chapter 4:5, published in Vol. II of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1923.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4D*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Headhunting]] is the practice of taking the head of a killed adversary, for ceremonial or magical purposes, or for reasons of prestige. It was found in many pre-modern [[tribal societies]].

Human sacrifice may be a ritual practised in a stable society, and may even be conductive to enhance societal bonds (see [[Sociology of religion]]), both by creating a [[human bonding|bond]] unifying the sacrificing community, and in combining human sacrifice and [[capital punishment]], by removing individuals that have a negative effect on societal stability (criminals, religious heretics, foreign slaves or prisoners of war). But outside of [[civil religion]], human sacrifice may also result in outbursts of &quot;blood frenzy&quot; and [[mass murder|mass killings]] that destabilise society. Thus, the [[Thuggee]] cult that plagued [[India]] was devoted to [[Kali]], the goddess of death and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/thug-the-true-story-of-indias-murderous-cult-by-mike-dash-497902.html Thug: the true story of India's murderous cult by Mike Dash], The Independent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstatv.htm#Thagi |title=Thuggee (Thagi) (13th C. to ca. 1838) |publisher =Users.erols.com |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' the Thuggee cult was responsible for approximately 2 million deaths. The bursts of capital punishment during [[European witch-hunts]], or during the French Revolutionary [[Reign of Terror]] show similar sociological patterns (see also [[Moral panic]]).

Many cultures show traces of prehistoric human sacrifice in their mythologies and religious texts, but ceased the practice before the onset of historical records. The story of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham and Isaac]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22) is an example of an [[Etiology|etiological myth]] explaining the abolition of human sacrifice. Similarly, the Vedic ''[[Purushamedha]]'' (literally &quot;human sacrifice&quot;) is already a purely symbolic act in its earliest attestation. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], human sacrifice in [[Ancient Rome]] was abolished by a senatorial decree in 97 [[BCE]], although by this time the practice had already become so rare that the decree was mostly a symbolic act. Human sacrifice once abolished is typically replaced by either animal sacrifice, or by the &quot;mock-sacrifice&quot; of [[effigy|effigies]], such as the [[Argei]] in ancient Rome.

==History by region==

===Ancient Near East===
{{Further|Religions of the Ancient Near East|Minoan religion#Possibility of human sacrifice}}

====Ancient Egypt====
There may be evidence of retainer sacrifice in the early dynastic period at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], when on the death of a King he would be accompanied with servants, and possibly high officials, who would continue to serve him in eternal life. The skeletons that were found had no obvious signs of trauma, leading to speculation that the giving up of life to serve the King may have been a voluntary act, possibly carried out in a drug induced state. At about 2800 BCE any possible evidence of such practices disappeared, though echoes are perhaps to be seen in the burial of statues of servants in [[Old Kingdom]] tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jacques Kinnaer |url=http://www.ancient-egypt.org/index.html |title=&quot;Human Sacrifice&quot;, retrieved 12 May 2007 |publisher=Ancient-egypt.org |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Abydos – Life and Death at the Dawning of Egyptian Civilization&quot;, National Geographic, April 2005, retrieved 12 May 2007.[http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0504/feature7/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesopotamia====
Retainer sacrifice was practised within the royal tombs of ancient Mesopotamia. Courtiers, guards, musicians, handmaidens and grooms died, presumed to have taken poison.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Practice of Human Sacrifice&quot;, Mike Parker-Pearson, 2002-08-19, BBC [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/human_sacrifice_03.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acrobats Last Tumble&quot;, Bruce Bower, Science News, Vol 174 #1, July 8, 2008 [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/32999/title/Acrobats_last_tumble]&lt;/ref&gt; A new examination of skulls from the royal cemetery at Ur, discovered in Iraq almost a century ago, appears to support a more grisly interpretation of human sacrifices associated with elite burials in ancient Mesopotamia than had previously been recognized, say archaeologists. Palace attendants, as part of royal mortuary ritual, were not dosed with poison to meet death serenely. Instead, a sharp instrument such as a pike was driven into their heads.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ritual Deaths at Ur Were Anything but Serene&quot;, John Noble Wilford, 2009-10-26 NYTIMES [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27ur.html?_r=4]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Levant====
{{Further|Binding of Isaac}}
References in the [[Bible]] point to an awareness of human sacrifice in the history of ancient near-eastern practice. During a battle with the Israelites the king of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (''olah'', as used of the Temple sacrifice) (2 Kings 3:27).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Why King Mesha of Moab Sacrificed His Oldest Son&quot;, Baruch Margalit, Biblical Archaeology Review, Nov/Dec 1986.[http://members.bib-arch.org/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http://www.basarchive.org/bswbSearch.asp=3fPubID=3dBSBA&amp;Volume=3d12&amp;Issue=3d6&amp;ArticleID=3d5&amp;UserID=3d0&amp;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22 as well as the Qur'an, there is a story about [[binding of Isaac|Abraham's binding of Isaac]], although in the Qur'an the name of the son is not mentioned and assumed to be [[Ishmael|Ismail]]. In the Bible's version of the story, [[God]] tests [[Abraham]] by asking him to present his son, [[Isaac]], as a sacrifice on [[Moriah|Mount Moriah]]. No reason is given within the text. Abraham agrees to this command without arguing. The story ends with an [[angel]] stopping Abraham at the last minute and making Isaac's sacrifice unnecessary by providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead. Many Bible scholars have suggested this story's origin was a remembrance of an era when human sacrifice was abolished in favour of animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Child Sacrifice: Returning God's Gift&quot;, [[Susan Ackerman]], [[Biblical Archaeology Review]], June 1993.[http://members.bib-arch.org/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http://www.basarchive.org/bswbSearch.asp=3fPubID=3dBSBR&amp;Volume=3d9&amp;Issue=3d3&amp;ArticleID=3d9&amp;UserID=3d0&amp;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Child Sacrifice at Carthage—Religious Rite or Population Control?&quot;, Lawrence E. Stager and Samuel R. Wolff, Biblical Archaeology Review, Jan/Feb 1984.[http://members.bib-arch.org/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http://www.basarchive.org/bswbSearch.asp=3fPubID=3dBSBA&amp;Volume=3d10&amp;Issue=3d1&amp;ArticleID=3d2&amp;UserID=3d0&amp;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of human sacrifice mentioned in the Bible is the sacrifice of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet him at the door when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in Judges 11:31 as &quot;''Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.''&quot; When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him. She begs for, and is granted, &quot;two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends&quot;, after which &quot;he [Jephthah] did to her as he had vowed.&quot; According to the [[meforshim|commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition]], Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radak-MD&quot;&gt;[[David Kimhi|Radak]], [[Book of Judges]] 11:39; ''Metzudas Dovid'' ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phoenicia====
According to Roman and Greek sources, [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] sacrificed infants to their gods. The bones of numerous infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites in modern times but the subject of [[child sacrifice]] is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05146/510878.stm |title=Carthage tries to live down image as site of infanticide |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2005-05-26 |accessdate=2010-05-25 | first=Andrew | last=Higgins}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a single child cemetery called the Tophet by archaeologists, an estimated 20,000 urns were deposited.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/01/science/relics-of-carthage-show-brutality-amid-the-good-life.html?pagewanted=all Relics of Carthage Show Brutality Amid the Good Life]&quot;. The New York Times. September 1, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] (ca. 46–120 CE) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Philo]]. [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. The Bible asserts that children were sacrificed at a place called the [[Tophet]] (&quot;roasting place&quot;) to the god [[Moloch]]. According to Diodorus Siculus' [[Bibliotheca historica|account]] of the [[Carthaginians]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Salisbury&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|publisher= Routledge |page=228 |last=Salisbury |first=Joyce E. |title=Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire.}}

Plutarch, however claims that the children were already dead at the time, having been killed by their parents, whose consent—as well as that of the children—was required; Tertullian explains the acquiescence of the children as a product of their youthful trustfulness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salisbury&quot;/&gt;

The accuracy of such stories is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Fantar, M’Hamed Hassine. Archaeology Odyssey Nov/Dec 2000, pp. 28–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Neolithic Europe====
{{Further|Neolithic religion}}
There is archaeological evidence of human sacrifice in [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] to [[Eneolithic]] Europe. Retainer sacrifices seem to have been common in early [[Indo-European religion]]. For example, the [[Luhansk sacrificial site]] shows evidence of human sacrifice in the [[Yamna culture]].

====Greco-Roman antiquity====
{{Further|Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Roman religion}}
Allusions to human sacrifice are found in classical mythology. The ''[[deus ex machina]]'' salvation in some versions of [[Iphigeneia]] (who was about to be sacrificed by her father [[Agamemnon]]) and her replacement with a deer by the goddess [[Artemis]], may be a vestigial memory of the abandonment and discrediting of the practice of human sacrifice among the Greeks in favour of animal sacrifice. Many scholars have suggested a possible analogy with the story of [[Isaac]]'s attempted sacrifice by his father [[Abraham]] in the Bible, which was also stopped at the last minute (though it had first been encouraged) by divine intervention.

The Romans practised various forms of human sacrifice; from [[Etruscans]] (or, according to other sources, [[Sabellians]]), they adopted the original form of [[gladiator]]ial combat where the victim was slain in a ritual battle. During the early [[Roman Republic|republic]], criminals who had broken their oaths or defrauded others were sometimes &quot;given to the gods&quot; (that is, executed as a human sacrifice). The ''[[Rex Nemorensis]]'' was an escaped [[slave]] who became priest of the goddess [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] at [[Nemi]] by killing his predecessor. [[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of war]] were buried alive as offerings to [[Manes]] and ''[[di inferi]]'' (gods of the underworld). [[Archaeologist]]s have found sacrificial victims buried in building foundations. Ordinarily, deceased Romans were [[cremation|cremated]] rather than buried. Captured enemy leaders, after the victorious general's [[Roman triumph|triumph]], would be ritually strangled in front of a statue of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the war god. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html#38.2 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, i.19, 38]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a sacrifice of [[Argei (dolls)|Argei]] in the [[Vesta (mythology)|Vestal]] ritual that might have originally included sacrifice of old men. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], human sacrifice was formally banned during the [[Roman consul|consulship]] of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives|Publius Licinius Crassus]] and [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus (consul 97 BC)|Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus]] in 97 BCE, although by this time it was so rare that the decree was largely symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 30.3.12&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rituals turned to [[animal sacrifice]] like ''[[taurobolium]]'' or became merely symbolic. A Roman general might bury a statue of his likeness to thank the gods for victory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} However, activities with a ritual origin and similarities to human sacrifice, such as the gladiatorial games and some forms of execution, continued for many years, and grew in popularity.

====Celts====
[[File:WickerManIllustration.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A [[wicker man]], that, according to Caesar, was used to sacrifice humans to the gods.]]

Victims meant for [[Esus]] were [[hanging|hanged]], those meant for [[Taranis]] [[wikt:immolate|immolated]] and those for [[Teutates]] drowned. Some, like the [[Lindow Man]], may have gone to their deaths willingly.

Archaeological evidence from the [[British Isles]] seems to indicate that human sacrifice may have been practised, over times long pre-dating any contact with Rome. Human remains have been found at the foundations of structures from the Neolithic time to the Roman era, with injuries and in positions that argue for their being foundation sacrifices.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Skeletons belonging to as many as 150 people and dating back to about the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest were discovered in [[Alveston]], England.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/090320-druids-sacrifice-cannibalism_2.html Druids Committed Human Sacrifice, Cannibalism?]&quot;.

Ritualised decapitation survives in the archaeological record such as the example of 12 headless corpses at the French late [[Iron Age]] sanctuary of [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]].&lt;ref&gt;French archaeologist Jean-Louis Brunaux has written extensively on human sacrifice and the sanctuaries of [[Belgic Gaul]]. See &quot;Gallic Blood Rites,&quot; Archaeology 54 (March/April 2001), 54–57; ''Les sanctuaires celtiques et leurs rapports avec le monde mediterranéean'', Actes de colloque de St-Riquier (8 au 11 novembre 1990) organisés par la Direction des Antiquités de Picardie et l'UMR 126 du [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]] (Paris: Éditions Errance, 1991); &quot;La mort du guerrier celte.

====Germanic peoples====
{{Further|Germanic paganism|bog body}}

Human sacrifice was not a particularly common occurrence among the Germanic peoples, being resorted to in exceptional situations arising from crises of an environmental (crop failure, drought, famine) or social (war) nature, often thought to derive at least in part from the failure of the king to establish and/or maintain prosperity and peace (''árs ok friðar'') in the lands entrusted to him.&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz, Peter (1993). &quot;Pagan Scandinavian Religion&quot; in Pulsiano, P (Ed.) ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia&quot;. New York: Routledge. pp. 521–525.&lt;/ref&gt; In later Scandinavian practice, human sacrifice appears to have become more institutionalised, and was repeated as part of a larger sacrifice on a periodic basis (according to Adam of Bremen every nine years).&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf (2003). ''Religion und Mythologie der Germanen''. Wissenshaftliche Buchgesellschaft: Darmstadt. pp. 58–64. ISBN 3-8062-1821-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] practices of human sacrifice predating the [[Viking Age]] depend on archaeology and on a few scattered accounts in [[Greco-Roman ethnography]]. For example, [[Tacitus]] reports Germanic human sacrifice to (what he [[interpretatio romana|interprets]] as) [[Germanic Mercury|Mercury]], and to [[Isis]] specifically among the [[Suebians]]. [[Jordanes]] reports how the [[Goths]] sacrificed prisoners of war to [[Teiwaz|Mars]], suspending the severed arms of the victims from the branches of trees.

By the 10th century, Germanic paganism had become restricted to [[Norse paganism|Scandinavia]]. One account by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] as part of his account of an [[embassy]] to the [[Volga Bulgars]] in 921 claims that [[Norse funeral|Norse warriors]] were sometimes buried with enslaved women with the belief that these women would become their wives in [[Valhalla]]. In his description of the funeral of a [[Scandinavia]]n [[tribal chief|chieftain]], a slave volunteers to die with a Norseman. After ten days of festivities, she is stabbed to death by an old woman, a sort of priestess who is referred to as [[Völva]] or &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, and [[Ship burial|burnt together with the deceased in his boat]]. This practice is evidenced archaeologically, with many male warrior burials (such as the ship burial at Balladoole on the Isle of Man, or that at Oseberg in Norway&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba59/feat4.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;) also containing female remains with signs of trauma.

According to [[Adémar de Chabannes]], just before his death in 932 or 933 [[Rollo]] (founder and first ruler of the Viking [[Duchy of Normandy|principality of Normandy]]) practised human sacrifices to appease the pagan gods, and at the same time made gifts to the churches in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;François Neveux, ''A brief history of the Normans: the conquests that changed the face of Europe'', Robinson, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam von Bremen]] recorded human sacrifices to [[Odin]] in 11th-century Sweden, at the [[Temple at Uppsala]], a tradition which is confirmed by ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' and the [[Norse saga]]s. According to the [[Ynglinga saga]], king [[Domalde]] was sacrificed there in the hope of bringing greater future harvests and the total domination of all future wars. The same saga also relates that Domalde's descendant king [[Aun]] sacrificed nine of his own sons to Odin in exchange for longer life, until the Swedes stopped him from sacrificing his last son, [[Ongentheow|Egil]].

[[Heidrek]] in the [[Hervarar saga]] agrees to the sacrifice of his son in exchange for the command over a fourth of the men of [[Reidgotaland]]. With these, he seizes the entire kingdom and prevents the sacrifice of his son, dedicating those fallen in his rebellion to Odin instead.

According to the 12th century Russian [[Primary Chronicle]], prisoners of war were sacrificed to the supreme Slavic deity [[Perun]]. Sacrifices to pagan gods, along with paganism itself, were banned after the [[Baptism of Rus]] by Prince [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir I]] in the 980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] are known to have made sacrifices of young men and women to [[Water deity#Chinese_mythology|river deities]], and to have buried [[Slavery in China|slaves]] alive with their owners upon death as part of a [[funeral]] service. This was especially prevalent during the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] Dynasties. During the [[Warring States]] period, [[Ximen Bao]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] demonstrated to the villagers that sacrifice to river deities was actually a ploy by crooked priests to pocket money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26349.htm |title=Ximen Bao |publisher= Chinaculture.org |date=2003-09-24 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese lore, Ximen Bao is regarded as a folk hero who pointed out the absurdity of human sacrifice.

The sacrifice of a high-ranking male's slaves, [[concubine]]s or servants upon his death (called ''Xun Zang'' 殉葬 or ''Sheng Xun'' 生殉) was a more common form. The stated purpose was to provide companionship for the dead in the afterlife. In earlier times the victims were either killed or buried alive, while later they were usually forced to commit suicide.

Funeral human sacrifice was widely practiced in the ancient Chinese [[state of Qin]].  According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]], the practice was started by [[Duke Wu of Qin|Duke Wu]], the tenth ruler of Qin, who had 66 people buried with him in 678 BC.  The fourteenth ruler [[Duke Mu of Qin|Duke Mu]] had 177 people buried with him in 621 BC, including three senior government officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiji&quot;&gt;{{cite web

After the abolition by Duke Xian, funeral human sacrifice became relatively rare throughout the central parts of China. However, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]] revived it in 1395 when his second son died and two of the prince's concubines were sacrificed. In 1464, the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] in his will forbade the practice for Ming emperors and princes.

Human sacrifice was also practised by the [[Manchus]]. Following [[Nurhaci]]'s death, his wife, [[Lady Abahai]], and his two lesser consorts committed suicide. During the [[Qing Dynasty]], sacrifice of slaves was banned by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in 1673.

===Tibet===
Human sacrifice, including [[cannibalism]], was thought practiced in [[Tibet]] prior to the arrival of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhism]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[L. Austine Waddell]], ''Tibetan Buddhism: With Its Mystic Cults, Symbolism and Mythology, and in Its Relation to Indian Buddhism'', 1895,  p. 516:
&quot;Human sacrifice seems undoubtedly to have been regularly practised in Tibet up till the dawn there of Buddhism in the seventh century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of human sacrifice in medieval Buddhist Tibet is less clear. The [[Lamaism|Lamas]], as professing Buddhists, could not condone blood sacrifices, and they replaced the human victims with effigies made from dough. This replacement of human victims with effigies is attributed to [[Padmasambhava]], a Tibetan saint of the mid-8th century, in Tibetan tradition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Nevertheless, there is some evidence that outside of lamaism, there were practices of [[tantra|tantric]] human sacrifice which survived throughout the medieval period, and possibly into modern times.
The 15th-century [[Blue Annals]], a seminal document of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], reports upon how in Tibet the so-called &quot;18 robber-monks&quot; slaughtered men and women for their [[tantra|tantric]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Annals, ed.{{By whom|date=February 2011}} 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;697.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such practices of human sacrifice as there was in medieval Tibet was mostly replaced by animal sacrifice, or the self-infliction of wounds in religious ritual, by the 20th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. A systematic survey of evidence for human sacrifice in 20th-century Tibet turns up three instances:
#a British traveller in 1915 was told that in previous times, babies had been sacrificed at a [[Gyantse]] monastery.
#[[Charles Alfred Bell]] reports the finding of the remains of an eight-year-old boy and a girl of the same age in a stupa on the Bhutan-Tibet border, apparently ritually killed.&lt;ref&gt;Bell,{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} 1927, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt;
#American anthropologist Robert Ekvall in the 1950s reported some instances of human sacrifice in remote areas of the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekvall,{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} 1964, pp.&amp;nbsp;165–166, 169, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on this evidence, Grunfeld (1996) concludes that it cannot be ruled out that isolated instances of human sacrifice did survive in remote areas of Tibet until the mid-20th century, but they must have been rare enough to have left no more traces than the evidence cited above.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATG 29&quot;&gt;[[A. Tom Grunfeld]], ''The making of modern Tibet'', 1996, ISBN 978-1-56324-714-9, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[File:Camunda5.JPG|thumb|Fierce goddesses like [[Chamunda]] are recorded to have been offered human sacrifice.]]
{{See also|Sati (practice)}}
The earliest evidence for human sacrifice in the Indian subcontinent dates back to the Bronze Age [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. An Indus seal from [[Harappa]] depicts the upside-down nude female figure with legs outspread and a plant issuing from the womb. The reverse side of the seal depicts a man holding a sickle and a woman seated on the ground in a posture of prayer. Many scholars interpret this scene as a human sacrifice in honor of the Mother-Goddess.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prakash&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Prakash, Om|title=Cultural History of India|pages=89|isbn=81-224-1587-3|publisher=New Age International (P) Limited Publishers|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Singh, Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India|pages=173|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|publisher=accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruthi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pruthi, Raj|title=Prehistory and Harappan Civilization|pages=164|isbn=81-7648-581-0|publisher=Kul Bhushan Nangia A.P.H Publishing Corporation|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rao, B.

Regarding possible [[Vedic]] mention of human sacrifice, the prevailing 19th-century view, associated above all with [[Henry Colebrooke]], was that human sacrifice had little scriptural warrant, and did not actually take place. Those verses which referred to ''[[purushamedha]]'' were meant to be read symbolically&lt;ref name=&quot;VD&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kooij, K.R. van; Houben, Jan E.M. |title=Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalization of violence in South Asian cultural history |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1999 |pages=117, 123, 129, 164, 212, 269 |isbn=90-04-11344-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a &quot;priestly fantasy&quot;. However, [[Rajendralal Mitra]] published a defence of the thesis that human sacrifice, as had been practised in [[Bengal]], was a continuation of traditions dating back to Vedic periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bremmer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Bremmer, J.N.| title=The Strange World of Human Sacrifice| publisher=Peeters Akademik| location=Leuven| year=2007| page=159| isbn=90-429-1843-8| oclc=| doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Oldenberg]] held to Colebrooke's view; but [[Jan Gonda]] underlined its disputed status.

Human and animal sacrifice became less common during the post-Vedic period, as ''ahimsa'' (non-violence) became part of mainstream religious thought. This may correspond to the impact of Sramanic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism.  The Chandogya Upanishad (3.17.4) includes ahimsa in its list of virtues.&lt;ref name=&quot;VD&quot;/&gt;

It was agreed even by Colebrooke, however, that by the [[Puranic]] period—at least at the time of the writing of the [[Kalika-Purana]], human sacrifice was accepted. The Kalika Purana was composed in Northeast India in the 11th century. The text states that blood sacrifice is only permitted when the country is in danger and war is expected. According to the text, the performer of a sacrifice will obtain victory over his enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;VD&quot;/&gt; In the medieval period, it became increasingly common. In the 7th century, [[Banabhatta]], in a description of the dedication of a temple of [[Chandi]]ka, describes a series of human sacrifices; similarly, in the 9th century, [[Haribhadra (Seng-ge Bzang-po)|Haribhadra]] describes the sacrifices to Chandika in [[Orissa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NC&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hastings, James (ed.) |authorlink=James Hastings |title=[[Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics]], vol 9. |publisher=Kessenger Publishing |year=2003 |pages=15, 119 |isbn=0-7661-3680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was &quot;more common&quot; in [[South India]]. The town of [[Kuknur]] in North Karnataka there exists an ancient [[Kali]] temple, built around the 8-9th century AD, which has a history of human sacrifices.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC&quot;/&gt;

Human sacrifices were carried out in connection with the worship of [[Shakti]] until approximately the early modern period, and in [[Bengal]] perhaps as late as the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipner&quot;/&gt; Although not accepted by larger section of [[Hindu culture]], certain [[tantra|tantric]] cults performed human sacrifice until around the same time, both actual and symbolic; it was a highly ritualised act, and on occasion took many months to complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipner&quot;&gt;

[[File:Thugs Strangling Traveller.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A group of [[Thuggee]]s strangling a traveller on a highway in India in the early 19th century.]]
Verse 19 of the Karpuradistotram (Hymn to [[Kali]]) lists humans as one of the species that are acceptable for sacrifice to the goddess. However, in 1922, Sir John George Woodroffe published a commentary on the Karpuradistotram by the Kaula commentator Swami Vimalananda. In it, he writes that the sacrificial animals listed in verse 19 are merely symbols for the [[Arishadvargas|six enemies]], with &quot;man&quot; representing pride. He also states that the age of material sacrifice had long since passed away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/htk/htk03.htm Hymn to Kali: Preface]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thuggee]]s, tuggees or thugs, were a religious [[cult]] devoted to Kali and an organized gang of professional [[assassins]] who traveled in groups across [[India]] for several hundred years. They were first mentioned in the Ẓiyāʾ-ud-Dīn Baranī ({{lang-en|History of Fīrūz Shāh}}) dated around 1356.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/594263/thug&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1830s they were targeted by [[Lord William Bentinck|William Bentinck]], along with his chief captain [[William Henry Sleeman]], for eradication.  They were seemingly destroyed by this effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;cult&quot;&gt;http://www.mahavidya.ca/hindu-sects/the-thuggee-cult/&lt;/ref&gt; Thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence.  This would allow them to then surprise and strangle them by tossing a handkerchief or noose around their necks. The killings were performed in honour of the goddess [[Kali]] and were very ritualistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;cult&quot; /&gt;  They would then rob the bodies of valuables and bury them.  This led them to also be called '''Phansigar''' ({{lang-en|using a [[noose]]}}), a term more commonly used in southern India.&lt;ref name=&quot;RussellLai1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.V.

The [[Khonds]], an [[Adivasi|aboriginal tribe]] of India, inhabiting the tributary states of [[Orissa]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], became notorious, on the British occupation of their district about 1835, from the prevalence and cruelty of the human sacrifices they practised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/KHA_KRI/KHONDS_or_KANDHS.html Khonds, or Kandhs], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deori people|Deori community]] has a notable culture and tradition which is a hidden treasure for the sociologists. The Deoris represent the class “priest”-a section of the whole Chutia community (now in Assam, India). In the first two decades of the 13th century, before the arrival of the [[Ahom people|Ahom]], Deoris used to make a Narbali (human sacrifice) in terms to win the war, battle and to prevent the villagers from the evil atmosphere like floods, drought etc. This practice make them pure owing to satisfy the supreme Goddess. Only the class of Patorganya people were eligible for sacrificing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deori.in&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture}}
[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141 cropped).jpg|thumb|225px|right|Aztec sacrifices, [[Codex Mendoza]].]]
The [[Aztec]]s were particularly noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale; an offering to [[Huitzilopochtli]] would be made to restore the blood he lost, as the sun was engaged in a daily battle. Human sacrifices would prevent the end of the world that could happen on each cycle of 52 years. In the 1487 re-consecration of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] some estimate that 80,400 prisoners were sacrificed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/sacrifice.htm |title=The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice |publisher=Latinamericanstudies.org |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdis.missouri.edu/exec/data/courses2/2065/lesson01.htm |title=Science and Anthropology |publisher=Cdis.missouri.edu |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; though numbers are difficult to quantify as all obtainable Aztec texts were destroyed by Christian missionaries during the period 1528–1548.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;George Holtker, &quot;Studies in Comparative Religion&quot;, The Religions of Mexico and Peru, Vol. 1, CTS&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ross Hassig]], author of ''Aztec Warfare'', &quot;between 10,000 and 80,400 people&quot; were sacrificed in the ceremony. The old reports of numbers sacrificed for special feasts have been described as &quot;unbelievably high&quot; by some authors&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; and that on cautious reckoning, based on reliable evidence, the numbers would have been in the hundreds for yearly feasts in Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; The real number of sacrificed victims during the 1487 consecration is unknown.

Michael Harner, in his 1997 article ''The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice'', estimates the number of persons sacrificed in central Mexico in the 15th century as high as 250,000 per year. [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]], a Mexica descendant and the author of ''[[Codex Ixtlilxochitl]]'', claimed that one in five children of the Mexica subjects was killed annually. [[Victor Davis Hanson]] argues that an estimate by Carlos Zumárraga of 20,000 per annum is more plausible. Other scholars believe that, since the Aztecs always tried to intimidate their enemies, it is more likely that they could have inflated the number as a [[propaganda]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;Duverger (op. cit), 174–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtintouch.net/~nlight/mexican%20pyramid.htm |title=New chamber confirms culture entrenched in human sacrifice |publisher= Mtintouch.net |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tlaloc]] would require weeping boys in the first months of the [[Aztec calendar]] to be ritually murdered.

Sacrifices to [[Xipe Totec]] were bound to a post and shot full of arrows. The dead victim would be skinned and a priest would use the skin. Earth mother [[Teteoinnan]] required [[flaying|flayed]] female victims.

The torture of war captives by the tribes of the Eastern Woodlands cultural region also seems to have had sacrificial motivations.  See [[Captives in American Indian Wars]]

====South America====
The Incas practiced human sacrifice, especially at great festivals or royal funerals where retainers died to accompany the dead into the next life.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Michael, &quot;Conquistadors&quot;, p. 114, BBC Worldwide, 2001, ISBN 0-563-55116-X&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moche]] of Northern [[Peru]] sacrificed teenagers en masse, as archaeologist Steve Bourget found when he uncovered the bones of 42 male adolescents in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.exn.ca/mummies/story.asp?id=1999041452&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the images seen in Moche art has enabled researchers to reconstruct the culture's most important ceremonial sequence, which began with ritual combat and culminated in the sacrifice of those defeated in battle. Dressed in fine clothes and adornments, armed warriors faced each other in ritual combat. In this hand-to-hand encounter the aim was to remove the opponent's headdress rather than kill him. The object of the combat was the provision of victims for sacrifice. The vanquished were stripped and bound, after which they were led in procession to the place of sacrifice. The captives are portrayed as strong and sexually potent. In the temple, the priests and priestesses would prepare the victims for sacrifice. The sacrificial methods employed varied, but at least one of the victims would be bled to death. His blood was offered to the principal deities in order to please and placate them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourget&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bourget, Steve |title=Sex, Death, and Sacrifice in Moche Religion and Visual Culture |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-292-71279-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inca]] of Peru also made human sacrifices. As many as 4,000 servants, court officials, favorites, and concubines were killed upon the death of the Inca [[Huayna Capac]] in 1527, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nigel Davies (historian)|Nigel Davies]], ''Human Sacrifice'' (1981, p. 261–262.).&lt;/ref&gt; A number of mummies of sacrificed children have been recovered in the Inca regions of [[South America]], an ancient practice known as [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures#In South America|capacocha]]. The Incas performed [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|child sacrifices]] during or after important events, such as the death of the [[Sapa Inca]] (emperor) or during a [[famine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

===West Africa===
[[File:Victims for sacrifice-1793.jpg|thumb|Victims for sacrifice - from ''[[Archibald Dalzel|The history of Dahomy, an inland Kingdom of Africa]]'', 1793]]
Human sacrifice was common in West African states up to and during the 19th century. The [[Annual customs of Dahomey]] was the most notorious example, but sacrifices were carried out all along the West African coast and further inland. Sacrifices were particularly common after the death of a King or Queen, and there are many recorded cases of hundreds or even thousands of slaves being sacrificed at such events. Sacrifices were particularly common in [[Dahomey]], in the [[Benin Empire]], in what is now [[Ghana]], and in the small independent states in what is now southern [[Nigeria]]. According to [[R. J. Rummel]], &quot;Just consider the Grand Custom in Dahomey: When a ruler died, hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of prisoners would be slain. In one of these ceremonies in 1727, as many as 4,000 were reported killed. In addition, Dahomey had an [[Annual customs of Dahomey|Annual Custom]] during which 500 prisoners were sacrificed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. Rummel (1997)&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=N1j1QdPMockC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Death by government]''&quot;. Transaction Publishers. p.63. ISBN 1-56000-927-6&lt;/ref&gt;   

In the northern parts of West Africa, human sacrifice had become rare early as Islam became more established in these areas such as the [[Hausa States]]. Human sacrifice was officially banned in the remainder of West African states only by coercion, or in some cases [[annexation]], by either the British or French. An important step was the British coercing the powerful [[Egbo]] secret society to oppose human sacrifice in 1850. This society was powerful in a large number of states in what is now south-eastern [[Nigeria]]. Nonetheless, human sacrifice continued, normally in secret, until West Africa came under firm colonial control.

The ''[[Leopard men]]'' were a West African secret society active into mid-1900s that practised [[cannibalism]]. In theory, the ritual cannibalism would strengthen both members of the society as well as their entire tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/RitualKillings1900_1950b.htm |title=The Leopard Society — Africa in the mid 1900s |accessdate=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tanganyika]], the ''Lion men'' committed an estimated 200 murders in a single three-month period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867859,00.html Murder by Lion], TIME&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibition in major religions==

===Judaism===
Current religious thinking views the ''[[Binding of Isaac|Akedah]]'' as central to the replacement of human sacrifice; while some Talmudic scholars assert the replacement was the sacrifice of animals at the Temple—using Exodus 13:2–12f; 22:28f; 34:19f; Numeri 3:1ff; 18:15; Deuteronomy 15:19—others view that as superseded by the symbolic ''[[Pars pro toto|pars-pro-toto]]'' sacrifice of [[circumcision]]. Leviticus 20:2 and Deuteronomy 18:10 specifically outlaw the giving of children to [[Moloch]], making it punishable by stoning; the [[Tanakh]] subsequently denounces human sacrifice as barbaric customs of [[Baal]] worshippers (e.g. Psalms 106:37ff).

Judges chapter 11 contains a story in which a Judge named [[Jephthah]] makes a vow to God to sacrifice the first thing that comes out of the door of his house in exchange for God's help with a military battle against the Ammonites. Much to his dismay, his only daughter greeted him upon his triumphant return. Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah kept his vow. According to the [[meforshim|commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition]], Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radak-MD&quot; /&gt; The 1st-century CE Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]], however, understood this to mean that Jephthah burned his daughter on Yahweh's altar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Athalya|title=Judges: a feminist companion to the Bible|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84127-024-1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=De4itoIYD9oC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=josephus++Jephthah++++burned++daughter+altar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yg_6TtiIKI-68gOVray9AQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=josephus%20%20Jephthah%20%20%20%20burned%20%20daughter%20altar&amp;f=false|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[pseudo-Philo]], late first century CE, wrote that Jephthah offered his daughter as a burnt offering because he could find no sage in Israel who would cancel his vow.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Christianity===
In Christianity, the belief developed that the story of [[binding of Isaac|Isaac's binding]] and of [[Jepthah]]'s virgin daughter were foreshadowing for the sacrifice of [[Jesus]], whose sacrifice and resurrection allowed the sins of mankind to be washed away. There is a tradition that the site of the [[binding of Isaac]], [[Moriah]], was also the city of Jesus's future crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;http://&quot;Voices From the Children of Abraham&quot;, [www.newmantoronto.com/040311childrenofabraham2.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs of most Christian denominations hinge upon the [[substitutionary atonement]] of the sacrifice of Jesus, which is necessary for salvation in the afterlife. Each individual person must participate in, and/or receive the benefits of, this sacrifice for the atonement of their sins. Early Christian sources explicitly described this event as a sacrificial offering, with Jesus in the role of both [[priest]] and victim, although starting with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some writers, such as [[John Locke]], have disputed the model of Jesus' death as a propitiatory sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Christian Theology: An Introduction |last= McGrath |first= Allister E. |pages= 390&amp;ndash;395 |edition= Second |publisher= [[Blackwell Publishing|Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-631-19849-0 }} According to [[Allister McGrath]], early sources describing a sacrifice include the [[New Testament]]'s [[Letter to the Hebrews]] and writings by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. Later sources, besides Locke, include [[Thomas Chubb]] and [[Horace Bushnell]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Eastern Orthodox Christian|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Christians believe that this sacrifice is made present in the [[sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]]. In this tradition, bread and wine, offered in a [[liturgy|liturgical]] ritual, [[transubstantiation|transforms]] into the &quot;[[Real Presence]],&quot; (the literal Body and Blood of [[Jesus Christ]]). Receiving the Eucharist is a central part of the religious life of Catholic and Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sacrifice of the Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=202&amp;SID=3 |title=&quot;Sacrifice of the Mass&quot;, Orthodox Church of America |publisher=Oca.org |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Protestant]] traditions do not share the belief in the Real Presence but otherwise are varied, for example, they may believe that in the bread and wine, Christ is present only spiritually, not in the sense of a change in substance ([[Methodism]])&lt;ref name=&quot;wesley&quot;&gt;{{cite wikisource |title= Articles of Religion |wslink= Articles of Religion (Methodist) |at= Article XVIII—Of the Lord's Supper |author= John Wesley |authorlink= John Wesley }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the bread and wine of communion are a merely symbolic reminder ([[Baptist]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;baptist supper&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Understanding Four Views on the Lord's Supper |series= Counterpoints: Church Life |editor1-first= Paul E.

===Islam===
The [[Qur'an]] strongly condemns human sacrifice, as a &quot;grave error and sinful act&quot;&lt;ref&gt;surah 17 ayah 31&lt;/ref&gt; and an &quot;ignorant, foolish act of those that have gone astray&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;surah 6 ayah 140&quot;&gt;surah 6 ayah 140&lt;/ref&gt; and speaks of how the &quot;heathens were deluded by their deities to kill their own children&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;surah 6 ayah 140&quot;/&gt;

===Eastern religions===
{{Main|Ahimsa}}
Many traditions of [[Eastern religions]] ([[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]) embrace the doctrine of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) which imposes [[vegetarianism]] and outlaws animal as well as human sacrifice.

In the case of Buddhism, both ''bhikkhus'' (monks) and ''bhikkhunis'' (nuns) were forbidden to take life in any form as part of the [[Vinaya|monastic code]], while non-violence was promoted among laity through encouragement of the [[Five Precepts]].  Across the Buddhist world both meat and alcohol are strongly discouraged as offerings to a Buddhist altar, with the former being synonymous with sacrifice, and the latter a violation of the Five Precepts.

In [[Hinduism]], the principle of ''ahimsa'' was prescribed as early as in the [[Maurya period]] ''[[Manu Smrti]]''. The same text, however, also exempts religious sacrifice from the notion of &quot;violence&quot; since the victim of the sacrifice was taken to benefit from the act as it would be reborn in a higher position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manu&quot;&gt;Manu Smriti 5.32; 5.39–40; 5.42&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Hinduism slaughter according to the rituals permitted in the Puranic scriptures has virtually disappeared. In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as [[Swami Vivekananda]],&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramana Maharshi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beasyouare.info/beasyouare.html |title=Ramana Maharishi: ''Be as you are'' |publisher=Beasyouare.info |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Sivananda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/ahimsa.htm |title=Swami Sivananda: ''Bliss Divine'', pp. 3–8 |publisher=Dlshq.org |date=2005-12-11 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami]]&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'' p. 56–60.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the importance of ahimsa.

===Allegations of human sacrifice===
{{See also|Blood libel}}
Allegations of human sacrifice have been made against the [[Jews]] generally in the form of accusations of [[child cannibalism]] or desecrating the [[eucharist]]. Groups that have had such accusations leveled against them include [[blood libel against the Jews]] by [[Apion]] in the 30s CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nathan |first=D. |authorlink=Debbie Nathan |coauthor=Snedeker M. |title=Satan's Silence: Ritual Abuse and the Making of a Modern American Witch Hunt |year=1995 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=0-87975-809-0 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|Christians in the Roman empire]] later allegations of a [[List of conspiracy theories#Jewish conspiracy|Jewish conspiracy]] and the [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe|witch hunts]] of the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name=Victor&gt;{{Cite book|title=Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend |author=Victor J.S. |publisher=[[Open Court Publishing Company]] |year=1993 |isbn=0-8126-9192-X |pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA207 207–208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, blood libel accusations re-emerged as part of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor&quot;/&gt;

The [[People's Republic of China]] as well as  [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalist]]s in the [[Republic of China]] in their effort to discredit Tibetan lamaism make frequent and emphatic reference to the historical [[human sacrifice in Tibet]], portraying the [[People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|1950 People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet]] as an act of humanitarian intervention.
According to Chinese sources, in the year 1948, 21 individuals were murdered by state sacrificial priests from Lhasa as part of a ritual of enemy destruction, because their organs were required as magical ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, 1996, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Tibetan Revolutions Museum'' established by the Chinese in Lhasa has numerous morbid ritual objects on display to illustrate these claims.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}, 1983, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
In Taiwan, [[Li Ao]] in his TV talk show in 2006 claimed that the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] had commanded human sacrifices, asking his followers to &quot;tear out human skin&quot; for &quot;some religious ceremony&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=bFSS826ETlk youtube.com video, with English subtitles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary human sacrifice==

===India===

Human sacrifice is illegal in India. But a few cases do occur in remote and underdeveloped regions of the country, where modernity has not penetrated well and tribal/semi-tribal groups adhere to cultural practices as they did over the course of millennia. According to the ''Hindustan Times'', there was an incident of human sacrifice in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cquote|After a rash of similar killings in the area — according to an unofficial tally in the English language-language ''Hindustan Times'', there have been 25 human sacrifices in western Uttar Pradesh in the last six months alone — police have cracked down against tantriks, jailing four and forcing scores of others to close their businesses and pull their [[advertising|ads]] from newspapers and television stations. The killings and the stern official response have focused renewed attention on tantrism, an amalgam of mysticism practices that grew out of Hinduism.''In India, case links mysticism, murder'' – John Lancaster, [[Washington Post]], 29 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, police in [[Khurja]] reported &quot;dozens of sacrifices&quot; in the period of half a year in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'' , Dan McDougall in Khurja, India, Sunday March 5, 2006 [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1723910,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
{{Further|Medicine murder}}
Human sacrifice, in the context of religious ritual, still occurs in other traditional religions, for example in [[muti]] killings in [[Eastern Africa]]. Human sacrifice is no longer officially condoned in any country, and such cases are regarded as murder.

In January, 2008, [[Milton Blahyi]] of [[Liberia]] confessed being part of human sacrifices which &quot;included the killing of an innocent child and plucking out the heart, which was divided into pieces for us to eat.&quot; He fought against [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]'s militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Paye |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7200101.stm |title=news.bbc.co.uk, I ate children's hearts, ex-rebel says |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2004, a muti killing took place in Ireland; the headless corpse of a [[Malawi]] woman was found near [[Piltown]], [[County Kilkenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article468989.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Daughter of minister beheaded |first=David |last=Lister |date=2004-08-13 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
A 1989 book by investigative journalist [[Patrick Tierney (journalist)|Patrick Tierney]] documents a modern ritual human sacrifice during the devastating [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|earthquake and tsunami of 1960]] by a [[Machi (shaman)|Machi]] of the [[Mapuche]] in the [[Budi Lake|Lago Budi]] community.&lt;ref&gt;''The Highest Altar: Unveiling the Mystery of Human Sacrifice'' ISBN 978-0-14-013974-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim, 5-year-old José Luis Painecur, had his arms and legs removed by Juan Pañán and Juan José Painecur (the victim's grandfather), and was stuck into the sand of the beach like a stake. The waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] then carried the body out to sea. The sacrifice was rumoured to be at the behest of local machi, Juana Namuncurá Añen. The two men were charged with the crime and confessed, but later recanted. They were released after two years. A judge ruled that those involved in these events had &quot;acted without free will, driven by an irresistible natural force of ancestral tradition.&quot;

The story is also mentioned in a ''Time'' magazine article from that year, although with much less detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869529,00.html |work=Time |title= CHILE: Asking for Calm |date=1960-07-04 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ritual murder===
Ritual killings perpetrated by individuals or small groups within a society that denounces them as simple murder are difficult to classify as either &quot;human sacrifice&quot; or mere pathological homicide because they lack the societal integration of [[sacrifice]] proper.

The instances closest to &quot;ritual killing&quot; in the criminal history of modern society would be pathological serial killers such as the [[Zodiac Killer]], and [[mass suicide]]s with [[doomsday cult]] background, such as the [[Peoples Temple]], [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]], [[Order of the Solar Temple]] or [[Heaven's Gate (cult)|Heaven's Gate]] incidents.{{says who|date=November 2011}} Other examples include the &quot;[[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] killings&quot; attributed to Mexican cult leader [[Adolfo Constanzo]] and the &quot;Superior Universal Alignment&quot; killings in 1990s Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Lewan, Satanic Cult Killings Spread Fear in Southern Brazil, The Associated Press, 26 October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Human sacrifice has a history as a topic in literature, opera, video games, and cinema. A recurrent theme in the [[Classics]], it returns to prominence in European imagination with the Spanish accounts of the Aztec rituals. [[Derek Hughes]] in ''Culture and Sacrifice'' traces the topic's iterations through the works of [[Shakespeare]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]] and [[Voltaire]], and its central position in the operatic tradition from [[Mozart]] to [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and into 20th century works such as those of [[D.H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2007). See also [http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/inside_he/archives/2008/sacred_horror_Feb.cfm Bookshelf (hero.ac.uk)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[The Lottery]]&quot; is a 1948 short story that caused controversy in the United States. ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' is a 1973 British film on the topic.

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s 1977 historical novel ''[[Sun Horse, Moon Horse]]'', the main character accepts a duty as a [[sacrificial king]] and lays down his life for the redemption of his people, while inaugurating the creation of the [[Uffington White Horse]].

Most of the plot of [[The Beatles]]' film ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' deals (in a humorous way) with a group that practises human sacrifice trying to kill Ringo Starr because he is wearing the sacrificial ring.

In [[Prisoners of the Sun|''Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun'']] the Inca leader comes close to sacrificing [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], [[Captain Haddock]], and [[Professor Calculus]] on a pyre to be set alight with parabolic mirrors. This was for Calculus having committed sacrilege for wearing the bracelet of Rascar Capac.

In the 1984 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', high priest Mola Ram sacrifices men by magically removing their heart with one hand and lowering them in boiling lava. One sacrifice is shown, in which the victim's amputated heart [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combusts]] when the victim hits the lava. In [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2006 film ''[[Apocalypto]]'', human sacrifice is done to appease the gods.

In the [[Dan Brown]] novel ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', the book's main [[antagonist]] Mal'akh, prepares himself for the human sacrifice throughout the story, believing that it is his great destiny to lead the forces of evil.

In the two [[fantasy]] series the [[Belgariad]] and the [[Malloreon]] by [[David Eddings]], human sacrifice of a type similar to that of the [[Aztecs]] is practiced by men of the [[Angarak]] race in devotion to their god [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Torak|Torak]]. 

In [[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]], Human Sacrifice is a recurring element in several side quests involving the infamous Daedric Princes. The most infamous of these is a quest given by the Daedric Prince Boethiah where the Dragonborn must sacrifice one of his or her followers in order to progress further into the quest and the Daedric Prince Molag Bol requires the player to sacrifice a corrupt priest by murdering him with a rusted mace once he is caught in one of Molag Bol's traps.
