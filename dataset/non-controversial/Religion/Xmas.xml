'''''Xmas''''' is a common [[abbreviation]] of the word ''[[Christmas]]''. It is sometimes pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}}, but it, and variants such as ''Xtemass'', originated as handwriting abbreviations for the typical pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|m|ə|s}}. The &quot;-mas&quot; part is from the Latin-derived [[Old English]] word for ''[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09790b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Liturgy of the Mass].

==History==
===Use in English===
[[File:Timbre penny post Canada 1898.jpg|left|thumb|&quot;XMAS 1898&quot; is near the bottom of this [[Postage stamps and postal history of Canada|Canadian postage stamp]].]]
Early use of &quot;Xmas&quot; includes Bernard Ward's ''History of St. Edmund's college, Old Hall'' (originally published circa 1755).&lt;ref name=oed-xmas&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Xmas, n. |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.oed.com.ezproxy.spl.org:2048/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/231032 |year= 2011|accessdate= 17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier version, &quot;X'temmas&quot;, dates to 1551.&lt;ref name=oed-xmas/&gt; Around 1100 the term was written as &quot;Xp̄es mæsse&quot; in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; &quot;Xmas&quot; is found in a letter from [[George Woodward (diplomat)|George Woodward]] in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, John and Christopher Reid, [http://books.google.com/books?id=qRKOG_JeSQIC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Xmas+%22eighteenth+century%22&amp;ei=79tWSafUNJfUzAS-pMmMCA#PPA216,M1 ''Eighteenth-century Popular Culture: A Selection''], Oxford University Press, 2000, ISBN 978-0-19-871134-6, p 216, retrieved via Google Books, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Byron]] used the term in 1811,&lt;ref name=mwdeu/&gt; as did [[Samuel Coleridge]] (1801)&lt;ref name=bbc04/&gt; and [[Lewis Carroll]] (1864).&lt;ref name=mwdeu/&gt; In the United States, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] used the term in a letter dated 1923.&lt;ref name=mwdeu/&gt; Since at least the late 19th century, &quot;Xmas&quot; has been in use in various other English-language nations. Quotations with the word can be found in texts written in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Kelcey, Barbara Eileen, ''Alone in Silence: European Women in the Canadian North Before 1940'', McGill-Queen's Press, 2001, ISBN 978-0-7735-2292-3 (&quot;We had singing practice with the white men for the Xmas carols&quot;, written by Sadie Stringer in Peel River, Northwest Territories, Canada), p 50, retrieved via Google Books, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the word has been used in Australia,&lt;ref name=ppcgaeu/&gt; and in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Alssopp, Richard, [http://books.google.com/books?id=PmvSk13sIc0C&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=Xmas+usage&amp;lr=&amp;ei=TFlWSb_8J5PqyQTHyeSmBQ &quot;most1&quot; article]''Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage'', University of the West Indies Press, 2003, ISBN 978-976-640-145-0 (&quot;The most day I enjoy was Xmas day&quot; — Bdos, 1985), p 388, retrieved via Google Books, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'' stated that modern use of the term is largely limited to advertisements, headlines and banners, where its conciseness is valued. The association with commerce &quot;has done nothing for its reputation&quot;, according to the dictionary.&lt;ref name=mwdeu/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the former [[Church of England]] Bishop of [[Diocese of Blackburn|Blackburn]], [[Alan Chesters (Bishop)|Alan Chesters]], recommended to his clergy that they avoid the spelling.&lt;ref name=bbc04/&gt;
In the United States, in 1977 New Hampshire Governor [[Meldrim Thomson]] sent out a press release saying that he wanted journalists to keep the &quot;Christ&quot; in Christmas, and not call it Xmas—which he asserted was a &quot;[[pagan]]&quot; spelling of Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JYMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lKEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=912,1874288&amp;dq=xmas+christmas+x&amp;hl=en &quot;X-mas is 'X'ing out Christ'&quot;, ''The Montreal Gazette'', December 8, 1977, accessed February 10, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation of Christmas as &quot;Xmas&quot; is the source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday. Dennis Bratcher, writing for a website for Christians, states &quot;there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation 'Xmas' as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/symbols/xmasorigin.html |title=The Origin of &quot;Xmas&quot; |publisher=CRI/Voice |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are evangelist [[Franklin Graham]] and [[CNN]] journalist [[Roland S. Martin]]. Graham stated in an interview: &lt;blockquote&gt;for us as Christians, this is one of the most holy of the holidays, the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. And for people to take Christ out of Christmas. They're happy to say merry Xmas. Let's just take Jesus out. And really, I think, a war against the name of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/16/ltm.02.html American Morning: A Conversation With Reverend Franklin Graham], CNN (December 16, 2005). Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Martin likewise relates the use of &quot;Xmas&quot; to his growing concerns of increasing commercialization and secularization of one of Christianity's highest holy days.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Roland (December 20, 2007). [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/20/roland.martin/index.html Commentary: You can't take Christ out of Christmas], CNN. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of &quot;Christ&quot; for various purposes.

The word &quot;[[Christ]]&quot; and its compounds, including &quot;Christmas&quot;, have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern &quot;Xmas&quot; was commonly used. &quot;Christ&quot; was often written as &quot;XP&quot; or &quot;Xt&quot;; there are references in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] as far back as AD 1021. This X and P arose as the [[uppercase]] forms of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[Chi (letter)|χ]] and [[rho|ρ]] used in ancient abbreviations for Χριστος (Greek for &quot;Christ&quot;),&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; and are still widely seen in many [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icons]] depicting [[Jesus Christ]]. The [[labarum]], an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as [[labarum|☧]], is a symbol often used to represent Christ in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestant]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christian Churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiansymbols.net/monograms_2.php Christian Symbols: Chi-Rho] ''Christian Symbols'', Doug Gray, Retrieved 2009-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) and the OED Supplement have cited usages of &quot;X-&quot; or &quot;Xp-&quot; for &quot;Christ-&quot; as early as 1485. The terms &quot;Xpian&quot; and &quot;Xtian&quot; have also been used for &quot;Christian&quot;. The dictionary further cites usage of &quot;Xtianity&quot; for &quot;Christianity&quot; from 1634.&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', most of the evidence for these words comes from &quot;educated Englishmen who knew their Greek&quot;.&lt;ref name=mwdeu&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA968&amp;dq=Xmas+usage&amp;ei=zVZWSa6FJY6syASeyKHRAw &quot;Xmas&quot; article], ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', Merriam-Webster, 1994, p 968, ISBN 978-0-87779-132-4, retrieved via Google Books, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Christian art, χ and χρ are abbreviations for Christ's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10488a.htm |title=Monogram of Christ |publisher=New Advent |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many manuscripts of the [[New Testament]] and [[icon]]s, Χ is an abbreviation for Χριστος{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, as is XC (the first and last letters in Greek, using the lunate [[sigma (letter)|sigma]]);&lt;ref&gt;''Church Symbolism: An Explanation of the more Important Symbols of the Old and New Testament, the Primitive, the Mediaeval and the Modern Church'' by Frederick Roth Webber (2nd. edition, 1938). {{OCLC|236708}}&lt;/ref&gt; compare IC for [[Jesus]] in Greek.

====Other uses of &quot;X&quot; for &quot;Chris-&quot;====
Other proper names containing the name &quot;Christ&quot; besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly (e.g., ''Xtina'' for the name &quot;Christina&quot;).
This usage of &quot;X&quot; to spell the syllable &quot;kris&quot; (rather than the sounds &quot;ks&quot;) has extended to &quot;xtal&quot; for &quot;[[crystal]]&quot;, and on [[florist|florists']] signs to &quot;xant&quot; for &quot;[[chrysanthemum]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=13693&amp;lastnode_id=0 |title=X |publisher=Everything 2 |date= |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though these words are not etymologically related to &quot;Christ&quot;: &quot;crystal&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning &quot;ice&quot; (and not even using the letter χ), and &quot;chrysanthemum&quot; comes from Greek words meaning &quot;golden flower&quot; (while &quot;Christ&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning &quot;anointed&quot;).

In the 17th and 18th centuries, &quot;Xene&quot; and &quot;Exene&quot; were common spellings for the given name Christine. The American singer [[Christina Aguilera]] has sometimes gone by the name &quot;Xtina&quot; (the &quot;t&quot; should not be considered redundant; as is noted above, &quot;Christ&quot; was historically often shortened to &quot;Xt&quot;, not just to X).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-acronyms.com/XT./Christ/1136835 &quot;Abbreviation: Xt.&quot; Date retrieved: 19 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In the animated television show ''[[Futurama]]'', which is set in the 31st century, Xmas {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}} is the official name for the day formerly known as Christmas (which, in the episode &quot;[[Xmas Story]],&quot; is said to have become an &quot;archaic pronunciation&quot;).
*In the board game [[Monopoly (board game)|Monopoly]], one of the &quot;Community Chest&quot; cards reads, &quot;XMAS FUND MATURES COLLECT $150.&quot;
