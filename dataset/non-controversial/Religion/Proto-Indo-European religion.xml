{{Indo-European topics}}

'''Proto-Indo-European religion''' is the hypothesized religion of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) peoples based on the existence of similarities among the [[Deity|deities]], religious practices and mythologies of the Indo-European peoples. Reconstruction of the hypotheses below is based on linguistic evidence using the [[comparative method]]. Archaeological evidence is difficult to match to any specific culture in the period of early Indo-European culture in the [[Chalcolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams89|Mallory &amp; Adams (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches to Indo-European mythology are possible, most notably the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] of [[Georges Dumézil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mythe et Épopée I, II, III'', by G. Dumézil, Gallimard, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantheon==
Linguists are able to reconstruct the names of some deities in the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) from many types of sources. Some of the proposed deity names are more readily accepted among scholars than others.&lt;ref&gt;In order to present a consistent notation, the reconstructed forms used here are cited from [[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]. For further explanation of the laryngeals – &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, and &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; – see the [[Laryngeal theory]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term for &quot;a god&quot; was ''*deiwos'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]: 408&lt;/ref&gt; reflected in Hittite, ''sius''; Latin, deus, Sanskrit [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]; [[Avestan]], [[daeva]] (later, Persian, ''divs''); Welsh duw; Irish ''dia'', Lithuanian, ''[[Dievas]]''; Latvian, ''Dievs''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

* [[Dyeus|''*Dyēus Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;tēr'']] is the god of the day-lit sky and the chief god of the Indo-European [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The name survives in Greek [[Zeus]] with a vocative form ''Zeu pater''; Latin [[Jupiter (god)|Jūpiter]] (from the archaic Latin ''Iovis pater''; Diēspiter), Sanskrit [[Dyaus Pita|Dyáus Pitā]], and Illyrian Dei-pátrous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]: 409–31&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''*Plth&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;wih&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is reconstructed&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]: 267&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Plenty'', a goddess of wide flat lands and the rivers that meander across them. Forms include Hittite ''Lelwanni'', a goddess of the underworld, &quot;the pourer&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[#GamkIvanov|Gamkrelidze &amp; Ivanov (1995)]]: 760&lt;/ref&gt; and Sanskrit [[Prthivi]].

* ''*[[Perkwunos]]'', known as &quot;the striker&quot;, is reconstructed&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]: 410–33&lt;/ref&gt; from Sanskrit [[Parjanya]], [[Prussian mythology|Prussian]] Perkuns, [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian]] [[Perkūnas]], [[Latvian mythology|Latvian]] Pērkons, Slavic [[Perun]], and Norse [[Fjörgyn]]. Fjörgyn was replaced by [[Thor]] among the Germanic-speaking peoples. The [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] hammer god [[Sucellus]] is of the same character, but with an unrelated name.

* ''*H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eus(os)'', is believed to have been the goddess of dawn,&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]: 409, 410, 432&lt;/ref&gt; continued in Greek mythology as [[Eos]], in Rome as [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], in Vedic as [[Ushas]], in [[Lithuanian mythology]] as Aušra 'dawn' or Auštaras (Auštra) 'the god (goddess) of the northeast wind', Latvian [[Auseklis]], the morning star (Lithuanian Aušrinė, 'morning star'); Ausera, and Ausrina, goddesses of dawn or of the planet Venus; Hittite, assu 'lord, god'; Gallic [[Esus]], a god of hearths; Slavic, [[Jarilo|Iaro]], a god of summer. The form Arap Ushas appears in Albanian folklore, but is a name of the Moon. See also the names for the Sun which follow. An extension of the name may have been ''*H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eust(e)ro'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]: 294, 301&lt;/ref&gt; but see also the form ''*as-t-r'', with intrusive -t- [between s and r] in northern dialects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MalloryAdams06|Mallory &amp; Adams (2006)]]: 702, 780; Gamkrelidze &amp; Ivanov (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Anatolian dialects: Estan, Istanus, Istara; Greek, [[Hestia]], goddess of the hearth; Latin [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], goddess of the hearth; in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] as [[Astghik]], a star goddess; possibly also in Germanic mythology as [[Eostre]] or Ostara; and Baltic, Austija.

* ''*PriHeh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', is reconstructed (Mallory &amp; Adams 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;208) as &quot;beloved, friend&quot;  (Sanskrit ''priya''), the [[love goddess]].

* ''*Deh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;nu-'' 'River goddess' is reconstructed (Mallory &amp; Adams 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;434) from Sanskrit [[Danu (Hindu goddess)|Danu]], Irish [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]]; Welsh [[Dôn]], and a masc. form Ossetic Donbettys.  The name has been connected with the Dan rivers which run into the Black Sea ([[Dnieper]], [[Dniester]], [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], and [[Danube]]) and other river names in Celtic areas.

* ''*Welnos'', is reconstructed as a god of cattle from Slavic [[Veles (god)|Veles]], and Lithuanian [[Velnias]] (in archaic Lithuanian vėlės means 'shades' or 'spirits of the departed'), &quot;protector of flocks&quot;; as well as Old Norse [[Ullr]], and Old English Wuldor, and even the Elysian fields in Greek myth and ritual (according to Jaan Puhvel). There may be a god of cattle in the northern lands, but the argument is very thin. These names were also once thought to be connected to Sanskrit [[Varuna]] and Greek [[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]], for example by Max Muller (''Comparative Mythology'' p.&amp;nbsp;84), but this is now rejected on linguistic grounds, (&quot;the etymology is disputed&quot; Shapiro, JIES 10, 1&amp;2, p.&amp;nbsp;155&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Indo-European Studies, publ. by JIES, Washington, DC., 1973 and continuing&lt;/ref&gt;).

* Divine Twins:  There are several sets (the Indo-Europeans seem to be quite fond of twins), which may or may not be related.
**Analysis of different Indo-European tales indicate the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind: *''Manu-'' (&quot;Man&quot;; Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]; Germanic [[Mannus]]) and *''Yemo-'' (&quot;Twin&quot;; Indic [[Yama]]; Germanic [[Ymir]]), his twin brother. Cognates of this set of twins appear as the first mortals, or the first gods to die, sometimes becoming the ancestors of everyone and/or king(s) of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory. ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans''. 1987. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Bruce. ''Death, War, and Sacrifice: Studies in Ideology &amp; Practice''. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
** The Sun and Moon as discussed in the next section.
** [[Divine Twins|Horse Twins]], usually have a name that means 'horse' ''*ekwa-'', but the names are not always cognate, because there is no lexical set (Mallory &amp; Adams 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;432). They are always male and usually have a horse form, or sometimes, one is a horse and the other is a boy. They are brothers of the Sun Maiden or Dawn goddess, sons of the Sky god, continued in Sanskrit [[Ashvins]] and Lithuanian [[Ašvieniai]], identical to Latvian [[Dieva deli]]. Other horse twins are: Greek, Dioskuri (Polydeukes and Kastor); borrowed into Latin as [[Castor and Pollux]]; Irish, the twins of [[Macha]]; Old English, [[Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] (both words mean 'stallion'), and possibly Old Norse [[Sleipnir]], the eight-legged horse born of [[Loki]]; Slavic Lel and Polel; possibly Christianized in Albanian as Sts. Flori and Lori. The horse twins may be based on the morning and evening star (the planet [[Venus]]) and they often have stories about them in which they &quot;accompany&quot; the Sun goddess, because of the close orbit of the planet Venus to the sun, (JIES 10, 1&amp;2, pp.&amp;nbsp;137–166, Michael Shapiro, who references D. Ward, ''The Divine Twins,'' Folklore Studies, No. 19, Univ. Calif. Press, Berkeley, 1968,).

* A water or sea god is reconstructed (Mallory &amp; Adams 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;438) as ''*H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;epom Nepots'' 'grandson/nephew of waters' from Avestan and Vedic [[Apam Napat]], and as ''*neptonos'' from Celtic [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtan]], Etruscan [[Nethuns]],  and Latin [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]. This god may be related{{clarify|date=December 2010}} to the Germanic water spirit, the [[Nix]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaan Puhvel, ''Analecta Indoeuropaea,'' (a collection of articles), publ. by Innsbrucker Beitrage zur Sprachwissenschaft, Innsbruck, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, most major [[Lithuanian rivers]] begin in ne- (e.g. [[Nemunas]], [[Neris]], [[Nevėžis River|Nevėžis]]). [[Poseidon]] fulfills the same role in Greek mythology, but although the etymology of his name is highly arguable, it is certainly not cognate to [[Apam Napat]].

The [[Sun deity|Sun]] and [[Moon deity|Moon]] are often seen as the twin children of various deities, but in fact the sun and moon were deified several times and are often found in competing forms within the same language. The usual scheme is that one of these celestial deities is male and the other female, though the exact gender of the [[Sun]] or [[Moon]] tends to vary among subsequent Indo-European mythologies. Here are two of the most common PIE forms:
* ''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'' with a genitive form ''*Sh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-en-s,'' Sun, appears as Sanskrit [[Surya]],  Avestan Hvara; Greek [[Helios]], Latin [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], Germanic *[[Sowilo]] (Old Norse [[Sól (Sun)|Sól]]; Old English Sigel and Sunna, modern English Sun), Lithuanian [[Saule (Lithuanian mythology)|Saulė]], Latvian Saule; Albanian Diell.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of IE Culture'', p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''*Meh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;not'' Moon, gives Avestan, Mah; Greek Selene (unrelated), although they also use a form Mene; Latin, Luna, later [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] (unrelated), ON [[Mani (god)|Mani]], Old English Mona; Slavic Myesyats; Lithuanian, *[[List of Lithuanian gods#Gods_and_god-_like_beings|Meno]], or Mėnuo (Mėnulis); Latvian Meness. In Albanian, Hane is the name of Monday, but this is not related. (''Encyclopedia of IE Culture,'' p.&amp;nbsp;385, gives the forms but does not have an entry for a moon goddess.)

* ''*Peh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;uson'' is reconstructed (Mallory &amp; Adams 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;434) as a pastoral god, based on the Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the Roman god [[Faunus]] and the [[Faun]]s, and Vedic [[Pashupati]], and [[Pushan]]. See also [[Paganism#Etymology|Pax]].

* There may have been a set of nature spirits or gods akin to the Greek [[Satyr]]s, the Celtic god [[Cernunnos]] and the Dusii, Slavic Veles and the [[Leszi]], the Germanic [[Woodwose]], [[elf|elves]] and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]. There may also have been a female cognate akin to the Greco-Roman [[nymph]]s, Slavic [[Slavic fairies|vila]]s, the [[Huldra]] of [[Germanic folklore]], and the [[Hindu]] [[Apsaras]].

* It is also likely that they had three fate goddesses; see the [[Norns]] in [[Norse mythology]], [[Moirai]] in [[Greek mythology]], [[Sudjenice]] of [[Slavic folklore]] and [[Deives Valdytojos|Deivės Valdytojos]] in [[Lithuanian mythology]]. Celtic religion is also rife with triple goddesses, such as the [[Celtic polytheism|Gaulish]] [[Matres and Matrones|Matrones]] and the [[Morrigan]] of Ireland, and sometimes triplicate gods as well, but they are not always associated with fate.  ''See also [[Triple deities]].''

A fuller treatment of the subject of the Indo-European Pantheon would not merely list the [[cognate]] names but describe additional correspondences in the &quot;family relationships&quot;, festival dates, associated myths (but see [[Proto-Indo-European religion#Mythology|Mythology section]]) and special powers.

===Pandemonium===
&quot;Pandemonium&quot; is [[Jaan Puhvel]]'s word for the mutual [[demonization]] that occurred when the [[Avestan_language#Forms_and_stages_of_development|Younger-Avesta]] demonized the ''[[daeva]]s'', and the post-[[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] texts demonized the ''[[asura]]s''. Neither demonization occurs in the oldest texts: in the Rigveda, there is not yet any hard-and-fast distinction between ''asuras'' and ''dēvas'', and even in the later [[Vedas]], the two groups (though thematically in opposition) cooperate at certain times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kuiper|first=F.B.J.|title=Ancient Indian Cosmology|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=J.|location=Delhi|publisher=Vikas|year=1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Avestan_language#Forms_and_stages_of_development|Old Avestan]] texts the ''daevas'' are to be rejected for being misguided by the &quot;lie&quot;, but they are still gods, and not demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Herrenschmidt|first=Clarisse|last2=Kellens|first2=Jean|chapter=*Daiva|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=6|year=1993|publisher=Mazda|location=Cosa Mesa|pages=601|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 19th century this distinction between the older and younger texts had not yet been made, and in 1884 [[Martin Haug]] &quot;postulated his thesis that the transition of both the words [''asuras'' and ''devas''] into the designations of the demons ... is based on a prehistoric schism in religion ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hillebrandt|first=Alfred|editor-last=Sarma|editor-first=Sreeramula Rajeswara, trans.|title=Vedic Mythology|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=New Delhi|year=1891&lt;!--facsimile--&gt;/1981|volume=2|pages=264|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observation was reiterated by [[Jacob Grimm]] (DM3, p.&amp;nbsp;985), who, like Haug, considered it to be the theological basis of [[Zoroastrianism]]'s [[dualism]].

Before this (in the 1850s), [[Westergaard]] had attributed the Younger-Avesta's demonization of the ''daevas'' to a &quot;moral reaction against Vedic polytheism&quot;, but that (unlike the general notion of a mutual demonization) was very quickly rejected, and by 1895 [[James Darmesteter]] noted that it has &quot;no longer [had] any supporter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Darmesteter|first=James|title=Sacred Books of the East|volume=4|editor-last=Müller|editor-first=Max|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|year=1895|pages=lii|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some modern authors like Mallory and Adams still refer to Zoroastrianism as a &quot;religious reformation&quot; of Vedic religion (Mallory &amp; Adams 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;408–09). Most scholars however stress that there were two independent developments in ancient Iran and post-Rigvedic India, but nonetheless to be considered against the common background of [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|prehistoric Indo-Iranian religion]] where both groups coexisted, with the ''asuras'', perhaps even as a subset (having a particular common characteristic, like the [[Aditya]]s) of the ''daevas'', the national gods.

==Mythology==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

=== World Tree ===
There seems to have been a belief in a [[world tree]], which in [[Continental Germanic mythology|Germanic mythology]] was an [[ash tree]] (Norse [[Yggdrasil]]; [[Irminsul]]), in [[Hinduism]] a [[banyan]] tree, an [[Oak|oak tree]] in [[Slavic mythology]], and a [[hazel|hazel tree]] in [[Celtic mythology]].  In classical [[Greek mythology]], the closest analogue of this concept is [[Mount Olympus]]; however, there is also a later folk tradition about the World Tree, which is being sawed by the [[Kallikantzaroi]] (Greek goblins), perhaps a reborrowing from other peoples.

===Dragon or Serpent===
One common myth which can be found among almost all Indo-European mythologies is a battle ending with the slaying of a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], usually a dragon of some sort (Watkins 1995).
*[[Thor]] vs. [[Jörmungandr]], [[Sigurd]] vs. [[Fafnir]] in [[Scandinavian mythology]];
*[[Zeus]] vs. [[Typhon]], [[Cronus|Kronos]] vs. [[Ophion]], [[Apollo]] vs. [[Python (mythology)|Python]], [[Heracles]] vs. the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] and [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], [[Perseus]] vs. [[Ceto]], and [[Bellerophon]] vs. the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] in Greek mythology;
*[[Indra]] vs. [[Vrtra]] in the [[Rigveda]];
*[[Krishna]] vs. [[Kāliyā]] in [[Bhagavata]] mythology;
*[[Fereydun|Θraētaona]], and later [[Garshasp|Kərəsāspa]], vs. [[Zahhak|Aži Dahāka]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Persian mythology]];
*[[Perun]] vs. [[Veles (god)|Veles]], [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] vs. [[Zmey]] in Slavic mythology;
*[[Tarhunt]] vs. [[Illuyanka]] of [[Hittites|Hittite]] mythology;
*[[Beowulf]] vs. [[Beowulf#Third_battle:_The_dragon|the dragon]] in [[Anglo-Saxon literature]]

There are also analogous stories in other neighbouring mythologies: [[Anu]] or [[Marduk]] vs. [[Tiamat]] in [[Mesopotamian mythology]]; [[Ra]] vs. [[Apep]] in [[Egyptian mythology]]; [[Baal]] or [[El (god)|El]] vs. [[Lotan]] or [[Yam (god)|Yam-Nahar]] in Levantine mythology; [[Yahweh]] or [[Gabriel]] vs. [[Leviathan]] or [[Rahab (demon)|Rahab]] or [[Tannin (demon)|Tannin]] in [[Jewish mythology]]; [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] and, [[Christ]] vs. [[Satan]] (in the form of a seven-headed dragon), [[Virgin Mary]] crushing a serpent in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] iconography (see [[Book of Revelation]] 12), [[Saint George and the Dragon]] in [[Christian mythology]].  The myth symbolized a clash between forces of order and chaos (represented by the serpent), and the god or hero would always win (except in some mythologies, such as the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Ragnarök]] myth). Serpentine aspects can be found in many Greek aquatic deities, most notably [[Poseidon]], [[Oceanus]], [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], Typhon (who carries many chthonic attributes while not specifically linked with the sea), Ophion, and also the Slavic Veles.  Possibly called ''*{{PIE|kʷr̥mis}}'', or some name cognate with *''[[Varuna|Velnos/Werunos]]'' or the root  *''Wel''/''Vel''- ([[Vedic Sanskrit|VS]] ''Varuna'', who is associated with the serpentine ''naga'', ''Vala'' and ''Vṛtra'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''Veles'', [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] ''velnias''), or &quot;serpent&quot; ([[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''Illuyanka'', VS ''[[Vritra|Ahis]]'', [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''[[Zahhak|azhi]]'', [[Greek languages|Greek]] ''ophis'' and ''[[Ophion]]'', and [[Latin]] ''anguis''), or the root *''dheubh''- (Greek ''Typhon'' and ''Python'').

===Sun===
Related to the dragon-slaying myth is the &quot;Sun in the rock&quot; myth, of a heroic warrior deity splitting a rock where the Sun or Dawn was imprisoned.   Such a myth is preserved in Rigvedic [[Vala (Vedic)|Vala]], where [[Ushas]] and the cows, [[cattle raid|stolen]] by the [[Panis]]  were imprisoned, connected with other myths of abductions into the [[underworld|netherworld]] such as the mysteries of [[Eleusis]] connected with [[Persephone]], [[Dionysus]] and [[Triptolemus]].

The [[Sun]] was represented as riding in a [[Sun chariot|chariot]].

===Earth as a body===
There was a creation myth involving the world being made from the body of a giant. The elements in the myth are (1) *Yemós, the &quot;twin&quot; who is (2) dismembered by (3)*Mánu, his brother, and then the parts of the twin's body are used to (4) create the world according to a specific formula &quot;his bones are the rocks, his blood made the rivers and seas&quot;, etc.  Each entry is followed by the original source of the myth, and then a place where it was published.  Many of the references are from the SBE = ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'', ed. by Max Müller.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacred Books of the East'', transl. by various Oriental scholars, series ed. by Max Müller, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879–1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the substance of the formula is essentially folkloric (because rocks do look like &quot;bones of the earth&quot;), the use of the formula in this particular context and the linguistic correspondence of the names makes possible the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European myth, as recognized by Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;189.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mythology of the Aryan Nations'' by George W. Cox, Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., London, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;  This myth also appears in the ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', Mallory and Adams, pp.&amp;nbsp;129–130, and other modern authors, which is why it was chosen as an example.

[[Vedic Sanskrit]] examples, circa 1500 to 500 BCE:
* [[Yama|Yamá]] dies (it doesn't say how).  &quot;Yamá surrendered his dear body.&quot;  The original source is the [[RV 10]].13.4.  This was published in ''Vedic Mythology,'' Vol. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;ref&gt;''Vedic Mythology'' by Alfred Hillebrandt, transl. by Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma, publ. Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1981 (orig. 1891)&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Yama died as the first of mortals.&quot;  The original source is the ''[[Atharva Veda]]'' XVIII.3.13, and this was also published in ''Vedic Mythology'', Vol. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;222.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
* later Sanskrit (1000–500 BCE).  First a bull, then the wife of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], named Manâvî is killed (with Manu's permission) in sacrifice by the Ashuras (no world making!).  The original source is the ''[[Satapatha-Brâhmana]]'': 1 Kanda, 1 Adhyâya, 4 Brâhmana 14–17.  This was published in the SBE, Vol. 12 (trans. by Julius Eggeling), pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30.

[[Avestan]] examples:
* [[Jamshid|Yima Kshaeta]] makes the world grow larger three times, but he does this while he is still alive.  This version is clearly mythological.  Yima is the Avestan form of Sanskrit Yama and Kshaeta means &quot;brilliant, shining.&quot; The original source is the ''Zend-[[Avesta]],'' Vendidad, Fargard II, and this was published in SBE, Vol. 4 (translated by James Darmesteter), pp.&amp;nbsp;12–21.
* Avestan &quot;....[[Zahhak|Aži Dahâka]] and Spityura, he who sawed Yima in twain.&quot;  According to the editor of the text (Darmesteter), Spityura was a brother of Yima.  The original source is the ''Zend-Avesta,'' Zamyâd Yasht, VIII: 46, published in SBE, Vol. 23, pp.&amp;nbsp;293–297.
* [[Middle Persian]] of the 9th–11th centuries.  In these sources Gav, the primordial bull, is killed by Ahriman (spelled Aharman in Darmesteter). The original source is the ''Bundahišn,'' Ch. 3, part 23, * Middle Persian.  Here there is only the bare statement: &quot;Spîtûr was he who, with Dahâk, cut up Yim.&quot;  The original source is also the ''Bundahišn,'' Chap XXXI, Verse 5, and this was published in SBE Vol. 5, p.&amp;nbsp;131.
* Persian (around 1100 CE, written by [[Ferdowsi|Firdausi]]).  In this source, Jemshid is sawn in two by Zohak.  (Jemshid is the Persian form of earlier Yima Kshaeta.  Zohak is the Persian form of earlier Aži Dahâka.)  In this text, Gayomart is a ''man'', the first king, but he simply &quot;passes away&quot; after winning a battle against the son of Ahriman.  The original source is the ''[[Shah Namah]],'' which was produced in many books often with beautiful Mughal-style illustrations.  The first section of it is a &quot;book of kings&quot;, hence the name.  The ''Shah Namah'' has been published in English in many very bad verse translations.  The one used here is Vol. 1 of the ''Shahnama of Firdausi,'' translated by Arthur George Warner and Edmond Warner, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., London, 1905.  There is also an abridged prose version of this on the net, transl. by Helen Zimmern, 1883, at sacred-texts.

[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] examples:
* Old Norse texts written down in the 13th cent. but composed earlier.  Ymir is dismembered by Odin and his brother gods to make the World with the formula:  &quot;Of Ymir's flesh the earth was fashioned, And of his sweat the sea; Crags of his bones, trees of his hair, And of his skull the sky. Then of his brows, the blithe gods made Midgard for sons of men; And of his brain, the bitter-mooded Clouds were all created.&quot;  The original source is [[Grimnismal]] 40–41 (''[[Poetic Edda]]'').  This version is quoted from p.&amp;nbsp;21, ''The [[Prose Edda]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]], transl. by [[Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur]], [[The American-Scandinavian Foundation]], Oxford Univ. Press, London, 1923.

===Brothers===
Analysis of different Indo-European tales indicates the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind: *Manu- (&quot;Man&quot;; Indic Manu; Germanic Mannus) and *Yemo- (&quot;Twin&quot;), his twin brother. 

There are almost no mythological tales of Rome, but the early &quot;history&quot; of Rome is recognized as being an historicized version of various old myths.  Romulus and Remus were twin brothers.  They both have stories in which they are killed.
* Remus is killed by his brother Romulus at the foundation of Rome; and
* Romulus is dismembered by the senators, &quot;... there were some who secretly hinted that he had been torn limb from limb by the senators ...&quot;  There is no world making here, but Romulus is the eponymous ancestor of the Romans, and the founder of Rome.  One of the original sources for the stories of Romulus and Remus is Livy's ''History of Rome'' Vol. 1, parts iv–vii and xvi.  This has been published in an Everyman edition, transl. by W.M. Roberts, E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. NY, 1912.
* Gemini is the actual Latin word for 'twins' though it usually applies to Castor and Pollux, see Horse Twins in the Pantheon section.  They were worshipped all over the Roman world with votive altars with inscriptions, which remained after the Romans were gone.  This may be the source of some names which appear in early Christian myths.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

The Germanic languages have information about both Ymir and Mannus (cognates of *Yemo- and *Manu- respectively), but they never appear in the same myth, rather they appear only in myths widely separated in both time and circumstances.
* A Roman text (dated CE 98) tells that Mannus, the son of Tuisto, was the ancestor of the Germanic people, according to [[Tacitus]], writing in Latin, in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' 2.  We never see this being again, but the name Allemagne is interpreted (perhaps by folk etymology) as &quot;all-men&quot; the name for themselves.

===Bulls===
* Celtic (in this case Irish) texts were written down between the 11th and 14th centuries CE. In one myth a bull is killed and dismembered by another bull and the parts of his body are distributed around Ireland, which explains the names of many features of the landscape, though not the cause of their existence.  &quot;It was not long before the men of Erin [Ireland], as they were there in the company of Ailill and Madb early on the morrow, saw coming over Cruachan from the west, the Brown Bull of Cualnge with the Whitehorned [Bull] of Ai in torn fragments hanging about his ears and horns.&quot;  An example of one of the distributions is this one:  &quot;Then he raised his head, and the shoulder-blades of the Whitehorned fell from him in that place.  Hence, Sruthair Finnlethe ('Stream of the White Shoulder-blade') is the name given to it.&quot;  The original source is the last chapter of the ''Táin Bó Cúalnge,'' usually called in English, ''The Cattle Raid of Cooley.''  These quotations are from ''The Ancient Irish Epic Tale, Táin Bó Cúalnge,'' transl. by Joseph Dunn, publ. David Nutt, London, 1914.

* In Lithuanian, a folktale tells of a bull and three cows which are beheaded by Aušrinė, (the morning star) and then the land appears.  &quot;The maiden upon returning released her bull.  The bull knelt down and spoke in a man's voice:  &quot;Chop off my head!&quot;  The maiden did not want to chop it off, but she had to.  She chopped the head off—a fourth of the seas disappeared, became land.  Her brother emerged from the bull.  She cut off the heads of all three cows, who were her sisters.  All the seas disappeared, turned to land.  The earth sprang to life.&quot;  The original source for this is a folktale called ''Saulė and Vejų Motina'' (The Sun and the Mother of the Winds), pp.&amp;nbsp;309–13, of M. Davainis-Silvestraitis' Collection, ''Pasakos, Sakmės, Oracijos'' (Tales, Legends and Orations) publ. in Vilnius, 1973.  The English version is from p.&amp;nbsp;67 ''Of Gods and Men'' by [[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Algirdas J. Greimas]], transl. by Milda Newman, Indiana Univ. Press, Indianapolis, 1992.

===Other myths===
Other myths may have included:

'''[[Creation myth]]s'''
* Birth of the Horse Twins from the grain/horse mother (Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;234, found in 7/11 language groups, which is a very conservative statistic)
* Danu killed and cut open to produce a river (a [[parturition]] creation myth, 3/11)

'''Cyclic myths'''
* Spring kills Winter, usually with his sprinkler or his striker (Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;559, found in 4/11 language groups)
* Cloud/cows stolen from the sun god by the wind god and then released (Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;232, 4/11)
* Death and rebirth of the (often grain-associated) [[life-death-rebirth deity]] causes the seasons; Frazer calls him the &quot;Dying Corn God&quot; (Frazer, Vol. 8 and 9 of the ''Golden Bough'' esp. Vol. 9, pp.&amp;nbsp;412–423; 4/11)
* Uncle Water melts the ice and releases the water causing flooding (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1995, 5/11)
* Quest of the golden apples of immortality, usually by a wind god (Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;512, 4/11)

'''Culture myths'''
* Culture myths, stories in which some godlike being teaches the &quot;arts of civilization&quot; (actually technologies) to humans, are found in all cultures.  The culture myths of the Indo-Europeans tell how the [[Culture hero|culture god]]s taught humans such arts as how to make fire, the proper way to kill and butcher an animal (sacrifice), religious rituals and law codes, smithing, weaving, ploughing, and healing.  Culture-giving figures (e.g. [[Prometheus]] and [[Loki]]) sometimes have an intermediate position between gods and humans (i.e., [[demigod]]s).  They are certainly supernatural, but they often die or are tortured by other gods for their beneficence to humans; nevertheless they are often revived and worshipped like regular gods or revered as [[hero]]es.  Mallory and Adams call them Craft Gods and argue that they are not linguistically reconstructible; however, Cox compares Greek Prometheus with Hindu Pramanthu (Cox, p.&amp;nbsp;421).  Smith gods, a subset of the culture gods, are slightly reconstructible according to Mallory and Adams.

==Ritual==

[[Émile Benveniste]] states that &quot;there is no common [IE] term to designate religion itself, or cult, or the priest, not even one of the personal gods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Indo-European Language and Society'' by Émile Benveniste (transl. by Elizabeth Palmer, pp. 445–6; orig. title ''Le vocabulaire des institutions Indo-Européennes'', 1969), University of Miami Press, Coral Gables, Florida, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are, however, terms denoting ritual practice reconstructed in [[Indo-Iranian religion]] which have root cognates in other branches, hinting at common PIE concepts. Thus,  the stem *''hrta''-, usually translated as &quot;([[cosmos|cosmic]]) order&quot; (Vedic [[ŗta]] and Iranian [[Asha|arta]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1995 p. 810; c.f. Hittite ''ara'', UL ''ara'', &lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;''Ara'' (a Hittite goddess).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This sounds like art, order, rite, and ritual.--[[User:thecurran]]2009-11-07--&gt;
Benveniste states, &quot;We have here one of the cardinal notions of the legal world of the Indo-Europeans to say nothing of their religious and moral ideas&quot; (pp.&amp;nbsp;379–381).  He also adds that an abstract suffix -tu formed the Vedic stem ''[[ŗtu]]-'', Avestan ''ratu-'' which designated order, particularly in the seasons and periods of time and which appears in Latin ''ritus'' &quot;[[:wikt:rite|rite]]&quot; and Sanskrit ''ritu''.

The following  list of reconstructed PIE religious terms is based on [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|EIEC]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EIEC&quot;&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]'', [[J.P. Mallory]] and Douglas Q. Adams, ed., Fitzroy Dearborn, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lyle Campbell&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyle&quot;&gt;''Historical Linguistics, An Introduction,'' by Lyle Campbell, The MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 2004, pp. 391-392; see also Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1995, pp. 832-7, ritual language.&lt;/ref&gt;

* *''werb&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;-'' ‘sacred enclosure’

==Development==
The various Indo-European daughter-cultures continued elements of PIE religion, syncretizing it with innovations and foreign elements, notably [[Ancient Near East]]ern and [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] elements, the reforms of [[Zoroaster]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and the spread of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].
