{{TULIP}}

'''Limited atonement''' (or '''definite atonement''' or '''particular redemption''') is a [[doctrine]] accepted in some [[Christian theology|Christian theological traditions]]. It is particularly associated with the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] tradition and is one of the [[five points of Calvinism]]. The doctrine states that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ's]] [[substitutionary atonement]] on the [[Christian cross|cross]] is specifically designed for the elect only, that He only died for them. This is in contrast to a belief that Christ  died for all, but while this atonement is sufficient for the salvation of all, it is only efficient for the elect,  those who receive Christ, these being [[predestination|predestined]] unto [[salvation]].  Thus its primary benefits are not given to all of [[humankind|humanity]] due to unbelief. However this is not a classical view. 

== The doctrine ==

The doctrine of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the doctrine of the nature of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. It also has much to do with the general [[predestination (Calvinism)|Calvinist view of predestination]]. Calvinists advocate the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction theory of the atonement]], which developed in the writings of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as [[penal substitution]], states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the [[sin]]s of men&amp;mdash;that is, Christ receives the wrath of God for sins and thereby cancels the judgment they had incurred.

The Calvinist view of [[predestination]] teaches that God created Adam in a state of original righteousness, but he fell into sin and all humanity in him as their [[Federal Head]]. Those elected to salvation were chosen without a view to their faith or good works but by the sovereign will of God.
The Calvinist atonement is called ''definite'' by some because they believe it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called ''limited'' in its extent because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, which is to say that no sin is too great to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic Baptists, the doctrine was usually known as ''particular redemption'', giving its adherents the name [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]]. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in ''general'' as [[General Baptist]]s believe.

=== Biblical passages ===

The classic [[Bible]] passage cited to prove a limited extent to the atonement is {{Bibleref2|John|10|ESV}} in which Jesus uses [[shepherd]]ing practices as a [[metaphor]] for his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would hear his voice and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd's voice.{{Bibleref2c|Jn|10:1-5|ESV}}. In that context, Jesus says, &quot;I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and I lay down my life ''for the sheep,''&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|14-15|ESV}} and he tells the [[Pharisee]]s that they &quot;do not believe because [they] are not part of [his] flock.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|10:26|ESV}} He continues, &quot;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.&quot; {{Bibleref2c-nb|Jn|10:27f|ESV}} Since Calvinists and nearly all Christians believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand {{Bibleref2|John|10|ESV}} to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way:

# Jesus lays down his life for the sheep.{{Bibleref2c|John|10:14-15|ESV}}
# Jesus will lose none of his sheep.{{Bibleref2c|John|10:28|ESV}}
# Many people will not receive eternal life.{{Bibleref2c|Mat|7:13-14|ESV}}
:Therefore, the Calvinist position is that Jesus did not die for everyone, but only for those whom the Father purposed to save.

Additionally, in the high priestly prayer, Jesus prays for the protection and [[sanctification]] of those who believed in him, and he explicitly excludes praying for all: &quot;I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|17:9b|ESV}}. Paul instructs the [[Elder (religious)|elder]]s in [[Ephesus]] &quot;to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood,&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Acts|20:28|ESV}} and he says in his letter to the same church that &quot;Christ loved the church and gave himself up ''for her.''&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:25|ESV}} Likewise, Jesus foreshadows that he will lay down his life &quot;for his friends,&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|15:13|ESV|Jon 15:13 cf. Jn 10:15}} and an [[angel]] tells Jesus' earthly father Joseph that he &quot;will save ''His people'' from their sins&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Mat|1:21|ESV}} Calvinists believe that these passages demonstrate that Jesus died for the church (that is, the elect) only.

=== Confessional positions ===

Chapter 3, paragraph 6 of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] says, &quot;Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.&quot;

The [[Canons of Dort]] assert that &quot;This death of God's Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world&quot; (Section 2, Article 3). Article 8 of the same section says
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For it was the entirely free plan and very gracious will and intention of God the Father that the enlivening and saving effectiveness of his Son's costly death should work itself out in all his chosen ones, in order that he might grant justifying faith to them only and thereby lead them without fail to salvation. In other words, it was God's will that Christ through the blood of the cross (by which he confirmed the new covenant) should effectively redeem from every people, tribe, nation, and language all those and only those who were chosen from eternity to salvation and given to him by the Father; that he should grant them faith (which, like the Holy Spirit's other saving gifts, he acquired for them by his death); that he should cleanse them by his blood from all their sins, both original and actual, whether committed before or after their coming to faith; that he should faithfully preserve them to the very end; and that he should finally present them to himself, a glorious people, without spot or wrinkle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objections to the doctrine ==

Limited atonement is contrasted with the view popularly termed ''hypothetical universalism'' or [[unlimited atonement]], which is advocated by [[Arminianism|Arminian]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheran]], [[Messianic Jewish]], and [[Roman Catholic]] theologians (among others) and which says Christ's work makes redemption possible for all but certain for none. (This doctrine should not be confused with concepts of [[universal reconciliation]], in which God loves and saves his entire creation.) Though Lutherans and Catholics share a similar doctrine of the nature of the atonement with Calvinists, they differ on its extent, whereas Arminians and Methodists generally accept an alternate theory of the nature of the atonement such as the [[Atonement (Governmental view)|moral government theory]]. The elect in such models are all the people who choose to avail themselves of God's gracious offer of salvation through Christ, not a pre-determined group. Thus, these systems place a limit on the efficacy of the atonement rather than on its extent, like Calvinists.

Historically, the Arminian Remonstrants raised this doctrine as a point of debate over predestination in the [[History of Calvinist-Arminian debate#Quinquarticular Controversy|Quinquarticular Controversy]], and their position was ultimately condemned by Calvinists at the [[Synod of Dort]] in 1619. In spite of opposition, the doctrine of the universal extent of the atonement became and remains prevalent outside of Calvinist circles. Even some Calvinistic Christians identify themselves as [[Amyraldism|Amyraldians]] or &quot;four point Calvinists&quot; and teach an unlimited atonement. In particular, Amyraldism teaches that God has provided Christ's atonement for all alike, but seeing that none would believe on his own, He elects those whom He will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of [[unconditional election]].

Calvin himself did not clearly articulate an opinion on this doctrine, which is nonetheless usually associated with his name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Kevin Dixon Kennedy |title=Union with Christ and the Extent of the Atonement in Calvin |location=New York |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Paul Hartog (2009). [http://www.baptistbulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/a-word-for-the-world.pdf A Word for the World: Calvin on the Extent of the Atonement]. Schaumburg: Regular Baptist Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but most modern Calvinists see it as a necessary consequence of his doctrines of election and the atonement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-highway.com/articleJuly02.html John Calvin's Position] by [[Paul Helm]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apuritansmind.com/Arminianism/NicoleRogerCalvinsLimitedAtonement.htm John Calvin’s View of the Extent of the Atonement] by [[Roger Nicole]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have contended that the doctrine of particular redemption implies that Christ's sacrifice was insufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world, but Calvinists have universally rejected this notion, instead holding that the value of the atonement is infinite but that God intentionally withholds its efficacious availability only to the elect.

=== Biblical passages ===

Several Biblical passages are urged by opponents as contradicting a doctrine of limited atonement (all quotes from the [[English Standard Version|ESV]], emphasis added):

* {{Bibleref2|John|1:29b}}: &quot;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of ''the world''!&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|John|3:16-17}}: &quot;For God so loved ''the world'', that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that ''the world'' might be saved through him.&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|2Cor|5:14-15||2 Corinthians 5”14-15}}: &quot;For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for ''all'', therefore all have died; and he died for ''all'', that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|1Tim|2:3-6||1 Timothy 2:3-6}}: &quot;This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants ''all'' men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for ''all'', which is the testimony given at the proper time.&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|1Timothy|4:10||1 Timothy 4:10}}: &quot;For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of ''all'' people, especially of those who believe.&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|Titus|2:11||Titus 2:11}}: &quot;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for ''all people''.&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|2Peter|2:1||2 Peter 2:1}}: &quot;But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even ''denying the Master who bought them,'' bringing upon themselves swift destruction.&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|2Peter|3:9||2 Peter 3:9}}: &quot;The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.&quot;
* {{Bibleref2|1John|2:2||1 John 2:2}}: &quot;He [Christ] is the [[propitiation]] for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the ''whole world''.&quot;

=== Rebuttal ===

Calvinists admit that these are difficult passages with respect to the extent of the atonement, but following the [[Protestant]] [[hermeneutic]] principle of letting [[analogy of faith|Scripture interpret Scripture]], they attempt to use their interpretations of other passages on election and other passages on the extent of the atonement to clarify the meaning of these difficult passages (one difficulty with this endeavor, which is always encountered in applying the principle of Scripture interpreting Scripture, is that it presupposes a framework can be established from other passages without any exegetical assumptions). According to this principle, since the word ''world'', for instance, is used at other places in the New Testament in a way obviously not intended to include every single person in the world (such as {{Bibleref2|Luke|2:1}} and {{Bibleref2|Romans|1:8}}), its meaning in any particular passage must be determined by the context. In particular, they understand ''all'' to refer to all of the elect (as in {{Bibleref2|2Cor|5:14-15||2 Corinthians 5:14-15}}) instead of every person in the world; or to refer to ''all'' qualitatively, instead of quantitatively, as in all [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] of people, not just [[Israelite]]s (as in {{Bibleref2|John|1:29}}; {{Bibleref2|John|3:16-17}}; {{Bibleref2|1Tim|2:6||1 Timothy 2:6}}; and {{Bibleref2|Titus|2:11}}); or to refer to the elect in all places throughout the world (as in {{Bibleref2|1Jn||1 John 2:2}}, where the words &quot;the sins of&quot; have been added to the last phrase by the ESV and other translations and literally reads &quot;but for the whole world&quot;, as in the [[New King James Version|NKJV]], [[American Standard Version|ASV]], the [[Vulgate]], etc.). They also posit that there can be different senses of the concept of salvation &amp;mdash; as simply the defense and preservation of temporal life (as they understand {{Bibleref2|1Tim|4:10||1 Timothy 4:10}}) or as salvation from God's wrath unto eternal life. Opponents of the view, such as Arminians, hold that such interpretations are read into the passages, rather than being their natural meanings; while admitting that words like &quot;world&quot; and &quot;all&quot; in the Bible do not always mean &quot;every human being,&quot; they maintain that there are no grounds for taking the terms in a limited sense here.

A related Calvinist approach understands scripture to speak of the atonement in two-fold manner, holding to the medieval formula that Christ's death was &quot;sufficient for all, but efficient for the elect.&quot; Under this approach, seemingly opposed scriptures are reconciled by classifying them as referring to either the sufficiency or the efficiency of the atonement.

Opponents offer alternate interpretations of the same passages which in turn support a universal atonement, and the disagreement has yet to find any significant resolution. Consequently, both limited and unlimited atonement views are still held in [[Christian theology]]. Limited views are typically restricted to Protestant denominations. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches both reject the view.

In the Lutheran confessions, the [[Formula of Concord]] on the article on the doctrine of election&lt;ref name=&quot;formulaconcord&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bookofconcord.org/sd-election.php#para5 |title=The Book of Concord, Formula of Concord |location=XI. Election, paragraph 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The eternal election of God, however, vel praedestinatio (or predestination), that is, God's ordination to salvation, does not extend at once over the godly and the wicked, but only over the children of God, who were elected and ordained to eternal life before the foundation of the world was laid, as Paul says, Eph. 1:4. 5: He hath chosen us in Him, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Canons of Dort]], one of the earliest Calvinist confessions, state in the Second Head, Article 8&lt;ref name=&quot;dort&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/dort.htm |title=Canons of Dort |location=SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 8. }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...]it was the will of God that Christ by the blood of the cross, whereby He confirmed the new covenant, should effectually redeem out of every people, tribe, nation, and language, all those, and those only, who were from eternity chosen to salvation and given to Him by the Father;[...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, James Arminius states in his works the following&lt;ref name=&quot;arminius-v1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/arminius/works1.iii.vi.i.html |title=Works of James Arminius, Vol. 1 |location=Sentiments on predestination, paragraph IV }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...]To these succeeds the fourth decree, by which God decreed to save and damn certain particular persons. This decree has its foundation in the foreknowledge of God, by which he knew from all eternity those individuals who would, through his preventing grace, believe, and, through his subsequent grace would persevere, according to the before described administration of those means which are suitable and proper for conversion and faith; and, by which foreknowledge, he likewise knew those who would not believe and persevere.[...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
