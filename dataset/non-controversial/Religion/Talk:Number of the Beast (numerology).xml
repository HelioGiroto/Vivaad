This article doesn't really need references.  It's claims are self evident.  Take out your caculator and try them out.  You'll see that they are accurate. --[[User:Pmcchesn|Pmcchesn]] 15:39, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

:The claims are self evident, I agree, but are they encyclopedic ? Or, more generally, do they really refer to the &quot;number of the beast&quot; ? It seems to me that they simply refer to the number 666, whatever meaning some people have attached to it. Actually, most of the &quot;properties&quot; of the number are already indicated in [[666 (number)]], so I'll suggest to merge the two articles together. [[User:Schutz|Schutz]] 11:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
::All the information contained in this article is now in [[666 (number)]]; if noone disagrees, I'll make a redirect out of it. [[User:Schutz|Schutz]]
:::[[666 (number)]] is a confusing page.  The page in question is better organized and contains only the information relevant to its stated topic, whereas the 666 (number) is really just a listing of trivia without a unifying theme (aside from 666).  [[Number of the Beast (numerology)]] is as &quot;encyclopedic&quot; as 666 (number) and certainly deals with a topic directly related to the perceived mystical aspects of the [[Number of the Beast]].  I see no reason to merge. [[User:Pmcchesn|Pmcchesn]] 18:52, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
::::How do prime numbers and their squares, the natural numbers between 1 and 36 and roman numbers relate to this beast your are talking about ? They are properties of the number 666 and nothing else and if the bible had not mentioned this number, they would exist in exactly the same way; the same is true of any other integer number. If you want to talk about the &quot;perceived mystical aspects&quot; of 666, then you have to cite sources which indicate why these mathematical properties are interesting from the mystical point of view, and not just &quot;random&quot; properties; otherwise, this is [[WP:NOR|original research]]. The only &quot;fact&quot; that is linked with the beast stuff is the joke on the sine; but it is probably not worth having an article just for a joke like this. [[User:Schutz|Schutz]] 19:35, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::I understand your point about this article not really relating to the number's religious connotations, but I donâ€™t think it represents original research.  Its claims are readily verifiable and have been published before (see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BeastNumber.html).  Furthermore, they are joked about commonly in the mathematical circles I have observed.  
:::::[[Number of the Beast (mathematical properties)]] might be a better title.  However, while I do not personally believe in numerology, I do believe that people attach supernatural significance to the topics discussed in this article.  But I'm not sure that I could find a reference demonstrating this.  Perhaps we should mark the article for deletion and put the decision to a vote with three possible courses of action:

:::::1) Keep the article and title intact.
:::::2) Merge the article to [[666 (number)]]
:::::3) Change the title to Number of the Beast (mathematical properties)

:::::What do you think? [[User:Pmcchesn|Pmcchesn]] 22:46, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
::::::Listing the article for deletion does not strike me as the best solution (since it is not one of the possible courses of action), but given that I don't see where else this could be discuted, I'd say: good idea, let's go for it. Can you do it, or do you want me to do it ? [[User:Schutz|Schutz]] 08:52, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

==Richard==
I grew up in a remote mountain area in China. I started to learn Chinese abacus when I was a little child. My grandpa told me to add up the first 36 numbers. Number 666 is a way to check whether I did correct abacus additions.

==JPII==
I deleted the section called &quot;JPII&quot;.  None of it, including the section's title itself, makes much sense to me.  Perhaps some additional explanation would make it more clear.  However, I believe this article should deal only with the numerical properties of 666 and not be based on any cultural aspects.  There other articles for that.</text>
