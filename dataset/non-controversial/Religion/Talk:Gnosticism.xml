== Gnostic Precedence ==

The first paragraph needs checking as it appears to be a complete reversal of the facts. Gnosticism as consistently taught, especially by the church, developed as a second century heresy but recent scolarship, Quispel and Pagels, has reversed that view. The existence of pre-Christian Jewish Gnosticism seems to flatly contradict the view that its a later development.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.121.32.109|2.121.32.109]] ([[User talk:2.121.32.109|talk]]) 23:26, 13 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Baroness Warsi Snub for Gnostics ==

Any links to her views on giving Gnostics a seat at the UK Government table? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:79.70.224.68|79.70.224.68]] ([[User talk:79.70.224.68|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/79.70.224.68|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:New stuff goes at the bottom.  I can find no [[WP:NOTE|notable]] [[WP:RS|mention]] of her discussing Gnosticism.  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 19:51, 20 February 2012 (UTC)
== Pre-1966 scholarship needs a flush down the pipe ==

Hi, we've talked about this before, but haven't been [[WP:BOLD]] and done it. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gnosticism&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=477988984&amp;oldid=477566052 changes I've made to lede] should be self-explanatory. But if not here's the explanation: There's too much Bibliobazaar style 1890-1940 material in the article. Interesting as historical curio, but completely irrelevant post Nag Hammadi. The next thing would be to go through tagging what isn't sourced. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 01:23, 21 February 2012 (UTC)
:Agree 100%. Also, I think there is a conspiracy-theory trend which runs through parts of the article, based on pseudo-scholarly world-views as opposed to modern critical scholarship.  That's why some of the invalid material keeps showing up - it's adherents keep attempting to introduce it back into the article.[[User:Jimhoward72|Jimhoward72]] ([[User talk:Jimhoward72|talk]]) 11:59, 21 February 2012 (UTC)
:Here is an example of the conspiracy-theory trend: [[Tempelhofgesellschaft]].  Amazingly, the article is categorized as &quot;gnostic&quot;. Throughout Wikipedia, there are a handful of articles of this type.[[User:Jimhoward72|Jimhoward72]] ([[User talk:Jimhoward72|talk]]) 21:38, 19 March 2012 (UTC)

== Rubbish Article ==

This reads as if it's been written by somebody attempting to show off how knowledgeable they are, with no intention of conferring that knowledge to others. A Wikipedia article is supposed to introduce a subject to new readers, not intentionally confuse everybody except those who already know what it's about.

Rewrite.--[[Special:Contributions/131.111.248.243|131.111.248.243]] ([[User talk:131.111.248.243|talk]]) 17:20, 6 May 2012 (UTC)
:The articles are intended to both introduce and to give deeper knowledge. If you think the introduction is sarce you are free to contribute with your knowledge to make the article better. That is the good with Wikipedia-we are ALL helping. [[User:Adville|Adville]] ([[User talk:Adville|talk]]) 08:58, 7 May 2012 (UTC)

::I think his point was he has nothing to contribute and this article did not help him with that.  It was a request for a better presentation for an unknowledgeable layperson, perhaps too aggressively worded. [[User:Mbarbier|Mbarbier]] ([[User talk:Mbarbier|talk]]) 14:48, 17 July 2012 (UTC)

:::Tend to agree with this. I don't know what Gnosticism is (hence why I came to the article in the first place) and to be honest, it didn't particularly help me to understand much about it. Sentences such as the one below are needlessly technical:

::::&quot;Gnosticism was primarily defined in Christian context, e.g., as &quot;the acute Hellenization of Christianity&quot; per Adolf von Harnack (1885), until Moritz Friedländer (1898) advocated Hellenistic Jewish origins, and Wilhelm Bousset (1907) advocated Persian origins.&quot;

:::There's no point in discussing the theory that gnosticism is the &quot;acute Hellenization of Christianity&quot; before people actually know what it is. I doubt half the people reading the article even know what Hellenization means (far less how it relates to gnosticism). It's a common problem with wikipedia articles - people forget that the aim is to communicate knowledge to a general audience, not to demonstrate that you're intelligent. I can understand the original user's frustration, even if it goes a little overboard. [[User:Bandanamerchant|Bandanamerchant]] ([[User talk:Bandanamerchant|talk]]) 16:30, 11 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
