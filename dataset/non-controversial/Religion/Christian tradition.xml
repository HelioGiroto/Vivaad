'''Christian tradition''' is a collection of [[tradition]]s of practices or beliefs associated with [[Christianity]] or groups with Christianity. These beliefs have more or less authority based on the nature of the practices or beliefs and on the group in question.

Many churches have traditional practices, such as particular patterns of worship or rites, that developed over time. Deviations from such patterns are sometimes considered unacceptable or [[heresy|heretical]]. Similarly, traditions can be stories or history that are or were widely accepted without being part of Christian doctrine, e.g., the [[crucifixion]] of [[Saint Peter]], which is widely believed to have happened but is not recorded in scripture. Similarly the names of the [[Magi]] who visited Jesus at his birth are thought to have been invented much later than the events; they are not considered authentic or obligatory, but can be considered a tradition.

Tradition also includes historic teaching of the recognized church authorities, such as [[Church Councils]] and ecclesiastical officials (e.g., the [[Pope]], [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], etc.), and includes the teaching of significant individuals like the [[Church Fathers]], the [[Protestant Reformers]], and founders of movements like [[John Wesley]]. Many [[creed]]s, confessions of faith, and [[catechism]]s generated by these bodies and individuals are also part of the traditions of various bodies.

==Tradition and ecclesial traditions==

The [[Catholic Church]] distinguishes between what it calls Apostolic Tradition (or Tradition with a capital T) and ecclesial traditions. In the course of time ecclesial traditions develop in theology, discipline, [[liturgy]], and devotions. These the Church may retain, modify or even abandon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 83]&lt;/ref&gt; Apostolic Tradition, on the other hand, is the teaching that was handed down by the apostles by word of mouth, by their example and &quot;by the institutions they established&quot;, among which is the [[apostolic succession]] of the [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]]: &quot;this living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called Tradition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PK.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 76-78]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of God, which has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 80]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches==

Among the [[Christianity#Main_grouping_of_Christianity|main groups of Christianity]], there are Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants. In the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Sacred Tradition]], but not &quot;ecclesial traditions&quot;, is considered official doctrine and of equal authoritative weight to the Bible. Among conservative [[Protestant]]s,  the [[Bible]] itself is the only final authority (see ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and ''[[prima scriptura]]''), but tradition still plays an important supporting role. All three groups generally accept the traditional developments on the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], for instance, and set bounds of orthodoxy and heresy based on that tradition. They also have developed creedal and confessional statements which summarize and develop their understanding of biblical teaching.
