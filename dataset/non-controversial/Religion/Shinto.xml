{{Nihongo|'''Shinto'''|神道|''Shintō''}} or '''Shintoism''', also '''''kami-no-michi''''',&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Shinto&lt;/ref&gt; is the indigenous spirituality of [[Japan]] and the people of Japan. It is a set of practices, to be carried out diligently, to establish a connection between present day Japan and its ancient past.&lt;ref&gt;John Nelson. ''A Year in the Life of a Shinto Shrine''. 1996. pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written historical records of the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' in the 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified &quot;Shinto religion&quot;, but rather to disorganized folklore, history, and mythology.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt; Shinto today is a term that applies to public shrines suited to various purposes such as war memorials, [[harvest festival]]s, romance, and historical monuments, as well as various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and ritual, dating from around the time of the [[Nara period|Nara]] and [[Heian period|Heian]] Periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

The word ''Shinto'' (&quot;Way of the Gods&quot;) was adopted from the written Chinese (神道, {{zh|p=shén dào}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Sokyo1962&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Shinto: The Kami Way |publisher=Charles E Tuttle Co |location=[[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, VT]] |first=Ono |last=Sokyo |edition=1st |year=1962 |pages=2 |isbn=0-8048-1960-2 |oclc=40672426}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining two ''[[kanji]]'': {{Nihongo|&quot;''shin''&quot;|神}}, meaning &quot;spirit&quot; or ''kami''; and {{Nihongo|&quot;''tō''&quot;|道}}, meaning a philosophical path or study (from the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''[[dào]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese Religion |publisher=Prentice Hall Inc |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |first=Robert Ellwood |last=Richard Pilgrim |edition=1st |year=1985 pages |isbn=0-13-509282-5 |unused_data=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sokyo1962&quot;/&gt; ''[[Kami]]'' are defined in English as &quot;spirits&quot;, &quot;essences&quot; or &quot;deities&quot;, that are associated with many understood formats; in some cases being human-like, in others being [[animistic]], and others being associated with more abstract &quot;natural&quot; forces in the world (mountains, rivers, lightning, wind, waves, trees, rocks). Kami and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

Fact books and statistics typically list some 80 to 90% of Japanese people as Shintoist&lt;ref name=&quot;'CIA Factbook: Japan'&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html 'CIA Factbook: Japan']&lt;/ref&gt; however polls suggest that most Japanese consider themselves non-religious and believe that there are currently only 4 million &quot;actual&quot; observers of Shinto in Japan,.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of people in Japan who take part in Shinto rituals also practice [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rituals. However Shinto does not actually require professing faith to be a believer or a practitioner a person who practices &quot;any&quot; manner of Shinto rituals may be so counted, and as such it is difficult to query for exact figures based on self-identification of belief within Japan. Another problem is that Shinto is sometimes seen more as a way of life rather than a religion by the Japanese due to its long historical and cultural significance. Due to the syncretic nature of Shinto and Buddhism, most &quot;life&quot; events are handled by Shinto and &quot;death&quot; or &quot;afterlife&quot; events are handled by Buddhism—for example, it is typical in Japan to register or celebrate a birth at a Shinto shrine, while funeral arrangements are generally dictated by Buddhist tradition—although the division is not exclusive.   According to Nobutaka (2003):
:&quot;In modern scholarship, the term is often used with reference to kami worship and related theologies, rituals and practices. In these contexts, ‘Shinto’ takes on the meaning of ‘Japan’s traditional religion’, as opposed to foreign religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and so forth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Inoue Nobutaka, ''Shinto, a Short History'' (2003) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation myth==
{{Main|Japanese creation myth}}
[[Image:Kobayashi Izanami and izanagi.jpg|Izanami-no-Mikoto and Izanagi-no-Mikoto, by Kobayashi Eitaku, late 19th century|thumb|175 px|left]]
The [[creation myth]] of Shinto is recorded in the ca. 712 [[Kojiki]]. It is a depiction of the events leading up to and including the creation of the Japanese Islands. There are many translations of the story with variations of complexity.

*Izanagi-no-Mikoto (male) and Izanami-no-Mikoto (female) were called by all the myriad gods and asked to help each other to create a new land which was to become Japan.
*They were given a spear with which they stirred the water, and when removed water dripped from the end, an island was created in the great nothingness.
*They lived on this island, and created a palace and within was a large pole.
*When they wished to bear offspring, they performed a ritual each rounding a pole, male to the left and female to the right, the female greeting the male first.
*They had 2 children (islands) which turned out badly and they cast them out. They decided that the ritual had been done incorrectly the first time.
*They repeated the ritual but according to the correct laws of nature, the male spoke first.
*They then gave birth to the 8 perfect islands of the Japanese archipelago.
*After the islands, they gave birth to the other Kami, Izanami-no-Mikoto dies and Izanagi-no-Mikoto tries to revive her.
*His attempts to deny the laws of life and death have bad consequences.

The islands of Japan are to be considered a paradise as they were directly created by the gods for the people of Japan, and were ordained by the higher spirits to be created into the Japanese empire. Shinto is the fundamental connection between the power and beauty of nature (the land) and the people of Japan. It is the manifestation of a path to understanding the institution of divine power.

==Kami==
{{Main|Kami}}
Shinto teaches that everything contains a {{Nihongo|kami|神|&quot;spiritual essence&quot;|commonly translated as god or spirit}}. Shinto's spirits are collectively called {{Nihongo|''yaoyorozu no kami''|八百万の神}}, an expression literally meaning &quot;eight million kami&quot;, but interpreted as meaning &quot;myriad&quot;, although it can be translated as &quot;many Kami&quot;. There is a phonetic variation ''kamu'' and a similar word among Ainu ''[[kamui]]''. There is an analog &quot;''mi-koto''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20100314x1.html In the land of the ''kami''], ''[[Japan Times]]'', March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kami is generally accepted to describe the innate supernatural force that is above the actions of man, the realm of the sacred, and is inclusive of gods, spirit figures, and human ancestors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} All mythological creatures of the Japanese cultural tradition, of the Buddhistic tradition, [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], [[Hindu deities|Hindu gods]], [[God in Islam|Islamic]] [[Allah]], various angels and demons of all faiths among others are considered Kami for the purpose of Shinto faith.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The kami reside in all things, but certain places are designated for the interface of people and kami (the common world and the sacred): ''sacred nature'', ''shrines'', and ''kamidana''. There are natural places considered to have an unusually sacred spirit about them, and are objects of worship. They are frequently mountains, trees, unusual rocks, rivers, waterfalls, and other natural edifices. In most cases they are on or near a shrine grounds. The shrine is a building built in which to house the kami, with a separation from the &quot;ordinary&quot; world through sacred space with defined features based on the age and lineage of the shrine. The ''kamidana'' is a home shrine (placed on a wall in the home) that is a &quot;kami residence&quot; that acts as a substitute for a large shrine on a daily basis. In each case the object of worship is considered a sacred space inside which the kami spirit actually dwells, being treated with the utmost respect and deference.

==Types==
To distinguish between these different focuses of emphasis within Shinto, many feel it is important to separate Shinto into different types of Shinto expression.
*{{Nihongo|'''Shrine Shinto'''|神社神道|jinja-shintō}} is the most prevalent of the Shinto types. It has always been a part of Japan's history and constitutes the main current of Shinto tradition. Shrine Shinto is associated in the popular imagination with summer festivals, good luck charms, making wishes, holding groundbreaking ceremonies, and showing support for the nation of Japan. Before the Meiji Restoration, shrines were disorganized institutions usually attached to Buddhist temples, but they were claimed by the government during the imperial period for patriotic use and systematized. The successor to the imperial organization, the [[Association of Shinto Shrines]], oversees about 80,000 shrines nationwide.
*{{Nihongo|'''Imperial Household Shinto'''|皇室神道|Kōshitsu-shintō}} are the religious rites performed exclusively by the Imperial Family at the three shrines on the Imperial grounds, including the Ancestral Spirits Sanctuary (Kōrei-den) and the Sanctuary of the Kami (Shin-den).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sokyo1962&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Shinto: The Kami Way |publisher=Charles E Tuttle Co |location=[[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, VT]] |first=Ono |last=Sokyo |edition=1st |year=1962 |pages=13 |isbn=0-8048-1960-2 |oclc=40672426}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Nihongo|'''Folk Shinto'''|民俗神道|minzoku-shintō}} includes the numerous but fragmented folk beliefs in deities and spirits. Practices include [[divination]], [[spirit possession]], and [[shaman]]ic healing. Some of their practices come from  [[Buddhism]], or [[Confucianism]], but most come from ancient local traditions.
*{{Nihongo|'''Sect Shinto'''|宗派神道|shūha-shintō}} is a legal designation originally created in the 1890s to separate government-owned shrines from local religious practices. They do not have shrines, but conduct religious activities in meeting halls. Shinto sects include the mountain-worship sects, who focus on worshipping mountains like [[Mount Fuji]], [[faith healing|faith-healing]] sects, [[Ritual purification|purification]] sects, Confucian sects, and Revival Shinto sects. The remainder of Sectarian Shinto is [[New Sect Shintoists|New Sect Shinto]]. The current groups of Sect Shinto are [[Kurozumikyo]], Shinto Shuseiha, Izumo Oyashirokyo, Fusokyo, Jikkokyo, Shinshukyo, Shinto Taiseikyo, Ontakekyo, Shinto Taikyo, Misogikyo, Shinrikyo and [[Konkokyo]]. An association of Sect Shintoists also exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Q_K81HQFoyoC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=%22New+Sect%22+Shinto#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20Sect%22%20Shinto&amp;f=false | title = Excel senior high school studies of religion | isbn = 978-1-74020-241-1 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = Louise | date = 2001-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Nihongo|'''[[Koshintō]]'''|古神道|ko-shintō}}, literally &quot;Old Shinto&quot;, is a reconstructed &quot;Shinto from before the time of Buddhism&quot;, today based on [[Ainu religion]] and [[Ryukyuan religion|Ryukyuan practices]]. It continues the Restoration movement begun by [[Hirata Atsutane]].

All these main types of Shinto and some subtypes have given birth to many and diverse schools and sects since [[medieval]] times to the present days. A list of the most relevant can be found at the article [[Shinto sects and schools]].

The principal worship of ''kami'' is done at public shrines or worship at small home shrines called ''[[kamidana]]'' (神棚, lit. &quot;god-shelf&quot;). The public shrine is a building or place that functions as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for ''kami''. A fewer number of shrines are also natural places called ''mori''. The most common of the ''mori'' are sacred groves of trees, or mountains, or waterfalls. All shrines are open to the public at some times or throughout the year.

While many of the public shrines are elaborate structures, all are characteristic Japanese architectural styles of different periods depending on their age. Shrines are fronted by a distinctive Japanese gate (鳥居, ''[[torii]]'') made of two uprights and two crossbars denoting the separation between common space and sacred space. The ''torii'' have 20 styles and matching buildings based on the enshrined kami and lineage.

There are a number of symbolic and real barriers that exist between the normal world and the shrine grounds including: statues of protection, gates, fences, ropes, and other delineations of ordinary to sacred space. Usually there will be only one or sometimes two approaches to the Shrine for the public and all will have the ''torii'' over the way. In shrine compounds, there are a ''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' (拝殿) or public hall of worship, ''[[heiden (Shinto)|heiden]]'' (幣殿) or hall of offerings and the ''[[honden]]'' (本殿). The innermost precinct of the grounds is the ''honden'' or worship hall, which is entered only by the high priest, or worshippers on certain occasions. The ''honden'' houses the symbol of the enshrined ''kami''.

The heart of the shrine is periodic rituals, spiritual events in parishioners' lives, and festivals. All of this is organized by priests who are both [[Conduit (spiritualism)|spiritual conduit]]s and administrators. Shrines are private institutions, and are supported financially by the congregation and visitors. Some shrines may have festivals that attract hundreds of thousands, especially in the New Year season.

==Beliefs==

===Impurity===
Shinto teaches that certain deeds create a kind of [[Ritual purification|ritual impurity]] that one should want cleansed for one's own peace of mind and good fortune rather than because impurity is wrong. Wrong deeds are called {{nihongo|&quot;impurity&quot;|穢れ|[[kegare]]}}, which is opposed to {{Nihongo|&quot;purity&quot;|清め|kiyome}}. Normal days are called &quot;day&quot; (''ke''), and festive days are called &quot;sunny&quot; or, simply, &quot;good&quot; (''hare'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Sugimoto1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Japanese Society |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge (town), New York|Cambridge, NY]] |first=Yoshio |last=Sugimoto |year=1997 |pages=230–231 |isbn=0-521-41692-2 |oclc=35008178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are killed without being shown gratitude for their sacrifice will hold a {{Nihongo|grudge|怨み|urami}} (grudge) and become powerful and evil ''kami'' who seek revenge (''aragami'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Additionally, if anyone is injured on the grounds of a shrine, the area must be ritually purified.

[[Image:NikkoPaperOffering5174.jpg|[[Haraegushi]] (祓串) for purification|thumb|180px]]

===Purification===
[[Ritual purification|Purification]] rites called [[Harae]] are a vital part of Shinto. They are done on a daily, weekly, seasonal, lunar, and annual basis. These rituals are the lifeblood{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} of the practice of Shinto. Such ceremonies have also been adapted to modern life. New buildings made in Japan are frequently [[blessing|blessed]] by a Shinto priest called {{nihongo||神主|[[kannushi]]}} during the groundbreaking ceremony (Jichinsai 地鎮祭), and many cars made in Japan have been blessed as part of the assembly process. Moreover, many Japanese businesses built outside Japan have had ceremonies performed by a Shinto priest, with occasionally an annual visitation by the priest to re-purify.

===Afterlife===
It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a [[Japanese funeral|Buddhist funeral]] at the time of death mostly due to the negative Japanese conception of the afterlife and death as well as buddhism's historical monopoly on funeral rites. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' is very close to the Greek [[Hades]] however later myths include notions of resurrection and even elysium-like descriptions such as with the legend of Okuninushi and Susanoo. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called &quot;kegare&quot;. However death is also viewed as a path towards apotheosis in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor Ojin who was enshrined as Hachiman the God of War after his death.

Unlike many religions, one does not need to publicly profess belief in Shinto to be a believer. Whenever a child is born in Japan, a local [[Shinto shrine]] adds the child's name to a list kept at the shrine and declares him or her a {{Nihongo|&quot;family child&quot;|氏子|ujiko}}. After death an ''ujiko'' becomes a {{Nihongo|&quot;family spirit&quot;, or &quot;family ''kami''&quot;|氏神|ujigami}}. One may choose to have one's name added to another list when moving and then be listed at both places. Names can be added to the list without consent and regardless of the beliefs of the person added to the list. This is not considered an imposition of belief, but a sign of being welcomed by the local ''kami'', with the promise of addition to the pantheon of ''kami'' after death.

==Practices==

===Omairi===
[[Image:ItsukushimaBasin7406.jpg|thumb|left|''Temizu Basin—Itsukushima Jinja'']]
Any person may visit a shrine and one need not be &quot;Shinto&quot; to do this.  Doing so is called Omairi.
Typically there are a few basic steps to visiting a shrine.
*At any entrance gate, bow respectfully before passing through.
*If there is a hand washing basin provided, perform Temizu: take the dipper in your right hand and scoop up water. Pour some onto your left hand, then transfer the dipper to your left hand and pour some onto your right hand. Transfer the dipper to your right hand again, cup your left palm, and pour water into it, from which you will take the water into your mouth (never drink directly from the dipper), silently swish it around in your mouth (do not drink), then quietly spit it out into your cupped left hand (not into the reservoir). Then, holding the handle of the dipper in both hands, turn it vertically so that the remaining water washes over the handle. Then replace it where you found it.
*Approach the shrine; if there is a bell, you may ring the bell first (or after depositing a donation); if there is a box for donations, leave a modest one in relation to your means; then bow twice, clap twice, and hold the second clap with your hands held together in front of your heart for a closing bow after your prayers.
*There is variation in how this basic visitation may go, and depending on the time of year and holidays there may also be other rituals attached to visitations.
*Be sincere and respectful to the staff and other visitors, and if at all possible, be quiet. Do be aware that there are places one should not go on the shrine grounds. Do not wear shoes inside any buildings.

===Harae===
The rite of ritual purification usually done daily at a shrine is a ceremony of offerings and prayers of several forms. Shinsen (food offerings of fruit, fish, vegetables), Tamagushi (Sakaki Tree Branches), Shio (salt), Gohan (rice), Mochi (rice paste), and Sake (rice wine) are all typical offerings. On holidays and other special occasions the inner shrine doors may be opened and special offerings made.

===Water purification===
Misogi harai or Misogi Shūhō (禊修法) is the term for water purification.

The practice of purification by ritual use of water while reciting prayers is typically done daily by regular practitioners, and when possible by lay practitioners. There is a defined set of prayers and physical activities that precede and occur during the ritual. This will usually be performed at a shrine, in a natural setting, but can be done anywhere there is clean running water.

The basic performance of this is the hand and mouth washing (Temizu 手水) done at the entrance to a shrine. The more dedicated believer may purify him- or herself by standing beneath a waterfall or performing ritual [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] in a river. This practice comes from Shinto history, when the kami Izanagi-no-Mikoto first performed misogi after returning from the land of Yomi, where he was made impure by Izanami-no-Mikoto after her death.

===Imi===
Another form of ritual cleanliness is avoidance, which means that a [[taboo]] is placed upon certain persons or acts. To illustrate, one would not visit a shrine if a close relative in the household had died recently. Killing is generally unclean and is to be avoided. When one is performing acts that harm the land or other living things, prayers and rituals are performed to placate the Kami of the area. This type of cleanliness is usually performed to prevent ill outcomes.

===Amulets and protective items===
[[Image:KasugaTaisha2.jpg|thumb|A woman tying her fortune (''omikuji'') at [[Kasuga Shrine]]]]
{{Main|Ema (Shinto)}}
Ema are small wooden plaques that wishes or desires are written upon and left at a place in the shrine grounds so that one may get a wish or desire fulfilled. They have a picture on them and are frequently associated with the larger Shrines.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Handy Bilingual Reference For Kami and Jinja |first= Study Group of Shinto Culture |year=2006 |publisher=International Cultural Workshop Inc. |location=Tokyo |pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ofuda]]'' are talismans—made of paper, wood, or metal—that are issued at shrines. They are inscribed with the names of [[kami]]s and are used for protection in the home. They are typically placed in the home at a [[kamidana]]. Ofuda may be kept anywhere, as long as they are in their protective pouches, but there are several rules about the proper placement of kamidana. They are also renewed annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

''[[Omamori]]'' are personal-protection amulets that sold by shrines. They are frequently used to  ward off bad luck and to gain  better health.  More recently,  there are also amulets to promote good driving, good business, and success at school. Their history lies with Buddhist practice of selling amulets.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

''[[Omikuji]]'' are paper lots upon which personal fortunes are written.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

A ''daruma'' is a round, paper doll of the Indian monk, [[Bodhidharma]]. The recipient makes a wish and paints one eye; when the goal is accomplished, the recipient paints the other eye. While this is a Buddhist practice, darumas can be found at shrines, as well. These dolls are very common.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Other protective items include ''dorei'', which are earthenware bells that are used to pray for good fortune. These bells are usually in the shapes of the zodiacal animals:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; ''hamaya'', which are symbolic arrows for the fight against evil and bad luck;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; and ''Inuhariko'', which are paper dogs that are used to induce and to bless good births.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Kagura===
[[Image:Niiname-sai,traditional Japanese dance,katori-jingu-shrine,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|left|''Kagura traditional dance, Katori Jingu, Katori City'']]
''[[Kagura]]'' is the ancient Shinto ritual dance of [[shamanic]] origin. The word &quot;kagura&quot; is thought to be a contracted form of ''kami no kura'' or &quot;seat of the kami&quot; or the &quot;site where the kami is received.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazushige Kobayashi|Kobayashi, Kazushige]]; [[Peter Knecht|Knecht, Peter]], &quot;On the Meaning of Masked Dances in Kagura&quot;, ''Asian Folklore Studies'' 40 (1): 1, 1981, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[mythology|mythological]] tale of how ''kagura'' dance came into existence. The sun goddess [[Amaterasu]] became very upset at her brother so she hid in a cave. All of the other gods and goddesses were concerned and wanted her to come outside. Ame-no-uzeme began to dance and create a noisy commotion in order to entice Amaterasu to come out. The kami (gods) tricked Amaterasu by telling her there was a better sun goddess in the heavens. Amaterasu came out and light returned to the universe.

Music plays a very important role in the ''kagura'' performance. Everything from the setup of the instruments to the most subtle sounds and the arrangement of the music is crucial to encouraging the kami to come down and dance. The songs are used as magical devices to summon the gods and as prayers for blessings. Rhythm patterns of five and seven are common, possibly relating to the Shinto belief of the twelve generations of heavenly and earthly deities. There is also vocal accompaniment called ''kami uta'' in which the drummer sings sacred songs to the gods. Often the vocal accompaniment is overshadowed by the drumming and instruments, reinforcing that the vocal aspect of the music is more for [[incantation]] rather than [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Averbuch]], [[Irit]], ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', [[Ithaca]], NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, pp.83–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both ancient Japanese collections, the [[Nihongi]] and [[Kojiki]], Ame-no-uzeme’s dance is described as ''asobi'', which in old Japanese language means a ceremony that is designed to appease the spirits of the departed, and which was conducted at funeral ceremonies. Therefore, ''kagura'' is a rite of ''tama shizume'', of pacifying the spirits of the departed. In the Heian period (8th–12th centuries) this was one of the important rites at the Imperial Court and had found its fixed place in the ''tama shizume'' festival in the eleventh month. At this festival people sing as accompaniment to the dance: “Depart! Depart! Be cleansed and go! Be purified and leave!”&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Kazushige; Knecht, Peter, &quot;On the Meaning of Masked Dances in Kagura&quot;, ''Asian Folklore Studies'' 40 (1): 1, 1981, pp.4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
This rite of purification is also known as ''chinkon''. It was used for securing and strengthening the soul of a dying person. It was closely related to the ritual of ''tama furi'' (shaking the spirit), to call back the departed soul of the dead or to energize a weakened spirit. Spirit pacification and rejuvenation were usually achieved by songs and dances, also called ''asobi''. The ritual of ''chinkon'' continued to be performed on the emperors of Japan, thought to be descendents of Amaterasu. It is possible that this ritual is connected with the ritual to revive the sun goddess during the low point of the winter solstice.&lt;ref&gt;Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a division between the ''kagura'' that is performed at the Imperial palace and the shrines related to it, and the ''kagura'' that is performed in the countryside. Folk ''kagura'', or ''kagura'' from the countryside is divided according to region. The following descriptions relate to ''sato kagura'', ''kagura'' that is from the countryside. The main types are: ''miko kagura'', ''Ise kagura'', ''Izumo kagura'', and ''shishi kagura''.

'''''Miko kagura''''' is the oldest type of ''kagura'' and is danced by women in Shinto shrines and during folk festivals. The ancient [[miko]] were shamanesses, but are now considered priestesses in the service of the Shinto Shrines. ''Miko kagura'' originally was a shamanic trance dance, but later, it became an art and was interpreted as a prayer dance. It is performed in many of the larger Shinto shrines and is characterized by slow, elegant, circular movements, by emphasis on the four directions and by the central use of torimono (objects dancers carry in their hands), especially the fan and bells.&lt;ref&gt;Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ise kagura''''' is a collective name for rituals that are based upon the ''yudate'' (boiling water rites of [[Shugendō]] origin) ritual. It includes ''miko'' dances as well as dancing of the ''torimono'' type. The ''kami'' are believed to be present in the pot of boiling water, so the dancers dip their ''torimono'' in the water and sprinkle it in the four directions and on the observers for purification and blessing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Averbuch, Irit 1995, p. 16&quot;&gt;Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Izumo kagura''''' is centered in the Sada shrine of Izumo, Shimane prefecture. It has two types: ''torimono ma'', unmasked dances that include held objects, and ''shinno'' (sacred No), dramatic masked dances based on myths. ''Izumo kagura'' appears to be the most popular type of ''kagura''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Averbuch, Irit 1995, p. 16&quot;/&gt;

'''''Shishi kagura''''' also known as the Shugen-No tradition, uses the dance of a ''shishi'' (lion or mountain animal) mask as the image and presence of the deity. It includes the ''Ise daikagura'' group and the ''yamabushi kagura'' and ''bangaku'' groups of the Tohoku area (Northeastern Japan). ''Ise daikagura'' employs a large red Chinese type of lion head which can move its ears. The lion head of the ''yamabushi kagura'' schools is black and can click its teeth. Unlike other ''kagura'' types in which the ''kami'' appear only temporarily, during the ''shishi kagura'' the ''kami'' is constantly present in the shishi head mask. During the Edo period, the lion dances became showy and acrobatic losing its touch with spirituality. However, the ''yamabushi kagura'' tradition has retained its ritualistic and religious nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Averbuch, Irit 1995, p. 16&quot;/&gt;

Originally, the practice of ''kagura'' involved authentic possession by the ''kami'' invoked. In modern day Japan it appears to be difficult to find authentic ritual possession, called ''kamigakari'', in ''kagura'' dance. However, it is common to see choreographed possession in the dances. Actual possession is not taking place but elements of possession such as losing control and high jumps are applied in the dance.

==History==

===Historical records===
There is no core sacred text in Shinto, as the [[Bible]] is in [[Christianity]] or [[Qur'an]] is in [[Islam]]. Instead there are books of [[folklore|lore]] and [[history]] which provide stories and background to many Shinto beliefs.

*The [[Kojiki]] (Record of Ancient Matters) The foundation to written Shinto history.
*The [[Shoku Nihongi]] and its [[Nihon Shoki]] (Continuing Chronicles of Japan)
*The [[Rikkokushi]] (Six National Histories) which includes the Shoku Nihongi and Nihon Shoki
*The [[Jinnō Shōtōki]] (a study of Shinto and Japanese politics and history) written in the 14th century

===Origins===
{{further2|[[Koshinto]]}}
Shinto has very ancient roots in the Japanese islands. The recorded history dates to the [[Kojiki]] (712) and [[Nihon Shoki]] (720), but archeological records date back significantly further. Both are compilations of prior oral traditions. The Kojiki establishes the [[Japanese imperial family]] as the foundation of Japanese culture, being the descendants of Amaterasu Omikami{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. There is also a [[creation myth]] and a [[genealogy]] of the gods. The Nihonshoki was more interested in creating a structural system of government, foreign policy, religious hierarchy, and domestic social order.

There is an internal system of historical Shinto development that configures the relationships between Shinto and other religious practices over its long history; the inside and outside [[Kami]] (spirits). The inside or ''ujigami'' (''uji'' meaning clan) Kami roles that supports cohesion and continuation of established roles and patterns; and the ''hitogami'' or outside Kami, bringing innovation, new beliefs, new messages, and some instability.

[[Jomon]] peoples of Japan used natural housing, predated rice farming, and frequently were hunter-gatherers, the physical evidence for ritual practices are difficult to document. There are many locations of stone ritual structures, refined burial practices and early [[Torii]] that lend to the continuity of primal Shinto. The Jomon had a clan-based tribal system developed similar to much of the worlds indigenous people. In the context of this clan based system, local beliefs developed naturally and when assimilation between clans occurred, they also took on some beliefs of the neighboring tribes. At some point there was a recognition that the ancestors created the current generations and the reverence of ancestors (''tama'') took shape. There was some trade amongst the indigenous peoples within Japanese islands and the mainland, as well as some varying migrations. The trade and interchange of people helped the growth and complexity of the peoples spirituality by exposure to new beliefs. The natural spirituality of the people appeared to be based on the worship of nature forces or ''mono'', and the natural elements to which they all depended.

The gradual introduction of methodical religious and government organizations from mainland Asia starting around 300 BCE seeded the reactive changes in primal Shinto over the next 700 years to a more formalized system. These changes were directed internally by the various clans frequently as a syncratic cultural event to outside influences. Eventually as the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] gained power a formalization process began. The genesis of the Imperial household and subsequent creation of the Kojiki helped facilitate the continuity needed for this long term development through modern history. There is today a balance between outside influences of [[Buddhist]], [[Confucian]], [[Taoism in Japan|Taoist]], [[Abrahamic]], [[Hindu]] and [[secular]] beliefs. In more modern times Shinto has developed new branches and forms on a regular basis, including leaving Japan.

===Jomon Period===
By the end of the [[Jōmon period]], a dramatic shift had taken place according to archaeological studies. New arrivals from the continent seem to have invaded Japan from the West, bringing with them new technologies such as rice farming and metallurgy. The settlements of the new arrivals seem to have coexisted with those of the Jōmon for some time. Under these influences, the incipient cultivation of the Jōmon evolved into sophisticated rice-paddy farming and government control. Many other elements of Japanese culture also may date from this period and reflect a mingled migration from the northern Asian continent and the southern Pacific areas. Among these elements are Shinto mythology, marriage customs, architectural styles, and technological developments such as lacquerware, textiles, laminated bows, metalworking, and glass making. The Jōmon is succeeded by the Yayoi period.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

===Yayoi Period===
Japanese culture begins to develop in no small part due to influences from mainland trade and immigration from China. During this time in the pre-writing historical period, objects from the mainland start appearing in large amounts, specifically mirrors, swords, and jewels. All three of these have a direct connection to the imperial divine status as they are the symbols of imperial divinity and are Shinto honorary objects. Also the rice culture begins to blossom throughout Japan and this leads to the settlement of society, and seasonal reliance of crops. Both of these changes are highly influential on the Japanese people's relationship to the natural world, and likely development of a more complex system of religion. This is also the period that is referenced as the beginning of the divine imperial family. The [[Yayoi]] culture was a clan based culture that lived in compounds with a defined leader who was the chief and head priest. They were responsible for the relationship with their &quot;gods&quot; [[Kami]] and if one clan conquered another, their &quot;god&quot; would be assimilated. The earliest records of Japanese culture were written by Chinese traders who described this land as &quot;Wa&quot;. This time period led to the creation of the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] culture and development of formal Shinto practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

The development of ''niiname'' or the (now) Shinto harvest festival is attributed to this period as offerings for good harvests of similar format (typically rice) become common.

===Kofun Period===
The great bells and drums, [[Kofun]] burial mounds, and the founding of the imperial family are important to this period. This is the period of the development of the feudal state, and the Yamato and Izumo cultures. Both of these dominant cultures have a large and central shrine which still exists today, [[Ise Shrine]] in the South West and [[Izumo Taisha]] in the North East. This time period is defined by the increase of central power in Naniwa, now [[Osaka]], of the feudal lord system. Also there was an increasing influence of Chinese culture which profoundly changed the practices of government structure, social structure, burial practices, and warfare. The Japanese also held close alliance and trade with the [[Gaya confederacy]] which was in the south of the peninsula. The [[Paekche]] in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] had political alliances with Yamato, and in the 5th century imported the Chinese writing system to record Japanese names and events for trade and political records. In 513 they sent a Confucian scholar to the court to assist in the teachings of Confucian thought. In 552 or 538 a [[Buddhism|Buddha]] image was given to the Yamato leader which profoundly changed the course of Japanese religious history, especially in relation to the undeveloped native religious conglomeration that was Shinto. In the latter 6th century, there was a breakdown of the alliances between Japan and Paekche but the influence led to the codification of Shinto as the native religion in opposition to the extreme outside influences of the mainland. Up to this time Shinto had been largely a clan ('uji') based religious practice, exclusive to each clan.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

===Asuka Period===
[[Yin and Yang|The Theory of Five Elements in Yin and Yang philosophy]] of [[Taoism]] and the [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]] had a profound impact on the development of a unified system of Shinto beliefs. In the early [[Nara period]], the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki'' were written by compiling existing myths and legends into a unified account of [[Japanese mythology]]. These accounts were written with two purposes in mind: the introduction of [[Taoist]], [[Confucian]], and Buddhist themes into Japanese religion; and garnering support for the legitimacy of the Imperial house, based on its lineage from the sun goddess, Amaterasu. Much of modern Japan was under only fragmentary control by the Imperial family, and rival ethnic groups. The mythological anthologies, along with other poetry anthologies like the ''Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves'' (''[[Man'yōshū]]'') and others, were intended to impress others with the worthiness of the Imperial family and their divine mandate to rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

In particular the Asuka rulers of 552–645 saw disputes between the more major families of the clan Shinto families. There were disputes about who would ascend to power and support the imperial family between the Soga and Mononobe/Nakatomi Shinto families. The Soga family eventually prevailed and supported Empress Suiko and Prince Shotoku, who helped impress Buddhist faith into Japan. However, it was not until the [[Hakuhō period|Hakuho ruling period]] of 645–710 was Shinto installed at the imperial faith along with the Fujiwara Clan and reforms that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

===Hakuho Period===
Beginning with [[Emperor Temmu]] (672–686), continuing through [[Empress Jito]] (686–697) and [[Emperor Mommu]] (697–707) Court Shinto rites are strengthened and made parallel to Buddhist beliefs in court life. Prior to this time clan Shinto had dominated and a codification of &quot;Imperial Shinto&quot; did not exist as such. The Nakatomi family are made the chief court Shinto chaplains and chief priests at Ise Daijingu which held until 1892. Also the practice of sending imperial princesses to the Ise shrine begins.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt; This marks the rise of Ise Daijingu as the main imperial shrine historically. Due to increasing influence from Buddhism and mainland Asian thought, codification of the &quot;Japanese&quot; way of religion and laws begins in earnest. This culminates in three major outcomes: Taiho Code (701 but started earlier), The Kojiki (712),and The Nihon Shoki (720).&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

The Taiho Code also called [[Ritsuryō]] (律令?) was an attempt to create a bulwark to dynamic external influences and stabilize the society through imperial power. It was a liturgy of rules and codifications, primarily focused on regulation of religion, government structure, land codes, criminal and civil law. All priests, monks, and nuns were required to be registered, as were temples. The Shinto rites of the imperial line were codified, especially seasonal cycles, lunar calendar rituals, harvest festivals, and purification rites. The creation of the imperial [[Jingi-kan]] or Shinto Shrine office was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

===Nara Period===
This period hosted many changes to the country, government, and religion. The capital is moved again to [[Heijō-kyō]], or [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], in AD 710 by [[Empress Gemmei]] due to the death of the Emperor. This practice was necessary due to the Shinto belief in the impurity of death and the need to avoid this pollution. However, this practice of moving the capital due to &quot;death impurity&quot; is then abolished by the [[Taihō Code]] and rise in Buddhist influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt; The establishment of the imperial city in partnership with Taihō Code is important to Shinto as the office of the Shinto rites becomes more powerful in assimilating local clan shrines into the imperial fold. New shrines are built and assimilated each time the city is moved. All of the grand shrines are regulated under [[Taihō Code|Taihō]] and are required to account for incomes, priests, and practices due to their national contributions.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

During this time, Buddhism becomes structurally established within Japan by [[Emperor Shōmu]] (reign 724–749), and several large building projects are undertaken. The Emperor lays out plans for the Buddha Dainichi (Great Sun Buddha), at Tōdai-ji assisted by the Priest Gyogi (or Gyoki) Bosatsu. The priest Gyogi went to Ise Daijingu Shrine for blessings to build the Buddha Dainichi. They identified the statue of Viarocana with Amatarasu (the sun goddess) as the manifestation of the supreme expression of universality.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt;

The priest Gyogi is known for his belief in assimilation of Shinto Kami and Buddhas. Shinto kami are commonly being seen by Buddhist clergy as guardians of manifestation, guardians, or pupils of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name=&quot;JapaneseReligion1985&quot;/&gt; The priest Gyogi conferred boddhisattva precepts on the Emperor in 749 effectively making the Imperial line the head of state and divine to Shinto while beholden to Buddhism.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShapersofBuddhism&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shapers Of Japanese Buddhism |publisher=Kosei Publishing Co.|location=Tokyo, Japan |first=Kashiwahara |last=Yusen |edition=1st |year=1994 pages |isbn=4-333-01630-4 |unused_data=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretism with Buddhism===
With the introduction of Buddhism and its rapid adoption by the court in the 6th century, it was necessary to explain the apparent differences between native Japanese beliefs and Buddhist teachings. One Buddhist explanation saw the ''kami'' as supernatural beings still caught in the cycle of birth and rebirth ([[reincarnation]]). The ''kami'' are born, live, die, and are reborn like all other beings in the [[karmic]] cycle. However, the ''kami'' played a special role in protecting Buddhism and allowing its teachings of compassion to flourish.

This explanation was later challenged by [[Kūkai]] (空海, 774–835), who saw the ''kami'' as different embodiments of the [[Buddhas]] themselves (''[[honji suijaku]]'' theory). For example, he linked [[Amaterasu]] (the sun goddess and ancestor of the Imperial family) with [[Vairocana|Dainichi Nyorai]], a central manifestation of the Buddhists, whose name means literally &quot;Great Sun Buddha&quot;. In his view, the ''kami'' were just Buddhas by another name.

===''Kokugaku''===
Buddhism and Shinto coexisted and were amalgamated in the ''[[shinbutsu shūgō]]'' and Kūkai's [[Syncretism|syncretic]] view held wide sway up until the end of the [[Edo period]]. There was no theological study that could be called &quot;Shinto&quot; during medieval and early modern Japanese history, and a mixture of Buddhist and popular beliefs proliferated. At that time, there was a renewed interest in &quot;Japanese studies&quot; (''[[kokugaku]]''), perhaps as a result of the [[Sakoku|closed country policy]].

In the 18th century, various Japanese scholars, in particular [[Motoori Norinaga]] (本居 宣長, 1730–1801), tried to tear apart the &quot;real&quot; Shinto from various foreign influences. The attempt was largely unsuccessful, since as early as the ''Nihon Shoki'' parts of the mythology were explicitly borrowed from Taoism doctrines. For example, the co-creator deities [[Izanami]] and [[Izanagi]] are explicitly compared to [[yin and yang]]. However, the attempt did set the stage for the arrival of [[state Shinto]], following the [[Meiji Restoration]] (c.1868), when Shinto and Buddhism were separated (''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'').

===State Shinto===
{{Main|State Shinto}}
[[Image:Chosen Jingu.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Chōsen Jingū]] in [[Seoul]]]]
Fridell argues that scholars call the period 1868-1945 the &quot;State Shinto period&quot; because, &quot;during these decades, Shinto elements came under a great deal of overt state influence and control as the Japanese government systematically utilized shrine worship as a major force for mobilizing imperial loyalties on behalf of modern nation-building.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur M. Fridell, “A Fresh Look at State Shintō”, ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 44.3 (1976), 547-561 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1462824 in JSTOR]; quote p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Meiji Restoration]] reasserted the importance of the emperor and the ancient chronicles to establish the [[Empire of Japan]], and in 1868 the government attempted to recreate the ancient imperial Shinto by separating shrines from the temples that housed them. During this period, numerous scholars of ''kokugaku'' believed that this national Shinto could be the unifying agent of the country around the Emperor while the process of modernization was undertaken with all possible speed. The psychological shock of the Western &quot;[[Black Ships]]&quot; and the subsequent collapse of the [[shogun]]ate convinced many that the nation needed to unify in order to resist being colonized by outside forces.

In 1871, a [[Jingi-kan|Ministry of Rites]] was formed and Shinto shrines were divided into twelve levels with the [[Ise Shrine]] (dedicated to Amaterasu, and thus symbolic of the legitimacy of the Imperial family) at the peak and small sanctuaries of humble towns at the base. The following year, the ministry was replaced with a new Ministry of Religion, charged with leading instruction in &quot;''shushin''&quot; (moral courses). [[Kannushi|Priests]] were officially nominated and organized by the state, and they instructed the youth in a form of Shinto theology based on the official [[dogma]] of the divinity of Japan's national origins and its Emperor. However, this propaganda did not take, and the unpopular Ministry of Rites was dissolved in the mid-1870s.

Although the government sponsorship of shrines declined, [[Japanese nationalism]] remained closely linked to the legends of foundation and emperors, as developed by the ''kokugaku'' scholars. In 1890, the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to &quot;offer yourselves courageously to the State&quot; as well as to protect the Imperial family. The practice of Emperor worship was further spread by distributing imperial portraits for esoteric veneration. All of these practices were used to fortify national solidarity through patriotic observance at shrines. This use of Shinto gave Japanese patriotism a special tint of [[mysticism]] and cultural introversion, which became more pronounced as time went on.

Such processes continued to deepen throughout the early [[Shōwa period]], when State Shinto became a main force of [[Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan|militarism]], finally coming to an abrupt end in August 1945 when Japan lost [[World War II|the war in the Pacific]]. On 1 January 1946, [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] issued the [[Ningen-sengen]], in which he quoted the [[Charter Oath|Five Charter Oath]] of [[Emperor Meiji]] and declared that he was not an ''[[Ningen-sengen|akitsumikami]]''.

===Post-war===
The era of State Shinto came to an abrupt close with the end of [[World War II]], when Americans decided to bring separation of church and state to Japanese shores in the wake of the Japanese surrender.

Most Japanese had come to believe that the [[hubris]] of Empire had led to their downfall.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Shinto system included the belief that the emperor, in this case Hirohito, was divine. Soon after the war, the Emperor issued a statement renouncing his claims to the status of &quot;living god&quot; (arahitogami).

In the post-war period, numerous &quot;[[Shinshūkyō|New Religions]]&quot; cropped up, many of them ostensibly based on Shinto, but on the whole, Japanese [[religiosity]] may have decreased. However, the concept of [[religion]] in Japan is a complex one. A survey conducted in the mid 1970s indicated that of those participants who claimed not to believe in religion, one-third had a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] or Shinto altar in their home, and about one quarter carried an ''[[omamori]]'' (an [[amulet]] to gain protection by ''kami'') on their person. Following the war, Shinto shrines tended to focus on helping ordinary people gain better fortunes for themselves through maintaining good relations with their ancestors and other ''kami''. The number of Japanese citizens identifying their religious beliefs as Shinto has declined a great deal, yet the general practice of Shinto rituals has not decreased in proportion, and many practices have persisted as general cultural beliefs (such as [[ancestor worship]]), and community festivals (''[[Japanese festivals#Local festivals (matsuri)|matsuri]]'')—focusing more on religious practices. The explanation generally given for this anomaly is that, following the demise of State Shinto, modern Shinto has reverted to its more traditional position as a traditional religion which is culturally ingrained, rather than enforced. In any case, Shinto and its values continue to be a fundamental component of the Japanese cultural mindset.

Shinto has also spread abroad to a limited extent, and a few non-Japanese Shinto priests have been ordained. A relatively small number of people practice Shinto in America. There are several [[List of Shinto shrines in the United States|Shinto shrines in America]]. Shrines were also established in [[List of Shinto shrines in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea during the Japanese occupation]] of those areas, but following the war, they were either destroyed or converted into some other use.

===New sects===
Within Shinto, there are a variety of new sects outside [[Shrine Shinto]] and the officially defunct [[State Shinto]]. [[Sect Shinto]], like [[Tenrikyo]] and [[Konkokyo]], have a unique dogma or leader, with some exhibiting the influence of [[Messiah|Messianic]] [[Christianity]] and cult of personality, in the 19th and 20th century, particularly the &quot;New Religions&quot; like (''[[Shinshūkyō]]'') that proliferated in the [[post-war era]].
