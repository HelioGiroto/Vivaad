== Empirical evidence is observable ==

There is a misconception about empiricism with some of the editors. The Creationism article states that creationists deny empirical evidence for evolution. This needs to be corrected. Creationists do deny evidence for evolution, but the evidence is not empirical.

It is innapropriate to state that the evidence is empirical for either evolution theory or creation thoery. The majority in the scientific community testify to the fact that evolution does not have emirical evidence because empirical evidence is observed, and it is not observable that any new type or organism arises from a prior type. We can only observe minute changes, but not the arival of any new type of life. Evolution requires a great measure of time for a new type of organism to arise from a prior type. For example, one can be certain that man's ancestor has produced man over time, but we cannot observe the accumilation of the countless minute changes producing man from the ancestor because this process requires far too much time. We can only see man today and examine evidence of many incrimental changes over this span of time. Therefore, stating that observable (empirical) evidence exists for evolution is as much an error as stating we can observe God create organisms. Refering to minute changes in life as it slowly transitions to a new type of life, such as speciation (see Species Problem), is not an observation that a new type of life has arisen.

This is why scientists avoid claiming that empirical evidence exists for many things we are confident are true, including the physical existance of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the arise of new genetic processes, the evolution of language from the vocal noises of man's ancestors, and countless other things, including evolution. Any article on Wiki which made the statement that the evidence for the formation of our sun, or the formation of the first living cell, or many other things would likewise be in error if it stated that it's evidence were empirical. We must not allow articles to include statements which are scientifically unsupported.

I would suggest to the dissenting editors that they investigate the matter of empiricy and the opinion of the scientific community. If they will do so, they will realize that stating that creationists deny empirical evidence is error, since the scientific community does not claim that the evidence for evolution is observable and therefore imperical.

Sir Karl Popper stated it succinctly -

&quot;Our theory of evolution has become, as Popper described, one which cannot be refuted by any possible observations. Every conceivable observation can be fitted into it. It is thus outside of empirical science but not necessarily false. No one can think of ways in which to test it.&quot;

Please investigate the opinion of the scientific community about the observability of evolution so that we can make the forementioned correction. Let us not have scientifically false statements in our articles. . . &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:2012‎ Coldhardfactsonly|2012‎ Coldhardfactsonly]] ([[User talk:2012‎ Coldhardfactsonly|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/2012‎ Coldhardfactsonly|contribs]]) 17:08, 19 July&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:See also [[Karl Popper#Darwinism]] for his clarification of his comments on evolution. Contrary to &quot;Coldhardfactsonly&quot;, he said &quot;The Mendelian underpinning of modern Darwinism has been well tested, and so has the theory of evolution which says that all terrestrial life has evolved from a few primitive unicellular organisms, possibly even from one single organism.&quot; He went on to discuss how natural selection could be tested. Of course he was only one of the philosophers of science, and not all scientists agree with his views. . [[User:Dave souza|dave souza]], [[User talk:Dave souza|talk]] 17:46, 19 July 2012 (UTC)

::The scientific community in general does not use the word &quot;empirical&quot; to define evidence for evolution because the changes which are observed, such as those you cite, are incrimental. It is not observable that a new type of life arises from a prior type. Emprirical evidence of evolutin would be observing the rise of a new type of life from a prior type, which no scientist poisits is observable, for this would constitute magic or special creatiuon. Incrimental change in the process of evolving into a new type of life does not constitute empirical evidence. The word &quot;empirical&quot; is used in reference to the evidence for evolution by the lay public, but not the concensus of the scientific community. Please investigate the opinion of the scientific community with regards to the unobservability of the rise of new types of life from prior types and why the word &quot;empirical&quot; is not used to refer to it.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Coldhardfactsonly|Coldhardfactsonly]] ([[User talk:Coldhardfactsonly|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Coldhardfactsonly|contribs]]) 18:00, 19 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:::(ec) The [[Empirical method]] is using collection of existing data (i.e. natural data) to develop conclusions--contrasted to [[Experimentation]], where carefully controlled scenarios are run in a lab.  The [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment]] is experimental evidence of evolution, whereas [[London Underground mosquito]] is an example of empirical evidence.  You (yes, you!  A member of the &quot;lay public&quot;!) can literally go and observe that that species of mosquito is different than the ones found elsewhere in London.

:::There is no &quot;empirical method&quot; in the physical sciences. There is only the Scientific Method. The &quot;empirical method&quot; is the employment of mathematic verifications of statistical analysis relating to social sciences, such as psychiatry and sociology.

:::I am not interested in debating evolution as you seem to be. The issue is not whether evolution is true or not, it is what kind of evidence supports it. Again you cite evidences for evolution which are not the observed rise of a new type of life from prior types. They are instead observations of incrimental changes in the evolution of new types of life rising from prior types. This is not empirical (observed) evidence of evolution (the biological development of new types of life from prior types over time) and it is why the concensus of the scientific community is that it is improper to employ the word &quot;empirical&quot; regarding the evidence of evolution. We must be accurate when discussing science. It would seem that either you are allowing your emotional attachment to evolution to stand in the way of your ability to be clear on science matters, or perhaps you for some reason feal that the correction of the article by removing the word &quot;empirical&quot; with regards to the evidence supporting evolution is some kind of threat to evolution theory or the article. It is neither. You are over-reacting. Calm down and consider what I am telling you and investigate empiricism in relation to the scientific community relating to the rise of new types of life over time. There should be no conflict in this matter, and the correction is necessary if we are to be scientific and is in no way any threat to the article. It makes the article stronger and supports the justification of evolution as scientific theory.

:::The isssue is with the use of the word empirical. It's a simple issue. There is no empirical evidence for the change of organisms into new types. This would require observation , which the scientific community agrees cannot be observed. It is bewildering that you call this falsehood. The solution is simple too. Remove the word &quot;empirical&quot; from the sentance. What do you not understand here? How can this be explained any more simply than this? Who mentioned YECs? You're trying to take this places it need not go for who knows why. It seems you are stuck thinking that this correction is some kind of threat to the evolution perspective of the article. It does not. I am not trying to debate evolution with you. I am for scientific accuracy, and it is improper to say observed evidence of new types of life arising exists. If you need to understand why empirical evidence does not exist for either evolution or creation, go to the scientific community. Please correct the article.

:::: I think Coldhardfactsonly is misusing either the adjective &quot;empirical&quot; or the noun &quot;observation&quot;. Evolution between species has been observed (see [[Evolution of the horse]] for one example). It just hasn't been observed while it's happening. The fossil record is observable evidence which corroborates the general theory of evolution. Does empirical mean something apart from that to you?

:::: Coldhardfactsonly, that's not how empiricism works. Do we have a case of evolution being empirically observed by a single individual? No, the concept is ridiculous. That's nowhere near the same thing as not having empirical evidence for evolution. Even empirical evidence can be indirect. We had empirical evidence of atoms before we could see them, for example.

:: In response to 68.149.110.63,  #1 Creationists don't reject observed cases of Speciation.  #2 Fossils are empirical but '''interpretations''' applied to them are not.  I'm sure an evolutionist is aware of how many of those interpretations can end up being in total error. But, to the point, there really is *no* empirical evidence for Common Descent trough Darwinian Evolution. The entiret of the theory boils down to speculation and extrapolation.

== Latest Gallup Poll ==

It would seem judicious to update the Gallup polling numbers with the most recent polls, release in June of 2012 - http://www.gallup.com/poll/155003/hold-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx - &quot;Forty-six percent of Americans believe in the creationist view that God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years... About a third of Americans believe that humans evolved, but with God's guidance; 15% say humans evolved, but that God had no part in the process.&quot; Other data from that poll could be used to update the &quot;Prevalence: United States&quot; section (5.4) as well.

:Well, I might take issue with using this data.  It says specifically that 46% believe that HUMANS are less than 10,000 years old and created directly by God.  That means that one who believes the earth is 4.5 billion years old and that all animals, except humans, evolved naturally over time, could logically be part of this 46%.  But the thing is that Creationism is more than simply the believe that humans were directly created less than 10,000 years ago, so this 46% are not necessarily creationists.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 21:45, 27 September 2012 (UTC)

One or two minor misconceptions which are themselves of interest, the last I noticed being &quot;The 'mystery of mysteries', as Darwin called the origin of species, is no mystery at all in this corner of Europe.&quot; Well, he was actually quoting Sir John Herschel, who had discussed the mystery in correspondence with [[Charles Lyell]] which was widely disseminated and published by [[Charles Babbage]]: see [[John Herschel#Visit to South Africa]]. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' published 23 year later, Darwin wrote of his aim &quot;&quot;to throw some light on the origin of species — that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.&quot;  Anyway, additions on the basis of these sources will be welcome. .

== Creationism in the UK section ==

In this section, it is noted that belief in Creationism has had &quot;a massive decrease since Darwin published his argument&quot;. While techinically true, this sounds like a rather strange observation, since the level of belief in all sorts of things has changed drastically over that length of time, particularly beliefs related to science, beacuse the scientific evidence on which those beliefs are based changes. People's belief in the possibility of space travel has probably increased over the same period. And by the way, similar effects have occurred worldwide. The next date it mentions is 2006, so the changes in Britons' beliefs in the intervening 150-odd years seems to have been ignored. Maybe just say &quot;public attitudes have changed in recent years&quot;, although there is not much evidence that they have. At the moment the way the paragraph is written seems to be dressing up Britons' beliefs as an exemplar of so-called rationality, by emphasisng the &quot;massive decrease&quot; in acceptance of Creationism, even though figures demonstrate that Creationism is very much alive and kicking in the UK.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.26.13.2|86.26.13.2]] ([[User talk:86.26.13.2|talk]]) 17:23, 27 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::Read the article: evolutionary ideas in Britain dated back to the late 18th century, and though few people accepted the concepts in [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s writings at that time, there was a significant increase in evolutionary views by the time [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. After that, it only took a decade or so for most scientists and much of the public to accept various evolutionary ideas, so if you're talking about creationism as anti-evolution the shift in opinion goes back to the 1870s. Of course there was some support among scientists until later in the 19th century for various forms of [[theistic evolution]]. By the way, what does this &quot;believed in Darwin's writings&quot; mean? Science isn't about belief. . . [[User:Dave souza|dave souza]], [[User talk:Dave souza|talk]] 23:28, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

== Remove non-creationist sections! ==

Please remove the &quot;Growing Evidence for Evolution&quot; section or I will!  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Asldfjk|Asldfjk]] ([[User talk:Asldfjk|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Asldfjk|contribs]]) 20:02, 31 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:No. Why? --[[User:Stephan Schulz|Stephan Schulz]] ([[User talk:Stephan Schulz|talk]]) 20:09, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
:That's not quite the way to get people on your side. I do think that it should be reworded to remove irrelevant (off-topic) content. But, there has to be consensus. --[[User:Musdan77|Musdan77]] ([[User talk:Musdan77|talk]]) 20:16, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
:The section is fine but I changed the name to &quot;Modern Science&quot;. It's silly to refer to the confirmation of established facts as &quot;growing evidence&quot;. [[User:TippyGoomba|TippyGoomba]] ([[User talk:TippyGoomba|talk]]) 05:33, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
::Hi [[User:Asldfjk]], you've got interesting views on your user page, but as a newbie you apparently don't yet appreciate that [[WP:WEIGHT]] policy requires minority and [[WP:FRINGE]] views to be shown in the majority view context. For science, there are clear majority views which your views contradict: your views may be common though by no means universal amongst creationists, but policy requires that we must not present them in isolation from the findings of science. Hope that helps, . [[User:Dave souza|dave souza]], [[User talk:Dave souza|talk]] 10:46, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

:Seriously, why should it be removed?  If you do have a good reason to have it removed, please say it, and the consensus may change in favor it.  But, if all you're going to do is make childish demands, no one is going to bother with you, other than to dismiss you as yet another Creationist troll-vandal.--[[User:Apokryltaros|Mr Fink]] ([[User talk:Apokryltaros|talk]]) 22:55, 6 November 2012 (UTC)</text>
