      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20837">'''Nontheistic religions''' are traditions of [[religious belief|thought]] within [[religion]]s, some otherwise aligned with [[theism]], others not, in which [[nontheism]] informs religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=J. Paul|coauthors=Horace L. Friess|title=The Nature of Religion|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1962|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–17|jstor=1384088|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|doi=10.2307/1384088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nontheism has been applied to the fields of [[Christian apologetics]] and general [[liberal theology]], and plays significant roles in [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]].

== Buddhism ==
{{Main|God in Buddhism}}
[[File:Parinibbana.jpg|220px|thumb|right|An artist's portrayal of [[Buddha]]'s entry into [[Parinirvana]]]]
Although Buddhism has a vast number of scriptures and practices, the fundamental core of Buddhism, the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] do not have any mention of any god(s) or any notion of worship of any deity.  They are purely ethical and meditative guidelines based on the truths of psychological suffering due to [[impermanence]].

Since the time of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the refutation of the existence of a creator has been seen as a key point in distinguishing Buddhist from non-Buddhist views.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''Contemplative Science.'' Columbia University Press, 2007, pages 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha said that gods (''[[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]]'') exist, though he portrayed them as mortal and, in some cases, deluded. He did not center his teaching around these gods, but instead around the explanation of [[dukkha]] (suffering, imperfection) and attaining freedom from it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Although the Buddha did affirm a positive belief in the existence of gods, he stated that they are not to be worshiped and are themselves in the cycle of [[samsara]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The question of a Creator God, however, was answered by Buddha in the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]].{{Citation needed|reason= that question, explicitly?  how was it answered?  what passage?  were the below lines once part of this claim? |date=December 2008}}
The Buddha denounced the view of a Creator and sees that such notions are related to the false view of eternity, and like the 61 other views, this belief causes suffering when one is attached to it and relates to these views with desire, hatred and delusion. At the end of the Sutta the Buddha says he knows these 62 views and he also knows the truth that surpasses them.

There are however, pantheistic elements in the doctrine of [[Adi-Buddha]], among others present in Buddhism.

===Belief and practice===
On one occasion, when presented with a problem of metaphysics by the monk Malunkyaputta, Buddha responded with the [[Parable of the Poison Arrow]].  When a man is shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poison, his family summons the doctor to have the poison removed, and the doctor gives an antidote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;But the man refuses to let the doctor do anything before certain questions can be answered.  The wounded man demands to know who shot the arrow, what his caste and job is, and why he shot him.  He wants to know what kind of bow the man used and how he acquired the ingredients used in preparing the poison.  Malunkyaputta, such a man will die before getting the answers to his questions.  It is no different for one who follows the Way.  I teach only those things necessary to [[Bodhi|realize the Way]].  Things which are not helpful or necessary, I do not teach.&quot;&lt;ref name=hanh&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Relative and ultimate truth===
Some revolutionary Buddhist teachers teach that mention of divine beings in the scriptures does not refer to actual existing gods, but was a language employed by Buddha to bring about a meaning, which was subsequently misunderstood. An example of this is [[Buddhadasa, Bhikku|Ajahn Buddhadasa]] of Thailand.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The majority of teachers, however, disagree with this revolutionary interpretation, and teach the orthodox teaching (from the [[Pali Canon]] and [[Mahayana Sutra]]s) that conventional gods do exist and can influence our lives.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} These gods, however, cannot give people enlightenment, and they are themselves unenlightened and unaware of the true [[Dhamma]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Bassui Tokushō|Zen Master Bassui]] (1327–1387) had strong words for those applying notions of divinity to any separate beings, such as [[bodhisattvas]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;... so you should realize that all the names of the bodhisattvas
    are just different names for the nature of mind.  As an expedient
    in the World-Honored-One's sermons, he defined things using
    certain names, and with these names he pointed to the truth.
    Ordinary people, unaware of this truth, become attached to the
    names and, in the hopes of attaining Buddhahood, seek the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]
    and [[Dharma]] outside their minds.  It's like cooking sand in the
    hopes of producing rice.&quot;&lt;ref name=braverman&gt;{{cite book

== Christianity ==
{{Main|Secular theology|Christian atheism}}
A few [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] [[theologians]], define a &quot;nontheistic God&quot; as &quot;the ground of all being&quot; rather than as a personal [[divinity|divine]] [[being]]. [[John Shelby Spong]] refers to a theistic God as &quot;a personal being with expanded supernatural, human, and parental qualities, which has shaped every religious idea of the Western world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''A New Christianity for a New World: Why Traditional Faith Is Dying and How a New Faith Is Being Born'', ISBN 0-06-067063-0&lt;/ref&gt;

From a nontheist, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], and [[rationalism|rationalist]] perspective, the concept of divine grace appears to be the same concept as [[luck]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Arnold S. &quot;Ability&quot;, ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 60, No. 19
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bust of Paul Johannes Tillich (daylight).JPG|170px|thumb|right|Bust of [[Paul Tillich]]]]
Many of them owe much of their [[theology]] to the work of Christian existentialist [[philosopher]] [[Paul Tillich]], including the phrase &quot;the ground of all being&quot;. Another quotation from Tillich is, &quot;God does not exist. He is being itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore to argue that God exists is to deny him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, Paul. (1951) ''Systematic Theology'', p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; This Tillich quotation summarizes his conception of God. He does not think of God as a being which exists in time and space, because that constrains God, and makes God finite. But all beings are finite, and if God is the Creator of all beings, God cannot logically be finite since a finite being cannot be the sustainer of an infinite variety of finite things. Thus God is considered beyond being, above finitude and limitation, the power or essence of being itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Hook, &quot;The Atheism of Paul Tillich&quot;, in ''Religious Experience and Truth: A Symposium'' ed. Sidney Hook. (New York University Press, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secular humanist]] [[Sidney Hook]] wrote in an essay called ''&quot;The Atheism of Paul Tillich&quot;'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;With amazing courage Tillich boldly says that the God of the multitudes does not exist, and further, that to believe in His existence is to believe in an idol and ultimately to embrace superstition. God cannot be an entity among entities, even the highest. He is being-in-itself. In this sense Tillich's God is like the God of [[Spinoza]] and the God of [[Hegel]]. Both Spinoza and Hegel were denounced for their atheism by the theologians of the past because their God was not a Being or an Entity. Tillich, however, is one of the foremost theologians of our time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nontheist Friend===
[[File:Nontheist.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Logo of the Society of Nontheist Friends]]
{{Main|Nontheist Friend}}
A nontheist Friend or an atheist Quaker is someone who affiliates with, identifies with, engages in and/or affirms [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] practices and processes, but who does not accept a belief in a theistic understanding of [[God]], a Supreme Being, the [[divinity|divine]], the [[soul]] or the [[supernatural]]. Like theistic Friends, nontheist Friends are actively interested in realizing centered [[peace]], simplicity, integrity, community, equality, [[love]], [[happiness]] and [[social justice]] in the Society of Friends and beyond.

== Hinduism ==
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
Hinduism is generally regarded as being characterised by extremely diverse beliefs and practises.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[R.C. Zaehner]], &quot;it is perfectly possible to be a good Hindu whether one's personal views incline toward monism, monotheism, polytheism, or even atheism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Catherine Robinson 1992, page 51&quot;&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that it is a religion that neither depends on the existence or non-existence of God or Gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Zaehner, (1966) ''Hinduism'', P.1-2, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Hinduism can be seen as having three more important strands: one featuring a personal Creator or Divine Being, one that emphasises an impersonal Absolute and a third pluralistic and non-absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Ninian,(1999) World Philosophies. Routledge, ISBN 0-415-18466-5 p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars regard devotion to a personal deity as the ultimate reality is the last and perhaps most significant stage of Hinduism's development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catherine Robinson 1992, page 51&quot;/&gt; This article will focus on the latter two traditions - which can be seen as nontheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul J, (2005) ''Nontheistic Conceptions of the Divine'' Ch. 3. in  T''he Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion'' by William J Wainwright, p.59 . Oxford University Press US, ISBN 0-19-513809-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Vedas are broadly concerned with the completion of ritual, there are some elements that can be interpreted as either nontheistic or precursors to the later developments of the nontheistic tradition. The oldest Hindu scripture, the [[Rig Veda]] mentions that 'There is only one god though the sages may give it various names' (1.164.46). [[Max Müller]] termed this [[henotheism]], and it can be seen as indicating one, non-dual divine reality, with little emphasis on personality.&lt;ref&gt;Masih, Y. A comparative study of religions, P.164, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000 ISBN 81-208-0815-0&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Nasadiya Sukta]], the 129th Hymn of the tenth and final Mandala (or chapter) of the Rig Veda,  considers creation and asks &quot;The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. /Who then knows whence it has arisen?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, (1981)''The Rig Veda: An Anthology of One Hundred Eight Hymns'' (Classic) Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen to contain the intuition that there must be a single principle behind all phenomena: 'That one' (tad ekam), self-sufficient, to which distinctions cannot be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, Diané and Wilkinson, Robert Thirty-Five Oriental Philosophers, P. 39, Routledge, 1994 ISBN 0-415-02596-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, Jitendranath (2000), Classical Indian Philosophy: An Introductory Text, p:1 Rowman &amp; Littlefield, ISBN 0-8476-8933-6&lt;/ref&gt;

It is with the [[Upanishads]], reckoned to be written in the first millennia (coeval with the ritualistic [[Brahmanas]]), that the Vedic emphasis on ritual was challenged. The Upanishads can be seen as the expression of new sources of power in India. Also, separate from the Upanishadic tradition were bands of wandering ascetics called Vadins whose largely nontheistic notions rejected the notion that religious knowledge was the property of the Brahmins. Many of these were [[shramana]]s, who represented a non-Vedic tradition rooted in India's pre-Aryan history.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav Krejčí, Anna Krejčová (1990) Before the European Challenge: The Great Civilizations of Asia and the Middle East, p:170, SUNY Press, ISBN 0-7914-0168-5&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of the Upanishads turned to knowledge, specifically the ultimate identity of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger,Wendy, (1990) ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'',P. 441, Merriam-Webster, ISBN 0-87779-044-2&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the notion of [[Brahman]], the key idea of the Upanishads, and much later philosophizing has been taken up with deciding whether Brahman is personal or impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Ninian (1998) The World's Religions P.73-74, CUP ISBN 0-521-63748-1&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of the nature of Brahman as impersonal is based in the definition of it as 'ekam eva advitiyam' (Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1) - it is one without a second and to which no substantive predicates can be attached.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, William J. (2005) Ch.3 Nontheistic conceptions of the divine. ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion'' p.67 OUP, ISBN 0-19-513809-0&lt;/ref&gt; Further, both the [[Chandogya]] and [[Brihadaranyaka]] Upanishads assert that the individual [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]] and the impersonal Brahman are one.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard H. (2004) ''Mysticism and Morality: A New Look at Old Questions'', P. 80, Lexington Books, ISBN 0-7391-0784-4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mahāvākyas|mahāvākya]] statement [[Tat Tvam Asi]], found in the Chandogya Upanishad, can be taken to indicate this unity.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert L,(1991) ''Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God'', SUNY Press, ISBN 079140656.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter Upanishad uses the negative term [[Neti neti]] to 'describe' the divine.
[[File:Patanjali Statue.jpg|270px|thumb|right|[[Patañjali]] statue in Pantanjali Yog Peeth Haridwar]]
Classical [[Samkhya]], [[Mimamsa]], early [[Vaisheshika]] and early [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism do not accept the notion of an omnipotent creator God at all.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James, Ch. Indian Conceptions of Reality and Divinity found in ''A Companion to World Philosophies'' By Eliot Deutsch, Ronald Bontekoe, P. 352, Blackwell, ISBN 0-631-21327-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Kenneth W. and Sarma, D S, Eds. (1953) Ch. 5. P.207 Hindu Religious Thought by Satis Chandra Chatterjee, ''The Religion of the Hindus: Interpreted by Hindus'', Ronald Press. ISBN 81-208-0387-6&lt;/ref&gt; While the Sankhya and Mimamsa schools no longer have significant followings in India, they are both influential in the developent of later schools of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'',(p.232) CUP, ISBN 052143878&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James,(1999) ''Classical Samkhya'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, ISBN 81-208-0503-8&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoga of [[Patanjali]] is the school that probably owes most to the Samkhya thought. This school is dualistic, in the sense that there is a division between 'spirit' (Sanskrit: [[purusha]]) and 'nature' (Sanskrit: [[prakṛti]]).&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1989), ''Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy'', Tarcher, ISBN 0-87477-520-5&lt;/ref&gt; It holds Samadhi or 'concentrative union' as its ultimate goal&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1999) ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought'', p:191, Edinburgh University Press, ISBN 0-7486-0954-7&lt;/ref&gt; and it does not consider God's existence as either essential or necessary to achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Richard Pauranik, ''Being a Witness in Theory and Practice of Yoga'' by Knut A. Jacobsen&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]], contains both passages which bear a monistic reading and others which bear a theistic reading.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith. E., ''On Interpreting the &quot;Bhagavadgītā&quot;'', Philosophy East and West 32, no 1 (January, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the book as a whole has been interpreted by some who see it as containing a primarily nontheistic message,&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord''. Routledge Press, 1992, page 45, 98, 115, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and by others who stress its theistic message.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, pages 47, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; These broadly either follow after either [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] or [[Ramanuja]]&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', (pps 239-234) CUP, ISBN 052143878&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a nontheistic passage might be &quot;The supreme Brahman is without any beginning. That is called neither being nor non-being.&quot; Which was interpreted by Sankara to mean that Brahman can only be talked of in terms of negation of all attributes - 'Neti neti'.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Gambhirananda, (1995), [http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/ ''Bhagavadgita: with the Commentary of Sankaracharya''], Ch. 13. Vs. 13, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta ISBN 81-7505-150-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Advaita Vedanta]] of [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] rejects theism as a consequence of its insistence that Brahman is &quot;Without attributes, indivisible, subtle, inconceivable, and without blemish, Brahman is one and without a second. There is nothing other than He.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, John, [http://www.realization.org/page/namedoc0/vc/vc_10.htm ''Viveka-Chudamani of Shankara'' Vs 468.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it lacks properties usually associated with God such as omniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and additionally is identical with the whole of reality, rather than being a causal agent or ruler of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wainright, William, (2006), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ ''Concepts of God''], Stanford Encyclopedia of Religion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Main|God in Jainism}}
{{See|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents - soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed. Jainism is a dualistic religion, with the [[universe]] made up of [[matter]] and [[souls]]. Jain text claims that the universe consists of Jiva (life force or souls), and Ajiva (lifeless objects).Similarly, the soul of each living being is unique and uncreated .

The universe, and the matter and souls within it, are eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent creator god in Jainism. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including Heavenly beings/Devas. These Heavenly beings are not viewed as creators, they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and portray them as mortal. Jains believe that the soul can attain &quot;godhood&quot;; however none of these supernatural beings exercise any sort of creative activity.

Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation/Nirvana. A soul who destroys all its passions, and desires, has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe.  If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a God as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed Gods/Tirthankara. 

Besides scriptural authority, Jains also employ [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute [[creationism|creationist]] theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|vedics]], [[samkhya|sāmkhyas]], mimimsas, Buddhists, and other school of thoughts were criticized by Jain Ācāryas, such as [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]].
