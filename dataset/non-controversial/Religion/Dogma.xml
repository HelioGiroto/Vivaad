'''Dogma''' is the official system of [[belief]] or [[doctrine]] held by a [[religion]], or a particular group or organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dogma], &quot;dogma.&quot; Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 24 Oct. 2011. &lt;Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dogma&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as part of the primary basis of an [[ideology]] or belief system, and it can not be changed or discarded without affecting the very system's [[paradigm]], or the ideology itself. Although it generally refers to religious beliefs that are accepted regardless of evidence, they can refer to acceptable opinions of philosophers or philosophical schools, public decrees, or issued decisions of political authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t101.e2044], &quot;Dogma&quot;  The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions. Ed. John Bowker. Oxford University Press, 2000. Oxford Reference Online. [[Oxford University Press]].  York University.  25 October 2011  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t101.e2044&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term derives from Greek {{lang|grc|δόγμα}} &quot;that which seems to one, [[opinion]] or belief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2327819 Dogma], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and that from {{lang|grc|δοκέω}} (''dokeo''), &quot;to think, to suppose, to imagine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2327848 Dokeo], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Dogma came to signify laws or ordinances adjudged and imposed upon others by the First Century. The plural is either ''dogmas'' or ''dogmata'', from Greek {{lang|grc|δόγματα}}. The term &quot;dogmatics&quot; is used as a synonym for [[systematic theology]], as in [[Karl Barth]]'s defining textbook of [[neo-orthodoxy]], the 14-volume ''[[Church Dogmatics]]''.

== In religion ==
{{see also|Roman Catholic dogma}}
Dogmata are found in religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], where they are considered core principles that must be upheld by all followers of that religion. As a fundamental element of religion, the term &quot;dogma&quot; is assigned to those theological tenets which are considered to be well demonstrated, such that their proposed disputation or revision effectively means that a person no longer accepts the given religion as his or her own, or has entered into a period of personal doubt. Dogma is distinguished from [[theology|theological]] opinion regarding those things considered less well-known. Dogmata may be clarified and elaborated but not contradicted in novel teachings (e.g., [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:6-9&amp;version=NIV; Galatians 1:6-9]). Rejection of dogma may lead to expulsion from a religious group.

In Christianity, religious beliefs are defined by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t98.e978], &quot;dogma&quot;  The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  York University.  25 October 2011  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t98.e978&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually on scripture or communicated by church authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t116.e662], Prof. David Berman  &quot;dogma&quot;  The Oxford Companion to Philosophy. Oxford University Press 2005. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  York University.  25 October 2011  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t116.e662&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that these dogmas will lead human beings towards redemption and thus the “paths which lead to God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=if0HIibsX-gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=what%20is%20dogma&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Journet, Charles. What Is Dogma? San Francisco: Ignatius, 2011. Google Book Search. Web. 21 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christianity]], the dogmata are contained in the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[canon law]]s of two, three, seven, or twenty-one [[ecumenical council]]s (depending on whether one is [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]). These tenets are summarized by [[St. John of Damascus]] in his ''Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith'', which is the third book of his main work, titled ''The Fount of Knowledge''. In this book he takes a dual approach in explaining each article of the faith: one, for Christians, where he uses quotes from the [[Bible]] and, occasionally, from works of other [[Church Fathers|Fathers of the Church]], and the second, directed both at non-Christians (but who, nevertheless, hold some sort of religious belief) and at [[atheist]]s, for whom he employs [[term logic|Aristotelian logic]] and [[dialectics]].

The decisions of fourteen later councils that Catholics hold as dogmatic and two decrees promulgated by [[Pope]]s' exercising [[papal infallibility]] (see [[Immaculate Conception]] and [[Assumption of Mary]]) are considered as being a part of the Church's sacred [[Magisterium|body of doctrine]].

Roman Catholic dogmata are a distinct form of doctrine taught by the Church.

[[Protestantism|Protestants]] to differing degrees affirm portions of these dogmata, and often rely on denomination-specific 'Statements of Faith' which summarize their chosen dogmata (see, e.g., [[Eucharist]]).

In [[Islam]], the dogmatic principles are contained in the ''[[aqidah]]''. Within many Christian denominations, dogma is referred to as &quot;[[doctrine]]&quot;.

== Other usage ==
As a possible reaction to [[skepticism]], dogmatism is a set of beliefs or doctrines that are established as undoubtedly in truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t98.e978], &quot;dogma&quot;  The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  York University.  25 October 2011  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t98.e978&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; They are regarded as (religious) truths relating closely to the nature of faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=if0HIibsX-gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=what%20is%20dogma&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Journet, Charles. What Is Dogma? San Francisco: Ignatius, 2011. Google Book Search. Web. 21 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;dogmatic&quot; can be used disparagingly to refer to any belief that is held stubbornly, including political&lt;ref&gt;Gabler, Neal. [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-gabler2-2009oct02,0,7817347.story], &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Michael. [http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=b413193m], The Analyst, 2004, 129, 865&lt;/ref&gt; beliefs. 

A notable use of the term can be found in the [[Central Dogma of Molecular Biology]]. In his [[autobiography]], ''[[What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery|What Mad Pursuit]]'', [[Francis Crick]] wrote about his choice of the word ''dogma'' and some of the problems it caused him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word [[hypothesis]] in the sequence hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, the use of the word dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth.... Many years later [[Jacques Monod]] pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
