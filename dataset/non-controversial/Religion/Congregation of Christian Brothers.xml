[[File:Christian Brothers Logo.png|right|thumb|Logo of the Christian Brothers, adopted in January 2006.]]
The '''Congregation of Christian Brothers''' (officially, in [[Latin]]: '''Congregatio Fratrum Christianorum''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Christian Brother Terms | url = http://www.edmundschools.org/sys-tmpl/terms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a worldwide religious community within the [[Catholic Church]], founded by [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Edmund Ignatius Rice|Edmund Rice]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title = Edmund Rice - The Man | url = http://www.edmundclt.org/history/edmundricetheman/edmundricetheman.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Christian Brothers''', as they are commonly known, chiefly work for the evangelisation and education of youth, but are involved in many ministries, especially with the poor. Their first school was opened in [[Waterford]], [[Ireland]], in 1802.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Br Philip Pinto is the current Congregation Leader of the Christian Brothers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Congregation Letter | url = http://www.edmundclt.org/news/cltnews/2008invitation/2008invitation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and head of its Congregational Leadership Team that is based in [[Rome]]. At the time of its foundation, though much relieved from the harshest of the [[Penal Laws]] by the Irish Parliament's Relief Acts, some  discrimination against Catholics remained throughout the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland pending full Catholic Emancipation in 1829. 

This congregation is sometimes confused with the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]], or &quot;De La Salle Christian Brothers,&quot; founded by [[Saint Jean-Baptiste de la Salle]] in France. This is a completely separate [[religious institute]]. Rice's congregation is sometimes called the '''Irish Christian Brothers'''.

==Formation==
[[File:Edmund Ignatius Rice.JPG|thumb|right|[[Edmund Ignatius Rice|Edmund Rice]]]]
At the turn of the eighteenth century, [[Waterford]] merchant [[Edmund Ignatius Rice|Edmund Rice]] considered travelling to [[Rome]] to join a religious institute, possibly the [[Augustinians]]. Instead, with the support of Dr. [[Thomas Hussey (bishop)|Thomas Hussey]], Catholic [[Bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Waterford and Lismore (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Waterford and Lismore]], he decided to found a religious community dedicated to teaching disadvantaged youth.

The first school, on Waterford's New Street, was a converted stable  and opened in 1802, with a second school opening in Stephen Street soon after to cater for increasing enrolments. Two men from his hometown of [[Callan]], Thomas Grosvenor and Patrick Finn, soon arrived to aid Rice in his makeshift schools, with the intention of living the life of [[lay brothers]]. In the same year, Rice used proceeds from the sale of his victualling business to begin building a community house and school on land provided by the diocese. Bishop Hussey opened the new complex, christened “[[Mount Sion Primary School|Mount Sion]]” on June 7, 1803, and pupils were transferred to the new school building the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Normoyle| first = M.C.| title = A Tree is Planted: The Life and Times of Edmund Rice | publisher = Congregation of Christian Brothers| year=  1976| location = | pages = 45–50| url = |accessdate = 2007-10-24|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of the school spread and across the next few years several men sought to become “Michaels”.

On 15 August 1808, seven men, including Edmund Rice, took religious promises under Bishop [[John Power (bishop)|John Power]] of Waterford. Following the example of Nano Nagle's Presentation Sisters, they were called &quot;[[Presentation Brothers]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Normoyle| first = M.C.| title = A Tree is Planted: The Life and Times of Edmund Rice | publisher = Congregation of Christian Brothers| year=  1976| location = | url = |accessdate = 2007-10-24|id =| page = 71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the first congregations of men to be founded in Ireland and one of the few founded in the Church by a layman.

Houses were soon opened in [[Carrick-on-Suir]], [[Dungarvan]], and in 1811, in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. In 1812 the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] established a community in the nation's capital and by 1907 there were ten communities in [[Dublin]], with in excess of 6,000 pupils. The schools included [[primary school|primary]], [[high school|secondary]] and [[vocational education|technical]] schools, along with [[orphanage]]s and a school for the deaf. A community was founded in [[Limerick]] in 1816, followed by establishments in several of Ireland's principal towns.

The [[Holy See]] formally established the congregation in 1820. This, too, was an unusual event, since the Christian Brothers were the first Irish congregation of men approved by a charter from [[Pope|Rome]].

Some brothers in Cork chose to remain under the original Presentation rule and continued to be known as Presentation Brothers, a separate congregation but also recognising Edmund Rice as its Founder.

==Expansion==
[[File:CrestOfChristianBrothersOrder.png|right|thumb|Traditional crest of the Christian Brothers, incorporating the [[Latin]] motto ''Facere et docere'' (&quot;To Do and To Teach&quot;).]]
The  congregation of Irish Christian Brothers spread to [[Liverpool]] and other parts of [[England]]. Brother [[Ambrose Treacy]] established a strong presence in [[Melbourne, Australia]] in 1868, and in 1875 in [[Brisbane, Australia]] and in 1876 a school was commenced in [[Kavanagh College|Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. In 1875 a school was opened in [[St. John’s, Newfoundland]]. In 1878 the Brothers were introduced to the then [[Crown colony]] of [[Gibraltar]]. In 1886 the Pope requested that they consider setting up in [[India]] and a province of the congregation was established there. In 1900 came the invitation  to establish houses in [[Rome]] and in 1906 schools were established in [[New York City]].

These new ventures were not always successful. Two brothers had been sent to Gibraltar to establish an institute in 1835. However, despite initial successes they left in August 1837 on account of disagreements with the local priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Normoyle| first = M.C.| title = A Tree is Planted: The Life and Times of Edmund Rice | publisher = Congregation of Christian Brothers| year=  1976| location = | pages = 289–296| url = |accessdate = 2007-10-24|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a mission to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1842 failed within a couple of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Normoyle| first = M.C.| title = A Tree is Planted: The Life and Times of Edmund Rice | publisher = Congregation of Christian Brothers| year=  1976| location = | pages = 405–406| url = |accessdate = 2007-10-24|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] was founded in New York, as a Higher Education College,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iona.edu/about/ About Iona College] Iona College Website.&lt;/ref&gt; facilitating poorer High School graduates to progress to a College education.

In 1955 [[Stella Maris College (Montevideo)]] in [[Uruguay]] was established, which became one of the leading schools in the country, but also became known for the accidental fame for the 
[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|Andes Flight Disaster]] involving its alumni rugby team.

The Christian Brothers teacher training center has become the [[Marino Institute for Education]] which since trains lay teachers since 1972 and since 1974 offers degrees validated by [[Trinity College Dublin]], in 2012 the University became co-thrustees with the brothers of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcd.ie/Communications/news/news.php?headerID=2296&amp;vs_date=2012-1-1 Trinity College Dublin Enters into a Co-Trusteeship of the Marino Institute of Education] Communications Office TCD, Jan 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers' schools continue to be of many types, including primary, secondary and technical schools, orphanages and for the deaf. A number of these technical schools originally taught poor children trades such as carpentry and building skills for which they could progress to gain apprenticeships and employment. As the National School system and vocational schools developed in the Irish Republic, the Irish Christian Brothers became more concentrated on secondary education.

===Irish nationalism===
[[File:Christian Brothers School Templemore April 2010.JPG|CBS Templemore, Co. Tipperary&lt;br /&gt;April 2010|thumb|right]]
The Irish Christian Brothers are strong supporters of Irish nationalism, the Irish Language revival and Irish sports. In most of their schools in Ireland [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] were encouraged as opposed to other sports and there were even examples of boys being punished for playing [[Association Football]]. [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] called them &quot;the most indefatigable and explicit carriers&quot; of the Catholic nation idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2008/08/31/story35413.asp Portrait of a Christian crusader - Reviewed by Dermot Bolger], ''Sunday Business Post'', August 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Publications by the Christian Brothers===
In the absence of government devised text books that were inexpensive, the Christian brothers composed and published a number of text books which were used by their schools. Many of these were in the Irish language but also dealt with Mathematics and other subjects. 
====Textbooks====
* ''Irish History Reader'', Christian Brothers, M.H. Gill &amp; Son, 1905.
* ''Graiméar na Gaeidhilge'', Na Bráithre Críostaí, 1907.

* ''Leaving Certificate Chemistry'', Christian Brothers Congregation, Folens, Dublin.
* ''Leaving Certificate Physics''[translated from the Irish], Christian Brothers Congregation, Folens, Dublin, 1973.

====Our Boys====
''Our Boys'' was a magazine format publication for boys by Christian Brothers and the Educational Company of Ireland. It was first published in September 1914, based on British ''Boys Own'' adventure comics, its content was cartoons and adventure stories in English and Irish. It had an overt Catholic and Irish Nationalist outlook, featuring Irish Legends, GAA figures, the Missions and Catholic juvenile organisations. The illustrator Gerrit van Gelderen contributed to the magazine. It was published up until the 1990's.&lt;ref&gt;[''True Sons of Erin:Catholic/Nationalist Ideology and the Politics of Adventure in Our Boys 1914-32''] by Michael Flannagan, Phd Thesis, DIT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational structure of the Christian Brothers==

Geographically, the Christian Brothers are divided into several [[provinces]] that encompass every inhabited continent. The brothers within each province work under the direction of a Province Leadership Team. In turn, the entire Congregation operates under the leadership of a Congregation Leadership Team that is based in [[Rome]] (and led by the Congregation Leader). These provincial and congregational teams are elected on a 6-year basis at Congregation [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]].

Restructuring has taken place in the congregation to account for the changing needs, in particular the declining number of brothers in the developed world. The three provinces of North America (Canada, Eastern American, and Western American Province) restructured into the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers North America on 1 July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ercbna.org/index.htm Embracing a Common Future&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The provinces that cover [[Ireland]], [[England]] and the Congregational Leadership Team in Rome combined into a single European province on May 5, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmundrice.org.au/Christian_Brothers/Restructuring/New_European_Province/ edmundrice.org.au - New European Province&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while the five provinces covering Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea combined into one Oceania province on October 1, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfcoceania.org.au/docs/138_1.pdf Shaping Our Future&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The English Province is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|254312|Trust property held in connection with the English Province of the Congregation of Christian Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dublin Headquarters are in the grounds of [[Marino Institute of Education]], Claremont, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9, Ireland.

A special community within this new European province will be based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], working to establish an [[NGO]] known as [[Edmund Rice International]]. The purpose of such an organisation is to gain what is known as a &quot;general consultative status&quot; with the [[United Nations]]. &quot;This position allows groups the opportunity to challenge systemic injustice and to engage in advocacy work with policy makers on behalf of people who are made poor.&quot; As well as including Christian Brothers from provinces all over the world, members of the [[Presentation Brothers]] will also have a presence within this community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmundrice.org.au/media/Jointletter07.pdf Presence, Compassion, Liberation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Rice Development]] is a faith-based Non-governmental Organisation with charity status in [[Ireland]].  Based in [[Dublin]], Edmund Rice Development was established in 2009, to formalise the fundraising efforts of the developing world projects for the Christian Brothers globally and received its charitable status in 2009.  Funding raised by the charity is directed mainly to 9 countries in [[Africa]], where The Christian Brothers work on mission in development: [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].  Additional funds are also raised for similar work in [[South America]] ([[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]]) and [[India]].

==Scandals==
{{See also|Abuse by priests in Roman Catholic orders|Sexual abuse scandal in the Congregation of Christian Brothers }}
In the late 20th and early 21st century the reputation of the congregation suffered from the exposure of a series of scandals involving emotional, physical and sexual abuse of Irish children in the congregation's care, stretching back over a long period of time. Similar abuse emerged also in other countries where the congregation had had a presence, including Canada, the United States and Australia.

===Canada===
In 1987, men came forward to say that when they were being raised in [[Mount Cashel Orphanage]] in St. John's [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], back in the 1950s all the way up to the 1970s, had suffered unspeakable acts of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and that when the [[Archdiocese]] became aware of the abuse, had quietly removed brothers who were guilty of these acts.

===Ireland===
In Ireland the Congregation of the Christian Brothers published full-page advertisements in newspapers in March 1998, apologizing to former pupils who had been ill-treated whilst in their care. This advertising campaign expressed &quot;deep regret&quot; on behalf of the Christian Brothers and listed telephone lines which former pupils could ring if they needed help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/71094.stm |title=Catholic order apologises publicly for abuse |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-03-30 |accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003 the Congregation brought a case against the [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]] seeking to prevent the Commission from naming brothers acccused of child abuse. This case was lost in the High Court, but the congregation appealed to the Supreme Court. This appeal was later dropped, when the Commission agreed not to name brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishsalem.com/religious-congregations/christian-brothers/decidetodropappeal-26jun04.php |title=http://www.irishsalem.com/religious-congregations/christian-brothers/decidetodropappeal-26jun04.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2009 a report was issued by an independent government commission on [[child abuse]] committed on thousands of children in residential care institutions run by various [[religious institute]]s for the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/ Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ireland)], 2009. [http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/01-06.php Chapter 6 of Volume 1] covers the Christian Brothers&lt;/ref&gt; This report found that sexual abuse of boys in institutions run by the Brothers was common. In response, the Irish [[ecclesiastical province|province]] issued a pledge to pay 161 million [[euro]]s toward a fund set up to compensate victims of such abuse in both their institutions and those run by other religious institutes, both male and female.

===United States===
Such abuse was not limited to Ireland.  According to the Chicago-Sun Times, in 1998 Brother Robert Brouillette was arrested in Joliet, Illinois, for indecent solicitation of a child.&lt;ref name=Brouillette1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4445049.html |title=Christian Brother caught in Net sex sting |publisher=Chicago Sun Times |date=1998-04-21 |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, a civil lawsuit was filed in Cook County, Illinois, against Brother Brouillette for sexual assault against a 21 year old man.&lt;ref name=Brouillette2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.snapnetwork.org/snap_statements/2004_statements/032604_jail_stlouis_brother.htm |publisher=The Joliet Daily News |date=2004-03-26 |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia has also seen such abuse. Details of dozens of offences committed by Brother Robert Best against young boys have been heard in court proceedings. Robert Best, 70, taught at Catholic primary and secondary schools in Ballarat, Box Hill and Geelong (all in Victoria, Australia) between the 1960s and 1980s. He has been convicted by a jury and has pleaded guilty to more than 40 child sex offences against dozens of students, some as young as eight years old.&lt;ref name=Best&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-25/christian-brother-found-guilty-of-chiild-sex-offences/2809210 |title=Christian brother found guilty of child sex offences |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Best was sentenced to fourteen years and nine months jail on August 8, 2011. Many of his victims were in court for the sentencing and shouted at him as he was led away.&lt;ref name=Best2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-08/best-jailed-for-14-years2c-9-months/2829166 |title=Christian Brother jailed for sex abuse |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
