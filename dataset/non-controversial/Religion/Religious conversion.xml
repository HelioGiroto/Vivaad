{{conversion}}

'''Religious conversion''' is the experience of one or more of the following phenomena. At the fundamental level conversion is the awakening of religious knowledge or understanding within a human being who had previously no belief in or concern with religious or spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;a spiritual change from sinfulness, ungodliness, or worldliness to love of God and pursuit of holiness.&quot; [[OED]], Current Edition&lt;/ref&gt; This awakening to moral and spiritual realities thus precedes a transformation of lifestyle and thought patterns often taking place over a long period of time and requiring a significant level of effort and commitment as described in the spiritual teachings of the world's great religions. This transformation is the first and basic meaning of religious conversion. In popular usage, religious conversion refers to the adoption, wholesale, of a set of beliefs identified with one particular [[religious denomination]] to the exclusion of others. Thus 'religious conversion' would describe the abandoning of adherence to one denomination and affiliating with another. This might be from one to another denomination within the same religion, for example, [[Christian]] [[Baptist]] to [[Methodist]] or [[Catholic]],&lt;ref&gt; More conservative Protestants, especially Fundamentalists, would view a &quot;reaffiliation&quot; to Catholicism as a conversion to a new religion.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]] [[Shi'a]] to [[Sunni]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney and Roger Finke. &quot;Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion.&quot; University of California Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-520-22202-1&lt;/ref&gt;

People convert to a different religion for various reasons, including: active conversion by free choice due to a change in beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Falkenberg, Steve. &quot;Psychological Explanations of ''Religious'' Socialization.&quot; Religious Conversion. Eastern Kentucky University. August 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[secondary conversion]], [[deathbed conversion]], conversion for convenience and [[marital conversion]], and [[forced conversion]].

Conversion or reaffiliation for convenience is an insincere act, sometimes for relatively trivial reasons such as a parent converting to enable a child to be admitted to a good school associated with a religion, or a person adopting a religion more in keeping with the [[social class]] he or she aspires to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/im-posh-let-me-in-602284.html The Independent newspaper]: &quot;... finding religion – is there anything middle-class parents won't try to get their children into the 'right' schools?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When people marry one spouse may convert to the religion of the other.

Forced conversion is adoption under duress of a different religion. The convert may secretly retain the previous beliefs and continue, covertly, with the practices of the original religion, while outwardly maintaining the forms of the new religion. Over generations a family forced against their will to convert may wholeheartedly adopt the new religion.

''[[Proselytism]]'' is the act of attempting to convert by persuasion another individual from a different religion or belief system. (See [[proselyte]]).

[[Apostasy|Apostate]] is a term used by members of a religion or denomination to refer to someone who has left that religion or denomination.

{{Main|Conversion to Judaism}}

==== Procedure ====
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] has a number of requirements of potential converts. They should desire conversion to Judaism for its own sake, and for no other motives. A male convert needs to undergo a ritual [[circumcision]] conducted according to Jewish law (if already circumcised, a needle is used to draw a symbolic drop of blood while the appropriate blessings are said), and there has to be a commitment to observe Jewish law. A convert must join the Jewish community, and reject the previous theology he or she had prior to the conversion. Ritual immersion in a small pool of water known as a ''[[mikvah]]'' is required.

====History====
{{Main|List of converts to Judaism}}

In Hellenistic and Roman times, some [[Pharisees]] were eager proselytizers, and had at least some success throughout the empire.

Some Jews are also descended from converts to Judaism outside the Mediterranean world. It is known that some Khazars, Edomites, and Ethiopians, as well as many Arabs, particularly in [[Yemen]] before, converted to Judaism in the past; today people all over the world convert to Judaism. The word &quot;proselyte&quot; originally meant a Greek who had converted to Judaism. As late as the 6th century the Eastern Roman empire (i.e., the Byzantine empire) was issuing decrees against conversion to Judaism, implying that this was still occurring.

In recent times, members of the [[Reform Judaism]] movement began a program to convert to [[Judaism]] the non-Jewish spouses of its intermarried members and non-Jews who have an interest in Judaism. Their rationale is that so many Jews were lost during [[the Holocaust]] that newcomers must be sought out and welcomed. This approach has been repudiated by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews as unrealistic and posing a danger. They say that these efforts make Judaism seem an easy religion to join and observe when in reality being Jewish entails many difficulties and sacrifices.

===Christianity===
{{Main|Conversion to Christianity|Christianization}}

{{Main|List of converts to Christianity}}

Conversion to Christianity is the religious conversion of a previously non-Christian person to some form of Christianity. The exact requirements vary between different churches and [[Christian denominations|denominations]]. The process of converting to [[Catholicism]] involves religious education followed by initial participation in the [[sacraments]]. In general, conversion to Christian Faith primarily involves  [[repentance]] for [[sin]] and a decision to live a life that is holy and acceptable to [[God]] through faith in (the [[atoning]] death and [[resurrection]] of ) [[Jesus Christ]].  All of this is essentially done through a voluntary exercise of the will of the individual concerned. True conversion to Christianity is thus a personal, internal matter and can never be forced. Converts are almost always expected to be [[baptism|baptized]].

Christians consider that conversion requires internalization of the new belief system. It implies a new reference point for the convert's self-identity, and is a matter of belief and social structure—of both faith and affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Hefner, Robert W. ''Conversion to Christianity.&quot; &lt;div&gt; University of California Press, 1993. ISBN 0-520-07836-5&lt;/ref&gt;
This typically entails the sincere avowal of a new belief system, but may also present itself in other ways, such as adoption into an identity group or spiritual lineage.

==== History====
The ancient roman [[saturnalia]] were integrated in Christianity in the 4th century CE, as a means to mass convert the pagan roman citizens.&lt;ref name=simpletoremember-xmas&gt;&quot;Christian leaders succeeded in converting to Christianity large numbers of pagans by promising them that they could continue to celebrate the [[Saturnalia]] as Christians.&quot;{{cite web|last=KELEMEN|first=LAWRENCE|title=The History of Christmas|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/Christmas_TheRealStory.htm|publisher=SimpleToRemember.com|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the saturnalia, human-shaped biscuits were consumed and dance-like singing was performed in the streets, a &quot;precursor of modern [[gingerbread man]]&quot; and [[caroling]]. &lt;ref name=nissenbaum&gt;&quot;Because of its known pagan origin, Christmas was banned by the Puritans and its observance was illegal in Massachusetts between 1659 and 1681.&quot;{{cite book|last=Nissenbaum|first=Stephen|title=The battle for Christmas|year=1997|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679740384|pages=3-4|edition=1st Vintage Books ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruben&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Ruben|title=Why Are The Young People Leaving The Church|year=2011|publisher=Xlibris, Corp.|isbn=978-1465343796|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=iZ9U0BAV8MwC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=University+of+Massachusetts,+Amherst+Nissenbaum+Christmas+illegal+observance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3By-XHLsPS&amp;sig=D0jBaZHomLl6sCnWV70DHGNUlLs&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2auTUKKWFYWztAax_YC4DA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=University%20of%20Massachusetts%2C%20Amherst%20Nissenbaum%20Christmas%20illegal%20observance&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baptism====
{{Main|Baptism}}

[[Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] and many [[Protestant]] denominations encourage [[infant baptism]] before children are aware of their status. In Roman Catholicism and certain [[high church]] forms of Protestantism, baptized children are expected to participate in [[confirmation]] classes as pre-teens. In Eastern Orthodoxy, the equivalent of confirmation, [[chrismation]], is administered to all converts, adult and infant alike, immediately after baptism.

Methods of baptism include  immersion, sprinkling (aspersion) and pouring (affusion).&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. &quot;Baptism.&quot; ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A-D (p. 419). Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995. ISBN 0-8028-3781-6&lt;/ref&gt; Baptism received by adults or younger people who have reached the [[age of accountability]] where they can make a personal religious decision is referred to as [[believer's baptism]] among conservative or evangelical [[Protestant]] groups.
It is intended as a public statement of a person's prior decision to become a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Purpose of Baptism.&quot;
http://gospelway.com/salvation/baptism_purpose.php&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian groups such as [[Catholics]], [[Churches of Christ]], and [[Christadelphians]] believe baptism is essential to salvation.

====Accepting Christ and renouncing sin====
[[Image:RepentanceisContrition&amp;faith.jpg|thumb|220px|The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' divides repentance into two parts: &quot;One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law and Gospel#Book of Concord|knowledge of sin]]; the other is [[Credo|faith]], which is born of the Gospel, or of [[Absolution#Lutheranism|absolution]], and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12 Augsburg Confession, Article XII: Of Repentance]&lt;/ref&gt;]] Conversion is expected to be more than a simple change in religious identity, but a change in nature ([[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]]), evidenced by a change in values. The Latin word ''conversio,'' translating the Greek ''[[Metanoia (theology)|metanoia]]'', literally means &quot;going the other way&quot; or &quot;changing one's mind&quot;. According to Christianity a convert is one who renounces [[sin]] as worthless and treasures instead the supreme worth of Jesus Christ; the convert sees the worth of Christ in Jesus' [[Atonement in Christianity|sacrificial death]] and [[resurrection]] and renounces sin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConversionToChrist&quot;&gt;[http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/ByDate/1983/405_Conversion_to_Christ_The_Making_of_a_Christian_Hedonist/ Conversion to Christ: The Making of a Christian Hedonist]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian convert is expected to believe that his separation from God cannot be overcome by good deeds done out of a desire to achieve individual moral self-satisfaction; rather, he seeks the forgiveness of his sins in the [[blood of Christ]] and wishes to be clothed in the righteousness of Christ. Because conversion is a change in values that embraces God and rejects sin, it includes a personal commitment to a life of [[Sainthood#Christianity|holiness]] as described by [[Paul of Tarsus]] and [[Ministry of Jesus|exemplified by Jesus]]. In some [[Protestant]] traditions, this is called &quot;accepting Christ as one's Savior and following him as Lord.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeSaved&quot;&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/resources/commentaries/index.php?action=getCommentaryText&amp;cid=1&amp;source=1&amp;seq=i.47.16.5 BibleGateway.com- Commentaries » Matthew 16 » The Cost of the Kingdom]&lt;/ref&gt; In another variation, the 1910 Catholic Dictionary defines &quot;conversion&quot; as &quot;One who turns or changes from a state of sin to repentance, from a lax to a more earnest and serious way of life, from unbelief to [[Credo|faith]], from heresy to the true faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd02330.htm New Catholic Dictionary: conversion]&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Orthodox understanding of conversion is illustrated in the rite of baptism, in which the convert faces west while publicly renouncing and symbolically spitting upon Satan, and then turns to the east to worship Christ &quot;as king and God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintsconstantineandelena.org/Liturgy/baptism3.htm † Saints Constantine &amp; Elena: Reception into the Catechumenate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Responsibilities ====
Many [[Christian denominations]] believe that proselytism, understood to be sharing the Gospel, in word or in deed, of Jesus Christ, is a responsibility of all Christians. In the [[New Testament]], Jesus commanded his disciples to &quot;go and make disciples of all nations&quot;{{bibleref2c|Matthew|28:19}}, generally known as the [[Great Commission]]. Accordingly, [[evangelism]]&amp;mdash;&quot;spreading the good news&quot;&amp;mdash;has been practiced by many Christians. Some evangelical Protestants consider that, in order to fulfill the Great Commission, every Christian must be prepared to try to convert nearly everyone they encounter.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Other forms of Christianity such as Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy consider that the Gospel cannot accurately and faithfully be explained, instead favouring evangelism by example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

====Reaffiliation====
Transferring from one Christian denomination to another may consist of a relatively simple transfer of membership, especially if moving from one [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] denomination to another, and if the person has received water [[baptism]] in the name of the [[Trinity]]. If not, then the person may be required to be baptized or rebaptized before acceptance by the new [[Church body|church]]. Some denominations, such as those in the [[Anabaptist]] tradition, require previously baptized Christians to be [[Rebaptism|re-baptized]]. The Eastern Orthodox Church treats a transfer from another denomination of Christianity to Orthodoxy (conceived of as the one true Church) as a category of conversion and repentance, though re-baptism is not always required.

The process of conversion to Christianity varies somewhat among Christian denominations. Most [[Protestants]] believe in conversion by ''faith'' to attain salvation. According to this understanding, a person professes faith in [[Jesus]] Christ as God, their Lord and [[Messiah|savior]]. Repentance for sin and a holy living are expected of those professing faith in Jesus Christ.  While an individual may make such a decision privately, usually it entails being baptized and becoming a member of a denomination or church. In these traditions, a person is considered to become a [[Christian]] by publicly acknowledging the fundamental Christian doctrines that Jesus Christ died, was buried, and was resurrected for the remission of [[sin]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==== Mormonism ====
{{Main|Baptism (Mormonism)}}
[[File:Mormon baptism circa 1850s.png|thumb|right|200px|Mormon baptism ceremony, circa the 1850s]]
Much of the theology of Mormon baptism was established during the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] According to this theology, baptism must be by submersion for the remission of [[sin]]s (meaning that through baptism, past sins are forgiven), and occurs after one has shown faith and repentance. Mormon baptism does not purport to remit any sins other than personal ones, as adherents do not believe in [[original sin]]. Mormon baptisms also occur only after an &quot;[[age of accountability]]&quot; which is defined as the age of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|68|25|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theology thus rejects [[infant baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Mormon theology requires that baptism may only be performed with one who has been called and ordained by God with [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{citation |url= http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gs/b/6 |contribution= Baptism, Baptize: Proper authority |title= Study Helps: Guide to the Scriptures |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church }} &lt;/ref&gt; Because the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement operate under a lay priesthood, children raised in a Mormon family are usually baptized by a father or close male friend or family member who has achieved the office of [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]], which in [[Mormonism]] is conferred upon worthy male members at least 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/study/topics/priest?lang=eng |contribution= Priest |title= Study Helps: Study by Topic |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Baptism is seen as symbolic both of [[Jesus]]' death, burial and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/baptism?lang=eng |contribution= Baptism |title= [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|LDS Bible Dictionary]] |work= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] |publisher= LDS Church }} &lt;/ref&gt; and is also symbolic of the baptized individual putting off of the natural or sinful man and becoming spiritually reborn as a disciple of Jesus.

Membership into a Latter Day Saint church is granted only by baptism whether or not a person has been raised in the church. Most Latter Day Saint churches do not recognize baptisms of other faiths as valid because they believe baptisms must be performed under the church's unique authority. Thus, all who come into one of the Latter Day Saint faiths as converts are baptized, even if they have previously received baptism in another faith.

When performing a Baptism, Latter Day Saints say the following prayer before performing the ordinance: 

{{quote|Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|11|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Baptisms inside and outside the temples are usually done in a [[baptismal font]], although they can be performed in any body of water in which the person may be completely immersed. The person administering the baptism must recite the prayer exactly, and immerse every part, limb, hair and clothing of the person being baptized. If there are any mistakes, or if any part of the person being baptized is not fully immersed, the baptism must be redone. In addition to the baptizer, two priesthood holders witness the baptism to ensure that it is performed properly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Performing Priesthood Ordinances&quot;&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng |contribution= Performing Priesthood Ordinances |title= Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B |year= 2000 |publisher= LDS Church |pages= 41–48 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Following baptism, [[Latter Day Saint]]s receive the [[Gift of the Holy Ghost]] by the [[laying on of hands]] of a [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] holder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Performing Priesthood Ordinances&quot; /&gt;

===Islam===
{{See|Spread of Islam|List of converts to Islam|Hanif|Islamic Missionary Activity|Apostasy in Islam}}
A newly converted [[Muslim]] is called a ''Muallaf''. There are [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars]], or foundations, of [[Islam]] but the primary, and most important is to believe that there is only one God and creator, referred to as [[Allah]] (the word for the name of God in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) and that the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], is His last and final messenger. A person is considered to have converted to Islam from the moment he or she sincerely makes this ''[[Profession (religious)|declaration of faith]]'', called the [[shahada]]h.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.convertstoislam.org/ Converts to Islam ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.convertstoislam.com/How/how.html How to Become a Muslim - Meeting Place for Reverts/Converts To Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam teaches that everyone is Muslim at birth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam101.com/dawah/newBorn.htm Every Child is Born Muslim&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themodernreligion.com/convert/islam_conversion_main.htm Conversion to Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; because every child that is born has a natural inclination to goodness and to worship the one true God alone, but his or her parents or society can cause him or her to deviate from the straight path. When someone accepts Islam he/she is considered to revert to his/her original condition. While conversion ''to'' Islam is among its most supported tenets, conversion ''from'' Islam to another religion is considered to be the sin of [[apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], and in Arab countries it is subject to the penalty of death. In the Koran however, there is no death penalty for apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/short/apostasy/5.htm Apostasy in Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, [[Khitan (circumcision)|circumcision]] is a ''[[Sunnah]]'' custom not mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. The primary opinion is that it is not obligatory and is not a condition for entering into Islam. The [[Shafi`i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools regard it as [[fard|obligatory]], while the [[Maliki]] and [[Hanafi]] schools regard it as only recommended. However, it is not a precondition for the acceptance of a person's Islamic practices, nor does one sin if choosing to forgo circumcision. It is not one of the Five Pillars of Islam or the [[Aqidah|Six Fundamentals of Belief]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision Is Circumcision obligatory after conversion?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 Considering Converting: Is it necessary to be circumcised?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss Circumcision for Converts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
In sharing their faith with others, Bahá'ís are cautioned to &quot;obtain a hearing&quot; – meaning to make sure the person they are proposing to teach is open to hearing what they have to say. &quot;[[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í pioneers]]&quot;, rather than attempting to supplant the cultural underpinnings of the people in their adopted communities, are encouraged to integrate into the society and apply Bahá'í principles in living and working with their neighbors.

Bahá'ís recognize the divine origins of all revealed religion, and believe that these religions occurred sequentially as part of a Divine plan (see [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]]), with each new revelation superseding and fulfilling that of its predecessors. Bahá'ís regard their own faith as the most recent (but not the last), and believe its teachings – which are centered around the principle of the oneness of humanity – are most suited to meeting the needs of a global community.

In most countries conversion is a simple matter of filling out a card stating a declaration of belief. This includes acknowledgement of Bahá'u'llah – the Founder of the Faith – as the Messenger of God for this age, awareness and acceptance of His teachings, and intention to be obedient to the institutions and laws He established.

Conversion to the Bahá'í Faith carries with it an explicit belief in the common foundation of all revealed religion, a commitment to the unity of mankind, and active service to the community at large, especially in areas that will foster unity and concord. Since the Bahá'í Faith has no clergy, converts to this Faith are encouraged to be active in all aspects of community life. Even a recent convert may be elected to serve on a Local Spiritual Assembly – the guiding Bahá'í institution at the community level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Momen |first = M. |year = 1997 |title = A Short Introduction to the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = One World Publications |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 1-85168-209-0 |url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_short_introduction_bahais }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{See also|List of converts to Hinduism}}Clear concepts of [[Religious conversion|conversion]], [[evangelization]], and [[proselytization]] are absent from Hindu texts, playing a marginal role in practice. Early in their history, in the absence of other competing religions, Hindus considered everyone they came across as Hindus and expected everyone they met to be Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Towards a Transcultural Future: Literature and society in a post-colonial world |last=Geoffray |first=Davis |coauthors=Peter Marsden, Benedicte Ledent, Marc Delrez |publisher=Rodopi |year=2005 |pages=106 |isbn=90-420-1736-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_0QNztm0EHYC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lr=&amp;sig=odCSau50iKmPQAAYDT22N4YGsVs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Caste in India |first=Shridhar |last=Ketkar |publisher=Taylor &amp; Carpenter |year=1909 |pages=87–89 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_c9OAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lr=#PPA89,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus today continue to be influenced by historical ideas of acceptability of conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Growse 1996:191&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, many Hindus continue to believe that Hinduism is an identity that can only be had from birth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1997/9/1997-9-18.shtml Italy's Hindu Controversy] [[Hinduism Today]] - September 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while many others continue to believe that anyone who follows Hindu beliefs and practices is a Hindu,&lt;ref&gt;Vasu 1&lt;/ref&gt; and many believe in some form of both theories. However, as a reaction to perceived and actual threat of evangelization, prozelyzation, and conversion activities of other major religions many modern Hindus are opposed to the idea of conversion from (any) one religion to (any) other per se.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Right to Religious Conversion: Between Apostasy and Proselytization |last=Omar |first=Rashid |publisher=Kroc Institute, University of Notre Dame |year=2006 |month=August |pages=3 | url=http://kroc.nd.edu/ocpapers/op_27_1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southeast Asia]] the merchant, sailor, and priestly class accounted for much of the spread of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;Curtin 101&lt;/ref&gt; Many foreign groups including [[Gujjar]]s, [[Ahom people|Ahoms]], and [[Hunas]] converted to Hinduism after generations of [[Sanskritization]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawat 106&lt;/ref&gt; In India and Indonesia today many groups still convert to Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Ramstedt 275&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of [[Hindu revivalist]] movements, conversions to Hinduism have risen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Java's Hinduism Revivial|first=Thomas |last=Reuter|publisher=Hinduism Today | year=2004 |month=September| url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2004/10-12/52-53_revivial.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconversion of former adherents of Hinduism are well accepted since conversion out of Hinduism is not recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Tamil-Nadu-Dalit-Christians-embrace-Hinduism/500277/ Tamil Nadu: Dalit Christians embrace Hinduism] Indian Express - August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no formal process for converting to Hinduism, although in many traditions a ritual called ''[[Diksha|dīkshā]]'' (&quot;initiation&quot;) marks the beginning of spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;Hoiberg 2001:61&lt;/ref&gt; A ritual called ''[[shuddhi]]'' (&quot;purification&quot;) sometimes marks the return to spiritual life after reconversion.&lt;ref&gt;Kuruvachira 2006:283&lt;/ref&gt; Most Hindu sects do not actively seek converts,&lt;ref name=cookson&gt;{{citation | year=2003 | title = Encyclopedia of religious freedom | author1=Catharine Cookson | publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-415-94181-5 | page=180 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R0PrjC1Ar7gC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=seek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coco&gt;{{citation | year=1991 | title = Conflicts and co-existence, India | author1=J.

===Sikhism===
[[Sikhism]] is not known to openly proselytize, but accepts converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/07aug/00137/sikhism.htm ThinkQuest - Sikhism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sikhism.about.com/od/glossary/g/Sikhism.htm About.com - Sikhism]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
[[Jainism]] accepts anyone who wants to embrace the religion. There is no specific ritual for becoming a Jain. You do not need to ask any authorities for admission in Jain faith, you can become a Jain on your own by adopting the five vows. Following the five vows is the basic thing in following Jainism. All other thing like visiting temples, monks etc. are secondary thing.

&lt;!-- Do not change this to all religions, the Parsis do not let anyone convert to Zoroastrianism.--&gt;

===Buddhism===
Persons newly adhering to Buddhism traditionally &quot;take Refuge&quot; (express faith in the Three Jewels — Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) before a monk, nun, or similar representative. Buddhists often hold multiple religious identities, combining the religion with [[Shinto]] (in Japan) or [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] (in China; cf. [[Chinese traditional religion]]).

Throughout the [[timeline of Buddhism]], conversions of entire countries and regions to Buddhism were frequent, as Buddhism spread throughout Asia.  For example, in the 11th century in [[Burma]], king [[Anoratha]] converted his entire country to [[Theravada]] Buddhism. At the end of the 12th century, [[Jayavarman VII]] set the stage for conversion of the [[Khmer people]] to Theravada Buddhism. In the 17th century, during the [[Edo period]] in Japan, Christianity - brought to Japan by the [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] - was outlawed, and all subjects had to register at Buddhist or Shinto temples. Mass conversions of areas and communities to Buddhism occur up to the present day, for example, in the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]] in India there have been [[Dalit Buddhist movement#Organized_mass_conversions|organized mass conversions]].

Exceptions to encouraging conversion may occur in some Buddhist movements. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|current Dalai Lama]] discourages active attempts to win converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cephas-library.com/na/buddhism_dalai_lama_against_prosylitizing.html Dalai Lama opposed to practice of conversion]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other religions and sects ==
Conversion to [[new religious movement]]s (NRMs) is riddled with controversies. The [[anti-cult movement]] sometimes uses the term [[Coercive persuasion|thought reform]] or even [[brainwashing]]. Often they will call certain NRMs [[cult]]s. There are many different definitions for the word cult. NRMs are very diverse and it is not clear whether conversion to NRMs differs from conversion to mainstream religions. However, it is clear that for the first decade or so of any NRM's existence, the overwhelming majority of its members must be converts (because the NRM will not have been in existence long enough for a significant number of its members to have been brought up in it).  It is also clear that every mainstream religion must have gone through this stage when it first emerged.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  See also [[Brainwashing#Brainwashing controversy in new religious movements and cults|Brainwashing controversy in new religious movements]].

Research both in the [[United States|USA]] and the [[Netherlands]] has shown there is a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|positive correlation]] between lack of involvement in mainstream churches in certain areas and provinces and the percentage of people who are a member of a new religious movement. This applies also for the presence of [[New Age]] centres.&lt;ref&gt;Schepens, T.

Bainbridge ''The future of religion: secularization, revival and cult formation'' (1985) Berkeley/Los Angeles/London: University of California press&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch research included [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (though most JW's were previously religious including a number of former ministers, deacons, priests and nuns) and the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]/[[Mormonism]] in the NRMs (which was more indicative of the research){{Clarify|date=October 2010}}.

In the 1960s  sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with [[Unification Church]] [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in [[California]] and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members for their church.  Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion], [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church], ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctorial thesis entitled: &quot;The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes,&quot; and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''.  It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion, and one of the first modern sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In 1965, [[William M. Branham]] started teaching separation from mainstream religion.  In several of his sermons he claimed denominational religion was &quot;The [[Mark of the Beast]]&quot; from the [[Book of Revelation]].

The [[Church of Scientology]] attempts to gain converts by offering &quot;free stress tests&quot; (see picture at [[Scientology#Auditing|auditing]]). Unlike other religions, Scientology requires converts to sign [[contract]]s before attending church.

On the other end of the scale are religions that do not accept any converts, or do so only very rarely. Often these are relatively small, close-knit minority religions that are ethnically-based such as the [[Yazidi]]s, [[Druze]], and [[Mandaeans]]. [[Zoroastrianism]] classically does not accept converts, but this issue has become controversial in the 20th century due to the rapid decline in membership. [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese traditional religion]] lacks clear criteria for membership, and hence for conversion. The [[Shakers]] and some Indian [[Eunuch (court official)#India|eunuch]] brotherhoods do not allow procreation, so that every member is a convert.

==International law==
The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] defines religious conversion as a [[human rights|human right]]: &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief....&quot; (Article 18). In spite of this some groups forbid or restrict religious conversion (see below).

Based on the declaration the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR) drafted the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], a legally binding treaty. It states that &quot;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice...&quot; (Article 18.1). &quot;No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice&quot; (Article 18.2).

The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UNCHR]] issued a General Comment on this Article in 1993: &quot;The Committee observes that the freedom to 'have or to adopt' a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, ''including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another'' or to adopt atheistic views [...] Article 18.2 bars coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief, including the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to their religious beliefs and congregations, to recant their religion or belief ''or to convert''.&quot; (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, General Comment No. 22.; emphasis added)

Some countries distinguish voluntary, motivated conversion from organized proselytism, attempting to restrict the latter. The boundary between them is not easily defined: what one person considers legitimate evangelizing, or witness-bearing, another may consider intrusive and improper. Illustrating the problems that can arise from such subjective viewpoints is this extract from an article by Dr. C. Davis, published in [[Cleveland State University]]'s 'Journal of Law and Health': &quot;According to the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]], [[Jews for Jesus]] and [[Hebrew Christians]] constitute two of the most dangerous cults, and its members are appropriate candidates for deprogramming. Anti-cult evangelicals ... protest that 'aggressiveness and proselytizing ... are basic to authentic Christianity,' and that Jews for Jesus and [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] are not to be labeled as cults. Furthermore, certain [[Hassidic]] groups who physically attacked a meeting of the Hebrew Christian 'cult' have themselves been labeled a 'cult' and equated with the followers of [[Reverend Moon]], by none other than the President of the Central Conference of American Rabbis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/cult_art.htm Joining a Cult: Religious Choice or Psychological Aberration?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the collapse of the former [[Soviet Union]] the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has enjoyed a revival. However, it takes exception to what it considers illegitimate proselytizing by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Salvation Army]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and other religious movements in what it refers to as its ''canonical territory''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Greece]] has a long history of conflict, mostly with [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] but also with some [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] over its laws on proselytism. This situation stems from a law passed in the 1930s by the dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. A Jehovah's Witness, [[Minos Kokkinakis]], won the equivalent of US $14,400 in damages from the Greek state after being arrested for trying to preach his faith from door to door. In another case, Larissis vs. Greece, a member of the Pentecostal church also won a case in the [[European Court of Human Rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Some Islamic countries with [[Sharia|Islamic law]] outlaw and carry strict sentences for proselytizing. Several Islamic countries under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], and [[Maldives]], outlaw [[apostasy]] and carry imprisonment or the death penalty for those leaving Islam and those enticing Muslims to leave Islam.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Also, induced religious conversions in Indian States of Orissa has resulted in communal-riots.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Psychological approaches to religious conversion==
{{Main|Psychology of religion}}

===Edwin Starbuck===
[[Edwin Starbuck (philosopher)|Edwin Starbuck]] criticised the use of religious conversions as evidence to support religion. In 1894 and 1895, he presented two papers on his research into religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/starbuck-e-d-eorl-13/&lt;/ref&gt; Starbuck found that the average age of a religious convert was 15.6. He also noted eight primary motivating factors in a religious conversion:&lt;ref name=&quot;rssupport.org.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.rssupport.org.uk/u6/u6phil/starb.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Fear]]s
#Other self-regarding [[motive]]s
#[[Altruism|Altruistic motives]]
#Following out a [[Morality|moral ideal]]
#Remorse for and conviction of [[sin]]
#Response to teaching
#Example and imitation
#Urging and [[Peer pressure|social pressure]]
It can, therefore, be argued that sociological factors can have a strong influence on religious conversion. It has been noted that, for every year a non-Christian grows older than 25, the likelihood of them converting decreases exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/skepticism/converts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===James H Leuba===
{{Main|James H. Leuba}}
James H Leuba was an American psychologist who studied religious conversion. In 1916, he started a study, intending to test the hypothesis that, the more people were educated, the less they believed in God. His studies compares undergraduates, professors and more distinguished professors; he found that, as one rises on the scale of age and culture, the proportion of unbelievers rises.&lt;ref name=&quot;rssupport.org.uk&quot;/&gt;

In 1997, [[Edward Larson]] and [[Harry Witham]] attempted to replicate Leuba's study. They studied a similar number of scientists, divided between physicists, biologists and mathematicians. Their results were very similar to Leuba's, in that scientists still seemed to be less likely to believe in religion than the average person. Whereas, in Leuba's study, the highest proportion of [[atheist]]s were [[biology|biologists]], the later study revealed that [[physics|physicists]] were now the most atheist group.&lt;ref name=&quot;rssupport.org.uk&quot;/&gt;
