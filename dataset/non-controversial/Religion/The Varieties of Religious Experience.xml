'''''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature''''' is a book by [[Harvard University]] psychologist and philosopher [[William James]]. It comprises his edited [[Gifford Lectures]] on [[natural theology]], which were delivered at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland in 1901 and 1902.

These lectures concerned the nature of religion and the neglect of science, in James' view, in the academic study of religion. Soon after its publication, the book entered the [[Western canon|canon]] of psychology and philosophy and has remained in print for over a century.

James went on to develop his philosophy of [[pragmatism]]. There are many overlapping ideas in ''Varieties'' and his 1907 book, ''Pragmatism''.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Proposition of value versus existential judgment===
James believed that the study of the origin of an object or an idea does not play a role in the study of its value. He asserted that [[Existentialism|existential]] judgment, or the scientific examination of an object's origin, is a separate matter from that object's value. As an example, he alluded to the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] religion and its founder, [[George Fox]].  Many of the scientists in James' audience immediately reject all aspects of the Quaker religion because evidence suggests that Fox was [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]].  Calling this rejection ''medical materialism'',  James insisted that the origin of Fox's notions about religion should not come into account when propositioning the value of the Quaker religion.  As an aside, many believe [[El Greco]] to have suffered from [[astigmatism]], yet no one would dismiss his art based on this medical detail. James proposed, somewhat sarcastically, that his audience's [[atheism]] was perhaps a dysfunction of the [[liver]]. Some believe science to be superior to religion because of religion's seemingly vain, unfounded, or perhaps insane origin. In his lectures, James asserted that these claims, while perhaps historically or [[epistemology|epistemologically]] interesting, play no role in the separate question of religion's value.

===Reality versus symbols of reality===
The lectures discussed the distinction between [[symbol]]ism and reality. [[Symbol]]s, such as the word &quot;steak&quot; on a menu, do not embody the actuality of the objects they represent. The word &quot;steak&quot; on a menu merely points to some slab of meat in the back of the restaurant.  In a similar way, James posits that all of science is fundamentally detached from reality since the tools of science are merely pointers to some actual objective realm. He criticized his audience for the scientific tendency to ignore the unseen aspects of life and the universe.  As an example, he discussed the way the notion of a lemon causes salivation in the mouth of an individual; while there is no lemon, there is clearly a process occurring worthy of academic inquiry.

==Reception==
The August 1902 ''New York Times'' review of the first edition ends with the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1902&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CE5DA113DEE32A2575AC0A96E9C946397D6CF | title= A Study of Man: ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''|work=The New York Times | date=August 9, 1902| accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everywhere there is a frolic welcome to the eccentricities and extravagances of the religious life.  Many will question whether its more sober exhibitions would not have been more fruitful of results, but the interest and fascination of the treatment are beyond dispute, and so, too, is the sympathy to which nothing human is indifferent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A July 1963 ''Time'' review of an expanded edition published that year, ends with quotes about the book from Peirce and Santayana:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,896918,00.html | title= Books: The Waterspouts of God | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=July 19, 1963| accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In making little allowance for the fact that people can also be converted to vicious creeds, he acquired admirers he would have deplored. [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], for instance, hailed James as a preceptor who had showed him that &quot;an action should be judged by its result rather than by its doctrinary basis.&quot; James...had no intention of giving comfort to latter-day totalitarians. He was simply impatient with his fellow academicians and their endless hairsplitting over matters that had no relation to life. A vibrant, generous person, he hoped to show that religious emotions, even those of the deranged, were crucial to human life. The great virtue of ''The Varieties'', noted pragmatist philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]], is its &quot;penetration into the hearts of people.&quot; Its great weakness, retorted [[George Santayana]], is its &quot;tendency to disintegrate the idea of truth, to recommend belief without reason and to encourage superstition.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
