==[[S. Daniel Abraham Israel Program]] merge==
The Israel Program page is small in scope and size. Seems like a good merge. (BTW, original suggestion to merge wasn't from me, but no one had put up a discussion). --[[User:FeldBum|FeldBum]] ([[User talk:FeldBum|talk]]) 10:21, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

==Yeshiva University Medical Ethics Society merge==

The article is too small in scope to be on its own. Merging the two seems natural. --[[User:Ultimus|UlTiMuS]] - ( [[User_talk:Ultimus|T]] | [[Special:Contributions/Ultimus|C]] ) 04:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
:'''Agreed''', although the article barely seems notable. -- [[User:FeldBum|FeldBum]] 12:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)


Well I assume there is more to the article than has been posted
:Plus the society is a student run organization. It was founded and is run by students. They are currently planning a conference on organ donation in jewish law for the fall.  I dont think it belongs on the YU page

==POV and Cleanup==

Regarding cleanup, the History paragraphs read like an article in the Jewish Press, using terms such as &quot;Torah UParnassah&quot; or &quot;Roshei Yeshiva&quot; without defining them. While such terms are 'normalspeak' in the orthodox community, this is an encyclopedia. 

The few sentences about the feud and the consequential opening of Lander College are vague, does not mention Lander to be part of Touro College, and is very biased. --[[User:Geekish|Geekish]] 07:55, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

Please note that I have moved information (student government and dorms) regarding Yeshiva College to the Yeshiva College page. Either the complete university data for these paragraphs should be included, or it should not be on this page.

==Roshei Yeshiva==
It's a real shame that it took this long for there to be a &quot;Roshei Yeshiva&quot; box at the end of this article.  Please do your best to expand articles for those that already exist and begin articles for those Roshei Yeshiva who do not have articles yet.

== logo ==

someone needs to change the logo....it was a swastika but i took it down

The history section is too long? Perhaps someone can condense it down or break it down to history and make a new section for presidents?

The history page is too short, if anything. Maybe a separate article? [[User:Davidmanheim|Davidmanheim]] ([[User talk:Davidmanheim|talk]]) 05:19, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

== Specious Claim ==

&quot;It also placed among the three top universities in the New York area, together with New York and Columbia universities.&quot;  Columbia and NYU are #1 and #2.  Someone has to be #3, but being the next one on the list by itself does not mean it is in the same category as the other two. (Why wouldn't the top 4 be the pertinent group?  Or the top 2?)  USNWR doesn't even hint that NYU, CU and YU are in some category that other New York-area schools are not.  A more accurate description would be &quot;after only New York and Columbia universities&quot;.  

I'm not trying to knock YU, but when a claim like this -- one that sounds substantive but really isn't -- appears in an article it suggests that the claim is unwarranted.  The article's other claims about YU's strength are legitimate, but this one really isn't and it detracts from the others.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/4.232.225.46|4.232.225.46]] ([[User talk:4.232.225.46|talk]]) 20:24, August 30, 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Similarly, &quot;Yeshiva University is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States combining Jewish scholarship with studies in the liberal arts, sciences, medicine, law, business, social work, Jewish studies and education, and psychology.&quot; Seems kind of ridiculous to list it as the oldest one that does all of these things.

== Translation into Chinese Wikipedia ==

==Adding notable faculty and alumni section==

This must be the only university in America that doesn't have such a section on its page.  There are scores of notable graduates, and many faculty (and former faculty)  whose scholarship merits individual web pages.  I may be wrong, but is YU embarrassed that among its many very distinguished alumni are some who are no longer observant?  It happens.  Other Orthodox institutions do list their no-longer-observant grads. [[User:Maimo67|Maimo67]] ([[User talk:Maimo67|talk]]) 23:10, 14 April 2008 (UTC)Maimo67

==Condense this article==
This article is way too detailed into different presidents and time periods and such..Somebody condense this properly w/o taking away the interesting information.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.130.210.114|24.130.210.114]] ([[User talk:24.130.210.114|talk]]) 02:03, 26 April 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Faux alumni ==

The entry has been defaced with faux alumni. Two have been removed, while others of dubious veracity are under investigation.

== Notable alumni - Baruch Goldstein ==

Avunculator added [[Baruch Goldstein]] to the list of notable alumni with the following description: &quot;physician and perpetrator of the Cave of the Patriarchs Massacre.&quot; I removed the information after physician as &quot;unnecessary&quot;. After Avunculator reverted and I reverted back, an IP (not sure if the IP is connected to Avunculator) added the information back. Three different editors reverted, but I believe the central basis of thosse reversions was that the information was unsourced. The IP then sourced the information, which was already in the Goldstein article anyway. My reason for reverting was it was more information than any of the other notable alumni had. The purpose of the list of notable alumni is not to give descriptions as to why they are notable - you can get them from the Wikipedia article about them - it's just to identify them. 

So, I reverted on that basis, and after some additional reversions, the IP posted to my Talk page this comment: &quot;Hello, I contend that the designation of perpetrator of the Cave of the Patriarchs Massacre is fitting, as no one knows Baruch Goldstein as a physician, as his listing would otherwise merely say. It would be dishonest to remove the main thing he is known for from this list. Thank you.&quot;

The IP reverted last, and I'm leaving it permitting others to comment. One possible solution is to remove the entire description, including physician. Several of the notable alumni have no description at all.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 19:06, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

:How about removing the physician part? He is not known for curing people, but killing people.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.8.241.204|99.8.241.204]] ([[User talk:99.8.241.204|talk]]) 19:16, 27 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Orthodox Judaism Navbox Unnecessary ==

The {{tl|Orthodox Judaism}} [[Navbox]] at the bottom of the article seems unnecessary. Considering how broad the navbox is, and how narrow the article, the navbox seems as appropriate to the article as a navbox on education or New York State.

== Notable faculty, alumni ==
