== Politics ==

Irie

the part on politics is very short and says the false when it says Rastafarians are not involved in politics.

Walter Rodney was running for legislation and after Marcus Garvey he gave voice to many secularized ideals behing Rastafarianism.

He ran the Working People's Alliance and his importance into the history of Rastafarianism is stated also by Horace Campbell.

InI think the section should be expanded mostly referring to the good accounts Campbell does in his Rasta Resistance book.

== Earth Changes delete ==

Hey, would you people care to give your opinion about [[Earth changes]]? The article is about to be deleted: [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Earth_changes]]  [[User:Subramanian| Subramanian]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Subramanian|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Repetition ==

I'm sure some of those pictures appear twice.

== Rastafarianism ==

This should be the name of the article as it is the common name, period.[[User:Luciferwildcat|LuciferWildCat]] ([[User talk:Luciferwildcat|talk]]) 00:21, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
:Wrong premise, wrong conclusion; and you've been [[WP:TROLL]]ing here for quite some time now based on that opinion. [[User:Til Eulenspiegel|Til Eulenspiegel]] ([[User talk:Til Eulenspiegel|talk]]) 05:46, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
::That's what everyone calls it. Please avoid personal attacks and assume good faith.[[User:Luciferwildcat|LuciferWildCat]] ([[User talk:Luciferwildcat|talk]]) 05:51, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
:::If that's what &quot;everyone&quot; calls it, then the people who call it something else, do not exist.  That supposition is plainly false, as is your assertion that &quot;everyone&quot; calls it that.  You are trolling here, just as if you went to Talk:Ethiopia and said &quot;Abyssinia should be the name of the article, because that's what everyone calls it&quot;, or if you went to Talk:Inuit and said &quot;Eskimo should be the name of this article, because that's what everyone calls it.&quot;  [[User:Til Eulenspiegel|Til Eulenspiegel]] ([[User talk:Til Eulenspiegel|talk]]) 13:38, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
:::Everyone still calls it rastafarianism, except a few, &quot;nearly everyone&quot; is a common sense of the term everyone but I am not going to write out every remote possibly when I choose my nouns. The rastafarians themselves don't call it that but they also get really uppity and black about it whenever they talk about it at all really aggressive people. Inuit or Eskimo are equally used, only ever heard Abyssinia on old maps, hmm Shall we be forced to call it Myanmar even though everyone calls it Burma?[[User:Luciferwildcat|LuciferWildCat]] ([[User talk:Luciferwildcat|talk]]) 23:54, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
::::Well, I think the last shred of good faith you're not a troll just went out the window! 00:15, 23 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::Oh yeah? Then why do I have 5 did you know articles baby boy?[[User:Luciferwildcat|LuciferWildCat]] ([[User talk:Luciferwildcat|talk]]) 06:18, 23 May 2012 (UTC)
::::::Luciferwildcat, may I ''' very strongly''' suggest that you read [[WP:TPG]] and [[WP:CIVILITY]] before offering further comments here? You may have a point that the term [[Rastafarians]] is more commonly used than [[Rastafari movement]], but your comments and presentation of yourself leave a great deal to be desired. Speaking as someone who has around 50 DYK articles, I have to say that very few people consider that single statistic to necessarily mean that those individuals are always right. &quot;Baby boy&quot; is also another very questionable and unfortunate choice of language. I do note that the encyclopedia ''Africana'' calls its article on the subject &quot;Rastafarians&quot;, so I acknowledge that there is some basis for saying this might as well. However, I also very much believe that conduct such as I have seen above in no way contributes to a civil and productive atmosphere. I think, if you want to pursue the subject, that presenting oneself in a more civil way would very definitely be a step in the right direction. I also note that there have been previous discussions about a name change in each of the first two pages of archives of this talk page. I think it would make a great deal of sense to at least review those previous discussions before starting another discussion on the same topic.

:::Do note that Lucifer isn't even arguing for the name &quot;Rastafarians&quot; but rather for exclusive use of the name '''&quot;Rastafarianism&quot;''' which is already cited in the lede as being a variant which is particularly offensive to members of the movement in Jamaica. In other words, he's going well out of his way to be offensive (and racist in his &quot;they get really black about it&quot; comments above) to members of a religion, which is prohibited by multiple wp policies.

== Rastafarian as Satanist ==

In the bible, the anti-Christ is an important figure. It is defined in 1 John 4:3 as a spirit that does not confess that Jesus is Christ IN THE FLESH. If Haile Selassie was Christ, then Jesus was not (Christ is the Jewish title for Messiah, and the Jews do not assign Jesus with that title.) In 1 John 2:18, the possibility of multiple anti-Christs is enumerated.

For this reason, some have argued that worshiping Haile Selassie is Satanist.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Hamiltek|Hamiltek]] ([[User talk:Hamiltek|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hamiltek|contribs]]) 03:30, 24 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Hamiltek, did you come here just to try to provoke a disturbance (&quot;troll&quot;), by blaring your own personal opinion / bias / theory (&quot;soapbox&quot;) with a religious attack completely mischaracterizing others' belief systems (&quot;strictly forbidden by cornerstone wikimedia policy&quot;), or do you perhaps have anything such as a &quot;reliable source&quot; other than yourself, to whom we could consider attributing such a contorted P.O.V. and non-sequitur logic?
