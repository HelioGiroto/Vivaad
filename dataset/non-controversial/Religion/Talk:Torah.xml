== Title ==

It seems to me to be quite arguable that &quot;Torah&quot; is a sectarian term, and that ''Pentateuch'' is the proper generic term for these five books.  While a great deal of this article deals with the specifically Jewish context of Torah, other parts of it more generally refer to the five books as books, rather than as the basis for Jewish law.  It might make sense to split the article, so that details on the books as such go in [[Pentateuch]], and details on their place in Judaism stay here.  What do people think? [[User:John Kenney|john k]] ([[User talk:John Kenney|talk]]) 02:35, 4 September 2008 (UTC)
:Torah is the first name, and the proper name. Pentateuch is just a Greek term for the Torah that is used by non-Jews. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Serendipodous|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:47, 12 September 2008 (UTC)
:Absolutely correct, almost. The &quot;five books&quot; are called Chumash&quot;, which means &quot;five&quot; [the ch is a soft gutteral]. When compiled into a single work, they are referred to as &quot;Torah&quot;, or teachings/Instructions. Actually, more correctly, it is &quot;Sefer Torah&quot;, which means Book of teachings/instructions. To explain, at the time there were no books, only scrolls and tablets of stone or clay. The Torah is written by hand on a scroll of parchment. The person who does this is often called a &quot;Sefer Schreiber&quot;, which is Yiddish [not Hebrew] for &quot;Book Writer&quot; [scriber = writer or scribe], where &quot;book&quot; means THE book [Torah].It takes about 1 year, and must be devoid of any errors, omissions,corrections or blemishes, as they are the words of God. The Torah is reproduced in book form for usage in prayer by the public. These books are always referred to as Chumash, and never as Torah. In a Synagogue, the congregation uses the book form, the ministers use a Torah. [[User:Historygypsy|Historygypsy]] ([[User talk:Historygypsy|talk]]) 21:57, 1 October 2008 (UTC)
::We seem to revisit this about once a month. The consensus has been that making a distinction between &quot;Torah&quot; and &quot;Pentateuch&quot; is misleading and invites sectarian misstatements. Also, it has inevitably come to the fore that the distinction between the distinction between the books and &quot;law&quot; as a general subject (and yes, I realize that &quot;law&quot; is in some ways a defective translation) is not as sharp as some people would like to make it. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 14:56, 13 October 2008 (UTC)

::: Well next time you revisit this add me to the Pentateuch camp. That's the term of choice in the scholarly and secular literature. (That's something of an understatement, I virtually never see Torah, even in scholarly literature written by Jews.) Plus, &quot;Torah&quot; has several meanings in Jewish parlance, as the article notes. This is not an issue I want to take up at this point, but here's comes my two cents:

:::Reading some previous discussion of this point it seems the problem is that we want 1) to have an article on the Jewish &quot;Torah&quot; concept given how enormously influential that text in its Jewish context is to Judaism, 2) to have generic information about the text, the Pentateuch, and 3) to have only ONE article. I trust we all see the tension :) I think we should have one article, very similar to the one that exists, but with the title as Pentateuch and the intro framing the subject in a generic way. One (large) section would be on Jewish use and the larger &quot;Torah&quot; context. So in summary what I think we should 1) change the article's title, 2) dramatically thin the two enormous paragraphs in the introduction reflecting Jewish use of the Pentateuch and move it to the Judaism section, and 3) move the Torah terminology/scroll stuff of the first paragraph to the terminology section. The new introduction should be along the lines of &quot;. . . an ancient Near Eastern document written in Hebrew . . . &quot;[[User:Carneadiiz|Carneadiiz]] ([[User talk:Carneadiiz|talk]]) 03:39, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
::::That's pushing it. Call it the Torah or the Pentateuch, it still is a purely Jewish document written by Jews for Jews. How other religions subsequently interpreted it has no bearing on how and why it was originally written. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Serendipodous|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 05:21, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
:::::I agree it should primarily be presented in the way it was written. But I feel you are conflating later forms of Judaism with earlier Israelite religions. Usage of the term &quot;Torah&quot; in the Bible, particularly in the Pentateuch is different than in Talmudic/medieval Judaism. So in a sense I agree that the article should be framed in what the histories say about ancient Israelite religion contemporary to the authorship, but stuff like the number of commandments, the terms &quot;Chumash&quot;, its writing on a ritually prepared scroll, oral tradition, midrash, etc. wouldn't make the cut. Those are later Jewish developments. So framing it as an ancient Israelite Near Eastern document I think would result in a very different intro than framing it in Judaism as we have it today. There is quite a bit of scholarship on ancient views of the Pentateuch, and that should be followed for the introduction. THAT is what I have in mind by generic and neutral, as that's the common source from which other views spring. [[User:Carneadiiz|Carneadiiz]] ([[User talk:Carneadiiz|talk]]) 12:44, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
::::::I don't know what you mean by &quot;earlier Israelite religions&quot;. The 70 rabbis who translated the Septuagint were not members of &quot;earlier Israelite religions&quot;; they were Jews. As was Jesus. The Torah already had a significant place in Judaism before Christianity was invented, let alone Islam. &lt;b&gt;[[User:Serendipodous|&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;Serendi&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Serendipodous|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#b00&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#00b&quot;&gt;[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:57, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
:::::::Yes I can see you don't know what I mean. And I'm surprised you would cite the legendary Letter of Aristeas concerning the Septuagint that contradicts all modern research, which in any event post-dates the period I'm referring to.

== Flame writing ==

The article incorrectly states that the Hebrew alphabet is called &quot;the flame alphabet&quot; because of a Kabbalistic idea (or maybe folk etymology?) about the torah being written in fire.

:The Biblical Hebrew language is sometimes referred to as &quot;the flame alphabet&quot; because many devout Jews believe that the Torah is the literal word of God written in fire.

Only the k'tav ashuri / k'tivah tammah is called &quot;flame writing,&quot; and that is because of the &quot;flare&quot; on the top corner of each letter, which is diminished or absent in the cursive script. &quot;Instead of the little ornaments at the upper ends of the stems, [in the cursive script] a more or less weak flourish of the line appears.&quot; ([http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1308&amp;letter=A#3547 Jewish Encyclopedia]). In fact, a Kabbalah site even states: &quot;The 22 letters are called flame letters because they are each drawn with a flame coming out the top.&quot; ([http://www.yhwhhouse.com/22Letters.html]). Please remove the incorrect sentence from the article. Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/24.243.3.27|24.243.3.27]] ([[User talk:24.243.3.27|talk]]) 02:15, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

==Tawrat and Torah==
The Tawrat and Torah are not one and same thing that is why should be written seperately.Tawrat of Quran is an attribute of Al-kitab like Quran and meaning of this word is Law. This law is written in وَكَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِيهَا أَنَّ النَّفْسَ بِالنَّفْسِ وَالْعَيْنَ بِالْعَيْنِ وَالأَنفَ بِالأَنفِ وَالأُذُنَ بِالأُذُنِ وَالسِّنَّ بِالسِّنِّ وَالْجُرُوحَ قِصَاصٌ فَمَن تَصَدَّقَ بِهِ فَهُوَ كَفَّارَةٌ لَّهُ وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ

[5:45] And We prescribed to them in it that life is for life, and eye for eye, and nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth, and (that there is) reprisal in wounds; but he who foregoes it, it shall be an expiation for him; and whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed, those are they that are the unjust. 

.At-tawrat of of Al-Quran is given to all prophets , including prophet Mohammad saw إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالأَحْبَارُ بِمَا اسْتُحْفِظُواْ مِن كِتَابِ اللّهِ وَكَانُواْ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَاء فَلاَ تَخْشَوُاْ النَّاسَ وَاخْشَوْنِ وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِآيَاتِي ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ

[5:44] Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and light; with it the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) judged (matters) .... 5:44 where as Torah is refered to Moses pbuh. Tawrat of Al-kitab is the ayats having order of Allah 5:43 and the order of Allah is in ayats of alkitab called mother of the Book.هُوَ الَّذِيَ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ مِنْهُ آيَاتٌ مُّحْكَمَاتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ في قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَاء الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَاء تَأْوِيلِهِ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلاَّ اللّهُ وَالرَّاسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ الألْبَابِ

[3:7] He it is Who has revealed the Book to you; some of its verses are decisive, they are the mother  of the Book, .....

== References to stars and planets discovered in Torah ==

Hi there, please take note that new discoveries were made that show where and how the Old Testament / Torah contains direct references to stars and astronomic cycles.
There are those stars all over the Torah which we can find using '''four''' different approaches: comparing the life spans and ages at childbirth of patriarchs to risings and settings of stars; comparing the sum of the total ages of patriarchs to known astronomical cycles; calculating planetary visibility cycles by the total verse count when taking a verse as a day; arranging the verses of Genesis and Leviticus in concentric circles and then looking for gematric word values. The last approach yields reproducible star maps, 10 in number. Not nine, not twelve, not 26. Ten like ten Sephiroth.
Note that those four approaches are '''not necessarily connected''' and can be applied '''independently'''. Three of them are introduced at length in the post linked below. Please go to http://theoryoftorah.blogspot.com/2009/05/why-are-there-references-to-stars-and.html

== the Torah has central significance to Christians ==

&quot;However, in both religions they lack the central significance that they have in Judaism.&quot;
that's wrong.  it is much more significant to Christians than to muslims (who Israel belongs to, the characteristics of the messiah, the inneracy of the word of God, even the existence of the Jewish temples and their locations, show real love and respect to the Jews). 
if the messiah of the Torah (accepted by Judaism) came tomorrow Jews would treat the Torah the exact same way Christian do now.  the purpose of the messiah is to give us a better covenant, priest (dealing with our sin before God).
orthodox Jews would worship the messiah.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.7.238.116|71.7.238.116]] ([[User talk:71.7.238.116|talk]]) 18:09, 9 August 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
Orthodox Jews would worship the Messiah?  Absolutely not.  Orthodox Jews declare every morning and evening &quot;Listen, Israel: the Lord is G-d; the Lord is One&quot;.  This fundamental statement of belief declares that G-d is indivisible and all-encompassing.  Messiah (literally the annointed one) will be a human being, a descendant of the line of David, who will lead the Jewish people out of their 2000 year exile.  The divine concept of Messiah is a strictly Christian one and quite alien to Jewish thought.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Apsidal|Apsidal]] ([[User talk:Apsidal|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Apsidal|contribs]]) 19:22, 17 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Definition ==

&quot;The word &quot;Torah&quot; in Hebrew &quot;is derived from the root ירה which in the hifil conjugation means &quot;to teach&quot; (cf. Lev. 10:11). The meaning of the word is therefore &quot;teaching,&quot; &quot;doctrine,&quot; or &quot;instruction&quot;; the commonly accepted &quot;law&quot; gives a wrong impression.&quot;[12] Other translational contexts in the English language include custom, theory, guidance,[13] or system.[14] The term &quot;Torah&quot; is therefore also used in the general sense to include both Judaism's written law and oral law, serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative Jewish religious teachings throughout history...&quot;

:I see your point, but ''in this article'' it means just the Five Books. The definition needs to be restricted a bit. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 12:56, 28 August 2009 (UTC)

::&quot;Torah&quot; includes &quot;written&quot; and &quot;oral&quot; Torah. That is, ''&quot;Torah Shebichtav&quot;'' and ''&quot;Torah Shebe'al Peh.&quot;'' In fact the article already says this. Another sense in which Torah is used is to refer to a physical object. You are probably just referring to the physical object, often existing in a scroll form, though also bound into books ([[codices]]), which contain the &quot;five books.&quot; [[User:Bus stop|Bus stop]] ([[User talk:Bus stop|talk]]) 13:28, 28 August 2009 (UTC)

=='Indefinite article'==
I believe the talk of 'indefinite article' in the following is misguided for a number of reasons.
1. This page is on the Torah, so quirks of English language usage are non appropriate. 2. This is true of most words in English. Without an article, a noun generally refers to an ideal, with an article it refers to a specific example of it. This same comment could be said of cat, carrot, beer or any other concrete noun in English. 3. It is non even entirely accurate, as definite articles can also be used to refer to Sefer Torah.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When used with an indefinite article, &quot;a Torah&quot; usually refers to a &quot;''[[Sefer Torah]]''&quot; (סֵפֶר תּוֹרָה, &quot;book of Torah&quot;) or Torah scroll, written on [[parchment]] in a formal, traditional manner by a specially trained [[sofer|scribe]] under very strict requirements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== [[Salvation]] ==

Would people please comment [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Salvation#NPOV here]?  I may overstate the case or oversimplify in saying that there is no idea of salvation in Judaism.  My real point is that whatever Jews mean by salvation is so different from Christianity they are not well-served by being in one article.  Perhaps Wikipedia could use a good article going into the long history of the concept of salvation in Judaism, but right now the current Salvation aricle is NOT &quot;it&quot; and I think the differences between Christianity and Judaism here are so great that it makes the intro an NPOV nightmare.

== Changes to the &quot;authorship&quot; section ==

I've made a large edit to the authorship section to bring it into line with modern biblical scholarship. The major changes are:
1. Mosaic authorship. I've deleted this entirely and replaced it with a single sentence noting its existence. It has no following at all among modern scholars - this can be checked from authoritative sources such as the Anchor Bible Dictionary - and due weight means that it shouldn't be treated as if it does. I've kept a link to the article on the subject, since it does have some historical interest.
2. Modern scholarship. This was as much out of date as the subsection on Mosaic authorship - the description given was of the Wellhausen version of the documentary model, which has been abandoned since the 1970s. There was nothing at all about contemporary theories, which tend to belong to the supplementary model (fragmentary models aren't actually very influential). [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 00:35, 16 November 2009 (UTC)

::The lack of references for such a major change is a big problem. I'd expect citations specifically documenting the change of opinion within the field.

[[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 01:26, 16 November 2009 (UTC)

The changes aren't really so major. The last para of the subsection on Mosaic authorship already says this: &quot;Mosaic authorship was accepted with very little discussion by both Jews and Christians until the 17th century, when the rise of secular scholarship and the associated willingness to subject even the Bible to the test of reason led to its rejection by mainstream biblical scholars. The majority of modern scholars believe that the Torah is the product of many hands, stretching over many centuries, reaching its final form only around the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.&quot; In other words, Mosaic authorship isn't accepted by mainstream modern scholarship. Giving it this large section, as if it were still important, is therefore misleading our readers. I have no quarrel with mentioning it in a single sentence with a link to the separate article on the subject. (Material from this subsection mi9ght usefully be moved into that article, which is a little thin in some regards).

The section on modern scholarship is simply wrong. The documentary hypothesis it describes is that of Wellhausen, and is now over a century old - the modern documentary hypothesis is somewhat different, as the Wiki article on the subject makes clear. Things have moved on. In my first post in this thread I mentioned the Anchor Bible Dictionary. Please have a look at that. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 07:21, 16 November 2009 (UTC)

On 18 December 2009, user 68.197.238.62 did make that proposed edit, which was made in good faith, but has some problems in terms of WP standards. It changed only one instance of the word, creating an undesirable spelling inconsistency. Also, I believe that: (a) the stated intent would have called for &quot;Bemidbar&quot;, rather than &quot;B'midbar&quot;, per [[WP:Naming conventions (Hebrew)]]; and (b) the whole concept of that edit also failed the &quot;Conventional spelling is preferred&quot; guideline of [[WP:Romanization]], which I think supports &quot;Bamidbar&quot;. I've reversed that edit and would like to see a consensus on the romanized spelling of the Hebrew name for the Book of Numbers. It occurs to me, for example, that there may be a consensus already in scholarly publications that we could reference. We should focus on the Hebrew word that represents the book ''title'', which may well be &quot;Bamidbar&quot; even though the word that appears in the first sentence of that book is &quot;Bemidbar&quot;. (P.S.: Perhaps the talk page of the [[Book of Numbers]] or [[Bamidbar (parsha)]] article would be a better page for this discussion, but we can always move the discussion later, if that is desired.) --[[User:Rich Janis|Rich Janis]] ([[User talk:Rich Janis|talk]]) 09:50, 18 August 2010 (UTC)

==Years of Talmud, precision, When?==

==Subjective treatment of Authorship==
I would assume that most college students, like myself, are bombarded with the JEDP hypothesis and its apologetic concessions. Too often, apparent contradictions are portrayed as absolute, and the documentary hypothesis is portrayed as &quot;What all modern scholars accept&quot;. Thus, I would like to point out the subjective treatment of authorship.

This article has a clear preference toward the JEDP hypothesis. While the 'academic analysis' only supports the JEDP hypothesis, the 'Mosaic authorship' is diluted extensively.

Within the 'Mosaic authorship' category, there's a very weak argument that I would like to remove- or at least qualify. The argument begins with a passage that, according to one source, best represents the Torah's argument for Mosaic authorship. Using that single passage, the author begins with an unsubstantiated claim that there exists an anachronism. 

&quot;Further&quot;, states the author, the word &quot;Torah&quot; is used in Numbers to refer to an individual section of the Pentateuch; thus, it &quot;seems forced&quot; for the passage to refer to Moses writing the Pentateuch. I consider this part of the argument faulty because:
     1) The earlier uses of &quot;Torah&quot; are in a different context in a different portion of the 
        Pentateuch.
     2) The argument suggests that this individual passage may only 
        refer to a portion of the Pentateuch- but it provides no evidence 
        of the broader point.
     3) The combination of this passage and others is what points toward 'Torah' meaning Pentateuch
The third of three points is very cryptic.

My main problem with the argument is that it attempts to belittle a single passage about Mosaic authorship, and in doing so, it attempts to generalize the criticism to every passage about Mosaic authorship.

Like all attempts to disprove Mosaic authorship, this argument is subjective. I hope that my changes will be be maintained.

I apologize for the bluntness- I just dislike the notion that every scholar supports the documentary hypothesis. This notion is false. Most 'Old Testament' classes favorably treat the JEDP hypothesis simply because academic institutions generally require secular treatment of religious topics. Most academic articles on the Torah explore the JEDP hypothesis because source criticism opens up the playing ground for a vast amount of journal articles. The religious scholars who believe in Mosaic authorship typically choose Yeshiva or Divinity school over academic institutions. I believe that our rabbis, preachers, and imams are just as scholarly as the JEDP article-publishing guys.

--After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end, he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD : &quot;Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. There it will remain as a witness against you. (Deuteronomy 24-26)

== The authorship section is obviously biased toward modern scholarship ==

From the Mosaic Authors subsection: &quot;Still, there are sufficient ways to explain apparent 'anachronisms' and there is much evidence to support Mosaic authorship.&quot;

In light of the fact that there is little or no evidence beyond that found in religious texts to support the notion that Moses authored the Torah, the preceding statement is absolutely horrendous. Furthermore, it is linked to three weak references, all three of which appear to be from a conservative religious viewpoint and are not peer-reviewed. The first reference is a discussion from a Bible study website; the second reference is an article in a monthly Christian journal written by a minister and another individual with no formal academic degree; and the third reference apparently is an undergraduate paper that provides support for Mosaic authorship based solely on biblical references. Due to its lack of evidence, I think that the preceding statement should be removed.

Toward the end of the Academic Analysis subsection: &quot;The documentary hypothesis has been increasingly challenged since the 1970s, and alternative views now see the Torah as having been compiled from a multitude of small fragments rather than a handful of large coherent source texts,[31] or as having gradually accreted over many centuries and through many hands.&quot;

The preceding statement is confusing and makes it seem as if modern scholarship is more contradictory than it is consistent with the documentary hypothesis. Although it is true the documenatary hypothesis in its original form &quot;has been increasingly challenged,&quot; the &quot;alternative views&quot; that are subsequently mentioned both agree that the Torah was written by multiple authors. Thus, according to the large majority of modern scholars, the only matter of debate concerns the process in which multiple authors wrote the Torah, not if the Torah was written by multiple authors or not. Due to its lack of clarity, I think that the preceding statement should be modified to make it clear that modern scholarship is largely in support of the notion that multiple individuals authored the Torah, although this general viewpoint has continued to be refined over time.

==Present multiple views, not just two==
This article should present multiple views of the subject, not just two.  Earlier versions of this article described the breadth of religious views on the authorship of, and textual development of the Torah. However, acouple of years ago this entire section was removed without comment, and replaced with a few bland lines leading the reader to believe that only two views existed: the right-wing Orthodox point of view, or a secular point of view. As such, this article has misled people as to the true variety of views of the Jewish community. These views were not monolithic, and it unfortunate that the views of major, important Torah commentators were removed.

I have thus restored this section - especially the brief discussion of a book which is written solely by Orthodox rabbis, and shows that even in Orthodoxy they admit that this diversity of viewpoints did exist, and continues to exist, because, in accord with Wikipedia's NPOV policy, editors can not wipe out entire points of view.

== Confusing section on &quot;Mosaic Authorship&quot; ==

The following text, as it now appears in the article, is confusing for a few reasons:

'Modern biblical scholars see no signs of Mosaic authorship, but indications of much later writing:[10]&quot;Here and there in the Pentateuch Moses is said to have written certain things ... but nowhere is it affirmed that the Pentateuch was authored by Moses ... One would therefore think that what calls for an explanation is not why most people stopped believing in the dogma of Mosaic authorship, but rather why anyone believed it in the first place.&quot;[11]'

This paragraph does not clearly explain what &quot;Mosaic Authorship&quot; means, exactly. Jews, throughout most of the history of Judaism, and many to this day, have never claimed that Moses was the author of the Torah, but rather that he copied it down the way it was dictated to him - some opinions even including the parts relating to Moses' own death. So the &quot;dogma&quot; of &quot;Mosaic Authorship&quot; mentioned in the above paragraph cannot be traditional Jewish religious dogma - does &quot;dogma&quot; refer to a dogma of secular academic scholarship, or perhaps a religious but non-Jewish dogma? Perhaps by &quot;Mosaic Authorship&quot; the writer means &quot;Mosaic Transcription&quot;? This is confusing and unclear, and may be the product of editing without complete reworking of the idea structure of the article, or of placing an outside quotation within the article without giving adequate background. Additionally, the end of the paragraph seems to be ridiculing whoever believes in &quot;Mosaic Authorship&quot;. Is a ridiculing tone appropriate for Wikipedia? Also, is it an academic or a religious position which is being ridiculed? Are Jews being called fools? It just feels wrong. Thanks.

== Five Books vs. Seven ==

The article states that the Pentateuch is a misnomer because the book of Bemidbar (Numbers)is in fact divided into three parts, and cites a source in Shabbat 115-116 to this effect. I changed it back to five for the following reasons:

1) Individual books of the Pentateuch are called Chumashim/Fifths in the Talmud itself. For example, Megillah 26b, 5th wide line of the standard Vilna edition.

2) At the end of each book, there are four blank lines in the Torah scroll. The Torah is thus demarcated into 5 books. (See Mishneh Torah, Ahavah, Hilchot Mezuzah 7:7).

3) The source in Shabbat discusses a law completely unrelated to the actual structure of a Torah scroll. Rather, the question is how much of a scroll needs to be intact in order to rescue it on the Sabbath. There is a disagreement as why that particular portion of Numbers has signs (either because it is misplaced or because it is in fact its own book), but no conclusion is drawn and it is never directly related to the question of how much of a Torah must be intact to save it. The Mishneh Torah in Shabbat 23:28 does not give a reason for the 85-letter requirement.  [[User:Octologue|Octologue]] ([[User talk:Octologue|talk]]) 17:04, 25 March 2011 (UTC) Octologue

==Suggestions for the shape of the article==
There's a danger of preoccupying with the origins of the &quot;written Torah&quot;, the five books. Fascinating though this subject is, it's just the beginning of what Torah means in Judaism. Discussion of origins can be dealt with in a sentence or two, and then move on to more important matters - how Torah is central to Jewish community life, for example.

::This goes back to a fairly frequent theme on these Ancient Israel vs Modern Judaism talk pages,[[Shabbat]] vs [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], [[Tanakh]] vs [[Hebrew Bible]] etc, whether any given article term should be (a) what the term means to dead scholarship - typically [[ANE]] scholarship, or (b) what the term means in living Judaism. In theory you'd have thought it would/should be possible to accomodate both in the same article as the Jewish Encyclopedia and Encyclopedia Judaica do. But evidently &quot;what ''Torah'' means in Judaism&quot; is more than &quot;Five Books&quot;... I would have thought the best way to do it would be as the JE does it; but here the JE tries to handle Torah with a hatnote in the first line of lede disamb. back to Pentateuch.

== Please be consistent and change &quot;Torah&quot; (w/ H) to &quot;Tora&quot; (w/o H) ==

On the Wikipedia pages for [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], why is תורה transliterated as Torah (with the letter H at the end), but הלכה is transliterated as Halakha (without the letter H at the end)?  They both end in the Hebrew letter [[He (letter)|Hei]], it's not like one of them ends in [[Aleph|Alef]] or something else that would not deserve a H.  The English letter H, although it is derived from the Hebrew letter [[Heth|Chet]], nowadays it is pronounced like [[He (letter)|Hei]].  Therefore, for consistency's sake, I propose that either Torah should become Tora, or Halakha should become Halakhah - you shouldn't be able to have it both ways!

:&quot;Torah&quot; is the usual form in English sources and a quick check of &quot;halakha&quot; seems to show that that is the usual rendition of that word.

== Edits by Learned69 in August 2012 ==

I am a visitor to this page, but it seems that Learned69 has made some significant edits to the page without explaining why they were made and why they were necessary. The following section seems unclear:
:&quot;A most crucial issue that these theories do not address is whether the Torah is true or whether its a work of fiction.  If it is true what was the source material that those authors used that recorded all of the dialogue, including the exact statutory language of the laws and commandments, that is the bulk of the Torah. The Torah also has many precise and obscure details, such as the exact number of each of the 12 tribes in the two census' that the Torah tells of, the lengthy family trees of Adam's grandchildren, the exact names of the presidents of each of the tribes, to name a few, that could not have been known thousands of years later without some written record. If it is a work of fiction how did a nation, dating at least to 100 BC, confuse this book, written a mere couple of hundred years earlier, with God's word and subject itself to its commandments. It also fails to account for the existence of the oral law (Section 5 of this article) (ref). &quot;
This paragraph seems out of step with the other ones - both in style and content. It is not clear whether Learned69 is presenting one or two points of view. Please clarify --[[User:Muchado|Muchado]] ([[User talk:Muchado|talk]]) 11:41, 25 August 2012 (UTC)

The point is that the theories do not address crucial issues so that they can provide an adequate and satisfactory explanation for the existence of the Torah.[[User:Learned69|Learned69]] ([[User talk:Learned69|talk]]) 08:21, 5 September 2012 (UTC)

I have changed this in two ways: &quot;According to religious Jews&quot; into &quot;According to tradition&quot;; &quot;with the exception&quot; into &quot;with the possible exception&quot;. As to the first, not all religious Jews, and not only religious Jews (this is also part of Christian tradition), believe in Mosaic authorship. As to the second, not all people who believe in Mosaic authorship accept that Moses did not (or, indeed, ''could'' not) write (under divine guidance) about his own death. BTW, this is somewhat a duplication of earlier remarks, but I'm leaving those unchanged. [[User:TomS TDotO|TomS TDotO]] ([[User talk:TomS TDotO|talk]]) 17:51, 23 September 2012 (UTC)

Can you please cite at least on source that says that Moses wrote of his own death. There is a discussion in the talmud about this and all are in agreement that he did not write it. The Talmud says that writing it would be a lie.

:I will defer to your learning, but I have, from time to time, come across the idea that it is possible that Moses wrote those final verses. I have recently looked that up on the web (and I freely admit that I have no idea of the reliability of these sources). From this online source [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Bible/Origins_of_the_Bible/Authorship/Torah_of_Moses.shtml]

:&quot;'So Moses, God's servant, died there' (Deuteronomy 34:5). But is it possible that Moses wrote 'So Moses died' while he was still alive?!' Rather, Moses wrote up to this point, and from here on, Joshua the son of Nun wrote—these are the words of R. Judah…[R. Shimon raises an alternative:] Up to this point, God spoke and Moses repeated and wrote; after this point, God spoke and Moses wrote in tears&quot; (Menachot 30a).

That link to kabbalaonline gives the proper definition of the term used in the Talmud, ''dema'', which it defines as mixture, as in mixed up letters, and not tears. The Talmud has two questions, if Moses wrote it it would be a lie, and if he didn't write it then the book of the Torah that Moses gave to the Levites would be missing several verses and therefore invalid. The [[Vilna Gaon]] asks that the answer of Moses writing it in tears doesn't answer either of the questions as writing in tears is still a lie and also the book of the Torah would still be invalid, as a Torah must be written in ink and not in tears. He too reached the same conclusion as that article, that the term ''dema'' does not mean tears, but a mixture of letters, the letters that the Torah was orignially written in before is was converted into the words as we now have them.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Learned69|Learned69]] ([[User talk:Learned69|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Learned69|contribs]]) 00:20, 1 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::I'm not arguing whether or not Moses wrote the verses in question. All I'm suggesting is that there is an opinion worth mentioning to the small extent of saying &quot;(possibly)&quot; in this Wikipedia article.

Orthodox , Sephardic, a majority of Israeli Jews[25] and other Jews, including many whom are not observant[25], reject critical Bible scholarship and the documentary hypothesis, holding to the opinion that it is against what they accept as the historical narrative, and is contradicted by the Torah in Deuteronomy 31:24,25 and 26, and the Talmud (Gittin 60a, Bava Basra 15b), which state that Moses wrote the Torah, as well as by the Mishnah[26], which asserts the divine origin of the Torah as one of the essential tenets of Judaism.   L69  keeps restoring this section.  Here is the source for these claims.  http://jcpa.org/dje/articles2/howrelisr.htm   This source does not substantiate the claims above, and makes no reference to biblical scholarship or the doc hypothesis.

That source says that they accept the tradition, people accept a tradition according to the basis of that tradition, distinguishing between an old wive's tale and a tradition with a basis that convinces them to accept it. So by accepting a tradition they are &quot;in general holding to the opinion&quot; of the basis of that tradition. That source is not the basis for the tradition.
