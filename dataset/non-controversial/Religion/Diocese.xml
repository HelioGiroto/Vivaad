[[Image:Alencastre Window.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Pope Pius XI]] blesses [[Bishop]] [[Stephen Alencastre]] as fifth [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Honolulu|Apostolic Vicar of the Hawaiian Islands]] in a [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]] [[stained glass window|window]]. In [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[pope]] is the bishop of the [[Diocese of Rome]]. He creates the other [[List of Roman Catholic dioceses|dioceses]] throughout the world and chooses their bishops.]]

A '''diocese''' is the district or [[Episcopal see|see]] under the supervision of a [[bishop]]. It is divided into [[parish]]es.

An '''archdiocese''' is more significant than a diocese. An archdiocese is presided over by an [[archbishop]] whose see may have or had importance due to size or historical significance. The archbishop may have metropolitan authority over any other (then 'suffragan') bishops and their dioceses within his [[ecclesiastical province]].

This structure of church governance is known as [[episcopal polity]].  

A diocese also may be referred to as a '''''bishopric''''' or ''[[episcopal see]]'', though strictly the term ''episcopal see'' refers to the domain of ecclesiastical authority officially held by the bishop, and the term ''bishopric'' to the post of being bishop. 

:The bishops, ''Greek: Episkopos, elders or overseers,'' of the long-established churches claim Apostolic succession, a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles.

:The word ''diocese'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''διοίκησις'', meaning &quot;administration&quot;.

==Catholic Church==

{{As of|2009|1}} there are 630 Catholic archdioceses (including 13 [[patriarchate]]s, two [[catholicate]]s, 536 metropolitan archdioceses, 79 single archdioceses) and 2,167 dioceses in the world.

===Eastern Catholic churches===
In the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] (which recognize papal authority and are a part of the larger Catholic Church), the equivalent unit is called an [[eparchy]].

==Eastern Orthodox Church==

[[Eastern Orthodoxy|The Eastern Orthodox Church]] calls dioceses '''metropoleis''' in the Greek tradition or '''eparchies''' in the Slavic tradition.

==Church of England and Anglican Communion==

After the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], the [[Church of England]] retained the existing diocesan structure which remains throughout the [[Anglican Communion]].

==Lutheranism==

===Poland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Finland===
Certain [[Lutheran]] denominations such as the [[Church of Sweden]] do have individual dioceses similar to Roman Catholics. These dioceses and archdioceses are under the government of a bishop (see [[Archbishop of Uppsala]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm Adam of Bremen, Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum], online text in Latin; scholia 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Lutheran bodies and synods that have dioceses and bishops include the [[Church of Denmark]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (partially), and the [[Church of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[List of Lutheran dioceses and archdioceses]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheranism in USA===
Some American Lutheran synods such as the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] do have a bishop acting as the head of the synod,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Office-of-the-presiding-bishop.aspx Office of the Presiding Bishop] on ELCA.org. Retrieved 2010-16-04.&lt;/ref&gt; but the synod does not have dioceses and archdioceses as the churches listed above. Rather, it is divided into a [[middle judicatory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.elca.org/ecumenical/lern/lerning_vol2_no4.pdf LERNing newsletter from July 2005] at ELCA.org. Retrieved 2010-16-04.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Lutheran Church-International]], based in [[Springfield, Illinois]], presently uses a traditional diocesan structure, with four dioceses in [[North America]]. Its current president is Archbishop Robert W. Hotes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranchurchinternational.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churches That Have Bishops, But Not Dioceses==

===Methodism===
{{See also|Methodist Circuit|Episcopal Area}}
In the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|British Methodist Church]] and [[Methodist Church in Ireland|Irish Methodist Church]], churches are grouped together in sections. Sections are grouped together to form [[Methodist Circuit|Circuits]]. Circuits are grouped together to form Districts. All of these, combined with the local membership of the Church, are referred to as the 'Connexion'. This 18th-century term, endorsed by [[John Wesley]] who remained within the Church of England, describes how people serving in different geographical centres are 'connected' to each other. The Methodist Church has an annual president. Each District is headed by a 'Chair' who oversees its functioning. Each Circuit is governed by a superintendent minister. The geographical regions covered by circuits and dioceses rarely overlap.

In the [[United Methodist Church]] (the United States and some other countries), a [[bishop]] is given oversight over a geographical area called an [[Episcopal Area]].  Each episcopal area contains one or more [[annual conference]]s, which is how the churches and clergy under the bishop's supervision are organized.  Thus, the use of the term &quot;diocese&quot; referring to geography is the most equivalent in the United Methodist Church, whereas each annual conference is part of one episcopal area (though that area may contain more than one conference).  The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] has a similar structure to the United Methodist Church, also using the Episcopal Area.

==Churches That Have Neither Bishops Nor Dioceses==

===Baptists===
Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pinson, William M., Jr. |title=Trends in Baptist Polity |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society |url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Baptists believe in &quot;Two offices of the church&quot;—pastor-elder and deacon—based on certain scriptures ({{Bibleref2|1Tim|3:1–13||1 Timothy 3:1–13}}; {{Bibleref2|Titus|1–2}}).

Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of [[Elder (Christianity)#Baptists|elders]], as well as the [[Episcopal Baptist]]s that have an [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal system]].

== History ==

[[File:Roman Empire with dioceses in 400 AD.png|thumb|right|280px|&lt;center&gt;Dioceses &lt;br&gt;of the Roman Empire &lt;br&gt;400 AD&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{See also|Bishop#Bishops and civil government|l1=Bishops and civil government}}
In the later organization of the [[Roman Empire]], the increasingly subdivided [[Roman province|provinces]] were administratively associated in a larger unit, the [[Roman diocese|diocese]] ([[Latin]] ''dioecesis'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''διοίκησις'', meaning &quot;administration&quot;).

With the adoption of Christianity as the Empire's official religion in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], the clergy assumed official positions of authority alongside the civil governors. A formal church hierarchy was set up, parallel to the civil administration, whose areas of responsibility often coincided. 

With the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] in the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the bishops in Western Europe assumed a large part of the role of the former Roman governors. A similar, though less pronounced, development occurred in the East, where the Roman administrative apparatus was largely retained by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In modern times, many diocese, though later subdivided, have preserved the boundaries of a long-vanished Roman administrative division. For Gaul, Bruce Eagles has observed that &quot;it has long been an academic commonplace in France that the medieval dioceses, and their constituent ''[[Pagus|pagi]]'', were the direct territorial successors of the Roman ''[[Civitas|civitates]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Eagles, &quot;Britons and Saxons on the Eastern Boundary of the Civitas Durotrigum&quot; ''Britannia'' '''35''' (2004:234–240) p 234, noting for instance E.M. Wightman, ''Gallia Belgica'' (London) 1985:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern usage of 'diocese' tends to refer to the sphere of a bishop's jurisdiction. This became commonplace during the self-conscious &quot;classicizing&quot; structural evolution of the [[Carolingian empire]] in the 9th century, but this usage had itself been evolving from the much earlier ''parochia'' (&quot;[[parish]]&quot;), dating from the increasingly formalised Christian authority structure in the 4th century (see ''EB'' 1911).
