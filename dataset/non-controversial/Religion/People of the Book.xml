{{Islam}}
'''People of the Book''' ({{lang-ar|أهل الكتاب }} ′Ahl al-Kitāb) is a term used to designate non-Muslim adherents to faiths which have a revealed scripture&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195390155-0059 For a scholarly guide to the literature available on this topic, see the entry &quot;People of the Book&quot; in Oxford Bibliographies Online: Islamic Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; called, in Arabic, ''Ahl-Al-Kitab'' ({{lang-ar|أهل الكتاب }} &quot;the people of the Book&quot; or &quot;people of the Scripture&quot;). The three types of adherents to faiths that the [[Qur'an]] mentions as ''people of the book'' are the [[Jews]], [[Sabians]] and [[Christians]].

In Islam, the [[Muslim]] scripture, the Qur'an, is taken to represent the completion of these scriptures, and to synthesize them as God's true, final, and eternal message to humanity. Because the People of the Book recognize the [[God]] of Abraham as the one and only god, as do Muslims, and they practice revealed faiths based on divine ordinances, tolerance and [[autonomy]] is accorded to them in societies governed by [[sharia]] (Islamic divine law).

In [[Judaism]] the term &quot;People of the Book&quot; ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: עם הספר, ''Am HaSefer'') was used to refer specifically to the [[Jewish people]] and the [[Torah]], and to the Jewish people and the wider canon of written Jewish law (including the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]]). Adherents of other Abrahamic religions, which arose later than Judaism, were not added.&lt;ref&gt;Hence for example such books as ''People of the Book: Thirty Scholars Reflect on Their Jewish Identity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997) and ''People of the Book: Canon, Meaning, and Authority'' (Harvard University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the appellation is accepted by Jews as a reference to an identity rooted fundamentally in Torah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahudi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=G2YlLrQUgzsC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=baptists+are+people+of+the+book&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=baptists%20are%20people%20of%20the%20book&amp;f=false|title =People of the Book: Christian Identity and Literary Culture|author=David Lyle Jeffrey|quote=Though first intended pejoratively, &quot;People of the Book&quot; in Jewish tradition came to be accepted with pride as a legitimate reference to a culture and religious identity rooted fundamentally in Torah, the original book of the Law. |publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|accessdate = 2007–10–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], the [[Catholic Church]] rejects the similar expression &quot;religion of the book&quot; as a description of the Christian faith, preferring the term &quot;religion of the Word of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church (1997), [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PP.HTM n. 108].&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, other [[Christian denominations|denominations]], such as the [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]&lt;ref name=&quot;adventistworld.org&quot;&gt;http://www.adventistworld.org/issue.php?issue=2010-1002&amp;page=11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pobpublications.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Puritans]] and [[Shakers]], have embraced the term &quot;People of the Book.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baptist Church&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=tuuys4HxSzcC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Baptist+People+of+The+Book+Islam&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title =Three Monotheistic Faiths - Judaism, Christianity, Islam: An Analysis And Brief History|author=Dr. Andrea C.

In fact, the first of these groups are foremost in the Christian tradition who claimed the term in question, proud themselves to be in their own way identified as &quot;a People of the Book.&quot; In the early Christian experience the New Testament was added to the whole Jewish &quot;Tanakh&quot; (an acronym from ''T''orah, the Law, Nebi'im, the prophets, and ''K''ethubim, the other canonical writings). This larger anthology, which after St. Jerome's translation tended more and more to be bound up as a single volume, had for those to whom the Christian missionaries came bearing it all the import of a unified ''locus'' of authority: &quot;''the'' Book.&quot; |publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|accessdate = 2007–10–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term &quot;People of the Book&quot; in the Qur'an refers to followers of monotheistic [[Abrahamic religion]]s that are older than Islam. This includes all [[Christian]]s, all [[Children of Israel]] (including [[Jew]]s, [[Karaite]]s and [[Samaritan]]s), and [[Sabians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hinduism2_127&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Hinduism and Islam in India: Caste, Religion, and Society from Antiquity to Early Modern Times | first = S. V. | last = Desika Char |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-55876-151-9 | page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by scholars and historians{{Who|date=September 2011}} to have been founded between 1000 BCE and 600 BCE, making it older than Christianity and Islam. It shares similar [[eschatological]] views with Christianity and Islam, and recognizes life after death, [[Shaytan|Satan]] (as [[Angra Mainyu]]), Heaven, and Hell. However, it is only regarded as one of the &quot;people of the book&quot; religions in [[Iran]].

This definition is limited to those books that predate the Quran; they are seen as divine guidance from God to man that has been corrupted. This definition is not extended to followers of similar texts claiming divine guidance after the revelation of the Quran, as the Quran is seen as the final revelation and therefore any following are necessarily false.

Islamic scholars differ on whether [[Hinduism|Hindus]] are People of the Book.&lt;ref name=&quot;hinduism&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Sufi Essays | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 1973 | isbn =  0-87395-233-2 | page = 139 | first = Seyyed Hossein | last = Nasr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic conquest of India]] necessitated that the definition be revised, as most India's inhabitants were followers of the [[Indian religions]]. Many of the Muslim clergy of India considered Hindus as people of the book,&lt;ref name=&quot;hinduism&quot;/&gt; and from Muhhammad-bin-Kasim to Aurangzib, Muslim rulers were willing to consider Hindus as people of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;hinduism2_127&quot;/&gt; Many Muslims did not treat Hindus as pagans or idol-worshippers,&lt;ref name=&quot;hinduism&quot;/&gt; although Hinduism does not include Adam, Eve, nor the various prophets of Abrahamic religions. However, the present Muslim and South Asian worlds traditionally were quite close in culture and trade despite differences in religions since time immemorial, as evidenced by the development of the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]]. It is worth mentioning that early Muslims who visited India believed they saw the worship of one true God behind the mask of several deities.

[[Buddhism]] does not explicitly recognize a monotheistic God or the concept of prophethood. Muslims however had at one point accorded them the status of &quot;people of the Book&quot;, and [[Al-Biruni]] wrote of Buddha as the prophet &quot;burxan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;www.berzinarchives.com/...books/.../history_cultures_18.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is interesting to note the similarity between the Arabic word [[Sura]] and the South Asian word [[Sutra]]. However, there is no formal [[God in Buddhism]], although Buddhism does not specifically oppose monotheism. But, it is explicitly stated in Buddhist sutras that the worship of an [[Ishvara]] (an ancient South Asian term for a creator god, most likely not referring to the Abrahamic God who may not have been known in South Asia during the Buddha's lifetime, but given the context meaning either Shiva, Kali or Brahma &lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle, Life of the Buddha. Clay Sanskrit Library, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;) is unnecessary to the attainment of [[Nirvana]], as the Buddha believed worshipers are still trapped in an endless cycle of rebirth ([[Samsara]]). Buddhists do not worship Brahma (a Hindu deity) or &quot;Deva&quot; (an ancient South Asian term for a deity, today meaning either a Hindi translation of the English &quot;God&quot;/ Latin &quot;Deus&quot; concept [although Christian Indians tend to use the term &quot;Parameshvara&quot; or &quot;Supreme Creator God&quot; for the Christian God the Father] or a synonym for the ancient South Asian concept of [[Brahman]]). In Buddhism, the historical Buddha, the celestial and predecessor Buddhas, and the Buddhas to Be's ([[Bodhisattvas]]) fulfill the devotional needs of believers, while an emphasis is placed on the lack of Creation and Judgement abilities of these Salvation/Teaching deities.

==In the Qur'an==
There are many statements in the [[Qur'an]] that promote tolerance towards People of The Book. The most widely cited example of this is the final segment of surah Al-Kafiroon, which states:

* ''&quot;To you your religion, and to me mine&quot;'' (109)

In other places the Qur'an says:

* ''And do not dispute with the followers of the Book except by what is best, except those of them who act unjustly, and say: We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him do we submit.'' {{Quran-usc|29|46}}

* ''Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the Verses of God during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin Al-Ma'rûf and forbid Al-Munkar ; and they hasten in (all) good works; and they are among the righteous. And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for God knows well those who are Al-Muttaqûn .(3:113-115)''

* ''And there are, certainly, among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), those who believe in God and in that which has been revealed to you, and in that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before God. They do not sell the Verses of God for a little price, for them is a reward with their Lord. Surely, God is Swift in account. '(3:199)'

* ''Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve .'' {{Quran-usc|2|62}}

* ''Say (O Muhammad ): &quot;O people of the Scripture : Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but God, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides God.'' {{Quran-usc|3|64}}

Throughout Islamic history, Muslims have used these [[ayah]] (verses) to justify a variety of positions towards non-Muslims. In some places and times, Muslims showed a great deal of tolerance towards non-Muslims; in other places and times non-Muslims were treated as enemies and persecuted.

One verse in the Qur'an encourages [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutral]] position toward all non-Muslims. This verse says, ''&quot;Those who follow the Jewish (scriptures) and the Sabians, Christians, Magians and Polytheists — God will judge them On the Day of Judgement:&quot;'' (22:17).

==Dhimmi==

{{Main|Dhimmi}}

Historically, a ''[[dhimmi]]'' was a person who is protected under Islamic law by a pact contracted between non-Muslims and authorities from their Muslim government: this status was first made available to non-Muslims who were People of the Book (e.g. [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s), but was later extended to include [[Sikh]]s, [[Zoroastrian]]s, [[Mandean]]s, [[Hindu]]s&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Chach Nama]] English translation by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg. Delhi Reprint, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Schimmel]] (2004), p.107, &quot;The conqueror Muhammad Ibn Al Qasem gave both Hindus and Buddhists the same status as the Christians, Jews and Sabaeans in the Middle east&quot;. They were all &quot;dhimmi&quot; ('protected people')&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; People of the Book living in non-Islamic nations were not considered dhimmis.

Non-Muslim People of the Book living in an Islamic nation under [[Sharia]] law were given a number of rights, such as the right to freely practice their faith in private and to receive state protection. In turn, they had a legal responsibility, the payment of a special tax called [[jizya]] (&quot;[[tribute]]&quot;) in place of [[zakat]]. The [[social structure of the Ottoman Empire]] would serve as an example of how non-Muslims were treated.

Because of the Hindu traditions of Vedanta and Upanishads, and the prominent Hindu theological perspective that there is a single Reality (''[[Brahman]]'') from which the world arises, Hindus eventually have been included as dhimmis.&lt;ref&gt;Thapar, R. 1993. ''Interpreting Early India.'' Delhi: Oxford University Press. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yazidi]], [[Druze]] and [[Azali]] faiths are small post-Islamic monotheistic faiths whose adherents mainly reside in Muslim-majority countries. Because they number very few and have seldom disturbed, countered or threatened Muslim authority, they are usually regarded as dhimmis.

The definition of &quot;dhimmi&quot; always excludes followers of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} This is because the Bahá'í Faith, which grew out of [[Shi'a Islam]], is a post-Islamic religion which does not accept the finality of Muhammad's revelation. Instead, Bahá'ís believe in the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]], which states that God's will is progressively revealed through different teachers at different times, and that there will never be a final revelation.

The [[Ahmadis]] (usually referred to by Muslims as ''Qadianis'') of Pakistan are also not regarded as dhimmis by the vast majority of Muslims. This is largely due to the fact that their prophet, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], came over 1,300 years after Muhammad, who is viewed as the &quot;last of the prophets&quot; by Sunni, Shia, and Ibadi variants of Islam. They differ from other post-Islamic faiths in Muslim lands because Ahmadis first began as an Islamic reform movement, threatening the established orthodoxy present in South Asian Islam, and further was embraced by highly socially upward mobile westernizing Muslim intellectuals of the day. These factors, compounded with the presence of the colonial British authorities in India who had overthrown the Muslim [[Mughal Empire]], led Muslims to view the presence of Ahmadis as a fifth column serving the British colonizers, and as a threat to &quot;true&quot; Islam. Pakistan to this day requires its citizens to swear an oath of allegiance to Islam, and declare Mirza Gulam Ahmad to be an apostate, should they elect to register as a Muslim for governmental services.

==Judæo-Christian view==
In the [[early Christian]] experience the [[New Testament]] was added to the whole Jewish [[Tanakh]], which after [[Jerome]]'s translation tended more and more to be bound up as a [[Bible|single volume]], and was accepted as a unified ''locus'' of authority: &quot;''the'' Book.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Denominations&quot;/&gt; Many [[Christian missionaries]] in Africa, Asia and in the [[New World]], developed writing systems for indigenous people and then provided them with a written [[Bible translations|translation of the Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry-Chase-Jacob-Jacob&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Missionaries were the first to meet and learn about many people and were the first to develop writing for those without a written language. Christian missionaries were ardently opposed to slavery.

The fact that these missionaries put enormous effort into reducing the language of these people to writing so as to provide a written translation of the Bible - an activity which, under such organizations as the Wycliffe Bible Translators  and the United Bible Societies, has resulted in at least part of the Christian Bible now being available in 2,100 languages - has lent an identification with the phrase among evangelical Christians in particular as strong as pertains among Jews.

As stated on its official world website, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA)]] also embraces the term People of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventist.org/bible-study/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; As also noted in its official flagship publication ''Adventist World'' (February 2010 edition), it is claimed prominent Islamic leaders have endorsed Seventh-day Adventists as the Qur'an's true People of the Book&lt;ref name=&quot;adventistworld.org&quot;/&gt;
