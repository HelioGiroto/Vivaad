==John 8:6==
I added John 18:6 as an example of falling down before God in a &quot;power encounter&quot;. If the context of that verse is in the wrong section, then feel free to move it elsewhere, but it's definitely an example of falling down before God.[[User:Jlujan69|Jlujan69]] 07:20, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

I removed the following text:

&quot;Some see similarities in the manifestation of this phenomenon to a form of [[seizure disorder]], though there may be a similar, if not superior, psychological benefit as is found in [[ECT]] seizure therapy.&quot;

This sounds highly suspect to me, and if true, needs references to back it up. If anything, being &quot;slain by the spirit&quot; sounds like [[cataplexy]], which is often triggered by strong emotions, and despite what the article implies, does not only occur in those with narcolepsy. Might also be [[vasovagal syncope]], which is related to the stress response. I know of nothing that would link this kind of phenomenon to seizure activity, particularly in those who do not otherwise manifest symptoms. As for the ECT claim, utter nonsense. Cite a study, or don't bother making rediculous claims.

This article as a whole strikes me as way too friendly to the idea of &quot;slain in the spirit.&quot;  It makes many half-hearted attempts to be neutral, but then again the entire text reads as though the phenomenon is precisely what it purports to be.  There's no critical analysis, little to no opinion beyond that of Christians, nor are there any sources cited outside the Bible.  Not a good encyclopedia entry!  I would like to see this piece evolve into something more like the [[Glossolalia]] article -- which handles the issue without condoning or condemning it.

this article sounds like it was describing an scientific fact. i find that strange [[User:217.91.55.124|217.91.55.124]] 18:15, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

==Weird church==
Ive been to these types of churches, and they are terrible. They hardly even read the bible. They just treat church like a rock concert and then go home! [[User:Portillo|Portillo]] ([[User talk:Portillo|talk]]) 05:33, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

== Next stage for this article ==

I've tried to clean up this article, but am aware that it still has major shortcomings. Is there anyone who might work on the history section, to include data from Wesley, Whitfield, Edwards, Finney, Woodward-Etter etc? Also there needs to be more on psychology and sociology. Is there a good foot-notable description anywhere? [[User:Hyper3|Hyper3]] ([[User talk:Hyper3|talk]]) 01:04, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

-----new to me----
i was just told by our pastor that in scripture the fruits of the spirit is self control and if you dont have control over your body how are you in parallel with scripture.i would like opinins i have been slain in the spirit and am questioning my experience and thinking there is more to this. he has a sermon on it on thewellcommunity.org from last sunday on there podcast. people need to check it out i do thid no justice.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.37.48.79|75.37.48.79]] ([[User talk:75.37.48.79|talk]]) 21:06, 10 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
