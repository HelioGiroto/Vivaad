'''Panentheism''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πᾶν}} (pân) &quot;all&quot;; {{lang|grc|ἐν}} (en) &quot;in&quot;; and {{lang|grc|θεός}} (theós) &quot;God&quot;; &quot;all-in-God&quot;) is a belief system which [[postulate|posits]] that the divine (be it a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[God]], [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[gods]], or an eternal cosmic animating force), interpenetrates every part of nature and timelessly extends beyond it. Panentheism differentiates itself from [[pantheism]], which holds that the divine is synonymous with the universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In panentheism, the [[universe]] in the first formulation is practically the whole itself. In the second formulation, the universe and the divine are not [[ontology|ontologically]] equivalent. In panentheism, God is viewed as the eternal animating force behind the universe. Some versions suggest that the universe is nothing more than the manifest part of God. In some forms of panentheism, the [[cosmos]] exists within God, who in turn &quot;pervades&quot; or is &quot;in&quot; the cosmos. While pantheism asserts that 'All is God', panentheism goes further to claim that God is greater than the universe. In addition, some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999&quot;/&gt; Much [[Hindu thought]] is highly characterized by panentheism and [[pantheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441533/pantheism/38168/Pantheism-and-panentheism-in-non-Western-cultures] Britannica - Pantheism and Panentheism in non-Western cultures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Robert.

== Ancient panentheism ==
===In the Americas (Pre-European)===
Many North American Native Peoples (such as the Cree, Iroquois, Huron, Navajo, and others{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) were and still are largely panentheistic, conceiving of God as both confined in God's existence in Creation but also [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] from it. (North American Native writers have also translated the word for God as the Great Mystery&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Means]], ''Where White Men Fear To Tread'' (Macmillan, 1993), pp. 3-4, 15, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; or as the Sacred Other&lt;ref&gt;George Tinker (Osage), [[Spirit and Resistance: Political Theology and American Indian Liberation]], p. 89.  He defines the Sacred Other as &quot;the Deep Mystery which creates and sustains all Creation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;) This concept is referred to by many as the [[Great Spirit]].  One exception can be modern [[Cherokee]] who are predominantly [[monotheism|monotheistic]] but apparently not panentheistic (as the two are not mutually exclusive);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Cherokee Peoples of the World: The Cherokee], website found 2008-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; yet in older Cherokee traditions many observe both aspects of pantheism and panentheism, and are often not beholden to exclusivity, encompassing other spiritual traditions without contradiction, a common trait among some tribes in the Americas. Most South American Native peoples were largely panentheistic as well (as were ancient South East Asian and African cultures).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Central American empires of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]s, [[Aztec]]s as well as the South American [[Inca]]ns (Tahuatinsuyu) were actually [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and had very strong male deities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

According to Charles C. Mann's, &quot;1491&quot;, only the lower classes of Aztec society were polytheistic. Writings from Aztec priests reveal them to be strong panentheists who considered the common mythology to be a symbolic oversimplification meant to be easier for the commoners to understand.

===In Europe===
[[Neoplatonism]] is polytheistic and panentheistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent &quot;God&quot; (The One) of which subsequent realities were emanations. From the One emanates the Divine Mind ([[Nous]]) and the Cosmic Soul (Psyche). In [[Neoplatonism]] the world itself is God [Timaeus 37].  This concept of divinity is associated with that of the ''[[Logos]]'', which had originated centuries earlier with [[Heraclitus]] (ca. 535–475 BC). The ''Logos'' pervades the [[cosmos]], whereby all thoughts and all things originate, or as Heraclitus said: &quot;He who hears not me but the Logos will say: All is one.&quot; Neoplatonists such as [[Iamblichus]] attempted to reconcile this perspective by adding another [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] above the original monad of force or [[Dunamis]]. This new all-pervasive monad encompassed all creation and its original uncreated emanations.

[[Baruch Spinoza]] later claimed that &quot;Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ethics, Pt. I, prop. 15&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ethics Pt. I, prop. 25S&lt;/ref&gt; Though Spinoza has been called the &quot;prophet&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Picton, J. Allanson, &quot;Pantheism: Its Story and Significance&quot;, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;prince&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Alexander Campbell &quot;Philosophy of Theism&quot;, William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p 163&lt;/ref&gt; of [[pantheism]], in a letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]] Spinoza states that: &quot;as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (March 26, 2009), ISBN 978-1-60459-156-9, letter 73&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a mode under two attributes of Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], when Spinoza wrote &quot;Deus sive Natura&quot; (God or Nature) Spinoza did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (October 23, 1974), ISBN 978-0-15-684730-8, Pages: 14 and 95&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Martial Guéroult]] suggested the term &quot;Panentheism&quot;, rather than &quot;Pantheism&quot; to describe Spinoza’s view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, &quot;in&quot; God. Yet, American philosopher and self-described Panentheist [[Charles Hartshorne]] referred to Spinoza's philosophy as &quot;[[Classical Pantheism]]&quot; and distinguished Spinoza's philosophy with panentheism.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, &quot;Philosophers Speak of God,&quot; Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of a formal philosophy==
The German philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] (1781–1832) seeking to reconcile [[monotheism]] and [[pantheism]], coined the term ''panentheism'' (&quot;all in God&quot;) in 1828. This conception of God influenced New England [[transcendentalists]] such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The term was popularized by [[Charles Hartshorne]] in his development of [[process theology]] and has also been adopted by proponents of various [[New Thought Movement|New Thought]] beliefs. The formalization of this term in the West in the 18th century was of course not new; philosophical treatises had been written on it in the context of [[Hinduism]] for millennia.

Other philosophers who embraced panentheism have included [[Thomas Hill Green]] (1839–1882), [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] (1843–1925), [[Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison]] (1856–1931) and [[Samuel Alexander]] (1859–1938).&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cooper ''Panentheism, the other God of the philosophers: from Plato to the present'' Baker Academic, 2006, ISBN 0-8010-2724-1&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1940s, Hartshorne examined numerous conceptions of God. He reviewed and discarded pantheism, [[deism]], and [[pandeism]] in favor of panentheism, finding that such a &quot;doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations.&quot; Hartshorne formulated God as a being who could become &quot;more perfect&quot;: He has absolute perfection in categories for which absolute perfection is possible, and relative perfection (i.e., is superior to all others) in categories for which perfection cannot be precisely determined.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, ''Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism'' (1964) ISBN 0-208-00498-X p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Some believe that Albert Einstein, amongst several other scientists, held a panentheistic view of God, and named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his world view (''Weltanschauung''). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: &quot;I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Einstein believes in &quot;Spinoza's God&quot;; Scientist Defines His Faith in Reply, to Cablegram From Rabbi Here. Sees a Divine Order But Says Its Ruler Is Not Concerned &quot;Wit Fates and Actions of Human Beings.&quot;&quot;. The New York Times. April 25, 1929. Retrieved 2009-09-08. &quot;Einstein's Third Paradise, by Gerald Holton&quot;. Aip.org. Retrieved 2011-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein had previously explored this belief that man could not understand the nature of God in an interview published in 1930 in [[George Sylvester Viereck|G. S. Viereck]]'s book ''Glimpses of the Great'' explaining:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not an Atheist.  I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist.  The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds.  May I not reply with a parable?  The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe.  We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues.  The child knows that someone must have written those books.  It does not know who or how.  It does not understand the languages in which they are written.  The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects.  That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God.  We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly.  Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations.  I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism.  I admire even more his contributions to modern thought.  Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester.  &quot;Glimpses of the Great&quot;.  Duckworth, 1930.  p. 372-373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In religion==
=== Bahá'í Faith ===
{{further|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], God is described as a single, imperishable God, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. The connection between God and the world is that of the creator to his [[Genesis creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithGod&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= God |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God is understood to be independent of his creation, and that creation is dependent and contingent on God.  God, however, is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures. Instead, in the [[Bahá'í teachings|Bahá'í understanding]], the world of creation [[wiktionary:emanate|emanates]] from God, in that all things have been realized by him and have attained to existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;saq&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-190-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-53.html.iso8859-1#gr5 | pages = 202–203 |origyear = 1904-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation is seen as the expression of God's will in the contingent world,&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithCreation&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= creation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and every created thing is seen as a sign of God's sovereignty, and leading to knowledge of him; the signs of God are most particularly revealed in [[human beings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithGod&quot;/&gt;

===Christianity===
Panentheism is a feature of some Christian thought, particularly in mystical [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[process theology]]. In order to avoid confusion with pantheism some panentheists now use the [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]] &quot;unitheism.&quot;

Process theological thinkers are generally regarded in the West as unorthodox, but process philosophical thought paved the way for [[open theism]], which sits more comfortably in the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] camp.

====Eastern Christianity====
{{See also|Omnipresence}}
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] Churches, as well as in the [[Church of the East]], creation is not considered to be a literal &quot;part of&quot; God, and the Godhead is distinct from creation. There is, in other words, an eternal difference between the uncreated (i.e., God) and the created (i.e., everything else). This does not mean, however, that the creation is wholly separated from God, because the creation exists by and in the Divine Energies (workings). These energies are the operations of God and are God, but the created is not God in the Divine Essence. God creates the universe by the Divine will, using His Energies, that are not identified with His Essence. It is not an &quot;emanation&quot; of God's own essence (Ousia), a direct literal outworking or effulgence of the Divine, or any other process which implies that creation is part of or necessary to God in His Essence. The use of panentheism as part of Orthodox theology and doctrine is &quot;problematic&quot; to those who would insist that panentheism requires creation to be &quot;part of&quot; God.

God is not merely creator of the universe; His active Presence is necessary in some way for every bit of creation, from smallest to greatest, to continue to exist ''at all''.&lt;ref&gt;
St. Symeon in Practical &amp; Theological Discourses, 1.1:
When men search for God with their bodily eyes they find Him nowhere, for He is invisible. But for those who ponder in the Spirit He is present everywhere. He is in all, yet beyond all.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, God's [[Energies of God|Energies]] (activities) maintain all things and all beings, even if those beings have explicitly rejected him. His love of creation is such that He will not withdraw His Presence, which would be the ultimate form of annihilation, not merely imposing death, but ending existence altogether. By this token, the entirety of creation is good in its being and is not innately evil either in whole or in part. This does not deny the existence of evil in a [[The Fall of Man|fallen]] universe, only that it is not an ''innate'' property of creation. Evil results from the will of creatures, not from their nature ''per se'' (see [[the problem of evil]]).

====Other Christian panentheists====

Panentheistic conceptions of God occur amongst some modern theologians. [[Process theology]] and [[Creation Spirituality]], two recent developments in [[Christian theology]], contain panentheistic ideas.

Some argue that panentheism should also include the notion that God has always been related to some world or another, which denies the idea of creation out of nothing (''creatio ex nihilo''). [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]] [[Methodism|Methodist]] theologian [[Thomas Jay Oord]] advocates panentheism, but he uses the word &quot;theocosmocentrism&quot; to highlight the notion that God and some world or another are the primary conceptual starting blocks for eminently fruitful theology. This form of panentheism helps in overcoming the problem of evil and in proposing that God's love for the world is essential to who God is.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

Panentheism was a major force in the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]] church for a long time, based on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s concept of the [[Over-soul|Oversoul]]. This survives today as the panentheistic religion, Oversoul.
[http://www.hi-des-website.com/oversoul/nav5plus.htm] Charles Hartshorne, who conjoined process theology with panentheism, maintained a lifelong membership in the Methodist church but was also a [[unitarianism|unitarian]]. In later years he joined the [[Austin, Texas]], [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] congregation and was an active participant in that church. &lt;ref&gt;http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charleshartshorne.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Christians who believe in [[universalism]] hold panentheistic views of God in conjunction with their belief in ''[[apocatastasis]]'', also called [[universal reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see http://www.savioroftheworld.net/conclusion.htm and http://www.newbeginningministries.com/articles/Oneness_True_Spiritual_Life.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Panentheistic [[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]] often believe that all creation's subsistence in God renders untenable the notion of final and permanent alienation from Him; they point to Biblical scripture passages such as Ephesians 4:6 (&quot;[God] is over all and through all and in all&quot;) and Romans 11:36 (&quot;from [God] and through him and to him are all things&quot;) to justify both panentheism and universalism.

====New Thought movement====
{{See also|History of New Thought}}
{{NewThought}}

[[Religious Science]], [[Divine Science]], and the [[Unity Church]] are religious denominations which represent a panentheistic worldview within the Christian [[New Thought]] movement.

=== Hinduism ===
Earliest reference to panentheistic thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] is in a creation myth contained in the later section of [[Rig Veda]] called the [[Purusha Sukta]], which was compiled before 1100 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Oberlies (1998:155) gives an estimate of 1100 BC for the youngest hymns in book 10. Estimates for a ''terminus post quem'' of the earliest hymns are more uncertain. Oberlies (p. 158) based on 'cumulative evidence' sets wide range of 1700–1100&lt;/ref&gt; The Purusha Sukta gives a description of the spiritual unity of the cosmos. It presents the nature of Purusha or the cosmic being as both immanent in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it.&lt;ref&gt;The Purusha Sukta in [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/invoc/in_pura.html Daily Invocations] by Swami Krishnananda&lt;/ref&gt; From this being the sukta holds, the original creative [[Will (philosophy)|will]] proceeds, by which this vast universe is projected in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnananda, Swami.

T&amp;T Clark Int'l, New York. P. 246. ISBN 0567030164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Panentheism is also expressed in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Southgate&quot;/&gt; In verse IX.4, [[Krishna]] states: {{Quote|By Me all this universe is pervaded through My unmanifested form.&lt;br/&gt; All beings abide in Me but I do not abide in them.}}

Many schools of Hindu thought espouse [[monistic theism]], which is thought to be similar to a panentheistic viewpoint. [[Nimbarka]]'s school of differential monism ([[Dvaitadvaita]]), [[Ramanuja]]'s school of qualified monism ([[Vishistadvaita]]) and [[Saiva Siddhanta]] are all considered to be panentheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Sherma, Rita DasGupta; Sharma Arvind. Hermeneutics and Hindu Thought: Toward a Fusion of Horizons. Springer, 2008 edition (December 1, 2010). P. 192. ISBN 9048178002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caitanya]]'s [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], which elucidates the doctrine of [[Acintya Bheda Abheda]] (inconceivable oneness and difference), is also thought to be panentheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Caitanya Caritamrita, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kashmir Shaivism]], all things are believed to be a manifestation of Universal Consciousness (Cit or Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Vibration: An Analysis of Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism, By Mark S.

The two [...] in themselves are One.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Subramanian, V. K., ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Sv3HkK2M15wC Saundaryalahari of Sankaracarya: Sanskrit Text in Devanagari with Roman Transliteration, English Translation, Explanatory Notes, Yantric Diagrams and Index]''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (Delhi, 1977; 6th ed. 1998). P. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is She who becomes the time and space, the cosmos, it is She who becomes the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]], and thus all animate life and inanimate forms. She is the primordial energy that holds all creation and destruction, all cycles of birth and death, all laws of cause and effect within Herself, and yet is greater than the sum total of all these.

===Sikhism===

The Sikh gurus have described God in numerous ways in their hymns included in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, but the oneness of the deity is consistently emphasized throughout. God is described in the Mool Mantar, the first passage in the Guru Granth Sahib, and the basic formula of the faith is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(GG. Pg 1)
— ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Ik onkar satinam karta purakhu nirbhau nirvair akal murat ajuni saibhan gurprasad''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
One Universal Creator God, The Name Is Truth, Creative Being Personified, No Fear, No Hatred, Image Of The Timeless One, Beyond Birth, Self Existent, By Guru's Grace.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Guru Arjan, Nanak V, says, &quot;God is beyond colour and form, yet His/Her presence is clearly visible&quot; (GG, 74), and &quot;Nanak's Lord transcends the world as well as the scriptures of the east and the west, and yet He/She is clearly manifest&quot; (GG, 397).

Knowledge of the ultimate Reality is not a matter for reason; it comes by revelation of the ultimate reality through nadar (grace) and by anubhava (mystical experience). Says Guru Nanak; &quot;''budhi pathi na paiai bahu chaturaiai bhai milai mani bhane.''&quot; This translates to &quot;He/She is not accessible through intellect, or through mere scholarship or cleverness at argument; He/She is met, when He/She pleases, through devotion&quot; (GG, 436).

Guru Nanak prefixed the numeral one (ik) to it, making it Ik Oankar or Ekankar to stress God's oneness. God is named and known only through his Own immanent nature. The only name which can be said to truly fit God's transcendent state is Sat (Sanskrit Satnam, Truth), the changeless and timeless Reality. God is transcendent and all-pervasive at the same time. Transcendence and immanence are two aspects of the same single Supreme Reality. The Reality is immanent in the entire creation, but the creation as a whole fails to contain God fully. As says Guru Tegh Bahadur, Nanak IX, &quot;He has himself spread out His/Her Own “maya” (worldly illusion) which He oversees; many different forms He assumes in many colours, yet He stays independent of all&quot; (GG, 537).

=== Islam ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
{{further2|[[Tawheed]]}}
Several [[Sufi]] saints and thinkers, primarily [[Ibn Arabi]], held beliefs that were somewhat panentheistic. These notions later took shape in the theory of [[wahdat ul-wujud]] (the Unity of All Things). [[Twelver Shi'ism]] has a panentheistic trend, represented by scholars such as [[Sayyid Haydar Amuli]], [[Mulla Sadra]] (all of whom were influenced by Ibn Arabi). Some Sufi Orders, notably the [[Bektashis]] and the [[Universal Sufism|Universal Sufi]] movement, continue to espouse panentheistic beliefs. [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]] follow [[Panentheism (Ismailism)|panentheism according to Ismaili doctrine]].

===Judaism===
While mainstream [[Rabbinic Judaism]] is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] theologian [[Maimonides]], the panentheistic conception of God can be found among certain mystical Jewish traditions. A leading scholar of [[Kabbalah]], Moshe Idel&lt;ref&gt;''Hasidism: Between Ecstacy and Magic'', SUNY, 1995, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; ascribes this doctrine to the kabbalistic system of Rabbi Moses Cordovero (1522–1570) and in the eighteenth century to the [[Baal Shem Tov]], founder of the [[Hasidism|Hasidic movement]], as well as his contemporary, Rabbi Menahem Mendel, the Maggid of Bar. There is some debate as to whether Lurianic Kabbalah, with its doctrine of [[Tzimtzum]], can be regarded as panentheistic. According to Hasidism, The infinite [[Ein Sof]] is incorporeal, and exists in a state that is both transcendent and immanent. Aspects of panentheism are also evident in the theology of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] as presented in the writings of [[Mordecai Kaplan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Gnosticism===
Some branches of [[Gnosticism]] teach a panentheistic view of reality,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and hold to the belief that God exists in the visible world only as sparks of spiritual &quot;light&quot;. The goal of human existence is to know the sparks within oneself in order to return to God, who is in the Fullness (or [[Pleroma]]).

Gnosticism is panentheistic,{{cn|date=October 2012}} believing that the true God is simultaneously both separate from the physical universe and present within it. As Jesus states in the [[Gospel of Thomas]], &quot;I am the light that is over all things. I am all... Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'', saying 77&lt;/ref&gt; This seemingly contradictory interpretation of Gnostic theology is not without controversy, since one interpretation of [[Dualism (theology)|dualistic theology]] holds that a perfect God of pure spirit would not manifest himself through the fallen world of matter. As [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], the founder of [[Manichaeism]], stated, &quot;The true God has nothing to do with the material world or cosmos&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Now God has no part in this cosmos nor does he rejoice over it&quot;,Classical Texts:Acta Archelai [www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_II_Texts.pdf] Page 76&lt;/ref&gt; and, &quot;It is the Prince of Darkness who spoke with Moses, the Jews and their priests. Thus the Christians, the Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they worship this God. For he leads them astray in the lusts he taught them.&lt;ref&gt;Classical Texts:Acta Archelai
Now, he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests he says is the archont of Darkness, and the Christians, Jews, and pagans (ethnic) are one and the same, as they revere the same god. For in his aspirations he seduces them, as he is not the god of truth. And so therefore all those who put their hope in the god who spoke with Moses and the prophets have (this in store for themselves, namely) to be bound with him, because they did not put their hope in the god of truth. For that one spoke with them (only) according to their own aspirations. [www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_II_Texts.pdf] Page 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Likewise, Manichaeism, being another Gnostic sect, preached a similar doctrine of positioning God against matter. This dualistic teaching embodied an elaborate cosmological myth that included the defeat of a primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light. Thus, to Mani, the devil god which created the world was the Jewish Jehovah. Mani said, &quot;It is the Prince of Darkness who spoke with Moses, the Jews and their priests. Thus the Christians, the Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they worship this God. For he leads them astray in the lusts he taught them.&quot;[http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/d/dualism.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentinian Gnosticism teaches that matter came about through [[Emanationism|emanations]] of the supreme being, and to some this event is held to be more accidental than intentional.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} To other Gnostics, these emanations are akin to the Sephirot of the Kabbalists; they are deliberate manifestations of a transcendent God through a complex system of intermediaries.

===Buddhism===

The Reverend Zen Master Soyen Shaku was the first Zen Buddhist Abbot to tour the United States in 1905-6. He wrote a series of essays collected into the book ''Zen For Americans''.  In the essay titled &quot;The God Conception of Buddhism&quot; he attempts to explain how a Buddhist looks at the ultimate without an anthropomorphic God figure while still being able to relate to the term God in a Buddhist sense:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the outset, let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term is ordinarily understood. It has certainly a God, the highest reality and truth, through which and in which this universe exists. However, the followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God, for it savors so much of Christianity, whose spirit is not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of religious experience. Again, Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense that it identifies the universe with God. On the other hand, the Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent; this world, being merely its manifestation, is necessarily fragmental and imperfect. To define more exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being, it may be convenient to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar, &quot;panentheism,&quot; according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν (all and one) and more than the totality of existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Zen For Americans'' by Soyen Shaku, translated by Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, 1906, pages 25-26. http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zfa/zfa04.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The essay then goes on to explain first utilizing the term &quot;God&quot; for the American audience to get and initial understanding of what he means by &quot;panenthesism,&quot; and then discusses the terms that Buddhism uses in place of &quot;God&quot; such as [[Dharmakaya]], [[Buddha]], and [[Tathagata]].
