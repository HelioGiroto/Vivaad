      <comment>r2.7.1) (Robot: Adding [[sv:Sede vacante]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10050">'''''Sede vacante''''' is an expression, used in the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], that refers to the vacancy of the [[episcopal see]] of a [[particular church]]. It is [[Latin]] for &quot;the seat being vacant&quot; (the [[Latin_grammar#Ablative_absolute|ablative absolute]] to ''sedes vacans'' &quot;vacant seat&quot;), the seat in question being the ''[[cathedra]]'' of the particular church.

==Vacancy of the Holy See==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Seal (device)]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ombrellino-keys.svg|right|frame|The arms of the [[Holy See]] ''sede vacante''.]]

After the [[death]] or [[papal resignation|resignation]] of a [[pope]] the [[Holy See]] becomes '''''sede vacante'''''. In this case the particular church is the [[Diocese of Rome]] and the &quot;vacant seat&quot; is the ''cathedra'' of [[Saint John Lateran]], the cathedral church of the bishop of Rome. During this period, the Holy See is administered by a [[Regent|regency]] of the [[College of Cardinals]].

According to ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'', the government of the [[Holy See]] ''sede vacante'' (and therefore of the Catholic Church) falls to the [[College of Cardinals]], but in a very limited capacity. At the same time, all of the heads of the [[Roman Curia]] resign their offices. The exceptions are the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Cardinal Camerlengo]], who is charged with managing the property of the Holy See, and the [[Apostolic Penitentiary|Major Penitentiary]], who continues to exercise his normal role. If either has to do something which normally requires the assent of the Pope, he has to submit it to the College of Cardinals. [[Papal legate]]s continue to exercise their diplomatic roles overseas, and the [[Vicar General of Rome]] continues to exercise his pastoral role over the diocese of Rome during this period. The postal administration of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] prepares and issues special postage stamps for use during this particular period, known as &quot;''sede vacante'' stamps&quot;.

The [[coat of arms]] of the Holy See also changes during this period. Instead of the [[papal tiara]] over the keys, the tiara is replaced with the ''[[umbraculum]]'' or ''ombrellino'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]. This symbolizes both the lack of a Pope and also the governance of the Camerlengo over the temporalities of the Holy See. As further indication, the Camerlengo ornaments his [[coat of arms|arms]] with this symbol during this period, which he subsequently removes once a pope is elected. The arms of the Camerlengo appear on commemorative [[euro]] coins minted during this period, which are legal tender in all [[Eurozone]] member states.

The interregnum is usually highlighted by the [[funeral]] [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the deceased pope, the general congregations of the college of cardinals for determining the particulars of the election, and finally culminated in the [[papal election|conclave]] to elect a successor. Once a new [[pope]] has been elected (and [[Holy Orders|ordained]] bishop if necessary) the ''sedes'' is no longer vacant, so this period then officially ends. Afterward occurs the [[Papal Installation]] or [[Papal Coronation]], depending on the form of [[inauguration]] and [[investiture]] a new pope chooses, and the formal possession of the ''cathedra'' of the [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano]].

[[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s present in [[Rome]] are required to wait at least fifteen days after the start of the vacancy for the rest of the college before they can hold the conclave to elect the new Pope. However, after twenty days have elapsed, they must hold the conclave even if cardinals are missing. Historically, ''sede vacante'' periods have often been quite lengthy, lasting many months due to lengthy deadlocked conclaves. For many years through 1922 the period from the death of the Pope to the start of the conclave was shorter, but after [[William Henry O'Connell|William Henry Cardinal O'Connell]] had arrived just too late for two conclaves in a row, [[Pope Pius XI]] extended the time limit. With the very next conclave in 1939, cardinals began to travel by air.

The most recent period of ''sede vacante'' of the Holy See began at 19:37 [[UTC]], April 2, 2005, due to the death of [[Pope John Paul II]], and concluded with the [[papal conclave, 2005|election]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] at 16:05 UTC, April 19, 2005.

==For dioceses other than the Diocese of Rome==
This means that for a [[diocese]] the diocesan [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] has either died, resigned, transferred to a different diocese, or lost his office and a replacement has not yet been named.  If there is a [[coadjutor bishop]] for the diocese, then this period does not take place, as the coadjutor bishop (or coadjutor archbishop, in the case of an archdiocese) immediately succeeds to the episcopal see.

Within eight days after the [[episcopal see|see]] is known to be vacant, the college of [[consultors]] (or the [[cathedral chapter]] in some countries)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Codex Iuris Canonici Canon 502 § 3 (noting that an episcopal conference can transfer the functions of the consultors to the cathedral chapter).&lt;/ref&gt; is obliged to elect a [[diocesan administrator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 421 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; The administrator they choose must be a priest or bishop who is at least 35 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 425 §1]. The word used (''sacerdos'') applies also to a bishop, not just a priest.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the college of consultors fails to elect a qualifying person within the time allotted, the choice of diocesan administrator passes to the [[metropolitan archbishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan archbishop]] or, if the metropolitan see is vacant, to the senior-most by appointment of the [[suffragan bishop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canons 421 §2 and 425 §3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the election of the diocesan administrator of a vacant see, the governance of the see is entrusted, with the powers of a [[vicar general]], to the [[auxiliary bishop]], if there is one, or to the senior among them, if there are several, otherwise to the college of consultors as a whole. The diocesan administrator has greater powers, essentially those of a bishop except for matters excepted by the nature of the matter or expressly by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1G.HTM Code of Canon Law, canons 426-427]&lt;/ref&gt; Canon law subjects his activity to various legal restrictions and to special supervision by the college of consultors (as for example canons 272 and 485).

[[vicar general|Vicars general]] and episcopal vicars lose their powers ''sede vacante'' if they are not bishops;&lt;ref&gt;Codex Iuris Canonici Canon 481 § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; the vicars that are themselves bishops retain the powers they had before the see fell vacant, which they are to exercise under the authority of the administrator.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Iuris Canonici Canon 409 § 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Uses==
The term has been adopted in [[Sedevacantism]], an extreme strand of the [[Catholic traditionalist]] movement. Sedevacantists believe that all popes since the [[Second Vatican Council]] have been [[heresy|heretics]], and that therefore the [[Bishop of Rome|see of Rome]] is vacant.
