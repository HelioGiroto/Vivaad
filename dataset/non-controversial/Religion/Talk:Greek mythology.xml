==Apollodorus==

The Literary Sources section says the Pseudo-Apollodorus &quot;attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets&quot;. The introduction to the Oxford World's Classics version (written by the same person this sentence uses as a citation) says that one of the good things about this work is that it '''doesn't''' try to reconcile contradictions, and the author doesn't try to impose his own view on things. &quot;And the author was content to summarize them as he found them without imposing his own interpretations, or attempting to reconcile conflicting traditions&quot;. Do people think this could do with changing?

YA!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/198.166.42.119|198.166.42.119]] ([[User talk:198.166.42.119|talk]]) 16:39, 3 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==&quot;Diachronically heavy&quot;==

I don't understand what the sentence &quot;Therefore, western literature is diachronically heavy with allusions to the heritage of the ancient Greek myths&quot; means. I would guess it either means A) throughout the history of western literature, there are allsuions to Greek myths or B) an allusion to Greek myth has 2500 years behind it, so when I speak of &quot;Odysseus&quot;, the reference is not only to Homer, but also to Euripides, Ovid, Dante, and Joyce. Either way, I think the sentence needs to be rewritten to be clearer, and I hope the editor who wrote the sentence can clarify what s/he meant.

:It is the A.--[[User:Yannismarou|Yannismarou]] 09:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the response. In my judgment the sentence is unnecessary, since the rest of the paragraph already tells us that Greek mythology has had influence on culture, art, and literature throughout western history, so I have removed it.

==Albanian nonsense==

I agree with the removal of the section some anon user keeps putting in claiming that Greek mythology comes from Albanian beliefs. That's just sheer nonsense that no reputable academic has ever said. The idea that the Albanians became Christian and then cast off their old beliefs to the Greeks is especially ridiculous, as Greek beliefs were around longer than Christianity. Looks like some nationalistic wishful thinking by some woefully undereducated individual who doesn't understand that Wikipedia articles are for facts as the world sees them and not [[WP:OR|brand new fanciful theories]]...

== Hades ==
I am wondering why [[Hades]] is not included in the list of Deities. As described on the Wikipedia page regarding Hades, he, along with his brothers Zeus and Poseidon, defeated the Titans and took control of the Underworld, Sky and Sea. Is there a special reason why the God of the Underworld, one of the three basic deities of Greek mythology is not included on the list at the base of the page and in the side window list?

That is a good question.Why isn't one of the main deities not listed in an article about Greek Gods. That is a bit backwards.
Yoh Hades isnt listed as one of the main deities beacuse zeus forced him to be god of the underworld and he's not considered an olympian god, he doesnt even have a throne at olympus.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/65.25.11.23|65.25.11.23]] ([[User talk:65.25.11.23|talk]]) 19:58, 21 January 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Well spotted. Not sure why this has been overlooked but as neither Hades nor Hestia are usually included among lists of [[Twelve Olympians]], have moved them to &quot;Other&quot; in the footlist.

The Iliad and The Odyssey are the oldest known literary sources within Greek mythology. Currently, due to the phrasing, it may mislead readers to believe these are the two oldest known literary sources EVER. (This would be untrue.)

Helios was a Greek but, Apollo was Greek and Roman because of the controversy that followers had about who came first.

I've corrected an error in the article's 5th picture-caption - [[Charun]] is shown, not [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] - but could someone familiar with Greek and Etruscan orthography (thus not me) please check the identity of the standing figure with sword in hand? The Commons source describes it as Akhilleus but the ancient potter obligingly labeled his cast of characters and what he's written looks like Ajax to me. Thanks in advance.

== modern adherents ==

Does greco-roman religion have any modern adherents, and if not then historically when (and under what circumstances) did they disappear? [[User:Cesiumfrog|Cesiumfrog]] ([[User talk:Cesiumfrog|talk]]) 04:02, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

:to your first question, yes there are those who today call themselves followers of the olympian or twelve-god religion, although they are of dubious lineage. The true pagans died out in waves beginning in the first century as Christianity became popular. The move away from the old religions has a few milestones - the closing of the philosophical schools of Athens, the banning of the games at Olympia, etc., the destruction of pagan temples - all these span the 4-5-6th centuries. In some parts of southern Greece there were still pagans up to the 8th or even 9th centuries. There is then a hiatus of more than 1,000 years and the revivalists have cropped up, numbering no more than a few thousand. They are trying to recreate the old religion based on texts and archaeological finds. It's all a bit of a sham. --[[User:5telios|5telios]] ([[User talk:5telios|talk]]) 09:27, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for that info. Could you suggest any further references? Also, do you know why people abandoned it exactly? (It seems difficult to conceive of a major religion entirely disappearing today.. was Christianity just that much more convincing?)

::Why is there nothing about how and when Greek mythology died out in this article? [[Special:Contributions/194.176.105.39|194.176.105.39]] ([[User talk:194.176.105.39|talk]]) 10:37, 14 July 2011 (UTC)

:::Greek mythology hasn't died out; see the [[Percy Jackson]] franchise, for instance, and the article on [[classical mythology]]. The comments in this section seem to be confusing mythology with religion, for which see [[Religion in ancient Greece]].

== Page moves ==

Today and over the past few days there have been two move attempts by the same editor moving the page to two different titles both of which I reverted. The rationale for both moves was &quot;It sounds better&quot;. This is obviously not a valid move rationale. The ghits meanwhile for both reverted titles were abysmally low compared to the current title which is the most common English name. This is also a featured article. No page moves should happen without broad consensus. Conclusion: There is no valid reason currently at all to move the page to any other title.

== consistency between Cronus/Kronos ==

In the section on the &quot;Age of Gods&quot; Cronus is spelled with both a &quot;C&quot; and a &quot;K&quot; at different points in the text. It should probably consistent all the way through with a mention that it can be spelled the alternative way.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.12.232.123|86.12.232.123]] ([[User talk:86.12.232.123|talk]]) 22:22, 29 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Citing the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' as a source ==
really is a bad idea for any Wikipedia article, especially for one that is considered a Featured Article. While '''signed''' encyclopedia articles are a different animal -- we are using the author as the authority, not the encyclopedia itself -- encyclopedias are [[tertiary source]]s, just like Wikipedia, &amp; established best practices for Wikipedia is to use only [[primary source|primary]] or [[secondary source]]s. And I believe they don't meet the criteria for [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Then there is the matter that the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' is a competitor to Wikipedia, &amp; by citing its material as is done in this article -- to anonymous articles in a recent edition -- we are saying that the ''EB'' is more reliable than Wikipedia. Which I doubt any of us would want to do.&lt;!-- Well, I don't, &amp; I'm mad that I'm the first to point this problem out. Mad as in wanting the person responsible for adding these references banned from Wikipedia. if anyone cares.--&gt; If anyone cares about this article enough to fix this problem, then you should do so. I'll wait a while -- probably a month -- to see if anyone does fix this before considering to list this article at [[Wikipedia:Featured article review]] for possible demotion. -- [[User:Llywrch|llywrch]] ([[User talk:Llywrch|talk]]) 18:55, 6 November 2011 (UTC)
:I agree emphatically with improving sources in mythology articles (these are often outdated or unscholarly), but you might want to review [[WP:TERTIARY]]. My guess would be that this article achieved FA status before standards were as high as they are now. It would certainly make sense to review that status.
