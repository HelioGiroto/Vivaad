{{Zoroastrianism}}

'''Zoroaster''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|ɒr|oʊ|ˈ|æ|s|t|ər}}), also known as '''Zarathustra''' ({{lang-ae|Zaraϑuštra}}), was the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Though he is known to most likely be Parsee/Persian, his birthplace is uncertain, but it is now generally thought that he was born in the eastern part of ancient [[Greater Iran]]. He is credited with the authorship of the [[Yasna Haptanghaiti]] as well as the [[Gathas]], hymns which are at the liturgical core of Zoroastrianism. Most of his life is known through the Zoroastrian texts. However, the language spoken by Zoroaster, [[Avestan language|Old Avestan]], used for composing the [[Yasna Haptanghaiti]] and the [[Gathas]], on archaeological and linguistic grounds, is dated to have been spoken probably in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Zoroaster's language&quot; and &quot;Zoroaster's dialect&quot; used in reference to Old Avestan [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/AryanHome.pdf Michael Witzel, THE HOME OF THE ARYANS, Harvard University, P.11]. Date for Old Avestan {{Citation|first=P.O.|last=Skjærvø|authorlink=Prods Oktor Skjaervo|title=An Introduction to Young Avestan: Introduction: Old and Young Avestan|year=2003|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Avesta/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroaster was a vegetarian and strongly &quot;forbade any animal sacrifice&quot; on ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithandfood.com/Zoroastrianism.php#vegetarianism|title=Faithandfood Fact Files - Zoroastrianism|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
&lt;!-- The spelling, &quot;Zoroaster,&quot; derives from a [[Greek language|Greek]] version of the name. '''Zara(t-)ushtra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|ɑr|ə|ˈ|θ|uː|ʃ|t|r|ə}} {{respell|ZAR|ə|THOOSH|trə}}) is a modern rendering of the Avestan pronunciation,&lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt; though '''Zarathustra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|ær|ə|ˈ|θ|ʊ|s|t|r|ə}} {{respell|ZARR|ə|THUUS|trə}}) is more commonly used. In the [[Middle Persian]] and, thus, modern [[Persian language|Persian]] languages, he is called '''Zardušt''' (with variations '''Zar''d''osht''' or '''Zar''t''osht'''). --&gt;

Zoroaster's name in his native language, [[Avestan language|Avestan]], was probably ''Zaraϑuštra''. His English name, &quot;Zoroaster&quot;, and the derivatives from a later (5th-century BCE) [[Greek language|Greek]] transcription, ''Zōroastrēs'' ({{lang|grc|Ζωροάστρης}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlerath_1977_133_135&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1977|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; as used in [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]]'s ''[[Xanthus (historian)#Lydiaca|Lydiaca]]'' (Fragment 32) and in [[Plato]]'s ''[[First Alcibiades]]'' (122a1). This form appears subsequently in the Latin ''{{lang|la|Zōroastrēs}}'' and, in later Greek orthographies, as ''Zōroastris''. The Greek form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic substitution of the [[Avestan]] ''zaraϑ-'' with the Greek ''zōros'' (literally &quot;undiluted&quot;) and the Avestan ''-uštra'' with ''astron'' (&quot;[[star]]&quot;).

In [[Avestan]], ''Zaraϑuštra'' is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian ''*Zaratuštra-''. While ''zarat-'' is strongly referenced to mean &quot;golden&quot;{{Who|date=October 2010}} (from the [[Eastern Iranian languages|old Eastern-Iranian]] ''zar-'' [-زر], meaning &quot;gold&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;For example ''zairi-'' (golden/yellow), ''zairitem'' (golden/green), ''zaranaênem'' (golden, of gold). [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/aveol-BF-X.html Old Iranian/Avestan:Base Form Dictionary] and [http://www.avesta.org/avdict/avdict.htm#ratu Dictionary of most common AVESTA words].&lt;/ref&gt; it does not itself appear in [[Avestan]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The second half of the name (''-uštra-'') is universally accepted to mean &quot;camel&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|ushtra_camel|a|none}} These factors combined open the door for reconstructing the name's meaning, though there have been other alternative etymologies proposed.

Reconstructions from later Iranian languages—particularly from the [[Middle Persian]] (300 BCE) ''Zardusht'',{{explain}} which is the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century [[Zoroastrian]] texts—suggest that ''*Zaratuštra-'' might be a [[Indo-European ablaut#Zero grade|zero-grade]] form of ''*Zarantuštra-''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt;
Subject then to whether ''Zaraϑuštra'' derives from ''*Zarantuštra-'' or from ''*Zaratuštra-'', several interpretations have been proposed.{{Ref label|name_contra|b|none}}

Following ''*Zarantuštra-'' are:
*&quot;with old/aging camels&quot;:&lt;ref name = &quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;/&gt; related to [[Avestan language|Avestic]] ''zarant-''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schlerath_1977_133_135&quot;/&gt; (''cf.'' [[Pashto language|Pashto]] ''zōṛ'' and [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]] ''zœrond'', &quot;old&quot;; [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''zāl'', &quot;old&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horn, Grundriß der neupersischen Etymologie, Strassburg 1893&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;with angry/furious camels&quot;: from Avestan ''*zarant-'', &quot;angry, furious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayrhofer_1977_43_53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mayrhofer|1977|pp=43–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''*Zaratuštra-'' are:
*&quot;[owner of the] golden camel&quot;: this is derived from old Eastern Iranian word ''*zar-'' for gold and ''ushtra'' for camel, further corresponding to an Eastern Iranian origin (the Old Persian word ''dar'' as a Western-Iranian dialect would be the equal term of Eastern Iranian ''zar''; Modern Persian uses the Eastern Iranian word for gold).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
*&quot;who is driving camels&quot; or &quot;who is fostering/cherishing camels&quot;: related to Avestan ''zarš-'', &quot;to drag&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey_1953_40_42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bailey|1953|pp=40–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mayrhofer (1977) proposed an etymology of &quot;who is desiring camels&quot; or &quot;longing for camels&quot; and related to [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] ''har-'', &quot;to like&quot;, and perhaps (though ambiguous) also to Avestan ''zara-''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mayrhofer_1977_43_53&quot;/&gt;
*&quot;with yellow camels&quot;: parallel to younger Avestan ''zairi-''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Markwart_1930_7ff&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Markwart|1930|pp=7ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[folk etymology]] of the name is from ''zaraϑa'', &quot;golden&quot;, and the ''*uštra'', &quot;light&quot; (from the root ''uš'', &quot;to shine&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In yet another etymological variation, ''Zaraϑuštra'' is split into two words: ''zara'', &quot;gold&quot;, and ''ϑuštra'', &quot;friend&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Several more etymologies have been proposed, some quite fanciful, but none is factually based.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schmitt|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of the ''-ϑ-'' ({{IPA|/θ/}}) in Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' was for a time itself subjected to heated debate because the ''-ϑ-'' is an irregular development: As a rule, ''*zarat-'' (a first element that ends in a [[dental consonant]]) should have Avestan ''zarat-'' or ''zarat̰-'' as a development from it. Why this is not so for ''zaraϑuštra'' has not yet been determined. Notwithstanding the phonetic irregularity, that Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' with its ''-ϑ-'' was linguistically an actual form is shown by later attestations reflecting the same basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitt_2003&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schmitt|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All present-day, Iranian-language variants of his name derive from the [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] variants of ''Zarϑošt'', which, in turn, all reflect Avestan's fricative ''-ϑ-''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Date==
The date of Zoroaster, i.e., the date of composition of the Old Avestan gathas, is unknown. Classical writers such as [[Plutarch]] proposed dates prior to 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigosian|first=Solomon|title=The Zoroastrian faith: tradition and modern research|year=1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=978-0-7735-1144-6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Uspf6eDDvjAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Zoroaster+400&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V8EFT5WVMMXW8QPmvbi2Dw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zoroaster%20400&amp;f=false|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dates proposed in scholarly literature diverge widely, between the 18th and the 6th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Controversy over Zaraϑuštra's date has been an embarrassment of long standing to Zoroastrian studies. If anything approaching a consensus exists, it is that he lived no later than 1000 BC, give or take a century or so, though reputable scholars have proposed dates as widely apart as 1750 BCE and '258 years before Alexander.'&quot; (''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late 17th century, Zoroaster was generally dated to about the 6th century BC, which coincided with both the &quot;Traditional date&quot; (see details below) and historiographic accounts ([[Ammianus Marcellinus]] xxiii.6.32, 4th century AD). However, already at the time (late 19th century), the issue was far from settled.

The &quot;Traditional date&quot; originates in the period immediately following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 330 BC. The Seleucid kings who gained power following Alexander's death instituted an &quot;Age of Alexander&quot; as the new calendrical epoch. This did not appeal to the Zoroastrian priesthood who then attempted to establish an &quot;Age of Zoroaster.&quot; To do so, they needed to establish when Zoroaster had lived, which they accomplished by counting back the length of successive generations&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahbazi_1977_25_26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1977|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; until they concluded that Zoroaster must have lived &quot;258 years before Alexander.&quot; This estimate then re-appeared in the 9th- to 12th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition,{{Ref label|258Masudi|c|none}} which in turn gave the date doctrinal legitimacy, especially since it was made plausible also by the [[Pleiades#Observational history|observational history of the Pleiades]] in the [[Geoponica]] that indicates Zoroaster as a principal source of some observations.  In the early part of the 20th century, this remained the accepted date (subject to the uncertainties of the 'Age of Alexander'{{Ref label|258precision|d|none}}) for a number of reputable scholars, among them [[Hasan Taqizadeh]], a recognized authority on the various Iranian calendars, and hence became the date cited by Henning and others.

By the late 19th century, scholars such as Bartholomea and Christensen noted problems with the &quot;Traditional date,&quot; namely in the linguistic difficulties that it presented. The [[Avestan language|Old Avestan language]] of the Gathas (which are attributed to the prophet himself) is still very close to the [[Vedic Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] of the [[Rigveda]]. Therefore, it seemed implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could be more than a few centuries apart, suggesting a date for the oldest surviving portions of the [[Avesta]] of roughly the 2nd millennium BCE.

A date of 11th/10th century BC date is sometimes considered among Iranists, who in recent decades found that the social customs described in the Gathas roughly coincide with what is known of other pre-historical peoples of that period.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Supported by this historical evidence,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} the &quot;Traditional date&quot; can be conclusively ruled out, and the discreditation can to some extent be supported by the texts themselves: The Gathas describe a society of bipartite (priests and herdsmen/farmers) nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] with tribal structures organized at most as small kingdoms. This contrasts sharply with the view of Zoroaster having lived in an empire, at which time society is attested to have had a tripartite structure (nobility/soldiers, priests, and farmers). Although a slightly earlier date (by a century or two) has been proposed on the grounds that the texts do not reflect the migration onto the [[Iranian Plateau]], it is also possible that Zoroaster lived in one of the rural societies that remained in Central Asia.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Place==

''Yasna'' 9 &amp; 17 cite the Ditya River in [[Airyanem Vaejah|Airyanem Vaējah]] ([[Middle Persian]] ''Ērān Wēj'') as Zoroaster's home and the scene of his first appearance. The [[Avesta]] (both Old and Younger portions) does not mention the Achaemenids or of any West Iranian tribes such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], or even [[Parthia]]ns.

However, in ''Yasna'' 59.18, the ''zaraϑuštrotema'', or supreme head of the Zoroastrian priesthood, is said to reside in 'Ragha'. In the 9th- to 12th-century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition, this 'Ragha'—along with many other places—appear as locations in Western Iran. While the land of Media does not figure at all in the Avesta (the westernmost location noted in scripture is [[Arachosia]]), the ''[[Bundahishn|Būndahišn]]'', or &quot;Primordial Creation,&quot; (20.32 and 24.15) puts Ragha in [[Medes|Media]] (medieval [[Ray, Iran|Rai]]). However, in Avestan, Ragha is simply a toponym meaning &quot;plain, hillside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gershevitch_1964_36_37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gershevitch|1964|pp=36–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these indications in [[Middle Persian]] sources which are open to interpretations, there are a number of other sources. The Greek and Latin sources are divided on the birthplace of Zarathustra. There are many Greek accounts of Zarathustra, referred usually as Persian or Perso-Median Zoroaster. Moreover they have the suggestion that there has been more than one Zoroaster.&lt;ref&gt;William Enfield,  Johann Jakob Brucker,  Knud Haakonssen, ''The History of Philosophy from the Earliest Periods: Drawn Up from Brucker's Historia Critica Philosophia'', Published by Thoemmes, 2001, ISBN 1-85506-828-1, pages: 18, 22. Note: [[Roman historian|Cephalion]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] suggest east of [[greater Iran]] whereas [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Origen]] suggest west of [[Iran]] as his birthplace.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, in post-Islamic sources [[Al-Shahrastani|Shahrastani]] (1086–1153) an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] writer originally from Shahristān, present-day [[Turkmenistan]], proposed that Zoroaster's father was from [[Atropatene]] (also in Medea) and his mother was from [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. Coming from a reputed scholar of religions, this was a serious blow for the various regions who all claimed that Zoroaster originated from ''their'' homelands, some of which then decided that Zoroaster must then have then been buried in their regions or composed his Gathas there or preached there.&lt;ref name=&quot;cf_Boyce_1975_2_26&quot;&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Boyce|1975|pp=2–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cf_Gronke_1993_59_60&quot;&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Gronke|1993|pp=59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also Arabic sources of the same period and the same region of historical Persia consider [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] as the birthplace of  Zarathustra.&lt;ref name=san&gt;Solomon Alexander Nigosian, ''The Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research'', Published by [[McGill-Queen's University Press]] – MQUP, 1993, ISBN 0-7735-1144-X, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 20th century, most scholars had settled on an origin in Eastern [[Iran]] and/or [[Afghanistan]]. Gnoli proposed [[Sistan]] (though in a much wider scope than the present-day province) as the homeland of Zoroastrianism; Frye voted for [[Bactria]] and [[Chorasmia]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Frye_1992_8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1992|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khlopin suggests the [[Tedzen]] Delta in present-day [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khlopin_1992_107_110&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Khlopin|1992|pp=107–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sarianidi considered the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex|BMAC]] region as &quot;the native land of the Zoroastrians and, probably, of Zoroaster himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarianidi_1987_54&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sarianidi|1987|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyce includes the [[steppe]]s to the west from the [[Volga River|Volga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce_1975_1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval &quot;from Media&quot; hypothesis is no longer taken seriously, and Zaehner has even suggested that this was a Magi-mediated issue to garner legitimacy, but this has been likewise rejected by Gershevitch and others.

The 2005 ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' article on the history of Zoroastrianism summarizes the issue with &quot;while there is general agreement that he did not live in western Iran, attempts to locate him in specific regions of eastern Iran, including Central Asia, remain tentative.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Malandra_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Malandra|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Scuola di atene 07.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|thumb|Zoroaster holds the [[celestial sphere]] in [[Raphael Sanzio|Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'']]
The ''Gathas'' contain allusions to personal events, such as Zoroaster's triumph over obstacles imposed by competing priests and the ruling class. They also indicate he had difficulty spreading his teachings, and was even treated with ill-will in his mother's hometown. They also describe familial events such as the marriage of his daughter, at which Zoroaster presided. In the texts of the Younger ''[[Avesta]]'' (composed many centuries after the ''Gathas''), Zoroaster is depicted wrestling with the [[daeva|''daeva''s]] and is tempted by [[Angra Mainyu]] to renounce his faith (''Yasht'' 17.19; ''Vendidad'' 19). The ''Spend Nask'', the 13th section of the Avesta, is said to have a description of the prophet's life. {{sfn|Boyce|1989|p=189}} However, this text has been lost over the centuries, and it survives only as a summary in the seventh book of the 9th century ''[[Denkard|Dēnkard]]''. Other 9th- to 12th-century stories of Zoroaster, as in the ''[[Shahnameh|Shāhnāmeh]]'', are also assumed to be based on earlier texts, but must be considered as primarily a collection of [[legend]]s. The historical Zoroaster, however, eludes categorization as a legendary character.

Zoroaster was born into the priestly family of the ''Spitamids'' and his ancestor ''Spitāma'' is mentioned several times in the [[Gathas]]. His father's name was ''Pourušaspa'', or &quot;Poroschasp,&quot; a noble [[Persian people|Persian]], and his mother's was Dughdova (''Duγδōuuā''). With his wife, Huvovi (''Hvōvi''), Zoroaster had three sons, Isat Vastar, Uruvat-Nara and Hvare Ciϑra; three daughters, Freni, Pourucista and Triti.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=-QdFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=turkey+zoroaster&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jc6WUImLFKq00AHBgoHwCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=turkey%20zoroaster&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, children and a cousin named Maidhyoimangha, were his first converts after his illumination from [[Ahura Mazda]] at age 30. According to ''Yasnas'' 5 &amp; 105, Zoroaster prayed to [[Anahita]] for the conversion of King [[Vishtaspa|Vištaspa]],{{sfn|Appleton|2005|p=179}} who appears in the ''Gathas'' as a historical personage. In legends, Vištaspa is said to have had two brothers as courtiers, Frašaōštra and Jamaspa, and to whom Zoroaster was closely related: his wife, Hvōvi, was the daughter of Frashaōštra, while Jamaspa was the husband of his daughter Pourucista. The actual role of intermediary was played by the pious queen Hutaōsa. Apart from this connection, the new prophet relied especially upon his own kindred (''hvaētuš'').

Zoroaster's death is not mentioned in the ''Avesta''. In ''[[Shahnameh]]'' 5.92,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson_1899_130_131&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1899|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he is said to have been murdered at the altar by the [[Turan]]ians in the storming of [[Balkh]].

==Death==
Zoroaster's death was said to have been in [[Balkh]] located in [[Eastern Iran]] during the Holy War between [[Turan]] and [[Iran]] in 583 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=pqanFyF6nI0C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Ismailov+grey+wolves&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VSNVoDmYin&amp;sig=YNM3486bi0dN2kbbNDW25yIplC8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z4CWULbbNcbL0QGc24GwBQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Ismailov%20grey%20wolves&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaspa, his son-in-law, then became Zoroaster's successor.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=WDMMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=turan+iran+holy+war+583&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-kLhq4npK6&amp;sig=KaElqRHobeyvR4BPt2JCSgbMQ_I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ToWWUPT8OKnJ0QHUhIEg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=turan%20iran%20holy%20war%20583&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Raffael 071.jpg|thumb|250 px|Detail of [[The School of Athens]] by [[Raphael]], 1509, showing Zoroaster (left, with star-studded globe).]]
In the Gathas, Zoroaster sees the human condition as the mental struggle between ''[[aša]]'' (truth) and ''druj'' (lie). The cardinal concept of ''aša''—which is highly nuanced and only vaguely translatable—is at the foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of [[Ahura Mazda]] (who is ''aša''), creation (that is ''aša''), existence (that is ''aša'') and as the condition for Free Will.

The purpose of humankind, like that of all other creation, is to sustain ''aša''. For humankind, this occurs through active participation in life and the exercise of constructive thoughts, words and deeds.

Elements of Zoroastrian philosophy entered the West through their influence on [[Judaism]] and [[Middle Platonism]] and have been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackburn&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=&quot;Philosophy&quot;, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''|author=Blackburn, Simon|year=1994|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the classic Greek philosophers, [[Heraclitus]] is often referred to as inspired by Zoroaster's thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;August Gladisch&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=&quot;Herakleitos Und Zoroaster: Eine Historische Untersuchung&quot;, ISBN 978-1-160-10327-5 |author=August Gladisch, |year=1859|publisher=[[Kessinger Pub Co (Februar 2010)]]|page=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Zoroaster 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Zoroastrian devotional art depicts the religion's founder with white clothing and a long beard]]
Although a few recent depictions of Zoroaster show the prophet performing some deed of legend, in general the portrayals merely present him in [[White clothing (religious)|white vestments]] (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian priests). He often is seen holding a ''[[barsom|baresman]]'' (Avestan; [[Middle Persian]] ''barsom''), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the [[Avesta]]. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the ''varza''—usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull's head—that priests carry in their installation ceremony&lt;!-- the bares*num*--&gt;. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if to make a point. Zoroaster is rarely depicted as looking directly at the viewer; instead, he appears to be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stausberg_2002_I58&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|2002|p=I.58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common variant of the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this depiction at [[Taq-e Bostan]], a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of [[Ardashir I]] or [[Ardashir II|II]]. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a ''baresman'' in hand and with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|gloriole]] around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly supposed to be a depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of [[Mithra]]. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in [[Raphael|Raphael's]] 1509 [[The School of Athens]]. In it, Zoroaster and [[Ptolemy]] are having a discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.

==Western perceptions==

===In classical antiquity===
Although, at the core, the Greeks (in the [[Hellenization|Hellenistic sense]] of the term) understood Zoroaster to be the &quot;prophet and founder of the religion of the Iranian peoples&quot; (e.g. [[Plutarch]] ''Isis and Osiris'' 46-7, [[Diogenes Laertius]] 1.6-9 and [[Agathias]] 2.23-5), &quot;the rest was mostly fantasy.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Beck_525&quot;/&gt; He was set in the impossibly ancient past, six to seven millennia before the Common Era, and was variously a king of [[Bactria]], or a [[Babylonian]] (or teacher of Babylonians), and with a biography typical for every [[Pythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] sage, i.e. a mission preceded by ascetic withdrawal and enlightenment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_525&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=525}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most importantly however, was their picture of Zoroaster as the sorcerer-astrologer ''[[wikt:non plus ultra|non-plus-ultra]]'', and indeed as the &quot;inventor&quot; of both magic and astrology. Deriving from that image, and reinforcing it, was a &quot;mass of literature&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Beck_491&quot;/&gt; attributed to him and that circulated the [[Mediterranean]] world from the 3rd century BCE to the end of antiquity and beyond. &quot;The Greeks considered the best wisdom to be exotic wisdom&quot; and &quot;what better and more convenient authority than the distant—temporally and geographically—Zoroaster?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|2003|loc=para. 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of that literature was predominantly [[Greek language|Greek]], though at one stage or another various parts of it passed through [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Syriac]], [[coptic language|Coptic]] or [[Latin]]. Its ethos and cultural matrix was likewise Hellenistic, and &quot;the ascription of literature to sources beyond that political, cultural and temporal framework represents a bid for authority and a fount of legitimizing &quot;alien wisdom&quot;. Zoroaster and the magi did not compose it, but their names sanctioned it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_491&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=491}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The attributions to &quot;exotic&quot; names (not restricted to magians&lt;!--cf Arnaldo Momigliano /Alien Wisdom/, Cambridge UP, 1975 --&gt;) conferred an &quot;authority of a remote and revelation wisdom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 1991 p=493&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=493}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the magi were associated with magic in Greek imagination, Zoroaster was bound to metamorphose into a magician too. The 1st century [[Pliny the Elder]] names Zoroaster as the inventor of magic (''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' 30.2.3). &quot;However, a principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds.&quot; That &quot;dubious honor&quot; went to the &quot;fabulous magus, [[Ostanes]], to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_2003_para7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|2003|loc=para. 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pliny calls him the inventor of magic, the Roman does not provide a &quot;magician's persona&quot; for him.&lt;ref name = &quot;Beck_2003_para7&quot;/&gt; Moreover, the little &quot;magical&quot; teaching that is ascribed to Zoroaster is actually very late, with the very earliest example being from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=522}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor for the association with astrology was Zoroaster's name, or rather, what the Greeks made of it. Within the scheme of Greek thinking (which was always on the lookout for hidden significances and &quot;real&quot; meanings of words) his name was identified at first with star-worshiping (''astrothytes'' &quot;star sacrificer&quot;) and, with the ''Zo-'', even as the ''living'' star.&lt;!-- Beck 523 --&gt; Later, an even more elaborate mythoetymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living (''zo-'') flux (''-ro-'') of fire from the star (''-astr-'') which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him.&lt;!-- Beck 523 --&gt;

Similar ideas about Zoroaster also appear in early Christian literature, beginning with the ''[[Clementine literature|Clementine Homilies]]'' 9.4-5, which identifies him with a parallel series of traditions about [[Nimrod]] having been the founder of astrology. In this account, Nimrod is killed by lightning and posthumously deified by the Persians as &quot;Zoroaster, on account of the living (''zosan'') stream of the star (''asteros'') being poured upon him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassionatespirit.com/Homilies/Book-9.htm Clementine Homilies, Book 9], Compassionatespirit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and &quot;more serious&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_523&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=523}}.&lt;/ref&gt; factor for the association with astrology was the notion that Zoroaster was a [[Babylonian]]. The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos (''cf.'' Agathias 2.23-5, [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] ''Stromata'' I.15), which—so Cumont and Bidez—derived from a Semitic form of his name. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean tradition]] considered  the mathematician to have studied with Zoroaster in Babylonia ([[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] ''Life of Pythagoras'' 12, Alexander Polyhistor apud Clement's ''Stromata'' I.15, Diodorus of Eritrea, Aristoxenus apud Hippolitus VI32.2). [[Joannes Laurentius Lydus|Lydus]] (''On the Months'' II.4) attributes the creation of the seven-day week to &quot;the Babylonians in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes,&quot; and who did so because there were seven planets. The [[Suda]]'s chapter on ''astronomia'' notes that the Babylonians learned their astrology from Zoroaster. [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] (''Mennipus'' 6) decides to journey to Babylon &quot;to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster's disciples and successors,&quot; for their opinion.

While the division along the lines of Zoroaster/astrology and Ostanes/magic is an &quot;oversimplification, the descriptions do at least indicate what the works are ''not''.&quot; &lt;!--emphasis Beck--&gt; They were not expressions of Zoroastrian doctrine, they were not even expressions of what the Greeks and Romans &quot;''imagined'' &lt;!--emphasis Beck--&gt; the doctrines of Zoroastrianism to have been.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 1991 p=493&quot; /&gt; The assembled fragments do not even show noticeable commonality of outlook and teaching among the several authors who wrote under each name.&lt;!-- &quot;...[The lack of commonality, it] must be emphasized, between ''and among'' the several authors who wrote under the name of the former and the several who wrote under the name of the latter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_495&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=495}}.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
[[File:Dura-Europos mithraeum - Sketch of an initiate.jpg|alt=|thumb|This sketch of Zoroaster was made by a [[Manicheanism|Manichean]] initiate]]
Almost all Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha is now lost, and of the attested texts—with only one exception—only fragments have survived. Pliny's 2nd or 3rd century attribution of &quot;two million lines&quot; to Zoroaster suggest that (even if exaggeration and duplicates are taken into consideration) a formidable pseudepigraphic corpus once existed at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. This corpus can safely be assumed to be pseudepigrapha because no one before Pliny refers to literature by &quot;Zoroaster,&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Beck_526&quot;/&gt; and on the authority of the 2nd century [[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]] and from a 6th century commentator on Aristotle it is known that the acquisition policies of well-endowed royal libraries created a market for fabricating manuscripts of famous and ancient authors.&lt;!-- &quot;This, says Galen, was the origin of much of the spurious literature still in circulation in his day. It cannot of course be proved, but it seems not unlikely that Zoroaster, bearing as fabled and antique a name as one might wish, and moreover never having written any real books against which to test the false, would have been an ideal author for the inventions of these entrepreneurs of the book trade.&quot;--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_526&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=526}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception to the fragmentary evidence (i.e. reiteration of passages in works of other authors) is a complete Coptic tractate titled ''Zostrianos'' (after the first-person narrator) discovered in the [[Nag Hammadi library]] in 1945. A three-line cryptogram in the colophones following the 131-page treatise identify the work as &quot;words of truth of Zostrianos. God of Truth [''logos'']. Words of Zoroaster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sieber|1973|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Invoking a &quot;God of Truth&quot; might seem Zoroastrian, but there is otherwise &quot;nothing noticeably Zoroastrian&quot; about the text and &quot;in content, style, ethos and intention, its affinities are entirely with the congeners among the Gnostic tractates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck_495&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=495}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the named works attributed to &quot;Zoroaster&quot; is a treatise ''On Nature'' (''Peri physeos''), which appears to have originally constituted four volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The framework is a retelling of Plato's ''[[Myth of Er]]'', with Zoroaster taking the place of the original hero. While Porphyry imagined [[Pythagoras]] listening to Zoroaster's discourse, ''On Nature'' has the sun in middle position, which was how it was understood in the 3rd century. In contrast, Plato's 4th century BCE version had the sun in second place above the moon. Ironically, [[Colotes]] accused [[Plato]] of plagiarizing Zoroaster,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nock_1929_111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nock|1929|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Livingston_2002_144_145&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Livingston|2002|pp=144–145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] wrote a text titled ''Zoroaster'' based on (what the author considered) &quot;Zoroastrian&quot; philosophy in order to express his disagreement with Plato on [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livingston_2002_147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Livingston|2002|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to substance and content in ''On Nature'' only two facts are known:&lt;!-- 530 --&gt; that it was crammed with astrological speculations, and that [[Ananke (mythology)|Necessity (''Ananké'')]] was mentioned by name and that she was in the air.

Another work circulating under the name of &quot;Zoroaster&quot; was the ''Asteroskopita'' (or  ''Apotelesmatika''), and which ran to five volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The title and fragments suggest that it was an astrological handbook, &quot;albeit a very varied one, for the making of predictions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 1991 p=493&quot;/&gt; A third text attributed to Zoroaster is ''On Virtue of Stones'' (''Peri lithon timion''), of which nothing is known other than its extent (one volume) and that pseudo-Zoroaster ''sang'' it (from which Cumont and Bidez conclude that it was in verse). Numerous other fragments (preserved in the works of other authors) are attributed to &quot;Zoroaster,&quot; but the titles of whose books are not mentioned.

These pseudepigraphic texts aside, some authors did draw on a few genuinely Zoroastrian ideas. The ''Oracles of Hystaspes'', by &quot;[[Vishtaspa|Hystaspes]]&quot;, another prominent magian pseudo-author, is a set of prophecies distinguished from other Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha in that it draws on real Zoroastrian sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 1991 p=493&quot;/&gt; Some allusions are more difficult to assess: in the same text that attributes the invention of magic to Zoroaster, Pliny states that Zoroaster laughed on the day of his birth, although in an earlier place (VII, I), Pliny had sworn in the name of [[Hercules]] that no child had ever done so before the 40th day from his birth. This notion of Zoroaster's laughter (like that of &quot;two million verses&quot;) also appears in the 9th-11th century texts of genuine Zoroastrian tradition,  and for a time it was assumed that the origin of those myths lay with indigenous sources. Pliny also records (VII, XV) that Zoroaster's head had pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom. The Iranians were however just as familiar with the Greek writers. The provenance of other descriptions are clear, so for instance, Plutarch's description of its dualistic theologies: &quot;Others call the better of these a god and his rival a daemon, as, for example, Zoroaster the Magus, who lived, so they record, five thousand years before the siege of Troy. He used to call the one [[Ahura Mazda|Horomazes]] and the other [[Angra Mainyu|Areimanius]]&quot; (''Isis and Osiris'' 46-7).

===In the post-classical era===
[[File:Zartosht 30salegee.jpg|alt=|thumb|This drawing was made by a Persian in the early 20th century, depicting Zoroaster as a warrior]]
Zoroaster was known as a sage, magician, and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture. Although almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late 18th century, his name was already associated with lost ancient wisdom. However as early as 1643 statements by Sir [[Thomas Browne]] are the earliest recorded references to Zoroaster in the English language.

Zoroaster appears as &quot;Sarastro&quot; in Mozart's opera ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', which has been noted for its Masonic elements. He is also the subject of the 1749 opera ''[[Zoroastre]]'', by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]].

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]] promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it was a form of rational [[Deism]], preferable to [[Christianity]]. With the translation of the [[Avesta]] by [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Abraham Anquetil-Duperron]], Western scholarship of Zoroastrianism began.

In his seminal work ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra)]]'' (1885) the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] uses the native Iranian name Zarathustra which has a significant meaning{{Ref label|Ashouri_2003|s|none}} as he had used the familiar Greek-Latin name in his earlier works.&lt;ref name=&quot;eiashouri&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ashouri|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Nietzsche invents a characterization of Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against morality.{{Ref label|nieztsche|f|none}} [[Richard Strauss]]'s Opus 30, inspired by Nietzsche's book, is also called ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]''.

Zoroaster was mentioned by the Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]].  His wife and he were said to have claimed to have contacted Zoroaster through &quot;[[automatic writing]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins_2006_PAGENUMMISSING&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Watkins|2006|p=??}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- if the conference proceedings were published. If not, where can we find this paper? --&gt;

The protagonist and narrator of [[Gore Vidal]]'s 1981 novel ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'' is described to be the grandson of Zoroaster.

[[Zarathustra]], the mythic hero in [[Giannina Braschi]]'s 2011 dramatic novel &quot;United States of Banana&quot;, joins forces with Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]] to liberate Calderon de la Barca's [[Segismundo]] from the dungeon of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repeatingislands.com/2011/12/12/new-book-giannina-braschis-united-states-of-banana/].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other religious systems==

===In Islam===
&lt;!-- CAUTION: Islamic tradition has much to say about Zoroastrians, but little about Zoroaster. Even if it may be tempting to slide off into a discussion of the Majusi, the topic of this article is the prophet, not his followers.

Like the Greeks of classical antiquity, [[Islam]]ic tradition understands Zoroaster to be the founding prophet of the Magians (via Aramaic, Arabic ''[[Majus]]'', collective ''Majusya'').The 11th century Cordoban [[Ibn Hazm]] (Zahiri school) contends that ''Kitabi'' &quot;of the Book&quot; cannot apply in light of the Zoroastrian assertion that their books were destroyed by Alexander. --&gt;
Citing the authority of the 8th century [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]], the 9th/10th century historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] (i.648)&lt;ref name=&quot;apud_Büchner_1936_105&quot;&gt;Qtd. in {{harvnb|Büchner|1936|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that Zara&lt;!-- with 'a' --&gt;dusht bin Isfiman (an [[Arabic]] adaptation of &quot;Zarathustra Spitama&quot;) was an inhabitant of Palestine, and a servant of one of the disciples of the prophet [[Jeremiah]]. According to this tale, Zaradusht defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf. [[Elisha]]'s servant [[Gehazi]] in Jewish Scripture). The apostate Zaradusht then eventually made his way to Balkh where he converted Bishtasb (i.e. [[Vishtaspa]]), who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians&lt;!--Madjusya--&gt;. Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i.681-683&lt;ref name=&quot;apud_Büchner_1936_105&quot;/&gt;) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been [[Sabians|''Sabi''s]]) to the Magian religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;apud_Büchner_1936_105&quot;/&gt;

The 10th/11th century heresiographer [[al-Shahrastani]] describes the Majusiya into three sects, the ''Kayumarthiya''&lt;!--(an otherwise undocumented sect that – per Sharastani – seems to have had a stronger doctrine of Ahriman's &quot;non-reality&quot;)--&gt;, the ''[[Zurvanism|Zurwaniya]]'' and the ''Zaradushtiya'', among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, the Zoroaster has said: &quot;They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform.&quot; (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, .5-7. 50–54) Shortly before the advent of the prophet of Islam, [Muhammad], Persia was under the sovereignty of Sasan V. When the companions of the Prophet, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other &quot;People of the Book.&quot; Though the name of Zoroaster is not mentioned in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there is a verse in the Qur'an: &quot;And We did send apostles before thee: there are some of them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not mentioned to Thee.&quot; (40 : 78). Accordingly the Muslims treated the founder of Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the Zoroastrian religion. James Darmestar has truly remarked in the translation of [[Zend Avesta]]: &quot;When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin of the Avesta.&quot; (Introduction to Vendiad. p.&amp;nbsp;69.)

====Ahmadiyya view====
[[Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadi Muslims]] view Zoroaster as a Prophet of God and describe the expressions of Ahura Mazda, the God of goodness and Ahraman, the God of evil as merely referring to the coexistence of forces of good and evil enabling humans to exercise free will. [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], in his book ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' views Zoroaster as Prophet of God and describes such the expressions to be a concept which is similar to the concepts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_5.html Revelation, Rationality Khowledge &amp; Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Manichaeism===
[[Manichaeism]] considered Zoroaster to be a figure (along with [[Jesus]] and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) in a line of prophets of which [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (216–276) was the culmination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Widengren_1961_76&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroaster's ethical dualism is—to an extent—incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which viewed the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Widengren_1961_43-45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=43–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Manicheanism also incorporated other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zoroaster's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Widengren_1961_43-45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=44–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaehner_1972_21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zaehner|1972|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Bahá'í Faith===
Zoroaster appears in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as a &quot;[[Manifestation of God]]&quot;, one of a line of prophets who have progressively revealed the Word of God to a gradually maturing humanity. Zoroaster thus shares an exalted station with [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], the [[Báb]], and the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taherzadeh_1976_3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taherzadeh|1976|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, saw Bahá'u'lláh as the fulfillment of a post-Sassanid Zoroastrian prophecy that saw a return of Sassanid emperor [[Bahram I|Bahram]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Buck_1998&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shoghi Effendi also stated that Zoroaster lived roughly 1000 years before Jesus.{{Ref label|Effendi_1000BCE|z|none}}

That '258 years' was the generally accepted figure is however noted by [[al-Biruni]] and [[al-Masudi]], with the latter specifically stating (in 943/944 AD) that &quot;the Magians count a period of two hundred and fifty-eight years between their prophet and Alexander.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson_1899_162&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1899|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Shahbazi_1977_26&quot;/&gt;

His birth? His enlightenment? His conversion of Vistaspa? His death? Similarly, before Alexander's ''what''? His accession to the Macedonian throne? His invasion? His death? The beginning of the &quot;Era of Alexander&quot; (which began 10 years after his death)?

It has been suggested that this &quot;traditional date&quot; is an adoption of some date from foreign sources, from the Greeks&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingsley_1990_245&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kingsley|1990|pp=245–265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Babylonians&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahbazi_1977_32&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1977|pp=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, which the priesthood then reinterpreted. A simpler explanation is that the priests subtracted 42 (the age at which Zoroaster is said to have converted Vistaspa) from the round figure of 300.&lt;!-- Jackson, On the Date of Zoroaster; Boyce, Z1; cf also Henning, Western Response --&gt;

The date is typically  described as &quot;5,000 years before the Trojan war&quot; or &quot;6,000 years before Plato&quot; (or &quot;before Xerxes&quot;). &quot;Their chief claim to any consideration&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson_1896_3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1896|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is that these sources cite the authority of (variously) [[Hermippus]] (5th c. BCE), [[Xanthus of Lydia]] (5th c. BCE), [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (5th/4th c. BCE), [[Aristotle]] (4th c. BCE) and Hermodorus (4th c. BCE, a student of [[Plato]]'s). In general, the 6000 BCE date is assumed to be based on a Greek misunderstanding of the (Zoroastrian) &quot;great-year&quot; cycles, which foresees recurring 12,000-year periods of three 3,000-year segments each.

Other classical sources—again on the authority of Xanthus of Lydia—consider &quot;600 years before Xerxes&quot; (i.e. before his invasion of Greece), i.e. 1080 BCE, which would then coincide with the linguistic dating of the Gathas. Similarly, the tenth c. [[Suda]], which cites no one but provides a date of &quot;500 years before Plato&quot; for one of its two Zoroasters.
