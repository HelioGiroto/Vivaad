{{Bahá'í}}
'''Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad Shírází''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|ā|.|y|ə|d|ˈ|æ|.|l|ē|.|m|ō|ˈ|h|æ|.|m|ə|d|.|sh|i|ˈ|r|ä|z|i}}, {{lang-fa|سيد علی ‌محمد شیرازی}}; October 20, 1819 – July 9, 1850) was the founder of [[Bábism]], and one of three central figures of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. He was a merchant from [[Shiraz, Iran|Shíráz]], [[Persia]], who at the age of twenty-four (on May 23, 1844) claimed to be the promised [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qá'im]] (or [[Mahdi]]). After his declaration he took the title of '''Báb''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|ä|b}}, {{lang-ar|باب}}) meaning &quot;Gate&quot;. He composed hundreds of letters and books (often termed ''[[Tablet (religious)|tablets]]'') in which he stated his messianic claims and defined his teachings, which constituted a new ''sharí'ah'' or religious law. His movement eventually acquired tens of thousands of supporters, was opposed by Iran's Shi'a clergy, and was suppressed by the Iranian government, leading to the persecution and killing of thousands of his followers, called Bábís. In 1850, at the age of thirty, the Báb was shot by a firing squad in [[Tabriz|Tabríz]].

[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] claim that the Báb was also the spiritual return of [[Elijah]] and [[John the Baptist]], that he was the &quot;[[Ushídar-Máh]]&quot; referred to in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] scriptures,&lt;ref name=&quot;gpb_58&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Effendi |last=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-5.html#pg58 | pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was the forerunner of their own religion. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, was a follower of the Báb and claimed to be the fulfillment of his promise that God would send another messenger.&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Studies in Modern Religions, Religious Movements and the Bābī-Bahā'ī Faiths | editor = Sharon, Moshe | chapter = The eschatology of Globalization: The multiple-messiahship of Bahā'u'llāh revisited | first = Christopher | last = Buck | isbn = 90-04-13904-4 | pages = 143–178 | location = Boston | publisher = Brill | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early life===
[[File:Bab-calligraphic-exercise.jpg|thumb|Calligraphic exercise of the Báb written before he was ten years old.]]
Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad Shírází was born on October 20, 1819, in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] to a middle-class [[merchant]] of the city. His father was Siyyid Muhammad Ridá, and his mother was Fátimih Bagum (1800–1881), a daughter of a prominent merchant in Shiraz (she later became a [[Bahá'í]]). His father died while he was quite young and the boy was raised by his maternal uncle, [[Seven Martyrs of Tehran#Hájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí|Hájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí]], who was also a merchant.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam | year = 1999 | article = Bāb | publisher = Koninklijke Brill NV | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | first = A.| last = Bausani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;balyuzi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Balyuzi |first = H.M. |authorlink = Hasan M.

He did not even answer our questions. He was constantly absorbed in his own thoughts, and was preoccupied with repetition of his prayers and verses. He is described as a handsome man with a thin beard, dressed in clean clothes, wearing a green shawl and a black turban.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hajji Muhammad Husayn, quoted in {{cite book | first = Abbas | last = Amanat | title = Resurrection and Renewal: The making of the Babi Movement in Iran, 1844–1850 | location= Ithaca | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 1989 | pages = 132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An English physician described the young man by saying: &quot;He was a very mild and delicate-looking man, rather small in stature and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft voice, which struck me much&quot;&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Balyuzi, ''The Bab – The Herald of the Day of Days'', p. 146
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
In 1842 he married [[Khadíjih-Bagum]] (1822–1882); he was 23 and she was 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; She was the daughter of a prominent merchant in Shíráz. The marriage proved to be a happy one,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;H.M. Balyuzi, ''Khadijih Bagum – Wife of the Bab''&lt;/ref&gt; and they had one child, a boy named Ahmad who died the year he was born (1843).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; The pregnancy jeopardized Khadíjih-Bagum's life, and she never conceived again. The young couple occupied a modest house in Shíráz along with the Báb's mother. Later, Khadíjih-Bagum became a Bahá'í.

===The Shaykhi movement===
In the 1790s in Persia, [[Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsa'i|Shaykh Aḥmad]] (1753–1826) began a religious movement within [[Shi'a Islam]]. His followers, who became known as [[Shaykhism|Shaykhis]], were expecting the imminent appearance of the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qá'im]] of the House of Muhammad, also called the [[Mahdi]]. After the death of Shaykh Ahmad, leadership was passed on to [[Sayyid Kazim Rashti|Sayyid Kázim]] of [[Rasht]] (1793–1843).

Around 1839–40 the Báb went on pilgrimage to [[Iraq]], and stayed mostly in and around [[Karbala]]. There he is believed to have met the leader of the Shaykhis, Sayyid Kázim, who showed a high regard for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot; /&gt; He is believed to have attended some of Siyyid Kazim's lectures; however, this period is almost entirely undocumented.&lt;ref name = &quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt;

As of his death in December 1843, Sayyid Kázim had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Mahdi, who, according to his prophecies, would soon appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot; /&gt; One of these followers, named [[Mullá Husayn]], after keeping vigil for forty days in a mosque, travelled to [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], where he met the Báb.&lt;ref name=&quot;balyuzi13&quot;&gt;Balyuzi, pp. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration to Mullá Husayn===
Soon after he arrived in Shiraz, Mullá Husayn came into contact with the Báb.  On the night of May 22, 1844, Mullá Husayn was invited by the Báb to his home; on that night Mullá Husayn told him that he was searching for the possible successor to Siyyid Kázim, the Promised One. The Báb told Mullá Husayn privately that he was Siyyid Kázim's successor and the bearer of divine knowledge.&lt;ref name= &quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Room-bab.jpg|thumb|right|The room where the Declaration of the Báb took place on May 23, 1844, in his house in [[Shiraz]].]]
After some consideration, Mullá Husayn became the first to accept the Báb's claims as the gateway to Truth and as the initiator of a new prophetic cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; The Báb had replied satisfactorily to all of Mullá Husayn's questions and had written in his presence, with extreme rapidity, a long commentary of [[Yusuf (sura)|Surah of Joseph]], which has come to be known as the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|Qayyúmu'l-Asmá']] and is considered the Báb's first revealed work.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot; /&gt;

===Letters of the Living===
Mullá Husayn was the Báb's first disciple. Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Siyyid Káẓim had independently recognized the Báb as a Manifestation of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Time of the Báb | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/bahai/history/bab_2.shtml |publisher=BBC | accessdate =July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was one woman, Fátimih Zarrín Táj Bara&lt;u&gt;gh&lt;/u&gt;áni, a poetess, who later received the name of [[Táhirih]] (the Pure). These 18 disciples were later to be known as the [[Letters of the Living]] and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; The Báb emphasized the spiritual station of these 18 individuals, who, along with himself, made the first &quot;Unity&quot; of his religion&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat191&quot;&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the term &quot;unity&quot; (Wáhid) has a numerical value of 19 using [[Abjad numerals]]). The Báb, in his book the [[Persian Bayán]], gives the metaphorical identity of the Letters of the Living as the [[The Fourteen Infallibles|Fourteen Infallibles]] in Shí'í Islam ([[Muhammad]], the [[Twelve Imams]], and [[Fatimah]]) and the four [[archangels]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat191&quot; /&gt; In some ways, they parallel the Twelve Apostles of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Moojan | last = Momen | title = Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetology: archetypal patterns in the lives of the founders of the world religions | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 1995 | journal = Bahá'í Studies Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclamation===
In his early writings, the Báb appears to identify himself as the gate (''báb'') to the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Hidden Twelfth Imam]], and later he begins explicitly to proclaim his station as that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;saiedi19&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Gate of the Heart | first = Nader | last = Saiedi | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, ON | pages = 19 | isbn = 978-1-55458-035-4 | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than being a discontinued or evolving consciousness, Saiedi states that the works of the Báb are unitary throughout, and that the gradual disclosure of the Báb's identity is defined by the principle of unity in diversity throughout reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;saiedi19&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Masjidivakil2008.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Báb stood on this pulpit in the Masjid-i-Vakíl, addressing the populace of Shiraz in September 1846]]
In the Báb's early writings, the exalted identity he was claiming was unmistakable, but because of the reception of the people, his writings appear to convey the impression that he is only the gate to the Hidden Twelfth Imam.&lt;ref name=&quot;saiedi19&quot; /&gt; To his circle of early believers, the Báb was equivocal about his exact status, gradually confiding in them that he was not merely a gate to the Hidden Imam, but the Manifestation of the Hidden Imam and the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qa'im]] himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoA&quot;&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Resurgence of Apocalyptic in Modern Islam | first = Abbas | last = Amanat | editor = Stein, Stephen J. | title = The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism, vol. III: Apocalypticism in the Modern Period and the Contemporary Age. | location = New York | publisher = Continuum | year = 2000 | pages = 241–242 | isbn = 0-8264-1255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early meetings with [[Mullá Husayn]], the Báb described himself as the Master and the Promised One; he did not consider himself to be simply [[Sayyid Kazim Rashti|Siyyid Kazim's]] successor, but claimed a prophetic status, a kind of deputy, delegated not just by the Hidden Imam but through Divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; His early texts such as the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|&quot;Commentary on the Surih of Joseph&quot;]] used Quranic language that implied divine authority and identified himself effectively with the Imam.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat230&quot;&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 230-31.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mullá `Alí Basṭámí, the second Letter of the Living, was put on trial in [[Baghdad]] for preaching about the Báb, clerics studied the &quot;Commentary on the Surih of Joseph,&quot; recognized in it a claim to divine revelation, and quoted from it extensively to prove that the author had made a messianic claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat230&quot; /&gt;

However, in the early phase of his declaration to the public, the title ''báb'' was emphasized as that of the gate leading to the Hidden Imam, as the Báb had told his early believers not to fully disclose his claims or reveal his name.&lt;ref name=&quot;manuchehri&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Manuchehri | first = Sepehr | title = The Practice of Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) in the Babi and Bahai Religions | journal = Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | year = 1999 | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol3/taqiya.htm | accessdate =September 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of laying claim to a lower position was intended to create a sense of anticipation for the appearance of the Hidden Imam, as well to avoid persecution and imprisonment, because a public proclamation of [[mahdi]] status could have brought upon the Báb a swift penalty of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;manuchehri&quot; /&gt;  After a couple of months, as the Báb observed further acceptance and readiness among his believers and the public, he gradually shifted his public claim to that of the Hidden Imam.&lt;ref name=&quot;manuchehri&quot; /&gt; Then in his final years he publicly announced his station as a [[Manifestation of God]]; in his [[#Trial|trial]], he boldly proclaimed himself, in the presence of the Heir to the Throne of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and other notables, to be the Promised One.&lt;ref name=&quot;manuchehri&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trial&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Trial of the Bab: Shi'ite Orthodoxy Confronts its Mirror Image | first = Denis | last = MacEoin | journal = Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | volume = 1 | url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/babtrial.htm | month = May | year = 1997 | accessdate =July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early months of his public declarations, the adoption of a cautious policy had essentially achieved maximum attention with minimum controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;manuchehri&quot; /&gt;

The gradual unfolding of his claims, however, did cause some confusion, both among the public and for some of his believers. A number of his early followers had instantly recognized his station as a messenger from God with divine authority, and this resulted in disagreement within the Bábi community.&lt;ref name=&quot;manuchehri&quot; /&gt;  Furthermore, even though the Báb had intended to convey his message with discretion, many of his followers (such as [[Táhirih]]) openly declared the coming of the promised Hidden Imam and Mahdi.&lt;ref name=&quot;manuchehri&quot; /&gt;

===Travels and imprisonment===
After the eighteen Letters of the Living had recognized him, the Báb and the eighteenth Letter of the Living, [[Quddús]], left on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the sacred cities of Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; In Mecca, the Báb wrote to the [[Sharif of Mecca]], Custodian of the Kaaba, proclaiming his mission.  After their pilgrimage, the Báb and Quddús returned to [[Bushehr]], Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;balyuzi&quot; /&gt;

After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. He was placed under house arrest at the home of his uncle until a cholera epidemic broke out in the city in September 1846.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; The Báb was released and departed for [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. There, many came to see him at the house of the imám jum'ih, head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the Báb debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity soared.&lt;ref&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the Governor of Isfahan, who had become his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to the Shah, [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]], ordering the Báb to [[Tehran]] in January 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 258.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the Báb could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to [[Tabriz]] in the northwestern corner of the country, where he was confined.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Mahku2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fortress of Máh-Kú (2008)]]
After forty days in Tabriz, the Báb was then transferred to the fortress of [[Maku, Iran|Máh-Kú]] in the province of [[Iranian Azarbaijan|Azarbaijan]] close to the Turkish border. During his incarceration there, the Báb began his most important work, the [[Persian Bayán]], which he never finished. Because of the Báb's growing popularity in Máh-Kú and the governor of Máh-Kú converting, the prime minister transferred him to the fortress of [[Chihríq|&lt;u&gt;Ch&lt;/u&gt;ihríq]] in April 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot; /&gt; In that place as well, the Báb's popularity grew and his jailors relaxed restrictions on him. It was at this time that Áqa Bálá Big Shíshvání Naqshbandí painted the portrait of the Báb.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |author = Denis MacEoin |year = 1992 |title = The Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History  |publisher = Brill |location = Leiden |isbn = 90-04-09462-8 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=xqV9-zmMxsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=177}} Muhammad 'Alí Faydí's ''Hadrat-i Nuqta-yi Ulá'' (Tehran, 132 B.E./1976-77): &quot;This work contains an interesting account of the single portrait of the Báb painted by Áqa Bálá Big Shíshvání Naqshbandí during Shírazí's stay in Urúmiyya in 1848 (pp. 367–74). This painting is now kept in the Bahá'í archives in Haifa...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hence the Prime Minister ordered the Báb back to Tabriz where the government called on religious authorities to put the Báb on trial for blasphemy and apostasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt;

===Trial===
The trial, attended by the Crown Prince, occurred in July 1848 and involved numerous local clergy. They questioned the Báb about the nature of his claims, his teachings, and demanded that he produce miracles to prove his divine authority. They admonished him to recant his claims. There are nine extant eyewitness reports of the trial, of which several may originate from an earlier source. Six of the reports are from Muslim accounts, and portray the Báb in an unfavourable light.&lt;ref name=&quot;trial&quot; /&gt; There are 62 questions that are found in the nine sources, however eighteen occur in only one source, fifteen in two, eight in three, five in four, thirteen in five, and three in six. Not including &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;he did not answer&quot;, there are thirty-five answers, of which ten occur in one source, eight in two, six in three, three in four, two in five, five in six. Only one answer is found in all nine eyewitness sources, where the Báb states that &quot;I am that person you have been awaiting for one thousand years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trial&quot; /&gt; His claim to Mahdihood was bold and unequivocal.

The trial did not bring a decisive result. Some clergy called for capital punishment, but the government pressured them to issue a lenient judgement because the Báb was popular. The government asked medical experts to declare the Báb insane so that he could not be executed. It is also likely that the government, to appease the religious clergy, spread rumours that the Báb had recanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Abbas | last = Amanat | title = Resurrection and Renewal: The Making of the Babi Movement in Iran | publisher =  Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 1989 | pages = 390–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shaykh al-Islam]] (a very prominent local cleric), the champion of the anti-Bábí campaign, who was not at the Báb's trial, issued a conditional death sentence if the Báb was found to be sane. A [[fatwa]] was issued establishing the Báb's [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] and stated &quot;The repentance of an incorrigible apostate is not accepted, and the only thing which has caused the postponement of thy execution is a doubt as to thy sanity of mind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat&quot; /&gt;

The crown prince's physician, William Cormick, examined the Báb and complied with the government's request to find grounds for clemency.&lt;ref name=&quot;trial&quot; /&gt; The physician's opinion saved the Báb from execution for a time, but the clergy insisted that he face corporal punishment instead, so the Báb was [[Foot whipping|bastinadoed]] (administered twenty lashes to the bottoms of his feet).&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat&quot; /&gt;  The official report states that because of his harsh beating, the Báb recanted, apologized, and stated that he would not continue to advance claims of divinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;msbr&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = E.G. | last = Browne | title = Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion | year = 1918 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While various government sources indicate that the Báb recanted his claim, there is little non-governmental evidence of their validity. Some theorise that the assertions were made to embarrass the Báb and undermine his credibility with the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat&quot; /&gt; There exists an unsigned and undated document that was supposedly written shortly after the Báb's trial in Tabriz where the Báb recants his claims to a divine station. But the language of this document is very different from the Báb's usual style; it could have been prepared by the authorities, but the Báb refused to sign it.&lt;ref name=&quot;trial&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amanat&quot; /&gt; The Báb was finally ordered back to the fortress of &lt;u&gt;Ch&lt;/u&gt;ihríq.

[[File:Where Bab executed.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The barrack square in [[Tabriz]], where the Báb was executed]]
In mid 1850 a new prime-minister, [[Amir Kabir]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gpb_52&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Effendi |last=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-5.html#pg52  | pages = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered the execution of the Báb, probably because various Bábí insurrections had been defeated and the movement's popularity appeared to be waning. The Báb was brought back to Tabríz from &lt;u&gt;Ch&lt;/u&gt;ihríq, so that he could be shot by a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]]. The night before his execution, as he was being conducted to his cell, a young Bábí, Muḥammad-`Alíy-i-Zunúzí, called Anís, threw himself at the feet of the Báb and begged to be killed with him. He was immediately arrested and placed in the same cell as the Báb.

On the morning of July 9, 1850, the Báb was taken to the courtyard of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch his execution. The Báb and Anís were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad of Christian soldiers prepared to shoot.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the result.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Justin Shiel, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran, wrote to [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on July 22, 1850, regarding the execution. The [[Execution of the Báb#Western accounts|letter]], can be found in its original form as document F.O. 60/152/88 in the archives of the Foreign Office at the Public Records Office in London.&lt;/ref&gt; The order was given to fire and the barracks square filled with musket smoke. When it cleared the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Some accounts say Anís was killed on the first volley; one says that the Báb was dispatched by a sword. See Firuz Kazemzadeh, Kazem Kazemzadeh, and Howard Garey, &quot;The Báb: Accounts of His Martyrdom&quot;, in ''World Order'', vol. 8, no. 1 (Fall, 1973), 32. All accounts, even the Muslim ones, concur that the Báb survived the first volley.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. But the soldiers subsequently found the Báb in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his [[Letters of the Living#Siyyid H.CC.A3usayn Yazd.C3.AD|secretary]]. He and Anís were tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad of Muslim soldiers was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; In the [[Bábí]]–[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] tradition, the failure of the first firing squad to kill the Báb is believed to have been a miracle. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals. 

The remains, however, were clandestinely rescued by a handful of Bábis and were hidden. Over time the remains were secretly transported by way of Isfahan, Kirmanshah, [[Baghdad]] and [[Damascus]], to [[Beirut]] and thence by sea to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on the plain below [[Mount Carmel]] in 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;gpb_18&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Effendi |last=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-19.html | pages=273–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1909, the remains were then interred in a special [[Shrine of the Báb|tomb]], erected for this purpose by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], on Mount Carmel in [[Haifa]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian D.

== Succession ==
{{main|Bahá'í/Bábí split}}
[[File:Bahai center Haifa 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shrine of the Báb]]]]
In most of his prominent writings, The Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as ''man yazhiruhu'lláh'', &quot;[[He whom God shall make manifest|Him Whom God shall make manifest]]&quot;, and that he himself was &quot;but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest.&quot; Within 20 years of the Báb's death, over 25 people claimed to be the Promised One, most significantly [[Bahá'u'lláh]].

Before the Báb's death, he sent a letter to Mírzá Yahyá, titled [[Subh-i-Azal]], which is considered to be his will and testament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol7/BABWILL.htm Last will and testament]&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is recognized as appointing Subh-i-Azal to be the leader of the Bábí community after the death of the Báb. He is also ordered to obey the Promised One when he appears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuchehri (2004)&quot;&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol7/BABWILL.htm Manuchehri (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Subh-i-Azal was still a teenager, had never demonstrated leadership in the Bábí movement, and was still living in the house of his older brother, Bahá'u'lláh. All of this lends credence to the Bahá'í claim that the Báb appointed Subh-i-Azal the head of the Bábí Faith so as to divert attention away from Bahá'u'lláh, while allowing Bábís to visit Bahá'u'lláh and consult with him freely, and allowing Bahá'u'lláh to write to Bábís easily and freely. Furthermore, there is a long history in Shí`ism of hidden leaders, with their deputies wielding the true power (the four bábs themselves are the first examples of this, as is `Alí-Muhammad's choice of the title &quot;the Báb&quot;).

Bahá'u'lláh claimed that in 1852, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a &quot;[[Maid of Heaven]]&quot;, which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. Ten years later in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration and eventually was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as &quot;He Whom God shall make manifest&quot;. His followers began calling themselves [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief Biography of Baha'u'llah | last = Cole| first = Juan| accessdate=June 22, 2006 | url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subh-i-Azal continued to live with or close to Bahá'u'lláh throughout the latter's exiles from Iran to Baghdad and then to Istanbul and Edirne, even though Bahá'u'lláh's claim to be a Manifestation of God in 1863 theoretically rendered moot Subh-i-Azal's authority as the head of the Bábí community. In September 1867, in Edirne, the rival claims to authority came to a head. Subh-i-Azal challenged Bahá'u'lláh to a test of the divine will in a local mosque in [[Edirne]] (Adrianople), such that &quot;God would strike down the impostor&quot;. Bahá'u'lláh agreed and went to the Sultan Selim Mosque at the appointed time, but Mirza Yahya failed to show up.&lt;ref name = &quot;Browne (1918) p. 18 &amp; Salmání (1982) pp. 94-95&quot;&gt;Browne (1918) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm p. 18.] &amp; Salmání (1982) [http://bahai-library.com/salmani_memories_bahaullah pp. 94–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subh-i-Azal's followers became known as [[Azali]]s or Azali Bábís. For the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh, Subh-i-Azal remained their leader until his death in 1912. Whether or not he had a successor is disputed. Bahá'í sources report that 11 of the 18 &quot;witnesses&quot; appointed by Subh-i-Azal to oversee the Bábí community became Bahá'ís, as well as his son. The man allegedly appointed by Subh-i-Azal to succeed him, Hadíy-i-Dawlat-Abádí, later publicly recanted his faith in the Báb and Subh-i-Azal.&lt;ref name = &quot;GPB, p. 233 &amp; Momen (1991)&quot;&gt;Shoghi Effendi (1944) [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-7.html#pg233 p. 233] &amp; Momen (1991) [http://bahai-library.com/momen_cyprus_exiles pp. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Bahá'u'llah emerged more successful and nearly all of the Báb's followers abandoned Subh-i-Azal and became Bahá'ís. Today Bahá'ís have several million followers, while estimates of the number of Azalís are generally around one thousand, isolated in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Azali | publisher = Britannica Concise | url = http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264 | accessdate =October 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings ==
{{main|Teachings of the Báb}}
The Báb's teachings can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the [[Qur'an]] and other [[Hadith|Islamic traditions]]. While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to philosophical elucidation and finally to [[legislation|legislative]] pronouncements. In the second philosophical stage, the Báb gives an explanation of the [[metaphysics]] of being and creation, and in the third legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly united.&lt;ref name=&quot;saiedi27&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Gate of the Heart | first = Nader | last = Saiedi | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, ON | pages = 27–28 | isbn = 978-1-55458-035-4 | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the Báb's writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;saiedi49&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Gate of the Heart | first = Nader | last = Saiedi | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, ON | pages = 49 | isbn = 978-1-55458-035-4 | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
{{wikiquote}}

Most of the writings of the Báb have been lost. The Báb himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur'an, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nabíl-i-Zarandí, in ''The Dawn-breakers'', mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur'an, revealed during the Báb's imprisonment at Máh-Kú, which have been lost without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;Denis MacEoin, ''The Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'' (Leiden: Brill, 1992), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as already noted, is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the Báb's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most works were revealed in response to specific questions by Bábís. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts as far back as the [[Apostle Paul]]. Three quarters of the chapters of the [[New Testament]] are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them.&lt;ref&gt;On letters as a medium of composition of the New Testament, see Norman Perrin, ''The New Testament: An Introduction, Proclamation and Parenesis, Myth and History'' (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, 1974), 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the Báb revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and eye-witnesses.

The Archives Department at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] currently holds about 190 [[Tablet (religious)|Tablets]] of the Báb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Unpublished letter from the Universal House of Justice |title = Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings Texts |url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings |accessdate =December 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from several principal works have been published in the only English-language compilation of the Báb's writings: ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb]]''. Denis MacEoin, in his ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the Báb revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qur'an, and many ''khutbihs'' or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in compilations.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 15–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Báb has been criticized for his inconsistent use of correct and incorrect [[Arabic grammar]] in his religious works, though in his Arabic letters made very few mistakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author = William McCants |title = Arabic Grammar of the Bab, The |url = http://bahai-library.com/mccants_arabic_grammar_bab |accessdate =March 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for this inconsistency could be to distinguish those who could not see past the outer form of the words from those that could understand the deeper meaning of his message.&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Todd Lawson |title = Qur'an Commentary of Sayyid 'Alí Muhammad, the Báb, The (Doctoral dissertation) |url = http://bahai-library.com/lawson_quran_commentary_bab |accessdate =March 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings before his declaration===
[[File:Selectionfromthebab.jpg|right|120px|]]
&lt;!-- The Báb's writings before his declaration do not demonstrate a prophetic consciousness. --&gt;
Todd Lawson noted this in his doctoral dissertation about the ''Tafsír-i-súrih-i-baqarih'' or &quot;Commentary on the Surih of the Cow&quot;, a work the Báb wrote on a chapter of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;B. Todd Lawson, ''The Qur'an Commentary of Sayyid `Alî Muḥammad, the Bab'', PhD diss, Institute of Islamic Studies, McGill Univ., Montreal, 1987, 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt; This Qur'an commentary was started by the Báb in November or December 1843, some six months before declaring his mission. The first half was completed by February or March 1844; the second half was revealed after the Báb's declaration. It is the only work of the Báb's revealed before his declaration that has survived intact. It also sheds light on the Báb's attitude toward Shí`í beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife also refers to important episodes before his declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Momen | first = Moojan | title =Messianic Concealment and Theophanic Disclosure | journal =Online Journal of Bahá’í Studies | volume =1 | pages =71–88 | publisher = | location = | year =2007 | url =http://oj.bahaistudies.net/OJBS_1_Momen_Messianic_Concealment.pdf | issn =1177-8547 | accessdate = 4–6–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiraz, May – September 1844===

*The first chapter of the ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|Qayyúmu'l-Asmá']]'' (&quot;Commentary on the Súrih of Joseph&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;listofwritings&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land, Ed | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#13 | title = ''Bahá'í Faith, The: 1844–1963'' | pages = 13 | accessdate =July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written by the Báb on the evening of his declaration to Mullá Husayn, May 23, 1844. The entire work, which is several hundred pages in length and is considered to be revelation by Bahá'ís, required forty days to write; it is one of the Báb's longer Arabic works. It was widely distributed in the first year of the Bábí movement, functioning as something of a Qur'an or Bible for the Bábís. In the book the Báb states his claim to be a [[Manifestation of God]], though the claim is disguised with other statements that he is the servant of the Hidden Imám.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Táhirih]] translated the work into Persian.

*''Sahífih-yi-makhzúnih'', revealed before his departure for Mecca in September 1844, and consists of a collection of fourteen prayers, mostly to be recited on specific Muslim Holy Days and festivals. Its content remained within the expectations of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilgrimage, September 1844 – June 1845===

During his nine and a half month pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], the Báb composed many works:

*''Khasá'il-i-sab`ih'': A work composed by the Báb on his sea journey back to [[Bushehr]] after his pilgrimage, which listed some regulations to be followed by the Bábí community. A copy of the manuscript probably still exists in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Kitáb-i-Rúḥ'' (&quot;Book of the Spirit&quot;): This book contains 700 or 900 verses and was written while the Báb was sailing back to Bushehr from pilgrimage. The original was nearly destroyed when the Báb was arrested. Several manuscript copies are extant.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Sahífih baynu'l-haramayn'' (&quot;Treatise Between the Two Sanctuaries&quot;): This Arabic work was written while the Báb traveled from Mecca to Medina in early 1845 and is in response to questions posed to him by a prominent Shaykhí leader.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Kitáb-i-Fihrist'' (&quot;The Book of the Catalogue&quot;): A list of the Báb's works, composed by the Báb himself after he returned from pilgrimage to Mecca, June 21, 1845. It is a bibliography of his earliest writings.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bushehr and Shiraz, March 1845 – September 1846===

The Báb was in Bushehr March through June 1845, then in Shiraz.

*''Sahífih-yi-Ja`fariyyih'': The Báb wrote this treatise to an unknown correspondent in 1845. Over a hundred pages in length, it states many of his basic teachings, especially in relation to some [[Shaykhi]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Tafsír-i-Súrih-i-Kawthar'' (&quot;Commentary on the Chapter on Abundance&quot;): The Báb wrote this commentary for Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí Vahíd while he was in Shiraz; it is the most important work revealed during the Shiraz period. Though the súrih is only three verses in length, being the shortest in the Qur'an, the commentary on it is over two hundred pages in length. The work was widely distributed, and at least a dozen early manuscripts are extant.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 71; Nabíl-i-Zarandí, ''The Dawn-breakers'', 174-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isfahan, September 1846 – March 1847===

*''Nubuvvih khásish'': This work, of fifty pages' length, was revealed in two hours in response to a question by Manúchihr Khán. It discusses the ''special prophethood'' of Muhammad, an important subject discussed in debates between Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 76–77; Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 257; Nabíl-i-Zarandí, ''The Dawn-breakers'', 202-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Tafsír-i-Súrih-i-va'l-`asr'' (Commentary on the Chapter named &quot;Age&quot;): This is one of the two important works the Báb penned in Isfahan. It was written spontaneously and publicly in response to a request by Mír Sayyid Muḥammad, the chief cleric of the city; much of it was written in one evening, to the astonishment to those present.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Máh-Kú, late summer 1847 – May 1848===

The Báb left [[Isfahan|Isfahán]] in March 1847, sojourned outside Tehran several months, then was sent to a fortress at [[Maku, Iran|Máh-Kú]], close to the Turkish border. It witnessed the composition of some of the Báb's most important works.

*''[[Persian Bayán]]'': This is undoubtedly the most important work of the Báb and contains the mature summary of his teachings. It was composed in Máh-Kú in late 1847 or early 1848. The work consists of nine chapters titled váhids or &quot;unities&quot;, which in turn are usually subdivided into nineteen bábs or &quot;gates&quot;; the one exception is the last unity, which has only ten bábs. The Báb explained that it would be the task of &quot;He Whom God shall make manifest&quot; to complete the work; Bahá'ís believe Bahá'u'lláh's ''[[Kitáb-i-Iqán]]'' to be the completion of the Bayán. Each unity begins with an Arabic summary of its contents, which makes it easier to read than many of the Báb's works. Extracts of this work are published in ''Selections from the Writings of the Báb''; A. L. M. Nicholas translated the entire work into French in four 150-page volumes.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Arabic Bayán]]'': This is the shorter and less important of the two Bayáns. It consists of eleven váhids or &quot;unities&quot;, each with nineteen bábs or &quot;gates&quot;. It offers a succinct summary of the Báb's teachings and laws. It was composed at Máh-Kú in late 1847 or early 1848.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih (The Seven Proofs)|Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih]]'' (&quot;Seven Proofs&quot;): There are two works by this name, the longer one in Persian, the shorter one in Arabic; both were composed in Máh-Kú in late 1847 or early 1848. Nicholas called the Persian Seven Proofs &quot;the most important of the polemical works that issued from the pen of Sayyid `Alí Muhammad&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written to either a non-Bábí or to a follower whose faith had been shaken, but the recipient's identity is unknown.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Arabic text summarizes the seven proofs found in the Persian text.

===&lt;u&gt;Ch&lt;/u&gt;ihríq, May 1848 – July 1850===

The Báb spent two years in Chihríq, except for his brief visit to [[Tabriz]] for his trial. The works he produced there were more esoteric or mystical and less thematically organized.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 88–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Two major books were produced, in addition to many minor works:

*''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Kitáb-i-Asmá' (The Book of Names)|Kitáb-i-Asmá']]'' (&quot;The Book of Names&quot;): This is an extremely long book about the names of God. It was penned during the Báb's last days at Chihríq, before his execution. The various manuscript copies contain numerous variations in the text; the book will require considerable work to reconstruct its original text.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Kitáb-i-panj sha'n'' (&quot;Book of Five Grades&quot;): Having been composed in March and April 1850, this is one of the Báb's last works. The book consists of eighty-five sections arranged in seventeen groups, each under the heading of a different name of God. Within each group are five &quot;grades&quot;, that is, five different sorts of sections: verses, prayers, homilies, commentaries, and Persian language pieces. Each group was sent to a different person and was composed on a different day. Thus the work is a kind of miscellany of unrelated material. Some of the sections represent further exposition of basic themes in the Báb's teachings; others consists of lengthy iterations of the names of God, and variations on their roots.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt;
