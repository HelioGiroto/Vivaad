'''Mysticism''' ({{Audio|En-uk-mysticism.ogg|pronunciation}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μυστικός}}, ''[[Wikt:μυστικός|mystikos]]'', meaning 'an initiate') is the knowledge of, and especially the personal experience of, [[level of consciousness (esotericism)|states of consciousness]], or [[plane of reality|levels of being]], or aspects of reality, beyond normal human perception, sometimes including experience of and communion with a [[supreme being]].

==Classical origins==

A &quot;mystikos&quot; was an initiate of a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]. The [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], (Greek: [[Wikt:Ἐλευσίς|Ἐλευσίνια]] [[Wikt:Μυστήρια|Μυστήρια]]) were annual initiation ceremonies in the cults of the goddesses [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]], held in secret at Eleusis (near [[Athens]]) in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerényi, Karoly, &quot;Kore,&quot; in C.G. Jung and C. Kerényi, ''Essays on a Science of Mythology: The Myth of the Divine Child and the Mysteries of Eleusis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963: pages 101-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The mysteries began in about 1600 B.C. in the [[Mycenean]] period and continued for two thousand years, becoming a major festival during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] era, and later spreading to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea, A History of Religious Ideas: From the Stone Age to the Eleusinian Mysteries. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern understanding==

The present meaning of the term ''mysticism'' arose via [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]&amp;mdash;which referred to the Eleusinian initiation as a [[metaphor]] for the &quot;initiation&quot; to spiritual truths and experiences&amp;mdash;and is the pursuit of [[wikt:communion|communion]] with, identity with, or [[awareness|conscious awareness]] of an [[Absolute (philosophy)|ultimate reality]], [[divinity]], [[Spirituality|spiritual truth]], or [[God]] through direct experience, intuition, instinct or insight. Mysticism usually centers on practices intended to nurture those [[experiences]]. Mysticism may be [[dualism|dualistic]], maintaining a distinction between [[self|the self]] and the divine, or may be [[nondualism|nondualistic]].&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Cobb. Mysticism and the Creed. BiblioBazaar, 2009. ISBN 978-1-113-20937-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Many if not all of the world's great religions have arisen around the teachings of mystics (including Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tze, and Krishna); and most religious traditions describe fundamental mystical experience, at least esoterically. ''[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]]'' or ''Illumination''  are generic English terms for the phenomenon, derived from the Latin ''[[Wikt:illuminatio|illuminatio]]'' (applied to Christian [[prayer]] in the 15th century) and adopted in English translations of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, but used loosely to describe the state of mystical attainment regardless of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Underhill. Practical Mysticism. Wilder Publications, new edition 2008. ISBN 978-1-60459-508-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional [[religion]]s, by definition, have strong institutional structures, including formal [[hierarchies]] and mandated [[sacred text]]s and/or [[creed]]s. Adherents of the faith are expected to respect or follow these closely, so mysticism is often deprecated or persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;David Steindl-Rast. The Mystical Core of Organized Religion. ReVision, Summer 1989. 12 (1):11-14. [http://csp.org/experience/docs/steindl-mystical.html Council on Spiritual Practices] Retrieved 29 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary forms used by spiritual teachers==

Since, by definition, mystical knowledge cannot be directly written down or spoken of (but must be experienced), numerous literary forms that allude to such knowledge - often with contradictions or even jokes - have developed, for example:

=== Aphorisms, poetry ===
[[Aphorisms]] and poetry include artistic efforts to crystallize some particular description or aspect of the [[mystical experience]] in words:
:* ''God is Love'' (Christian and Sufi in particular)
:* ''Atman is Brahman'', ''[[neti neti]]'', &quot;Neither This nor That&quot; (Advaitan)
:* ''God and me, me and God, are One'' ([[Kundalini Yoga]], Sikhism)
:* Zen [[haiku]]
:* ''Ana'l Haqq'', &quot;I am The Truth&quot;, [[Mansur al-Hallaj]]. [[Rumi]]'s love poems&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/i/ebooks/pdf/mewlana_jalaluddin_rumi_2004_9.pdf Jalaluddin Rumi: Poems]&lt;/ref&gt; (Sufism)

=== Koans, riddles, contradictions ===
Zen [[koans]], riddles, and metaphysical contradictions are intentionally irresolvable tasks or lines of thought, designed to direct one away from intellectualism and effort towards direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;Koun Yamada. The Gateless Gate: The Classic Book of Zen Koans. Wisdom Publications. New edition, 2005. ISBN 978-0-86171-382-0&lt;/ref&gt;

:* &quot;What is the sound of one hand (clapping)?&quot; (Zen)
:* &quot;[[How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?]]&quot; (Christian).

These can be meant as humorous phrases (see humour, below); or as serious questions with significant mystical answers. Others believe that the most edifying understanding of these riddles is that excessive effort contemplating the impossible can give an individual the opportunity to stop trying to 'achieve' and start just 'being'.

:* The evocative Taoist phrase&amp;mdash;''To yield is to be preserved whole, to be bent is to become straight, to be empty is to be full, to have little is to possess''&lt;ref&gt;Tao Te Ching. LinYutan version. Chapter 22, sentence 1. For other versions see ''[http://wayist.org/ttc%20compared/chap22.htm TTC Compared]''&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash;is another example of a metaphysical contradiction describing the path of emptying the learned self.

=== Jokes ===

Jokes and humorous stories can be used in spiritual teaching to make simple yet profound metaphysical points:

:* Some examples are the [[Nasreddin]] tales,&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sufism/Nasrudin Nasruddin stories]&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. someone shouts at Nasreddin sitting on a river bank, &quot;How do I get across?&quot; &quot;You are across.&quot; he replies;

:* [[Bektashi]] jokes&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.bektashi.net/beliefs-jokes1.html Bektashi jokes]&lt;/ref&gt; within  [[Sufi]] Islam;

:* the Trickster or Animal Spirit stories passed down in Native American, Australian Aboriginal, and African Tribal folklore, and &quot;[[Br'er Rabbit]] and the Tar Baby&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanfolklore.net/folklore/2010/07/brer_rabbit_meets_a_tar_baby.html Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby] retold by S.E. Schlosser as 'A Georgia Folktale'. Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stories, parables, metaphors ===
[[Parable]]s and [[metaphor]] include stories that have a deeper meaning to them: 

:* Jesus makes use of parables and metaphors when teaching his followers. See [[Parables of Jesus]].

Some passages seem to be aphorisms, riddles and parables all at once. For instance, [[Yunus Emre]]'s famous passage:

:I climbed into the plum tree
:and ate the grapes I found there.
:The owner of the garden called to me,
:&quot;Why are you eating my walnuts?&quot;

== Induction of mystical experiences ==
[[File:Falun Dafa fifth meditation exercise.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Meditation]]]]
[[File:Whirlingdervishes.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Sufi whirling]]]]

Various religious texts prescribe meditative practices in order to achieve the state of consciousness which is typical of religious experience. Texts of [[Yoga]] and [[Tantra]] mention specific physical, nutritive, ethical, and meditative methods in order to achieve specific kinds of experiences.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The traditions of Mantra Marga (literally, &quot;the way of formulae&quot;) in particular stress the importance of saying, either aloud or to oneself internally, particular [[Mantra]]s (phrases to be repeated) given by their teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Daniélou, Alain: Yoga, methods of re-integration&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with this is the set of practices related to [[Yantras]] (symbols to be meditated on). Various other ways not specific of any religion include:

* [[Near-death experience]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Moody|Moody, Raymond]]. ''Life After Life'' ISBN 0-06-251739-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perennial philosophy ==

The centuries-old idea of a [[perennial philosophy]], popularized by [[Aldous Huxley]] in his 1945 book: ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', states one view of what mysticism is all about:

&lt;blockquote&gt; [W]ith the one, divine reality substantial to the manifold world of things and lives and minds. But the nature of this one reality is such that it cannot be directly or immediately apprehended except by those who have chosen to fulfill certain conditions, making themselves loving, pure in heart, and poor in spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Aldous|last=Huxley|title=The Perennial Philosophy|publisher=Perennial|year=1945|isbn=0-06-057058-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Natural and religious mysticism ==
[[R. C. Zaehner]] has identified two distinctively different mystical experiences: natural and religious mystical experiences, this being the overarching thesis of his book ''Mysticism Sacred and Profane''.&lt;ref&gt;Zaehner, R. C. ''Mysticism Sacred and Profane'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Natural mystical experiences are, for example, experiences of the 'deeper self' or experiences of oneness with nature. Zaehner argues that the experiences typical of 'natural mysticism' are quite different from the experiences typical of religious mysticism. In this, Zaehner is directly opposing the views [[Aldous Huxley]] put forward in ''The Perennial Philosophy'' according to which the mystical experiences in all religions are essentially the same. Natural mystical experiences are in Zaehner's view of less value because they do not lead as directly to the virtues of charity and compassion. Zaehner is generally critical of what he sees as narcissistic tendencies in nature mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Chapters 3,4, and 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== The unknowable ==

According to [[Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;schopenhauer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung|volume=2|year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt; mystics arrive at a condition in which there is no knowing subject and known object:

{{Quotation|... we see all religions at their highest point end in mysticism and mysteries, that is to say, in darkness and veiled obscurity. These really indicate merely a blank spot for knowledge, the point where all knowledge necessarily ceases. Hence for thought this can be expressed only by negations, but for sense-perception it is indicated by symbolical signs, in temples by dim light and silence, in [[Brahminical Hinduism#Practices|Brahmanism]] even by the required suspension of all thought and perception for the purpose of entering into the deepest communion with one's own self, by mentally uttering the mysterious ''[[Om]]''. In the widest sense, mysticism is every guidance to the immediate awareness of what is not reached by either perception or conception, or generally by any knowledge. The mystic is opposed to the philosopher by the fact that he begins from within, whereas the philosopher begins from without. The mystic starts from his inner, positive, individual experience, in which he finds himself as the eternal and only being, and so on. But nothing of this is communicable except the assertions that we have to accept on his word; consequently he is unable to convince.|[[Schopenhauer]], ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVIII}}

==Skepticism==
In ''[[The Emotion Machine]]'', [[Marvin Minsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Minksy, M: ''The Emotion Machine'', Chapter 3, ''Being in Pain''&lt;/ref&gt; argues that mystical experiences only ''seem'' profound and persuasive because the mind's critical faculties are relatively inactive during them:-

{{quote|'Meditator: It suddenly seemed as if I was surrounded by an immensely powerful Presence. I felt that a Truth had been &quot;revealed&quot; to me that was far more important than anything else, and for which I needed no further evidence. But when later I tried to describe this to my friends, I found that I had nothing to say except how wonderful that experience was.

This peculiar type of mental state is sometimes called a &quot;Mystical Experience&quot; or &quot;Rapture,&quot; &quot;Ecstasy,&quot; or &quot;Bliss.&quot; Some who undergo it call it &quot;wonderful,&quot; but a better word might be &quot;wonderless,&quot; because I suspect that such a state of mind may result from turning so many Critics off that one cannot find any flaws in it.

What might that &quot;powerful Presence&quot; represent? It is sometimes seen as a deity, but I suspect that it is likely to be a version of some early Imprimer that for years has been hiding inside your mind. In any case, such experiences can be dangerous—for some victims find them so compelling that they devote the rest of their lives to trying to get themselves back to that state again.'}}

Minsky's idea of 'some early Imprimer hiding in the mind' was an echo of Freud's belief that mystical experience was essentially infantile and regressive, i.e., a memory of 'Oneness' with the mother. Others (such as Ken Wilber) countered with the position that Freud had erred by confusing pre-ego states with trans-ego states, although such arguments hinge on the veracity of alleged trans-ego states.
