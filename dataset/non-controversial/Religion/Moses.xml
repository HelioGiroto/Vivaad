'''Moses''' ({{lang-he|מֹשֶׁה}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Modern Hebrew|Modern]]&lt;/small&gt; ''{{transl|he|Moshe}}'' &lt;small&gt;[[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]]&lt;/small&gt; ''{{transl|he|Mōšéh}}'' &lt;small&gt;[[ISO 259-3]]&lt;/small&gt; ''{{transl|he|Moše&amp;#x202f;}}''; {{lang-ar|موسى}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Mūsā&amp;#x202f;}}'') was, according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Qur'an]], a religious leader, lawgiver and [[prophet]], to whom the [[Mosaic authorship|authorship]] of the [[Torah]] is traditionally attributed. Also called ''Moshe Rabbenu'' in Hebrew ({{lang|he|מֹשֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ}}, ''[[Literal translation|Lit.]]'' &quot;Moses our Teacher/Rabbi&quot;), he is the most important prophet in [[Judaism]],&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|34:10|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Maimonedes#The 13 principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], 7th principle&lt;/ref&gt; and is also considered an important prophet in [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], as well as a number of [[Abrahamic religions#Other Abrahamic religions|other faiths]]. 

The existence of Moses as well as the veracity of the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] story is disputed amongst [[Archaeology|archaeologists]]  and [[Egyptologist]]s, with experts in the field of [[biblical criticism]] citing logical inconsistencies, new archaeological evidence, historical evidence, and related [[Myth of origins|origin myths]] in [[Canaan]]ite culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5036.html |title=Princeton University Press Press Reviews, retrieved 6th June 2009 |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Quest for the Historical Israel: Debating Archeology and the History of Early Israel'', 2007, Society of Biblical Literature, Atlanta, ISBN 978-1-58983-277-0.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Van Seters, &quot;The life of Moses&quot;, ISBN 90-390-0112-X&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians maintain that the biographical details, and Egyptian background, attributed to Moses imply the existence of a historical political and religious leader who was involved in the consolidation of the [[Tribes of Israel|Hebrew]] tribes in [[Canaan]] towards the end of the [[Bronze Age]].

According to the [[Book of Exodus]], Moses was born in a time when his people, the [[Children of Israel]], were increasing in number and the  [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Egyptian Pharaoh]] was worried that they might help Egypt's enemies. Moses' Hebrew mother, [[Jochebed]],  hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed, and the child was adopted as a [[Child abandonment|foundling]] by the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slave-master, Moses fled across the [[Red Sea]] to [[Midian]] where he encountered the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] in the form of a &quot;[[burning bush]]&quot;. God sent Moses to request the release of the Israelites. After the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues]], Moses led [[the Exodus]] of the Israelites out of Egypt and [[Crossing the Red Sea|across the Red Sea]], after which they based themselves at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where Moses received the [[Ten Commandments]]. After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died within sight of the [[Promised Land]].

[[Rabbinical Judaism]] calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391&amp;ndash;1271 BCE;&lt;ref&gt;[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]{{full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian tradition has tended to assume an earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]]'s ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' (4th century) gives 1592 for the birth of Moses, the 17th-century [[Ussher chronology]] calculates 1619 BC (''Annals of the World'', 1658)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:Moses041.jpg|thumb|230px|Moses and the tablets of law]]
The biblical text explains the name Mošeh משה as a derivation of the [[triliteral|root]] ''mšh'' משה &quot;to draw&quot;, in  {{bibleverse||Exodus|2:10|KJV|}}:
:&quot;[...] she called his name Moses (משה): and she said, Because I drew him (משיתהו) out of the water.&quot; ([[KJV]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;World Publishing&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last = |first = |authorlink =  |coauthors = |title = New World Dictionary-Concordance to the New American Bible |publisher = World Publishing |year = 1970 |location = |page =461 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-529-04540-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is thus suggested to relate to ''drawing out'' in a passive sense, &quot;the one who was drawn out&quot;. Those who depart from this tradition derive the name from the same root but in an active sense, &quot;he who draws out&quot;, in the sense of  &quot;[[Soter|saviour]], deliverer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;HAW Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the name as recorded in the [[Masoretic text]] is indeed the expected form of the Biblical Hebrew active participle.&lt;ref&gt;Lambdin, T.O., ''Intro. to Biblical Hebrew''. NY:Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971. pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] argued for an  [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] etymology, and some scholarly suggestions have followed this in deriving the name from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] terms ''mo'' &quot;water&quot; and ''`uses''  &quot;save, deliver&quot;, suggesting a meaning &quot;saved from the water&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gesenius' Lexicon]] (1906), s.v. מֹשֶׁה ; Gesenius was sympathetic towards the Coptic etymology. So also Jones' Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggestion has connected the name with the Egyptian ''ms'', as found in Tuth-mose and Ra-messes, meaning &quot;born&quot; or &quot;child&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Publishing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;So  BDB Theological Dictionary and
HAW Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament; see {{cite web|url=http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Moses.html|title=Meaning, origin and etymology of the name Moses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:MosesRescued FromTheNile.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Moses rescued from the Nile, 1638, by [[Nicolas Poussin]]]]

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the narratives of Moses are in Exodus, [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. According to the Book of Exodus, Moses was a son of [[Amram]], a member of the [[Levite]] tribe of [[Children of Israel|Israel]] descended from [[Jacob]], and his wife, [[Jochebed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Illustrated Bible Dictionary|last=Easton|first= Matthew George |authorlink=Matthew George Easton|year=1897 |publisher= T. Nelson|location=London ; New York|id=&quot;Moses&quot; |isbn=1-157-58258-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jochebed (also Yocheved) was kin to Amram's father [[Kohath|Kehath]] (Exodus 6:20). Moses had one older (by seven years) sister, [[Miriam]], and one older (by three years) brother, [[Aaron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; According to Genesis 46:11, Amram's father Kehath immigrated to Egypt with 70 of Jacob's household, making Moses part of the second generation of Israelites born during their time in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|46||HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Exodus account, the birth of Moses occurred at a time when an unnamed Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] had commanded that all male Hebrew children born be killed by drowning in the river [[Nile]].  Jochebed, the wife of the Levite Amram, bore a son and kept him concealed for three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;j4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=830&amp;letter=M&amp;search=moses#0|title=Biblical data on Moses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|title=Moses|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she could keep him hidden no longer, rather than deliver him to be killed, she set him adrift on the Nile River in a small craft of bulrushes coated in pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;j4&quot;/&gt; Moses' sister [[Miriam]] observed the progress of the tiny boat until it reached a place where Pharaoh's daughter ([[Bithiah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; Thermuthis &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nalanda.nitc.ac.in/resources/english/etext-project/history/antiqjews/book-2chapter9.html|title=Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, Chapter 9, Paragraph 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was bathing with her handmaidens. It is said that she spotted the baby in the basket and had her handmaiden fetch it for her. Miriam came forward and asked Pharaoh's daughter if she would like a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; Thereafter, Jochebed was employed as the child's nurse.  He grew up and was brought to Pharaoh's daughter and became her son and a younger brother to the future Pharaoh of Egypt. Moses would not be able to become Pharaoh because he was not the 'blood' son of Bithiah, and he was the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=61|title=Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, Chapter 8, Paragraph 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2008}}

===Shepherd in Midian===
After Moses had reached adulthood, he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. Moses killed the Egyptian and buried his body in the sand.&lt;ref name=&quot;j4&quot;/&gt; Moses soon discovered that the affair was known, and that Pharaoh was likely to put him to death for it; he then fled from Egypt across the [[Sinai Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;j4&quot;/&gt; In [[Midian]] he stopped at a well where he protected seven shepherdesses from a band of rude shepherds. The shepherdesses' father [[Hobab]] adopted him as his son. Hobab gave his daughter [[Zipporah]] to Moses in marriage, and made him the superintendent of his herds.&lt;ref name=&quot;j4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=63|title=Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, Chapter 11, Paragraph 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No further mention is made of Moses' first wife Tharbis in either Exodus or Flavius Josephus except in the case where Aaron and Miriam taunted Moses about it.&lt;/ref&gt; Moses lived in Midian for forty years as a shepherd, during which time his son [[Gershom]] was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;j4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%202:16-22;&amp;version=9;|title=Exodus 2:16–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One day, Moses led his flock to [[Mount Horeb]] ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|3|HE}}), usually identified with [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]&amp;nbsp;— a mountain that was thought in the [[Middle Ages]] to be located on the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. There he saw a [[burning bush|bush that burned, but was not consumed]]. When Moses came to look more closely, [[God]] spoke to him from the bush, revealing [[I Am that I Am|his name]] to Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;j4&quot;/&gt;

God commanded Moses to go to Egypt and deliver his fellow Hebrews from bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%204:2-9;&amp;version=9;|title=Exodus 4:2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the way Moses was nearly killed by God because his son was not [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]]. He was met on the way by his elder brother, Aaron, and gained a hearing with his oppressed kindred after they returned to Egypt, who believed Moses and Aaron after they saw the signs that were performed in the midst of the Israelite assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%204:20-31;&amp;version=9;|title=Exodus 4:20–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him that the Lord God of Israel wanted Pharaoh to permit the Israelites to celebrate a feast in the wilderness. Pharaoh replied that he did not know their God and would not permit them to go. They gained a second hearing with Pharaoh and changed Moses' rod into a serpent, but Pharaoh's magicians did the same with their rods.  Moses and Aaron met Pharaoh at the Nile riverbank, and Moses had Aaron turn the river to blood, but Pharaoh's magicians could do the same. Moses obtained a fourth meeting, and had Aaron bring frogs from the Nile to overrun Egypt, but Pharaoh's magicians were able to do the same thing. Pharaoh asked Moses to remove the frogs and promised to let the Israelites go observe their feast in the wilderness in return. Pharaoh decided against letting the Israelites leave to observe the feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%208:13-15;&amp;version=9;|title=Exodus 8:13-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Pharaoh let the Hebrews depart after Moses' God sent [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] upon the Egyptians. The third and fourth were the plague of [[gnat]]s and [[Fly|flies]]. The fifth was diseases on the Egyptians' cattle, oxen, goats, sheep, camels, and horses. The sixth was boils on the skins of Egyptians. Seventh, fiery [[hail]] and [[thunder]]. The eighth plague was [[locust]]s. The ninth plague was total darkness. The tenth plague was the slaying of the Egyptian male first-born children, whereupon such terror seized the Egyptians that they ordered the Hebrews to leave. The events are commemorated as [[Passover]], referring to how the plague &quot;passed over&quot; the houses of the Israelites while smiting the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm|title=Judaism 101: Pesach; Passover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The crossing of the Red Sea===
{{Main|The Exodus}}
Moses then led his people eastward, beginning the long journey to [[Canaan]]. The procession moved slowly, and found it necessary to encamp three times before passing the Egyptian frontier&amp;nbsp;— some believe at the [[Great Bitter Lake]], while others propose sites as far south as the northern tip of the [[Red Sea]]. Meanwhile, Pharaoh had a change of heart, and was in pursuit of them with a large army. Shut in between this army and the sea, the Israelites despaired, but Exodus records that God [[Crossing the Red Sea|divided the waters]] so that they passed safely across on dry ground. There is some contention about this passage, since an earlier incorrect translation of ''[[Yam Suph]]'' to Red Sea was later found to have meant [[Reed Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cresourcei.org/yamsuph.html |title=The Yam Suph: &quot;Red Sea&quot; or &quot;Sea of Reeds&quot; |publisher=Cresourcei.org |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Egyptian army attempted to follow, God permitted the waters to return upon them and drown them.

The people then continued to Marsa marching for three days along the wilderness of the Shur &lt;ref&gt;Shore&lt;/ref&gt; without finding water. Then they came to Elim where twelve water springs and 70 Palm trees greeted them.&lt;ref&gt;Elim and Elat are plurals of the word El in Phoenician and again associated with Asherah worship. The words Elim and Elat refer to the power of the high and mighty terebinth trees that the Phoenicians used for masts and Asherah poles. William Albright has associated Asherah groves with the incense trade spices and perfumes such as frankincense and myrrh.&lt;/ref&gt;
From [[Elim (Bible)|Elim]] they set out again and after 45 days they reached the wilderness of Sin between Elim and Sinai.

From there they reached the plain of [[Rephidim]], completing the crossing of the Red Sea.

===Mount Sinai and the Ten Commandments===
{{Main|Ten Commandments}}
According to the [[Bible]], after crossing the Red Sea and leading the [[Israelites]] towards the desert, Moses was summoned by God to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], also referred to as [[Mount Horeb]], the same place where Moses had first talked to the [[Burning Bush]], tended the flocks of [[Jethro]] his father-in-law, and later produced water by striking the rock with his [[Aaron's rod|staff]] and directed the battle with the [[Amalek]]ites.

Moses stayed on the mountain for 40 days and nights, a period in which he received the Ten Commandments directly from God. Moses then descended from the mountain with intent to deliver the commandments to the people, but upon his arrival he saw that the people were involved in the sin of the [[Golden Calf]]. In terrible anger, Moses broke the commandment [[Tablets of Stone|tablets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus||32:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered his own tribe (the [[Levites]]) to go through the camp and kill everyone, including family and friends,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus||32:27|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon which the Levites killed about 3,000 people, some of whom were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus||32:28|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; God later commanded Moses to inscribe two other tablets, to replace the ones Moses smashed,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus {{bibleverse-nb|Exodus||34:1|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|Exodus||34:27–28|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Moses went to the mountain again, for another period of 40 days and nights, and when he returned, the commandments were finally given.

In Jewish tradition, Moses is referred to as &quot;The Lawgiver&quot; for this singular achievement of delivering the Ten Commandments.

===The years in the wilderness===
[[File:KingFountainWashingtonParkAlbany.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A statue of Moses smiting the rock stands in [[Washington Park Historic District (Albany, New York)|Washington Park]], [[Albany, New York]].]]
When the people arrived at [[Marah (Bible)|Marah]], the water was bitter, causing the people to murmur against Moses. Moses cast a tree into the water, and the water became sweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2015:23-25;&amp;version=9;|title=Exodus 15:23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Chaim Dovid Green |title =Project Genesis:  Parshas B'Shalach&amp;nbsp;— Rough Beginnings | url=http://www.torah.org/learning/dvartorah/5761/beshalach.html  | accessdate = 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the journey the people began running low on supplies and again murmured against Moses and Aaron and said they would have preferred to die in Egypt, but God's provision of [[manna]] from the sky in the morning and quail in the evening took care of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2016;&amp;version=9;|title=Ex. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Eliyahu Hoffmann |title =Project Genesis:  Parshas Beshalach&amp;nbsp;— Man or Mon? | url=http://www.torah.org/learning/olas-shabbos/5766/beshalach.html | accessdate = 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the people camped in Rephidim, there was no water, so the people complained again and said, &quot;Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?&quot; Moses struck a rock with his staff, and water came forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2017:1-7;&amp;version=9;|title=Ex. 17:1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Pinchas Avruch |title =Project Genesis: Parshas Beshalach&amp;nbsp;— Never Forget| url=http://www.torah.org/learning/kolhakollel/5765/beshalach.html | accessdate = 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amalekites arrived and attacked the Israelites. In response, Moses bade [[Joshua]] lead the men to fight while he stood on a hill with the rod of God in his hand. As long as Moses held the rod up, Israel dominated the fighting, but if Moses let down his hands, the tide of the battle turned in favor of the [[Amalek]]ites. Because Moses was getting tired, Aaron and Hur had Moses sit on a rock. Aaron held up one arm, Hur held up the other arm, and the Israelites routed the Amalekites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2017:8-13;&amp;version=9;|title=Ex. 17:8–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Dovid Rosenfeld |title= Project Genesis: Pirkei Avos&amp;nbsp;– Exhilarating Fear |url= http://www.torah.org/learning/pirkei-avos/chapter6-65-8.html |accessdate= 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came to see Moses and brought Moses' wife and two sons with him. After Moses had told Jethro how the Israelites had escaped Egypt, Jethro went to offer sacrifices to the Lord, and then ate bread with the elders. The next day Jethro observed how Moses sat from morning to night giving judgement for the people. Jethro suggested that Moses appoint judges for lesser matters, a suggestion Moses heeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=2&amp;chapter=18&amp;version=9|title=Ex. 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Israelites]] came to Sinai, they pitched camp near the mountain. Moses commanded the people not to touch the mountain. Moses received the [[Ten Commandments]] orally (but not yet in tablet form) and other moral laws. He then went up with Aaron, [[Nadav and Avihu|Nadab, Abihu]], and seventy of the elders to see the god of Israel. Before Moses went up the mountain to receive the tablets, he told the elders to direct any questions that arose to Aaron or [[Hur (bible)|Hur]]. While Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving instruction on the laws for the Israelite community, the Israelites went to Aaron and asked him to make gods for them. After Aaron had received golden earrings from the people, he made a [[golden calf]] and said, &quot;These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.&quot; A &quot;solemnity of the Lord&quot; was proclaimed for the following day, which began in the morning with sacrifices and was followed by revelry.

After Moses had persuaded the Lord not to destroy the people of Israel, he went down from the mountain and was met by Joshua. Moses destroyed the calf and rebuked Aaron for the sin he had brought upon the people. Seeing that the people were uncontrollable, Moses went to the entry of the camp and said, &quot;Who is on the Lord's side? Let him come unto me.&quot; All the sons of [[Levi]] rallied around Moses, who ordered them to go from gate to gate slaying the idolators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2032%20;&amp;version=9;|title=Exodus 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Mordechai Kamenetzky|title= Project Genesis: Parshas Ki Sisa&amp;nbsp;— Masked Emotions |url= http://www.torah.org/learning/drasha/5758/kisisa.html |accessdate= 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, according to the last chapters of ''Exodus'', the [[Tabernacle]] was constructed, the priestly law ordained, the plan of encampment arranged both for the Levites and the non-priestly tribes, and the Tabernacle consecrated. Moses was given eight prayer laws that were to be carried out in regards to the Tabernacle. These laws included light, incense and sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glencairnmuseum.org/tabernacle/court.htm|title=The Tabernacle of Israel; Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on account of his marriage to an [[Ethiopia]]n, Josephus explains the marriage of Moses to this Ethiopian in the ''Antiquities of the Jews''&lt;ref name=&quot;j3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=61&amp;fk_files=2359|title=Antiquities of the Jews page 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2008}} and about him being the only one through whom the Lord spoke. Miriam was punished with leprosy for seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2012:1-15;&amp;version=9;|title=Numbers 12:1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people left [[Hazeroth]] and pitched camp in the wilderness of [[Desert of Paran|Paran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2012:16;&amp;version=9;|title=Numbers 12:16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Paran is a vaguely defined region in the northern part of the Sinai peninsula, just south of Canaan) Moses sent twelve spies into Canaan as scouts, including most famously Caleb and Joshua. After forty days, they returned to the Israelite camp, bringing back grapes and other produce as samples of the regions fertility. Although all the spies agreed that the land's resources were spectacular, only two of the twelve spies (Joshua and [[Caleb]]) were willing to try to conquer it, and are nearly stoned for their unpopular opinion. The people began weeping and wanted to return to Egypt. Moses turned down the opportunity to have the Israelites completely destroyed and a great nation made from his own offspring, and instead he told the people that they would wander the wilderness for forty years until all those twenty years or older who had refused to enter Canaan had died, and that their children would then enter and possess Canaan. Early the next morning, the Israelites said they had sinned and now wanted to take possession of Canaan. Moses told them not to attempt it, but the Israelites chose to disobey Moses and invade Canaan, but were repulsed by the Amalekites and Canaanites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2013-14;&amp;version=9;|title=Numbers 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tribe of Reuben]], led by [[Korah]], [[Dathan]], [[Abiram]], and 250 Israelite princes accused Moses and Aaron of raising themselves over the rest of the people. Moses told them to come the next morning with a censer for every man. Dathan and Abiram refused to come when summoned by Moses. Moses went to the place of Dathan and Abiram's tents. After Moses spoke the ground opened up and engulfed Dathan and Abiram's tents, after which it closed again. Fire consumed the 250 men with the censers. Moses had the censers taken and made into plates to cover the altar. The following day, the Israelites came and accused Moses and Aaron of having killed his fellow Israelites. The people were struck with a plague that killed 14,700 persons, and was only ended when Aaron went with his censer into the midst of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=4&amp;chapter=16&amp;version=9|title=Numbers 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent further murmurings and settle the matter permanently, Moses had each of the chief princes of the non-Levitic tribes write his name on his staff and had them lay them in the sanctuary. He also had Aaron write his name on his staff and had it placed in the tabernacle. The next day, when Moses went into the tabernacle, Aaron's staff had budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2017:1-8;&amp;version=9;|title=Numbers 17:1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Sinai, the Israelites camped in Kadesh. After more complaints from the Israelites, Moses struck the stone twice, and water gushed forth. However, because Moses and Aaron had not shown the Lord's holiness, they were not permitted to enter the land to be given to the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020:1-13;&amp;version=9;|title=Num. 20:1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second occasion Moses struck a rock to bring forth water; however, it appears that both sites were named [[Meribah]] after these two incidents.

[[File:The Brazen Serpent.jpg|thumb|right|Moses lifts up the [[Nehushtan|brass serpent]], curing the Israelites from poisonous snake bites in a painting by [[BenjaminWest]].]]
Now ready to enter Canaan, the Israelites abandoned the idea of attacking the Canaanites head-on in [[Hebron]], a city in the southern part of Canaan. Having been informed by spies that they were too strong, it was decided that they would flank Hebron by going further East, around the [[Dead Sea]]. This required that they pass through [[Edom]], [[Moab]], and [[Ammon]]. These three tribes were considered Hebrews by the Israelites as descendants of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], and therefore could not be attacked. However they were also rivals, and did not therefore give permission to allow the Israelites to pass openly through their territory. So Moses lead his people carefully along the eastern border of Edom, the southernmost of these territories. While the Israelites were making their journey around Edom, they complained about the ''manna''. After many of the people had been bitten by serpents and died, Moses made the [[Nehushtan|brass serpent]] and mounted it on a pole, and if those who were bitten looked at it, they did not die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2021:4-9;&amp;version=31;|title=Num. 21:4–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Biblical [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] this brass serpent remained in existence until the days of King [[Hezekiah]], who destroyed it after persons began treating it as an idol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2018:1-4;&amp;version=31;|title=2 Kings 18:1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they reached Moab, it was revealed that Moab had been attacked and defeated by the [[Amorite]]s led by a king named [[Sihon]]. The Amorites were a non-Hebrew Canaanic people who once held power in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. When Moses asked the Amorites for passage and it was refused, Moses attacked the Amorites (as non-Hebrews, the Israelites had no reservations in attacking them), presumably weakened by conflict with the Moabites, and defeated them.&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Tromp | first =Johnannes | title =The Assumption of Moses: A Critical Edition with Commentary| publisher =Brill | year =1993| isbn =90-04-09779-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Israelites, now holding the territory of the Amorites just north of Moab, desired to expand their holdings by acquiring [[Bashan]], a fertile territory north of Ammon famous for its oak trees and cattle. It was led by a king named [[Og]]. Later [[rabbi]]nical legends made Og a survivor of the flood, suggesting the he had sat on the Ark and was fed by [[Noah]]. The Israelites fought with Og's forces at [[Edrei]], on the southern border of Bashan, where the Israelites were victorious and slew every man, woman, and child of his cities and took spoil for their bounty.&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot; /&gt;

[[Balak]], king of Moab, having heard of the Israelites' conquests, feared that his territory might be next. Therefore he sent elders of Moab, and of [[Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian]], to [[Balaam]] (apparently a powerful and respected prophet), son of [[Beor (Bible)]], to induce him to come and curse the Israelites. Balaam's location is unclear. Balaam sent back word that he could only do what God commands, and God has, via a dream, told him not to go. Moab consequently sent higher ranking priests and offers Balaam honours, and so God tells Balaam to go with them. Balaam thus set out with two servants to go to Balak, but an [[Angel]] tried to prevent him. At first the Angel is seen only by the ass Balaam is riding. After Balaam started to punish the ass for refusing to move, it is miraculously given the power to speak to Balaam, and it complains about Balaam's treatment. At this point, Balaam was allowed to see the angel, who informed him that the ass is the only reason the Angel did not kill Balaam. Balaam immediately repented, but is told to go on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenazareneway.com/story_of_balaam.htm|title=The Story of Balaam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moses-icon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the prophet Moses, gesturing towards the [[burning bush]]. 18th century ([[Iconostasis]] of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] Church, [[Kizhi]] Monastery, [[Karelia]], [[Russia]]).]]

Balak met with Balaam at [[Kirjath-huzoth]], and they went to the high places of [[Baal]], and offered sacrifices at seven altars, leading to Balaam being given a prophecy by God, which Balaam relates to Balak. However, the prophecy blesses Israel; Balak remonstrated, but Balaam reminded him that he can only speak the words put in his mouth, so Balak taook him to another high place at [[Mount Pisgah (Bible)|Pisgah]], to try again. Building another seven altars here, and making sacrifices on each, Balaam provided another prophecy blessing Israel. Balaam was finally taken by a now very frustrated Balak to [[Peor]], and, after the seven sacrifices there, decided not to seek enchantments but instead looked on the Israelites from the peak. The spirit of God came upon Balaam and he delivered a third positive prophecy concerning Israel. Balak's anger rose to the point where he threatened Balaam, but Balaam merely offered a prediction of fate. Balaam then looked on the [[Kenite]]s, and Amalekites and offered two more predictions of fate. Balak and Balaam then go to their respective homes. Later, Balaam informed Balak and the Midianites that, if they wished to overcome the Israelites for a short interval, they needed to seduce the Israelites to engage in idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=114|title=Antiquities of the Jews, Book IV, Chapter VI, Paragraph 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2008}} The Midianites sent beautiful women to the Israelite camp to seduce the young men to partake in idolatry, and the attempt proved successful.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 23:3–6 summarises these incidents, and further states that the Ammonites were associated with the Moabites. Joshua, in his farewell speech, also makes reference to it. Nehemiah, Micah, and Joshua continue in the historical account of Balaam, who next advises the Midianites how to bring disaster on the Israelites by seducing the people with idols and beautiful women, which proves partly successful.&lt;/ref&gt;

God then commanded Moses to kill and hang the heads of everyone who had engaged in idolatry, and Moses ordered the judges to carry out the mass execution. At the same time, one of the Israelites brought home a Midianitish woman in the sight of the congregation. Upon seeing this, [[Phinehas]], the grandson of Aaron, took a javelin in his hand and thrust through both the Israelite and the Midianitish woman, which turned away the wrath of God. By that time, however, the plague inflicted on the Israelites had already killed about twenty-four thousand persons. Moses was then told that because [[Phinehas]] had averted the wrath of God from the Israelites, [[Phinehas]] and his descendents were given the pledge of an everlasting priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2025:1-13;&amp;version=9;|title=Num. 25:1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After Moses had taken a census of the people, he sent an army to avenge the perceived evil brought on the Israelites by the Midianites. Numbers 31 says Moses instructed the Israelite soldiers to kill every Midianite woman, boy, and non-virgin girl, although virgin girls were shared amongst the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers%2031;&amp;version=50;|title=Num. 31:17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israelites killed Balaam, and the five kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2031:8;&amp;version=9;|title=Num. 31:8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses appointed Joshua, son of [[Nun (Bible)|Nun]], to succeed him as the leader of the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2027:15-23;&amp;version=9;|title=Num. 27:15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses then died at the age of 120.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|34|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[Image:Bust of Moses at Earl Hall, Columbia University IMG 0950.JPG|thumb|Bust of Moses at Earl Hall at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]]]

Moses was warned that he would not be permitted to lead the  Israelites across the [[Jordan river]], because of his trespass at the waters of Meribah (Deut. 32:51) but would die on its eastern shores (Num. 20:12).&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt;
He therefore assembled the [[Tribes of Israel#The Twelve Tribes|tribes]], and delivered to them a parting address, which is taken to form the [[Book of Deuteronomy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;j1&quot;/&gt;

When Moses finished, he sang a [[Song of Moses|song]] and pronounced a [[Blessing of Moses|blessing]] on the people. He then went up Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah, looked over the promised land of Israel spread out before him, and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty, according to Talmudic legend on 7 Adar, his 120th birthday exactly.&lt;ref name=7adar&gt;Talmud Bavli, Megilah 13b, Sotah 12b, Kidushin 38a, Beshallaḥ, Wayassa', 5 [ed.

==Mosaic law==
{{Further|Law of Moses|Mosaic authorship|Deuteronomist|Book_of_Deuteronomy#Deuteronomic code|613 Mitzvot}}
The [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] relates how a &quot;law of Moses&quot; was discovered in the  [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] during the reign of King [[Josiah]] (r. 641–609 BC).
This book is mostly identified as an early version of the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], perhaps chapters 5-26 and chapter 28 of the extant text. This text contains a number of laws, dated to the 8th century BC [[kingdom of Judah]], a time when a minority [[Yahweh|Yahwist]] faction was actively attacking mainstream polytheism, succeeding in establishing official [[monolatry]] of the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] under Josiah by the late 7th century BC.

The law attributed to Moses,  specifically the laws set out in Deuteronomy, as a consequence came to be considered   supreme over all other sources of authority (the king and his officials), and the Levite priests were the guardians and interpreters of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&amp;sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., &quot;The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p.19ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Deuteronomy ({{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|31:9|KJV}} and {{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|31:24–26|KJV}}) describes how Moses writes &quot;[[torah]]&quot; (instruction) on a scroll and lays it beside the [[Ark of the Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=719426 Deuteronomy].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar passages include, for example, Exodus 17:14, &quot;And YHWH said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of [[Joshua]], that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of [[Amalek]] from under heaven;&quot; Exodus 24:4, &quot;And Moses wrote all the words of YHWH, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel;&quot; Exodus 34:27, &quot;And Yahweh said unto Moses, Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=217012 |title=Exodus |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Bibleref|Leviticus|26:46|KJV}}  &quot;These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.&quot;

Based on this tradition, &quot;Mosaic law&quot; came to refer to the entire legal content of the Pentateuch, not just the Ten Commandments explicitly connected to Moses in the biblical narrative.
The content of this law was excerpted and codified in [[Rabbinical Judaism]] as the [[613 Mitzvot]].
By Late Antiquity, the tradition of Moses being the source of the law in the Pentateuch also gave rise to the tradition of [[Mosaic authorship]], the interpretation of the entire [[Torah]] as the work of Moses.

==Moses in Hellenistic literature==
{{Further|Moses in Judeo-Hellenistic literature}}
[[File:Lawrence Saint Moses Closeup.JPG|thumb|right|The Moses Window at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] depicts the three stages in Moses' life.]]

Non-biblical writings about Jews, with references to the role of Moses, first appear at the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period, the zenith of Greek influence in the ancient world,  from 323 BCE to about 146 BCE. Shmuel notes that &quot;a characteristic of this literature is the high honour in which it holds the peoples of the East in general and some specific groups among these peoples.&quot;&lt;ref name=Shmuel/&gt;{{rp|1102}}  In addition to the Judeo-Roman or Judeo-Hellenic historians [[Artapanus of Alexandria|Artapanus]], [[Eupolemus]], [[Josephus]], and [[Philo]], a few non-Jewish historians including [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] (quoted by [[Diodorus Siculus]]), [[Alexander Polyhistor]], [[Manetho]], [[Apion]], [[Chaeremon of Alexandria]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] also make reference to him. The extent to which any of these accounts rely on earlier sources is unknown.&lt;ref name=Shmuel/&gt;{{rp|1103}} Moses also appears in other religious texts such as the [[Mishnah]] (c. 200 AD), [[Midrash]] (AD 200–1200),&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Reuven. ''The Classic Midrash: Tannaitic Commentaries on the Bible'', Paulist Press (1995) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Qur'an]] (c. 610—653).

The figure of [[Osarseph]] in Hellenistic historiography is a renegade Egyptian priest who leads an army of lepers against the pharaoh and is finally expelled from Egypt, changing his name to Moses.

;In Hecataeus
The earliest existing reference to Moses in Greek literature occurs in the Egyptian history of [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] (4th century BC). All that remains of his description of Moses are two references made by [[Diodorus Siculus]], wherein, writes historian Arthur Droge, &quot;he describes Moses as a wise and courageous leader who left Egypt and colonized Judaea.&quot;&lt;ref name=Droge&gt;Droge, Arthur J. ''Homer or Moses?: Early Christian Interpretations of the History of Culture'', Mohr Siebeck (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} Among the many accomplishments described by Hecataeus, Moses had founded cities, established a temple and religious cult, and issued laws:
:''After the establishment of settled life in Egypt in early times, which took place, according to the mythical account, in the period of the gods and heroes, the first . . . to persuade the multitudes to use written laws was Mneves [Moses], a man not only great of soul but also in his life the most public-spirited of all lawgivers whose names are recorded.''&lt;ref name=Droge/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Droge also points out that this statement by Hecataeus was similar to statements made subsequently by [[Eupolemus]]&lt;ref name=Droge/&gt;{{rp|18}}

;In Artapanus
The Jewish historian [[Artapanus of Alexandria]] (2nd century BCE), portrayed Moses as a cultural hero, alien to the Pharaonic court. According to theologian John Barclay, the Moses of Artapanus &quot;clearly bears the destiny of the Jews, and in his personal, cultural and military splendor, brings credit to the whole Jewish people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, John M. G. ''Jews in the Mediterranean diaspora: from Alexander to Trajan (323 BCE - 117 CE)'', University of California Press (1996) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Jealousy of Moses' excellent qualities induced [[Chenephres]] to send him with unskilled troops on a military expedition to [[Ethiopia]], where he won great victories. After having built the city of [[Hermopolis]], he taught the people the value of the [[ibis]] as a protection against the serpents, making the bird the sacred guardian spirit of the city; then he introduced circumcision. After his return to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], Moses taught the people the value of oxen for agriculture, and the consecration of the same by Moses gave rise to the cult of [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]]. Finally, after having escaped another plot by killing the assailant sent by the king, Moses fled to [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], where he married the daughter of [[Jethro (Bible)|Raguel]] [Jethro], the ruler of the district.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=830&amp;letter=M&amp;search=moses#3 |title=Moses |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artapanus goes on to relate how Moses returns to Egypt with Aaron, and is imprisoned, but miraculously escapes through the name of [[YHWH]] in order to lead the Exodus. This account further testifies that all Egyptian [[Egyptian temple|temples]] of [[Isis]] thereafter contained a rod, in remembrance of that used for Moses' miracles.  He describes Moses as 80 years old, &quot;tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified.&quot;

Some historians, however, point out the &quot;apologetic nature of much of Artapanus' work,&quot;&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;{{rp|40}} with his addition extra-biblical details, as with references to Jethro: The non-Jewish Jethro expresses admiration for Moses' gallantry in helping his daughters, and chooses to adopt Moses as his son.&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;Feldman, Louis H. ''Josephus's Interpretation of the Bible'', University of California Press (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}}

;In Strabo
[[Strabo]], a Greek historian, geographer and philosopher, in his ''Geography'' (c. AD 24), wrote in detail about Moses, whom he considered to be an Egyptian who deplored the situation in his homeland, and thereby attracted many followers who respected the deity. He writes, for example, that Moses opposed the picturing of the deity in the form of man or animal, and was convinced that the deity was an entity which encompassed everything — land and sea:&lt;ref name=Shmuel/&gt;{{rp|1132}}

:''35. An Egyptian priest named Moses, who possessed a portion of the country called the Lower Egypt, being dissatisfied with the established institutions there, left it and came to Judaea with a large body of people who worshipped the Divinity. He declared and taught that the Egyptians and Africans entertained erroneous sentiments, in representing the Divinity under the likeness of wild beasts and cattle of the field; that the Greeks also were in error in making images of their gods after the human form. For God [said he] may be this one thing which encompasses us all, land and sea, which we call heaven, or the universe, or the nature of things. . . . ''

:''36. By such doctrine Moses persuaded a large body of right-minded persons to accompany him to the place where Jerusalem now stands. . . . ''''&lt;ref name=Strabo&gt;Strabo. ''The Geography of Strabo'', XVI 35, 36, Translated by H.C. Hamilton and W. Falconer, pp. 177-178,&lt;/ref&gt;

In Strabo’s writings of the history of Judaism as he understood it, he describes various stages in its development: from the first stage, including Moses and his direct heirs; to the final stage where &quot;the Temple of Jerusalem continued to be surrounded by an aura of sanctity.&quot; Strabo’s &quot;positive and unequivocal appreciation of Moses’ personality is among the most sympathetic in all ancient literature.&quot; &lt;ref name=Shmuel/&gt;{{rp|1133}} His portrayal of Moses is said to be similar to the writing of [[Hecataeus of Abdera|Hecataeus]] who &quot;described Moses as a man who excelled in wisdom and courage.&quot;&lt;ref name=Shmuel&gt;Shmuel, Safrai, M. Stern (ed) ''The Jewish People in the First Century'', Van Gorcum Fortress Press (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1133}}

Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]] concludes that Strabo was the historian &quot;who came closest to a construction of Moses' religion as [[monotheistic|monotheism]] and as a pronounced counter-religion.&quot; It recognized &quot;only one divine being whom no image can represent. . . [and] the only way to approach this god is to live in virtue and in justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=Assmann/&gt;{{rp|38}}

;In Tacitus
The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (ca. 56—120 AD) refers to Moses by noting that the Jewish religion was monotheistic and without a clear image. His primary work, wherein he describes Jewish philosophy, is his ''Histories'' (ca. 100), where, according to Murphy, as a result of the Jewish worship of one God, &quot;[[paganism|pagan]] mythology fell into contempt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Cornelius. ''The works of Cornelius Tacitus: With an essay on his life and genius'' by Arthur Murphy, Thomas Wardle Publ. (1842) p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus states that, despite various opinions current in his day regarding the Jews' ethnicity, most of his sources are in agreement that there was an Exodus from Egypt. By his account, the Pharaoh [[Bakenranef|Bocchoris]], suffering from a plague, banished the Jews in response to an oracle of the god [[Zeus|Zeus-Amun]].

:''A motley crowd was thus collected and abandoned in the desert. While all the other outcasts lay idly lamenting, one of them, named '''Moses''', advised them not to look for help to gods or men, since both had deserted them, but to trust rather in themselves, and accept as divine the guidance of the first being, by whose aid they should get out of their present plight.''&lt;ref name=Tacitus/&gt;

In this version, Moses and the Jews wander through the desert for only six days, capturing the Holy Land on the seventh.&lt;ref name=Tacitus&gt;Tacitus, Cornelius. ''Tacitus, The Histories, Volume 2'', Book V. Chapters 5, 6 p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

;In Longinus
The [[Septuagint]], the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, influenced [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]], who may have been the author of the great book of literary criticism, ''[[On the Sublime]]'', although the true author is still unknown for certain. However, most scholars agree that the author lived in the time of [[Augustus]] or [[Tiberius]], the first and second Roman Emperors.

The writer quotes [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in a &quot;style which presents the nature of the deity in a manner suitable to his pure and great being,&quot; however he does not mention Moses by name, but instead calls him &quot;the Lawgiver of the Jews.&quot;  Besides its mention of [[Cicero]], Moses is the only non-Greek writer quoted in the work, and he is described &quot;with far more admiration than even Greek writers who treated Moses with respect, such as [[Hecataeus of Abdera|Hecataeus]] and [[Strabo]].&lt;ref name=Shmuel/&gt;{{rp|1140}}

;In Josephus
In [[Josephus]]' (37 – c. 100 AD) ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'',  Moses is mentioned throughout. For example Book VIII Ch. IV, describes [[Solomon's Temple]], also known as the First Temple, at the time the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was first moved into the newly built temple:

{{bquote|When [[King Solomon]] had finished these works, these large and beautiful buildings, and had laid up his donations in the temple, and all this in the interval of seven years, and had given a demonstration of his riches and alacrity therein; ... he also wrote to the rulers and elders of the Hebrews, and ordered all the people to gather themselves together to [[Jerusalem]], both to see the temple which he had built, and to remove the ark of God into it; and when this invitation of the whole body of the people to come to Jerusalem was everywhere carried abroad, ...  [[The Feast of Tabernacles]] happened to fall at the same time, which was kept by the Hebrews as a most holy and most eminent feast. So they carried the ark and the tabernacle which Moses  had pitched, and all the vessels that were for ministration to the sacrifices of God, and removed them to the temple... Now the ark contained nothing else but those two tables of stone that preserved the [[ten commandments]], which God spake to Moses in [[Mount Sinai]], and which were engraved upon them...&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Flavius. ''The works of Flavius Josephus: Comprising the Antiquities of the Jews'', trans. by William Whiston, (1854) Book VIII, Ch. IV, pp. 254-255&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Feldman, Josephus also attaches particular significance to Moses' possession of the &quot;cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.&quot; He also includes piety as an added fifth virtue. In addition, he &quot;stresses Moses' willingness to undergo toil and his careful avoidance of bribery. Like [[Plato]]'s philosopher-king, Moses excels as an educator.&quot;&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;{{rp|130}}

;In Numenius
[[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], a Greek philosopher who was a native of Apamea, in Syria, wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century AD. Historian Kennieth Guthrie writes that &quot;Numenius is perhaps the only recognized Greek philosopher who explicitly studied Moses, the prophets, and the life of Jesus . . . &quot;&lt;ref name=Guthrie&gt;Guthrie, Kenneth Sylvan. ''Numenius of Apamea: The Father of Neo-Platonism'', George Bell &amp; Sons (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}} He describes his background:

{{bquote|Numenius was a man of the world; he was not limited to Greek and Egyptian mysteries, but talked familiarly of the myths of Brahmins and Magi. It is however his knowledge and use of the Hebrew scriptures which distinguished him from other Greek philosophers. He refers to Moses simply as &quot;the prophet&quot;, exactly as for him [[Homer]] is the poet. [[Plato]] is described as a Greek Moses.&lt;ref name=Guthrie/&gt;{{rp|101}}}}

;In Justin Martyr
The Christian saint and religious philosopher [[Justin Martyr]] (103–165 AD) drew the same conclusion as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], according to other experts. Theologian Paul Blackham notes that Justin considered Moses to be &quot;more trustworthy, profound and truthful because he is ''older'' than the Greek philosophers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Blackham/&gt; He quotes him:
{{bquote|I will begin, then, with our first prophet and lawgiver, Moses . . . that you may know that, of all your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or lawgivers, by far the oldest, as the Greek histories show us, was Moses, who was our first religious teacher.&lt;ref name=Blackham&gt;Blackham, Paul; ed.

==Historicity==
[[File:Memorial of Moses, Mt. Nebo.jpg|thumb|Memorial of Moses, Mount Nebo, Jordan]]

The tradition of Moses as a lawgiver and [[culture hero]] of the [[Israelites]] can be traced to 8th or 7th century BCE in the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Moses is a central figure in the [[Deuteronomist]] account of the origins of the Israelites, cast in a literary style of elegant flashbacks told by Moses. The Deuteronomist relies on earlier material that may date to the [[United Monarchy]], so that the biblical narrative would be based on traditions that can be traced to about four centuries after the supposed lifetime of Moses.

The question of the historicity of [[the Exodus]] (specifically, the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]], identification of which would connect the biblical narrative to Egyptological chronology) has long been debated, without conclusive result. [[Manetho]] for instance in a distorted account reported in [[Josephus]], states that Moses was originally [[Osarseph]] a renegade priest, who led a band of lepers out of Avaris (referred to as [[Pi-Ramesses|Raamses]] in the Bible).({{bibleverse||Exodus|1:11|KJV|}}) 

Many biblical scholars are prepared to admit that there may be a historical core beneath the Exodus and Sinai traditions, even if the biblical narrative dramatizes by portraying as a single event what was more likely a gradual process of migration and conquest.  Thus, the motif of &quot;slavery in Egypt&quot; reflects the historical situation of imperialist control of the [[Egyptian Empire]] over [[Canaan]] after the conquests of [[Ramesses II]], which declined gradually during the 12th century under the pressure from the [[Sea Peoples]] and the general [[Bronze Age collapse]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.
[[Israel Finkelstein]] points to the appearance of settlements in the central hill country around 1200 as the earliest of the known settlements of the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;I Finkelstein and N. Na'aman, eds., From Nomadism to Monarchy (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; A cyclical pattern to these highland settlements, corresponding to the state of the surrounding cultures, suggests that the local Canaanites combined an agricultural and nomadic lifestyles.  When Egyptian rule collapsed after the invasion of the [[Sea Peoples]], the central hill country could no longer sustain a large nomadic population, so they went from nomadism to [[sedentism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Finkelstein, Israel and Silberman, Neil Asher | title=The Bible Unearthed | publisher=New York: Free Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-684-86912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|WHY would Egyptian rule jeopardize nomadism and lack of rule, encourage farming?

While the general narrative of the Exodus and the conquest of the Promised Land may be remotely rooted in historical events, the figure of Moses as a leader of the Israelites in these events cannot be substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;''Who Were the Early Israelites?'' by [[William G. Dever]] (William B.

[[Martin Noth]]  holds that two different groups experienced the Exodus and Sinai events, and each group transmitted its own stories independently of the other one, writing that &quot;The biblical story tracing the Hebrews from Egypt to Canaan resulted from an editor's weaving separate themes and traditions around a main character Moses, actually an obscure person from Moab.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;&quot;Moses.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;  The Moabite king [[Mesha]] seems to have preserved another form of the name.

[[William Foxwell Albright|William Albright]] held a more favorable view towards the traditional views regarding Moses, and accepted the essence of the biblical story, as narrated between Exodus 1:8 and Deuteronomy 34:12, but recognized the impact that centuries of oral and written transmission have had on the account, causing it to acquire layers of accretions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

==Moses in religious traditions==

===Judaism===
{{Main|Moses in Hellenistic literature|Moses in Rabbinic Literature}}

There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the [[Jewish apocrypha]] and in the genre of [[rabbi]]nical exegesis known as [[Midrash]], as well as in the primary works of the Jewish [[oral law]], the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]].
Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition.
The [[Midrash]] identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names.&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Rabbah, Ki Thissa, XL. 3-3, Lehrman, P.463&lt;/ref&gt; Moses' other names were: Jekuthiel (by his mother), Heber (by [[Amram|his father]]), Jered (by [[Miriam]]), Avi Zanoah (by Aaron), [[Avigdor (name)|Avi Gedor]] (by [[Kohath]]), Avi Soco (by his wet-nurse), Shemaiah ben Nethanel (by people of Israel).&lt;ref&gt;Yalkut Shimoni, Shemot 166 to Chronicles I 4:18, 24:6; also see Vayikra Rabbah 1:3; Chasidah p.345&lt;/ref&gt; Moses is also attributed the names Toviah (as a first name), and Levi (as a family name) (Vayikra Rabbah 1:3), Heman,&lt;ref&gt;Rashi to Bava Batra 15s, Chasidah p.345&lt;/ref&gt; Mechoqeiq (lawgiver)&lt;ref&gt;Bava Batra 15a on Deuteronomy 33:21, Chasidah p.345&lt;/ref&gt; and Ehl Gav Ish (Numbers 12:3)&lt;ref&gt;Rashi to Berachot 54a, Chasidah p.345&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish historians who lived at [[Alexandria]], such as [[Eupolemus]], attributed to Moses the feat of having taught the [[Phoenicia]]ns their alphabet,&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''[[Præparatio Evangelica]]'' ix. 26&lt;/ref&gt; similar to legends of [[Thoth]]. [[Artapanus of Alexandria]] explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth / Hermes, but also with the Greek figure [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] (whom he calls &quot;the teacher of [[Orpheus]]&quot;), and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He names the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, l.c. ix. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient sources mention an Assumption of Moses and a Testimony of Moses. A Latin text was found in [[Milan]] in the 19th century by [[Antonio Ceriani]] who called it the [[Assumption of Moses]], even though it does not refer to an assumption of Moses or contain portions of the Assumption which are cited by ancient authors, and it is apparently actually the Testimony. The incident which the ancient authors cite is also mentioned in the [[Epistle of Jude]].

To Orthodox Jews, Moses is called ''Moshe Rabbenu, `Eved HaShem, Avi haNeviim zya&quot;a''. He is defined &quot;Our Leader Moshe&quot;, &quot;Servant of God&quot;, and &quot;Father of all the Prophets&quot;. In their view, Moses not only received the Torah, but also the revealed (written and oral) and the hidden (the ''`hokhmat nistar'' teachings, which gave Judaism the Zohar of the [[Shimon bar Yochai|Rashbi]], the Torah of the [[Isaac Luria|Ari haQadosh]] and all that is discussed in the Heavenly Yeshiva between the [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramhal]] and his masters). He is also considered the greatest prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/moshe.htm |title=Judaism 101: Moses, Aaron and Miriam |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arising in part from his age, but also because 120 is elsewhere stated as the maximum age for Noah's descendants (one interpretation of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|6:3|JP}}), &quot;may you live to 120&quot; has become a common blessing among Jews.

|attributes= Tablets of the Law}}
For [[Christianity|Christians]], Moses&amp;nbsp;— mentioned more often in the [[New Testament]] than any other [[Old Testament]] figure&amp;nbsp;— is often a symbol of God's law, as reinforced and [[Expounding of the Law|expounded on]] in the teachings of [[Jesus]]. New Testament writers often compared Jesus' words and deeds with Moses' to explain Jesus' mission. In [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 7:39–43, 51–53, for example, the rejection of Moses by the Jews who worshiped the golden calf is likened to the rejection of Jesus by the Jews that continued in traditional Judaism.

Moses also figures in several of Jesus' messages. When he met the [[Pharisees]] [[Nicodemus]] at night in the third chapter of the [[Gospel of John]], he compared Moses' lifting up of the [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]] in the wilderness, which any Israelite could look at and be healed, to his own lifting up (by his death and [[resurrection]]) for the people to look at and be healed. In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them ''[[manna]]'' in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the &quot;bread of life&quot;, Jesus stated that He was  provided to feed God's people.

Moses, along with [[Elijah]], is presented as meeting with Jesus in all three Gospel accounts of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 17, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 9, and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 9, respectively. Later Christians found numerous other parallels between the life of Moses and Jesus to the extent that Jesus was likened to a &quot;second Moses.&quot; For instance, Jesus' escape from the [[Massacre of the Innocents|slaughter by Herod in Bethlehem]] is compared to Moses' escape from Pharaoh's designs to kill Hebrew infants. Such parallels, unlike those mentioned above, are not pointed out in Scripture. See the article on [[typology (theology)|typology]].

His relevance to modern Christianity has not diminished. Moses is considered to be a saint by several churches; and is commemorated as a prophet in the respective Calendars of Saints of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches on [[September 4]].&lt;ref&gt;Great [[Synaxarium|Synaxaristes]]: {{gr icon}} ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/552/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Προφήτης Μωϋσῆς].'' 4 Σεπτεμβρίου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt; He is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on July 30.

;Mormonism
{{Main|Book of Moses}}
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (colloquially called [[Mormons]]) generally view Moses in the same way that other Christians do. However, in addition to accepting the Biblical account of Moses, Mormons include [[Book of Moses|Selections from the Book of Moses]] as part of their scriptural canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmormons.com/bom.php |title=About Mormons |publisher=About Mormons |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book is believed to be the translated writings of Moses, and is included in the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/basic/scripture/moses.html |title=The Book of Moses |publisher=Lightplanet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latter-day Saints are also unique in believing that Moses was taken to heaven without having tasted death ([[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]). In addition, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] stated that on April 3, 1836, Moses appeared to them in the [[Kirtland Temple]] in a glorified, immortal, physical form and bestowed upon them the &quot;keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110/11#11 110:11]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Biblical narratives and the Qur'an#Moses (Mūsā موسى)}}
[[File:Nabi Musa jerico-Jerusalam.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nabi Musa|Maqam El-Nabi Musa]], [[Jericho]]]]
Moses is mentioned more in the [[Quran]] than any other individual and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]].&lt;ref name=Keeler/&gt;
In general, Moses is described in ways which parallel the [[prophet Muhammad]],&lt;ref&gt;
Keeler (2005) describes Moses from the Muslim perspective:
:”Among prophets, Moses has been described as the one ‘whose career as a messenger of God, lawgiver and leader of his community most closely parallels and foreshadows that of Muhammad’, and as ‘the figure that in the Koran was presented to Muhammad above all others as the supreme model of saviour and ruler of a community, the man chosen to present both knowledge of the one God, and a divinely revealed system of law’. We find him clearly in this role of Muhammad’s forebear in a well-known tradition of the miraculous ascension of the Prophet, where Moses advises Muhammad from his own experience as messenger and lawgiver.”
&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;his character exhibits some of the main themes of Islamic theology,&quot; including the &quot;moral injunction that we are to submit ourselves to God.&quot;

Moses is defined in the Qur'an as both prophet (''nabi'') and messenger (''rasul''), the latter term indicating that he was one of those prophets who brought a scripture and law to his people.

[[Huston Smith]] (1991) describes an account in the Qur'an of meetings in heaven between Moses and Muhammad, which Huston states were &quot;one of the crucial events in Muhammad's life,&quot; and resulted in Muslims observing 5 daily prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Huston.

Moses is mentioned 502 times in the Qur'an; passages mentioning Moses include [[Al-Baqara|2]].49-61, [[Al-A'raf|7]].103-160, [[Yunus (sura)|10]].75-93, [[Al-Isra|17]].101-104, [[Ta-Ha|20]].9-97, [[Ash-Shu'ara|26]].10-66, [[An-Naml|27]].7-14, [[Al-Qisas|28]].3-46, [[Al-Ghafir|40]].23-30, [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].46-55, [[Ad-Dukhan|44]].17-31, and [[An-Naziat|79]].15-25. and many others.
Most of the key events in Moses' life which are narrated in the Bible are to be found dispersed through the different [[Surahs]] of Qur'an, with a story about meeting [[Khidr]] which is not found in the Bible.&lt;ref name=Keeler/&gt;

In the Moses story related by the Qur'an, Jochebed is commanded by God to place Moses in an ark and cast him on the waters of the Nile, thus abandoning him completely to God's protection.&lt;ref name=Keeler&gt;Annabel Keeler, &quot;Moses from a Muslim Perspective&quot;, in: Solomon, Norman; Harries, Richard; Winter, Tim (eds.), [http://books.google.com/books?id=9A4JZ8CSJJwC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;vq=Moses&amp;dq=Moses+Qur%27an&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=4&amp;sig=ACfU3U1sEssZMSZaPhSSlzCosLopQbDrOQ#PPA55,M1 ''Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation''],  by .

[[Thomas Mann]]'s [[novella]] ''[[The Tables of the Law]]'' is a retelling of the story of the exodus from Egypt, with Moses as its main character.

===Psychology===
;In Freudian psychoanalysis
[[Sigmund Freud]], in his last book, ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' in 1939, postulated that Moses was an Egyptian nobleman who adhered to the [[monotheism]] of [[Akhenaten]]. Following a theory proposed by a contemporary biblical critic, Freud believed that Moses was murdered in the wilderness, producing a collective sense of patricidal guilt that has been at the heart of Judaism ever since. &quot;Judaism had been a religion of the father, Christianity became a religion of the son&quot;, he wrote. The possible Egyptian origin of Moses and of his message has received significant scholarly attention.&lt;ref name=Assmann&gt;{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Assmann |title=Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism |location= |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-674-58738-3 }} See also Y.

;Criticism
{{Main|Criticism of Moses}}

In the late 18th century the [[deist]] [[Thomas Paine]] commented at length on Moses' Laws in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', and gave his view that &quot;the character of Moses, as stated in the Bible, is the most horrid that can be imagined&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Paine]] ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' part II, 1796&lt;/ref&gt; giving the story at {{Bibleverse||Numbers|31:13-18}} as an example. In the 19th century the [[agnostic]] [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] wrote &quot;...that all the ignorant, infamous, heartless, hideous things recorded in the 'inspired' Pentateuch are not the words of God, but simply 'Some Mistakes of Moses'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert G. Ingersoll]], ''Some Mistakes of Moses'' chapter XXIX&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the [[atheist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] referring, like Paine, to the incident at {{Bibleverse||Numbers|31:13-18}}, concluded, &quot;No, Moses was not a great role model for modern moralists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', 2006, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the center of the 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying Roman numerals I through X, with some numbers partially hidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianindex.org/1087.article &quot;In the Supreme Court itself, Moses and his law on display&quot;] ''Religion News Service''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelangelo's statue===
[[Michelangelo]]'s [[Moses (Michelangelo)|statue of Moses]] in the Church of [[San Pietro in Vincoli]], [[Rome]], is one of the most familiar masterpieces in the world.
Horns the sculptor included on Moses' head are the result of a mistranslation of the Hebrew Bible into the Latin [[Vulgate Bible]] with which he was familiar. The Hebrew word taken from ''Exodus'' means either a &quot;horn&quot; or an &quot;irradiation.&quot; Experts at the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] show that the term was used when Moses &quot;returned to his people after seeing as much of the Glory of the Lord as human eye could stand,&quot; and his face &quot;reflected radiance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Margaret. (ed) ''Art and Archaeology'', Vol. VI, Archaeological Institute of America (1917) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In early Jewish art, moreover, Moses is often &quot;shown with rays coming out of his head.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devore |first=Gary M. |title=Walking Tours of Ancient Rome: A Secular Guidebook to the Eternal City |location= |publisher=Mercury Guides |year=2008 |page=126 |isbn=978-0-615-19497-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another author explains, &quot;When [[Saint Jerome]] translated the Old Testament into Latin, he thought no one but Christ should glow with rays of light — so he advanced the secondary translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomason |first=Dustin |last2=Caldwell |first2=Ian |title=The Rule of Four |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2005 |page=151 |isbn=0-440-24135-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross |first=Kenneth |title=The Dream of the Moving Statue |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell Univ. Press |year=2005 |page=245 |isbn=0-271-02900-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, writer J. Stephen Lang points out that Jerome's version actually described Moses as &quot;giving off hornlike rays,&quot; and he &quot;rather clumsily translated it to mean 'having horns.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=J.
