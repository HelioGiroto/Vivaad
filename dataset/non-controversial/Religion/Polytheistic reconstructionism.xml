'''Polytheistic reconstructionism''' ('''Reconstructionism''') is an approach to [[Neopaganism]] first emerging in the late 1960s to early 1970s, and gathering momentum in the 1990s to 2000s. Reconstructionism attempts to re-establish  historical [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions in the modern world, in contrast with [[Syncretism|syncretic]] movements like [[Wicca]], and &quot;channeled&quot; movements like [[Germanic mysticism]] or [[Theosophy]].

&lt;!-- While the emphasis on historical accuracy may imply [[historical reenactment]], the desire  for continuity in ritual traditions ([[orthopraxy]]) is a common characteristic of religion in general, as seen in Anglican [[ritualism]], or in much [[Christian liturgy]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} --&gt;

== History ==
[[D. H. Lawrence]] put a sketch of a fictional programme into the mouth of a character in  ''[[The Plumed Serpent]]'' (published in 1926):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So if I want Mexicans to learn the name of Quetzalcoatl, it is because I want them to speak with the tongues of their own blood. I wish the Teutonic world would once more think in terms of Thor and Wotan, and the tree Igdrasil. And I wish the Druidic world would see, honestly, that in the mistletoe is their mystery, and that they themselves are the Tuatha De Danaan, alive, but submerged. And a new Hermes should come back to the Mediterranean, and a new Ashtaroth to Tunis; and Mithras again to Persia, and Brahma unbroken to India, and the oldest of dragons to China.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term &quot;Reconstructionist Paganism&quot; was likely coined by [[Isaac Bonewits]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;brp&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first =Isaac | last =Bonewits | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2006 | month = | title =Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition =  | publisher =Kensington/Citadel | location =New York| isbn =0-8065-2710-2 | url =| page =131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonewits has said that he is not sure whether he &quot;got this use of the term from one or more of the other culturally focused Neopagan movements of the time, or if [he] just applied it in a novel fashion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brp&quot;/&gt; [[Margot Adler]] later used the term &quot;Pagan Reconstructionists&quot; in the 1979 edition of ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon]]'' to refer to those who claimed to adhere to some sort of historical religion. This emphasis on reconstruction is in ostensible contrast to more fanciful approaches to &quot;paganism&quot; in [[Romanticism]], as seen for example in [[Germanic mysticism]].

Reconstructionist Paganism has evolved into Polytheistic Reconstructionism, and is a distinct movement from the syncreticism and eclecticism of popular [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] culture, and from the [[Wicca]]n ritual format that many Neopagan groups have adopted. Reconstructionist religions are based on the surviving historical record, and on surviving folk practices of the culture in question.

According to Linzie (2004), the reconstructionist movement originated around 1970 with early attempts to reconstruct pre-Christian religions, with [[Germanic neopaganism]] in the USA, the UK and Iceland focussing on [[Norse religion]] of the [[Viking Age]], and reconstruction of [[Hellenic polytheism]] in Greece, and of [[Baltic polytheism]] with [[Romuva]].

In a second phase beginning in the 1990s, these movements have been joined by serious attempts at reconstructing [[Roman polytheism]] and [[Celtic polytheism]] (see [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]]). Many of these groups focus on the [[1st millennium AD]] (with the exception of Greek and Roman polytheism which is already well-attested in sources of the mid to late [[1st millennium BC]]), up to the period of Christianization of the respective populations. Most also include folkloric practices that have survived into recent history or, in some cases, into the present day.

==Reconstructionism and Neopaganism==
{{See also|Neopaganism}}

Linzie (2004) enumerates the difference between reconstructionist Neopaganism and &quot;classical&quot; Neogapanism as found in Eighteenth to mid Twentieth century movements (including [[Germanic mysticism]], early [[Neodruidism]] and [[Wicca]]) as follows:

# There is no attempt to recreate a combined pan-European paganism.
# Researchers attempt to stay within research guidelines developed over the course of the past century for handling documentation generated in the time periods that they are studying.
# A multi-disciplinary approach is utilized capitalizing on results from various fields as historical literary research, anthropology, religious history, political history, archaeology, forensic anthropology, historical sociology, etc. with an overt attempt to avoid pseudo-sciences.
# There are serious attempts to recreate culture, politics, science and art of the period in order to better understand the environment within which the religious beliefs were practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Linzie (2004), 5f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the terms &quot;[[Paganism|Pagan]]&quot; and &quot;Neopagan&quot; to apply to polytheistic reconstructionists is controversial.  Some reconstructionist, ethnic and indigenous religious groups take great issue with being referred to as &quot;Pagan&quot; or &quot;Neopagan,&quot; viewing &quot;Pagan&quot; as a pejorative term used in the past by institutions attempting to destroy their cultures and religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;sceh&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=faq#24|title=Pagans|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes|author=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, reconstructionists may choose to reject the terms &quot;Pagan&quot; and &quot;Neopagan&quot; in order to distance themselves from aspects of popular Neopaganism, such as eclecticism, cultural appropriation, the practice of magic, and a tendency to conduct rituals within a Wiccan-derived format, that they find irrelevant or even inimical to their religious practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;heath&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wyrdwords.vispa.com/heathenry/callusheathen.html|title=Call us Heathens!|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Journal of the  Pagan Federation|year=1997|author=Arlea Ansch√ºtz, Stormerne Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among those reconstructionist groups who see themselves as part of the broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with the more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, [[cultural appropriation]] or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism as the older current in the Pagan community, and are unwilling to give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adler | first = Margot | title = Drawing down the Moon, &quot;Perhaps the main difference in the Pagan movement today, as a whole, compared to the movement that existed in the middle and late 1970s is that, at that time, the organizations described in this chapter [Pagan Reconstructionists]...were the main influences in creating a Neo-Pagan consciousness. ... It's important to remember, however, that the reason the Pagan movement in the United States is so rich and varied and presents such a unique perspective to the world is primarily because of the non-Wiccan influences that were so dominant in earlier years.&quot; page 282 | publisher = Penguin/Arkana | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-14-019536-X | page = 262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- This supposed quote has been completely butchered, and out of context of the chapter as a whole.
