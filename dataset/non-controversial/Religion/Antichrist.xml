[[File:Antichrist-from-Osogovo-Monastery.jpg|thumb|250px|Antichrist{{spaced ndash}}detail from a fresco, [[Osogovo Monastery]]]]

The '''antichrist''' is a [[Christian]] concept based on the [[exegesis]] of [[Second Temple]] (500 BCE–50 CE) Jewish texts that refer to anti-messiahs. In Christian belief, [[Jesus]] the [[messiah]] appears in his [[Second coming]] to earth, to face the emergence of the Antichrist figure. Just as [[Christ]] is the savior and the ideal model for humanity, his opponent in the [[End of Days (eschatology)|End of days]] will be a single figure of concentrated evil. {{sfn|Cabinet|2001|p=[http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/5/widholm.php Interview with Bernard McGinn]}} In the [[New Testament]], the term &quot;antichrist&quot; occurs five times in [[1 John]] and [[2 John]], once in [[plural]] form and four times in the [[singular number|singular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Word Search Results for &quot;antichristos (Strong's 500) Strong's antichristos (Strong's 500)&quot;| publisher =The Blue Letter Bible| url =http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=500| accessdate =2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Etymology===
The word ''antichrist'' is made up of two [[root (linguistics)|root]]s: [[wikt:αντι-#Greek|αντί]] + [[wikt:Χριστός|Χριστός]] (anti + Christos). &quot;Αντί&quot; can mean not only &quot;against&quot; and &quot;opposite of&quot;, but also &quot;in place of&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;See Strong's Bible Dictionary: [http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G473&amp;t=KJV αντί] and the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0072%3Aentry%3Da%29nti%2F Lexicon to Pindar]. Related terms as noted by the Catholic Encyclopedia include: antibasileus-a king who fills an [[interregnum]]; antistrategos-a [[propraetor]]; anthoupatos-a [[proconsul]]; antitheos-in [[Homer]],one resembling a god in power and beauty, in other works it stands for a hostile god&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Χριστός&quot;, translated &quot;[[Christ]]&quot;, is Greek for the Hebrew &quot;[[Messiah]]&quot; meaning &quot;[[anoint]]ed,&quot; and refers to Jesus of Nazareth&lt;ref&gt;See Strong's Bible Dictionary: [http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G5547&amp;t=KJV χριστος]&lt;/ref&gt; within Christian, [[Islamic]] and [[Messianic Jewish]] [[theology]].

===Jewish antecedents===
Anti-messiahs are referred to in some Jewish writings in the period 500 BC–50 AD, and this is thought to be the precursor of the concept of the Antichrist in Christian writing. Bernard McGinn conjectures that the concept may have been generated by the frustration of Jews subject to often-capricious Seleucid or [[Roman Judaea|Roman rule]], who found the nebulous Jewish idea of a [[Satan]] who is more of an opposing angel of God in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]] insufficiently humanised and personalised to be a satisfactory incarnation of evil and threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabinetmagazine.org&quot;/&gt;

[[Armilus]] is an anti-messiah figure from late period [[Jewish eschatology]]. He is described as bald, partially maimed, and partially deaf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1789&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Armilus Jewish Encylcopedia: Armilus]: &quot;bald-headed, with one large and one small eye, deaf in the right ear and maimed in the right arm, while the left arm is two and one-half ells long.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the doctrine==

===Early Church===
{{Christian Eschatology}}
{{See also|Early Christianity}}

[[Polycarp]] (ca. 69 – ca. 155) warned the Philippians that everyone who preached false doctrine was an antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Polycarp's letter to the Philippians (Lightfoot translation)|Polycap's Letter to the Philippians]], paragraph 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irenaeus]] (2nd century AD – c. 202) wrote ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' to refute the teachings of the [[Gnostic]]s. In Book V of ''Against Heresies'' he addresses the figure of the Antichrist referring to him as the &quot;recapitulation of apostasy and rebellion.&quot; He uses the [[Number of the Beast]] from [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13:18 to [[Numerology|numerologically]] decode several possible names. Some names that he loosely proposed were &quot;Evanthos&quot;, &quot;Lateinos&quot; (&quot;Latin&quot; or pertaining to the Roman Empire). In his exegesis of Daniel 7:21, he stated that the ten horns of the beast will be the Roman empire divided into ten kingdoms before the Antichrist's arrival. However, his readings of the Antichrist were more in broader theological terms rather than within a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Kevin L.|title=Constructing antichrist : Paul, biblical commentary, and the development of doctrine in the early Middle Ages|year=2005|publisher=Catholic Univ. of America Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780813214153|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ttvHhsEkXoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Irenaeus+antichrist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9ShfdyBdG1&amp;sig=gsfge15eTm71Ua8v181Qp2Rr5ic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QBY7UNvSL-X5iwLxyYCIDg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Irenaeus%20antichrist&amp;f=false|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Tertullian]] (ca.160 – ca.220 AD) held that the [[Roman Empire]] was the restraining force written about by Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:7-8. The fall of Rome and the disintegration of the ten provinces of the Roman Empire into ten kingdoms were to make way for the Antichrist.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'For that day shall not come, unless indeed there first come a falling away,' he [Paul] means indeed of this present empire, 'and that [[man of sin]] be revealed,' that is to say, Antichrist, 'the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or religion; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, affirming that he is God. Remember ye not, that when I was with you, I used to tell you these things? And now ye know what detaineth, that he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now hinders must hinder, until he be taken out of the way.' What obstacles is there but the Roman state, the falling away of which, by being scattered into the ten kingdoms, shall introduce Antichrist upon (its own ruins)? And then shall be revealed the wicked one, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: even him whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.viii.xxiv.html |title=On the Resurrection, chp 24 |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100628020454/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.viii.xxiv.html| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (c. 170-c. 236) held that the Antichrist would come from the [[tribe of Dan]] and would [[Third Temple|rebuild the Jewish temple]] in order to reign from it. He identified the Antichrist with the Beast out of the Earth from the book of Revelation. &lt;blockquote&gt;By the beast, then, coming up out of the earth, he means the kingdom of Antichrist; and by the two horns he means him and the false prophet after him. And in speaking of &quot;the horns being like a lamb,&quot; he means that he will make himself like the Son of God, and set himself forward as king. And the terms, &quot;he spake like a dragon,&quot; mean that he is a deceiver, and not truthful.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus's [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Extant Works and Fragments of Hippolytus/Dogmatical and Historical/Treatise on Christ and Antichrist|Treatise on Christ and Antichrist, part 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Origen]] (185–254) refuted [[Celsus]]'s view of the Antichrist. Origen utilized Scriptural citations from Daniel, Paul, and the Gospels. He argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Where is the absurdity, then, in holding that there exist among men, so to speak, two extremes-- the one of virtue, and the other of its opposite; so that the perfection of virtue dwells in the man who realizes the ideal given in Jesus, from whom there flowed to the human race so great a conversion, and healing, and [[wikt:amelioration|amelioration]], while the opposite extreme is in the man who embodies the notion of him that is named Antichrist?... one of these extremes, and the best of the two, should be styled the Son of God, on account of His pre-eminence; and the other, who is diametrically opposite, be termed the son of the wicked demon, and of Satan, and of the devil. And, in the next place, since evil is specially characterized by its diffusion, and attains its greatest height when it simulates the appearance of the good, for that reason are signs, and marvels, and lying miracles found to accompany evil, through the cooperation of its father the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Origen|1872|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Post-Nicene Christianity===
{{See also|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}

[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], in the mid-4th century, delivered his [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf207.ii.xix.html 15th] [[Cyril_of_Jerusalem#Catechetical_Lectures|Catechetical Lecture]] about the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]], in which he also lectures about the Antichrist, who will reign as the ruler of the world for three and a half years, before he is killed by Jesus Christ right at the end of his three-and-a-half-year reign, shortly after which the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will happen.

[[Athanasius]] (c. 293 – 373),  writes that [[Arius]] of Alexandria is to be associated with the Antichrist, saying, &quot;And ever since [the Council of Nicaea] has Arius's error been reckoned for a heresy more than ordinary, being known as Christ's foe, and harbinger of Antichrist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;from Athanasius' &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/28161.htm Four Discourses]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Chrysostom]] (c. 347–407) warned against speculations and old wives' tales about the Antichrist, saying, &quot;Let us not therefore enquire into these things&quot;. He preached that by knowing Paul's description of the Antichrist in 2 Thessalonians Christians would avoid deception.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysostom [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume XIII/On Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians/On 2 Thessalonians/Argument|Homily 1 on the 2nd Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome]] (c. 347-420) warned that those substituting false interpretations for the actual meaning of Scripture belonged to the &quot;synagogue of the Antichrist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893b|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;He that is not of Christ is of Antichrist,&quot; he wrote to [[Pope Damasus I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that &quot;the mystery of iniquity&quot; written about by Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 was already in action when &quot;every one chatters about his views.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893c|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Jerome, the power restraining this mystery of iniquity was the Roman Empire, but as it fell this restraining force was removed. He warned a noble woman of [[Gaul]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;He that letteth is taken out of the way, and yet we do not realize that Antichrist is near. Yes, Antichrist is near whom the Lord Jesus Christ &quot;shall consume with the spirit of his mouth.&quot; &quot;Woe unto them,&quot; he cries, &quot;that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days.&quot;... Savage tribes in countless numbers have overrun run all parts of Gaul. The whole country between the Alps and the Pyrenees, between the Rhine and the Ocean, has been laid waste by hordes of [[Quadi]], [[Vandals]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Alans]], [[Gepids]], Herules, [[Saxons]], [[Burgundians]], [[Allemanni]], and—alas! for the commonweal!-- even [[Pannonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893d|pp=236–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In his Commentary on Daniel, Jerome noted, &quot;Let us not follow the opinion of some commentators and suppose him to be either the Devil or some demon, but rather, one of the human race, in whom Satan will wholly take up his residence in bodily form.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Commentary on Daniel&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1958|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of rebuilding the Jewish Temple to reign from, Jerome  thought the Antichrist sat in God’s Temple inasmuch as he made &quot;himself out to be like God.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Commentary on Daniel&quot; /&gt; He refuted Porphyry’s idea that the &quot;little horn&quot; mentioned in Daniel chapter 7 was Antiochus Epiphanes by noting that the &quot;little horn&quot; is defeated by an eternal, universal ruler, right before the final judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commentary on Daniel&quot; /&gt; Instead, he advocated that the &quot;little horn&quot; was the Antichrist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We should therefore concur with the traditional interpretation of all the commentators of the Christian Church, that at the end of the world, when the Roman Empire is to be destroyed, there shall be ten kings who will partition the Roman world amongst themselves. Then an insignificant eleventh king will arise, who will overcome three of the ten kings... after they have been slain, the seven other kings also will bow their necks to the victor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commentary on Daniel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Circa 380, an apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]] describes Constantine as victorious over Gog and Magog. Later on, it predicts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Roman empire shall have ceased, then the Antichrist will be openly revealed and will sit in the House of the Lord in Jerusalem.  While he is reigning, two very famous men, Elijah and Enoch, will go forth to announce the coming of the Lord. Antichrist will kill them and after three days they will be raised up by the Lord. Then there will be a great persecution, such as has not been before nor shall be thereafter. The Lord will shorten those days for the sake of the elect, and  the Antichrist will be slain by the power of God through Michael the Archangel on the Mount of Olives.&lt;ref name='Sibyl'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://http-server.carleton.ca/~jopp/3850/1-1.htm |title=Latin Tiburtine Sibyl |publisher=Http-server.carleton.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100702171945/http://http-server.carleton.ca/~jopp/3850/1-1.htm| archivedate= 2 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430) wrote &quot;it is uncertain in what temple [the Antichrist] shall sit, whether in that ruin of the temple which was built by Solomon, or in the Church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm City of God, Book 20] chapter 19, cited in Brug's [http://www.wlsessays.net/node/376 A Scriptural and Historical Survey of the Doctrine of the Antichrist]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] wrote to Emperor Maurice A.D. 597, concerning the titles of bishops, &quot;I say with confidence that whoever calls or desires to call himself ‘universal priest’ in self-exaltation of himself is a precursor of the Antichrist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quote from McGinn, Bernard, Visions of the End. Apocalyptic Traditions in the Middle Ages, New York: Columbia
University, 1979. p. 64,.found in Brug's [http://www.wlsessays.net/node/376 A Scriptural and Historical Survey of the Doctrine of the Antichrist]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Church–Pre-Reformation===
[[Arnulf (Archbishop of Reims)|Archbishop Arnulf of Rheims]] disagreed with the policies and morals of [[Pope John XV]]. He expressed his views while presiding over the [[Council of Reims#Council of Reims, 991|Council of Reims]] in A.D. 991. Arnulf accused John XV of being the Antichrist while also using the 2 Thessalonians passage about the Man of Sin, saying, &quot;Surely, if he is empty of charity and filled with vain knowledge and lifted up, he is Antichrist sitting in God's temple and showing himself as God.&quot; This incident is history's earliest record of anyone identifying a pope with the Antichrist (See [[Antichrist (historicism)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bernard McGinn, Antichrist: two thousand years of the human fascination with evil, New York: Columbia University Press, 2000 p. 100. and {{harvnb|Schaff|Schley Schaff|1885|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (c. 1015 or 29 – 1085), struggled against, in his own words, &quot;a robber of temples, a perjurer against the Holy Roman Church, notorious throughout the whole Roman world for the basest of crimes, namely, [[Antipope Clement III|Wilbert]], plunderer of the holy church of Ravenna, Antichrist, and archeritic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://books.google.com/books?id=EgRbpkgRSZAC&amp;pg=PA162 The Correspondence of Pope Gregory VII] trans. Emerton, Ephraim. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990., p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Benno, on the opposite side of the [[Investiture Controversy]], wrote long descriptions of abuses committed by Gregory VII, including necromancy, torture of a former friend upon a bed of nails, commissioning an attempted assassination, executions without trials, unjust excommunication, doubting the Real Presence in the [[Eucharist]], and even burning it.&lt;ref&gt;From long quotations in {{harvnb|Foxe|1583|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benno held that Gregory VII was &quot;either a member of Antichrist, or Antichrist himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted by David M. Whitford, [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1353/ren.2008.0027 The Papal Antichrist: Martin Luther and the Underappreciated Influence of Lorenzo Valla], Renaissance Quarterly, 61:26–52, Spring 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Eberhard II von Truchsees, [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]] in 1241 at the Council of [[Regensburg]] denounced [[Pope Gregory IX]] as &quot;that man of perdition, whom they call Antichrist, who in his extravagant boasting says, I am God, I cannot err.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=YTAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA305,M1 The Methodist Review Vol. XLIII], No. 3, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the ten kingdoms that the Antichrist is involved with&lt;ref&gt;See Daniel {{bibleverse-nb||Daniel|7:23-25|31}}, Revelation {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|13:1-2|31}}, and Revelation {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|17:3-18|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the &quot;Turks, Greeks, Egyptians, Africans, Spaniards, French, English, Germans, Sicilians, and Italians who now occupy the provinces of Rome.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Dictionary of the Bible&quot;&gt;Article on &quot;Antichrist&quot; from Smith and Fuller, [http://books.google.com/books?id=zM0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA147,M1 A Dictionary of the Bible], 1893, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the papacy was the &quot;little horn&quot; of Daniel 7:8:&lt;ref&gt;Daniel {{bibleverse-nb||Daniel|7:8|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A little horn has grown up with eyes and mouth speaking great things, which is reducing three of these kingdoms--i.e. Sicily, Italy, and Germany--to subserviency, is persecuting the people of Christ and the saints of God with intolerable opposition, is confounding things human and divine, and is attempting things unutterable, execrable.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Dictionary of the Bible&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Protestant reformers===
{{Main|Antichrist (historicism)}}

Many Protestant reformers, including [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]], [[John Knox]], and [[Cotton Mather]], identified the Roman [[Papacy]] as the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44 The AntiChrist and The Protestant Reformation]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centuriators of [[Magdeburg]], a group of Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg headed by [[Matthias Flacius]], wrote the 12-volume &quot;[[Magdeburg Centuries]]&quot; to discredit the papacy and identify the pope as the Antichrist. The fifth round of talks in the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue]] notes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In calling the pope the &quot;antichrist,&quot; the early Lutherans stood in a tradition that reached back into the eleventh century. Not only dissidents and heretics but even saints had called the bishop of Rome the &quot;antichrist&quot; when they wished to castigate his abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://books.google.com/books?id=ICCi66SNBUoC&amp;pg=PA140 Building Unity], edited by Burgess and Gross&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:AntichristSOF.jpg|thumb|250px|Woodcut showing the Antichrist, 1498]]

[[William Tyndale]], an English Protestant reformer, held that while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any religious organization that distorted the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise ''The Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that will be with us until the end of the age under different religious disguises from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale, William, ''Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008)at pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the &quot;man of sin&quot; reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newmatthewbible.org/antichrist.html &quot;Tyndale's Doctrine of Antichrist and His Translation of 2 Thessalonians 2&quot;], R. Davis, New Matthew Bible Project. (A shorter version of this article was also published in the Tyndale Society Journal No. 36, Spring 2009, under the title ''Tyndale, the Church, and the Doctrine of Antichrist'')&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[King James Bible]] committee, which followed the Vulgate more closely.

===Counter-Reformation===
The view of [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurism]], a product of the [[Counter-Reformation]], was advanced beginning in the 16th century in response to the identification of the Papacy as Antichrist. [[Francisco Ribera]], a [[Jesuit]] priest, developed this theory in ''In Sacrum Beati Ioannis Apostoli, &amp; Evangelistiae Apocalypsin Commentarij'', his 1585 treatise on the [[Apocalypse of John]]. [[St. Bellarmine]] codified this view, giving in full the Catholic theory set forth by the Greek and Latin Fathers, of a personal Antichrist to come just before the end of the world and to be accepted by the [[Jew]]s and enthroned in the temple at [[Jerusalem]] — thus endeavoring to dispose of the exposition which saw Antichrist in the pope. Most premillennial [[dispensationalism|dispensationalists]] now accept Bellarmine's interpretation in modified form.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Widespread [[Protestant]] identification of the Papacy as the Antichrist persisted in the USA until the early 1900s when the [[Scofield Reference Bible]] was published by [[Cyrus Scofield]]. This commentary promoted Futurism, causing a decline in the Protestant identification of the Papacy as Antichrist.

Some US Futurists hold that sometime prior to the expected [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], there will be a period of &quot;great tribulation&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Matthew 24:21 (King James Version)| publisher =BibleGateway.com| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=24&amp;verse=21&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse| accessdate =2007-12-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080116002648/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=24&amp;verse=21&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse| archivedate= 16 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which the Antichrist, indwelt and controlled by Satan, will attempt to win supporters with false peace, supernatural signs. He will silence all that defy him by refusing to &quot;receive his mark&quot; on their right hands or forehead. This &quot;mark&quot; will be required to legally partake in the end-time economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Revelation 13:16-17 (King James Version)| publisher =BibleGateway.com| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013:16-17;&amp;version=9;| accessdate =2007-12-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071203184459/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013:16-17;&amp;version=9;| archivedate= 3 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Futurists believe that the Antichrist will be assassinated half way through the Tribulation, being revived and indwelt by Satan.

===Old Believers===
After the reforms of [[Patriarch Nikon]] to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] of 1652, a large number of [[Old Believers]] held that czar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] was the Antichrist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/pe/Peter1-Rus.html|title=Peter I, czar of Russia|publisher=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2008-02-10| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080212044338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/pe/Peter1-Rus.html| archivedate= 12 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his treatment of the Orthodox Church, namely subordinating the church to the state, requiring clergymen to conform to the standards of all Russian civilians (shaved beards, being fluent in French), and requiring them to pay state taxes.

===Age of Enlightenment===
Bernard McGinn noted that complete denial of the Antichrist was rare until the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Following frequent use of &quot;Antichrist&quot; laden rhetoric during religious controversies in the 17th century, the use of the concept declined in the 18th century. Subsequent eighteenth-century efforts to cleanse Christianity of &quot;legendary&quot; or &quot;folk&quot; accretions effectively removed the Antichrist from discussion in mainstream Western churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabinetmagazine.org&quot;/&gt;

==Other identities ==

===As &quot;Man of sin&quot;===
The Antichrist has been equated with the &quot;Man of sin&quot; of [[2 Thessalonians]] 2, even though commentaries of the ''Man of sin's'' identity greatly varies.&lt;ref&gt;Schink, W.F. &quot;The Scriptural Doctrine of the Antichrist.&quot; ''Our Great Heritage: Vol. 3'' Ed. Lange, Lyle and Albrecht, Jerome G. Milwaukee: Northwestern Publishing house, 1991. p. 572.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;man of sin&quot; has been identified with [[Caligula]],&lt;ref name=&quot;netbible&quot;/&gt; [[Nero]],&lt;ref&gt;[[St. John Chrysostom]], Homilies on II Thess., Nicene-Post Nicene Fathers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preteristcentral.com/pgt-man-of-sin.htm Man of Sin], Kurt Simmons&lt;/ref&gt; and the end times Antichrist. Some scholars believe that the passage contains no genuine prediction, but represents a speculation of the apostle's own, based on {{bibleverse||Dan|8:23ff}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Dan|11:36ff}}, and on contemporary ideas of the Antichrist.&lt;ref name=&quot;netbible&quot;&gt;[http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=MAN%20OF%20SIN Net Bible: Man of sin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(compare [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bousset]], Der Antichrist, 93 ff, etc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===As &quot;being in league with other figures&quot;===
Several American [[evangelical]] and [[fundamentalist]] theologians, including [[Cyrus Scofield]], have identified the Antichrist as being in league with (or the same as) several figures in the [[Book of Revelation]] including the Dragon (or [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]), the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]], the [[False Prophet]], and the [[Whore of Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;See footnotes in [http://www.studylight.org/com/srn/view.cgi?book=re Revelation 7 and 13] in the ''Scofield Reference Bible'', 1917&lt;/ref&gt; Others, for example, Rob Bell, reject the identification of the Antichrist with any one person or group. They believe a loving Christ would not view anyone as an enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Rob; Golden, Don ''Jesus Wants to Save Christians'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Satan===
Bernard McGinn described multiple traditions detailing the relationship between the Antichrist and Satan. In the dualist approach, Satan will become incarnate in the Antichrist, just as [[Incarnation of Jesus|God became incarnate in Jesus]]. However, in [[Orthodox Christianity|orthodox]] Christian thought, this view was problematic because it was too similar to Christ's incarnation. Instead, the &quot;indwelling&quot; view became more accepted. It stipulates that the Antichrist is a human figure inhabited by Satan, since the latter’s power is not to be seen as equivalent to God’s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabinetmagazine.org&quot;&gt;See McGinn, Bernard, ''Antichrist'', 2000, Columbia University Press; http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/5/widholm.php accessed October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Lucifer===
In [[Mormonism]], the ''Antichrist'' &quot;is anyone or anything that counterfeits the true gospel or plan of salvation and that openly or secretly is set up in opposition to [[Christ]] and the changes he wants made to his Church when he wants them done. The great antichrist is [[Lucifer]], but he has many assistants&lt;ref&gt;[[Korihor]] is directly referred to in ''The Book of Mormon'' as an anti-Christ ([[Book of Alma|Alma]] 30:6)&lt;/ref&gt; both as spirit beings and as mortals.&quot; [[Latter-day Saint]]s use the [[New Testament]] scriptures, [[1 John]] 2:18, 22; [[1 John]] 4:3-6; [[2 John]] 1:7 and the [[Book of Mormon]], [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]] 7:1-23, [[Book of Alma|Alma]] 1:2-16, Alma 30:6-60, in their [[exegesis]] of the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LDS|first=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|title=Bible Dictionary: Antichrist|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/antichrist?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As &quot;Masih ad-Dajjal&quot;===
{{Eschatology}}
'''[[Masih ad-Dajjal]]''' ({{lang-ar|الدّجّال}}, literally &quot;The Deceiving Messiah&quot;), is an evil figure in [[Islamic eschatology]]. He is to appear pretending to be God at a time in the future, before [[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyamah]] (The Day of Resurrection, Judgment Day). He will travel around the globe entering every city except [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] obliging people to believe in him as a God. Then Isa (Jesus) will descend from the sky to the White lighthouse in eastern [[Bethlehem]], [[Palestine]], placing his hands on the backs of two angels at the time of Fajr. This will happen at the time of the Dajjal and Isa will be the one to eventually defeat the Dajjal, killing him with his spear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|41|7023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam.tc/prophecies/masdaj.html Who is the evil Dajjal (the &quot;anti-Christ&quot;)?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ahmadiyya]] teachings interpret the prophecies regarding the appearance of the ''Dajjal'' (Anti-Christ) and [[Gog and Magog]] in Islamic eschatology as foretelling the emergence of two branches or aspects of the same turmoil and trial that was to be faced by Islam in the latter days and that both emerged from Christianity or Christian nations. Its Dajjal aspect relates to deception and perversion of religious belief while its aspect to do with disturbance in the realm of politics and the shattering of world peace has been called Gog and Magog. Thus Ahmadis consider the widespread Christian missionary activity that was aggressively active in the 18th and 19th centuries as being part of the prophesied Dajjal (Antichrist) and Gog and Magog emerging in modern times. The emergence of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[USA]] as superpowers and the conflict between the two nations (i.e., the rivalry between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]]) are seen as having occurred in accordance with certain prophecies regarding Gog and Magog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Islam%20and%20Communism-20080615MN.pdf Islam and Communism]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahmadis believe that prophecies and sayings about the Antichrist are not to be interpreted literally and hold deeper meanings. [[Masih ad-Dajjal]] is then a name to given to latter day [[Christianity]] and [[Europe|the west]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_6_section_2.html &quot;Unveiling of the 'Unseen' by the Quran&quot; in &quot;Knowledge Revealation, Rationality and Truth&quot; by Mirza Tahir Ahmad], hosted on Al Islam, the Official Website of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot;===
In the [[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]], [[Theosophy|Theosophist]] [[Alice A. Bailey]] asserts that [[World War II]] was a cosmic conflict between [[good and evil|good]] and [[evil]]. The [[Ascended masters|Masters of the Wisdom]], representing the ''[[Magic (paranormal)|Forces of Light]]'', were on the side of the [[Allies]]; the ''[[Black magic|Dark Forces]]'' were on the side of the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. According to Bailey, [[Adolf Hitler]] was [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by the Dark Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 Lucis Publishing Co. See under &quot;Hitler&quot; in index&lt;/ref&gt; With the defeat of the axis by the allies in 1945, the stage was set for the appearance of [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] to inaugurate the [[New Age]]. Alice A. Bailey's follower [[Benjamin Creme]] claims to be the one called to prepare the way for this to happen, and that it is possible that it could happen because Adolf Hitler was the Anti-Christ and he was defeated in World War II.

==Use in popular culture==
{{main|List of fictional Antichrists}}
[[File:Peter's Cross.svg|thumb|right|100px|The inverted cross is sometimes used as the symbol of Antichrist. It is also seen as the [[Cross of St Peter]].]]
The term &quot;Antichrist&quot; is widely used through popular culture, and most prominently in [[punk subculture]]. This trend was spurred by the [[Sex Pistols|Sex Pistols']] song &quot;[[Anarchy in the UK]]&quot;, in which lead singer [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] proclaimed that he was an Antichrist. After the release of the song, adherents of the punk culture began to use the word as a term to describe someone who is very vulgar, crude, or rebellious. However, after Johnny Rotten's denouncement of useless violence in his years with [[Public Image Ltd]], this trend began to subside with those who had used it for the sheer sake of being &quot;punk&quot;. It is now used in the fringe groups of anarcho-punks and is most commonly used to describe those who practice violent and sensational forms of anarchy.
