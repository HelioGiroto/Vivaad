==anattā, the absence of ego-centeredness==
I thought that anatta is the absence of ego, not &quot;absense of ego-centeredness&quot; as given in this article. I have heard people, especially Western people, who would like there to be a nice, common sense, not-self-contradictory-to-logical-thought Buddhism, describe Buddhist enlightment as freedom from self-centeredness (i.e. &quot;nice&quot;). But as far as I am aware, the Buddha teaches the opposite of Descartes and is irreconcilable with reverance for the liars paradox; the Buddha teaches &quot;I am not&quot; - or at least, I (and ego and atta) are but names or signs signifying nothing (c.f [http://web.singnet.com.sg/~rjp31831/nagasena.htm Questions of King Milinda]). Buddhism is even scarier than &quot;The Matrix&quot; because when you wake up, you aren't, and that is a main reason why people do not wake up. We are in love with ourselves and do not want to face the ultimate absense. --[[User:Timtak|Timtak]] 10:58, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

:As far as I understand the Buddhist concept of enlightenment, if you ignore the mythical nonsense, it's about undoing the &quot;first cut&quot; (i.e. distinction between one's self and the outer world) and thus &quot;being one&quot; with the universe. &amp;mdash; [[User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:Ashmodai|talk]] &amp;middot; [[Special:Contributions/Ashmodai|contribs]])&lt;/sup&gt; 22:02, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

= Ambiguous sentence in Introduction =

There is an ambiguous sentence in the first paragraph that can be read to mean that some bhodisattvas have attained bhodi.  I know this because someone used it in argument at e-sangha to prove that assertion!

Here is the passage containing fatal sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In early Buddhism, bodhi carried a meaning synonymous to nirvana, using only some different metaphors to describe the experience, which implied the extinction of raga (greed), dosa (hate) and moha (delusion). In the later school of Mahayana Buddhism, the status of nirvana was downgraded, coming to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate, implying that delusion was still present in one who attained nirvana, and that one needed to attain bodhi to eradicate delusion [1]. Therefore, according to Mahayana Buddhism, the arahant attains only nirvana, thus still being subject to delusion, while '''the bodhisattva attains bodhi.'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's hard to read that sentence without filling in the blank, so the problem is almost invisible.  I'm going to fix it right now, for the sake of all sentient beings, or at least those who read Wikipedia an don't know the difference between a bodhisattva and a Buddha.  I think I it would helpul if someone to wrote a response to this confirming that I'm not pulling a fast one.

==Definition given is incompatible with basic Buddhist doctrine.  I have replaced the first paragraph.==

The definition given in the first sentence of this article may make sense in other traditions, but it contradicts the Buddhist conception of enlightenment in a fundamental way.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bodhi (बोधि) is the Pāli and Sanskrit word for the &quot;awakened&quot; or &quot;knowing&quot; consciousness of a fully liberated yogi,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A buddha or an arahant can be described as a yogi, but not that kind of yogi.  (As far as I know, in Buddhist terminology &quot;yogi&quot; means &quot;someone who meditates.&quot;)  Anything that might be called &quot;an awakened consciousness&quot; is not nirvana,and is not bodhi.

This may not be the same in other Indian traditions, and I have added a sentence to cover that.  Someone knowledgeable in the subject should add a section on this topic.[[User:SeattleJoe|SeattleJoe]] ([[User talk:SeattleJoe|talk]]) 04:28, 5 April 2008 (UTC)

==Clean up==
I've tried to clean up the article, by removing double information, over-extensive quotes, and summarizing the Buddhist path. It's arbitary, of course, the choices I've made, so any comment is welcome. [[User:Joshua Jonathan|Joshua Jonathan]] ([[User talk:Joshua Jonathan|talk]]) 10:53, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
:Nice job.  I think the {{tlx|citation style}} still is appropriate though. [[User:Toddst1|Toddst1]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk: Toddst1|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:33, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
The Buddhist Path-section is a resumee of the previous text. Maybe it can be deleted altogether. But I'll see what I can do, regarding the sources. [[User:Joshua Jonathan|Joshua Jonathan]] ([[User talk:Joshua Jonathan|talk]]) 16:46, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

== Compassion ==

Besides enlightenment, mind-matter also 'strives' for compassion - [[bodhicitta]]. Can this please be integrated, i added the keyword in the 'See Also' section for now. [[User:Wakari07|Wakari07]] ([[User talk:Wakari07|talk]]) 23:51, 17 September 2012 (UTC)</text>
