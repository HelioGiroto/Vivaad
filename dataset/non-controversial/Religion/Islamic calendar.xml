{{Islam}}
The '''Islamic calendar''', '''Muslim calendar''' or '''Hijri calendar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ar|التقويم الهجري}} ''at-taqwīm al-hijrī''; [[Persian language|Persian]]: تقویم هجری قمری  ''taqvim-e hejri-ye qamari''; {{lang-tr|Hicri Takvim}}; {{lang-ur|اسلامی تقویم}} ''Islami taqwīm''; {{lang-id|Kalender Hijriah}}; {{lang-ms|Takwim Hijrah}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hijracalendar.com/ Hijra Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[lunar calendar]] consisting of 12 [[lunar month|months]] in a year of 354 or 355 days. Being a purely lunar calendar, it is not synchronized with the [[season]]s. With an annual drift of 10 or 11 days, the seasonal relation repeats about every 33 Islamic years.

It is used to date events in many [[List of Muslim-majority countries|Muslim countries]] (concurrently with the [[Gregorian calendar]]), and used by [[Muslim]]s everywhere to determine the proper days on which to observe the annual fast (see [[Ramadan]]), to attend [[Hajj]], and to celebrate other [[Islamic holidays]] and festivals.

The [[epoch (reference date)|first year]] was the Islamic year beginning in AD 622 during which the emigration of [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], known as the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], occurred. Each numbered year is designated either H for ''Hijra'' or AH for the [[Latin]] ''[[anno Hegirae]]'' (in the [[Hijri year|year of the Hijra]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Watt, W.

Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Hidjra| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | id = ISSN 1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence, Muslims typically call their calendar the Hijri calendar.

The current Islamic year is 1433 AH.  In the Gregorian calendar 1433 AH runs from approximately 26 November 2011 (evening) to 14 November 2012 (evening).{{Update after|2012|11|14}}

[[wikiquote:Qur'an#The_Immunity_.28Al-Bara.27at.29|Four]] of the twelve Hijri months  are considered sacred, although there is disagreement over the designated  months, such as between proponents for the sequences {7,11,12,1} vs. {12,1,2,3}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appx.15 - PilgrFile: Hajj &amp; `Umrah|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/appendices/appendix15.html#pilgrimage|work=The Four Months of Hajj|publisher=United Submitters International|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve Hijri months are named as follows in Arabic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author =B. van Dalen |coauthors = R.S.

==Days of the week==
In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the &quot;first day&quot; of the week corresponds with Sunday of the planetary week. The Islamic and Jewish weekdays begin at sunset, whereas the medieval Christian and planetary weekdays begin at the following midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Trawicky (2000) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian [[liturgical day]], however, kept in monasteries, begins with [[vespers]] (see [[wiktionary:vesper|vesper]]), which is evening, in line with the other [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] traditions. Muslims gather for worship at a [[mosque]] at noon on &quot;gathering day&quot; ({{transl|ar|DIN|Yaum al-Jumu‘ah}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|yawm}} {{lang|ar|يوم}} means ‘day’) which corresponds with Friday. Thus &quot;gathering day&quot; is often regarded as the weekly day of rest. This is frequently made official, with many Muslim countries adopting Friday and Saturday (e.g. [[Egypt]]) or Thursday and Friday (e.g. [[Saudi Arabia]]) as official [[weekend]]s, during which offices are closed; other countries (e.g. [[Iran]]) choose to make Friday alone a day of rest, and few others (e.g. [[Morocco]]) adopted the Western Saturday-Sunday weekend while making Friday a working day with a long midday break to allow time off for worship.

==History==
{{Muslimmonths}}

===Pre-Islamic calendar===
  
Inscriptions of the ancient [[South Arabia]]n calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these calendars followed the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar system]]. For Central Arabia, especially [[Mecca]], there is a lack of epigraphical evidence but details are found in the writings of Muslim authors of the [[Abbasid]] era. Both [[al-Biruni]] and [[al-Mas'udi]] suggest that the Ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-Tarikh&quot; /&gt;
  
The Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that the Arabs of [[Ḥijāz]] distinguished between two types of months, permitted (''ḥalāl'') and forbidden (''ḥarām'') months. The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the [[hajj|pilgrimage]] season, Dhū al-Qiʿda, Dhū al-Ḥijja, and Muḥarram. Information about the forbidden months is also found in the writings of [[Procopius]], where he describes an armistice with the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir which happened in the summer of 541 AD. However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The [[Qur'an]] links the four forbidden months with ''Nasīʾ'', a word that literally means &quot;postponement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-Tarikh&quot; /&gt; According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of [[Kinanah]],&lt;ref name=Moberg2/&gt; by a man known as the ''al-Qalammas'' of Kinanah and his descendants (pl. ''qalāmisa'').&lt;ref name=Kitab /&gt;

Different interpretations of the concept of ''Nasīʾ'' have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the various theories and a discussion of the problem of &quot;hindsight chronology&quot; in early and pre-Islamic sources, see [http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/978/1/978.pdf?EThOS%20(BL) Maurice A. McPartlan, ''The Contribution of Qu'rān and Hadīt to Early Islamic Chronology'' (Durham, 1997)].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, both Muslim&lt;ref&gt;Mahmud Effendi (1858), as discussed in Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, ''[http://www.archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars]'' (London: 1901), pp.  460–470.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to &quot;Tradition&quot;, repeatedly cited by F.C.  De Blois.&lt;/ref&gt; and Western,&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-Tarikh&quot;&gt;F.C. De Blois, &quot;TAʾRĪKH&quot;: I.1.iv.  &quot;Pre-Islamic and agricultural calendars of the Arabian peninsula&quot;, ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd edition, '''X''':260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moberg2&gt;A. Moberg, &quot;NASI'&quot;, ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd, VII:977.&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] calendar used in Central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, ''Nasīʾ'' is related to the Pagan practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like [[Ibn Hisham]], [[Ibn Manzur]], and the corpus of [[tafsir|Qur'anic exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 4th| publisher = Al-maktaba al-tijāriyya| last = Muḥammad al-Khuḍarī Bayk| title = Muḥāḍarāt tārīkh al-Umam al-Islāmiyya| year = 1935| pages=59–60| volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also corroborated by an early [[Sabaic]] inscription, where a religious ritual was &quot;postponed&quot;  (''ns'ʾw'') due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ''ns'ʾ'' has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendering postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of ''Nasīʾ''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-Tarikh&quot; /&gt; Thus the [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] concludes that the &quot;The Arabic system of [Nasīʾ] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd edition, Index, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Others concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] it was transformed into a [[lunisolar calendar]] containing an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary month]] added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]], and later by [[al-Biruni]],&lt;ref name=Kitab&gt;[[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]] (787–886), ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k93171b.image.f166.langFR Kitab al-Uluf]'', ''Journal Asiatique'', series 5, '''xi''' (1858) 168+. {{fr icon}} {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Biruni&gt;[[al-Biruni]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=kUpmAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA73,M1 &quot;Intercalation of the Ancient Arabs&quot;, ''The Chronology of Ancient Nations''], tr. [[Eduard Sachau|C. Edward Sachau]], (London: William H. Allen, 1000/1879) 13–14, 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[al-Mas'udi]], and some Western scholars.&lt;ref name=Moberg1&gt;A. Moberg, &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=9JQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA856,M1 NASI']&quot;, ''E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation considers ''Nasīʾ'' to be a synonym to the Arabic word for &quot;intercalation&quot; (''kabīsa''). It also suggests that every second or third year the beginning of the year was postponed by one month. The intercalation doubled the month of the pilgrimage, that is, the month of the pilgrimage and the following month were given the same name, postponing the names and the sanctity of all subsequent months in the year by one. The first intercalation doubled the first month Muharram, then three years later the second month Safar was doubled, continuing until the intercalation had passed through all twelve months of the year and returned to Muharram, when it was repeated. The Arabs, according to one explanation mentioned by Abu Ma'shar, learned of this type of intercalation from the Jews.&lt;ref name=Moberg2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kitab/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biruni/&gt;

===Prohibiting Nasīʾ===
{{Further|Nasi'}}
&lt;!-- Please see [[Talk:Muhammad/FAQ]] and discuss on the talk page before removing this image--&gt;[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|Muhammad prohibiting nasīʾ. Found in an illustrated copy of [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Bīrūnī]]'s ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'' (17th century copy of an early 14th century [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] manuscript).&lt;ref&gt;From an illustrated manuscript of Al-Biruni's 11th c. ''[[Vestiges of the Past]]'' (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Arabe 1489 fol. 5v. (Bibliothèque Nationale on-line catalog). See also: Robert Hillenbrand, &quot;Images of Muhammad in al-Bīrūnī's Chronology of Ancient Nations&quot;, in: R. Hillenbrand (ed.), ''Persian Painting from the Mongols to the Qajars: Studies in Honour of Basil W. Robinson'' (Londen/New York: I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2000), pp. 129-146.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

In the tenth year of the Hijra, as documented in the [[Qur'an]] ([[At-Tawba|sura 9]]:36–37), [[God in Islam|God]] revealed the &quot;prohibition of the Nasīʾ&quot;.
{{Quote|The number of months with Allah has been twelve months by Allah's ordinance since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of these four are known as forbidden [to fight in]; That is the straight usage, so do not wrong yourselves therein, and fight those who go astray. But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.&lt;br&gt;Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief: The [[Kafir|Unbelievers]] are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year, and forbidden another year, of months forbidden by Allah and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.|[[Sura]] 9 (At-Tawba), [[ayah|ayat]] 36-37&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|36|e=37|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The prohibition of ''Nasīʾ'' would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month had returned to its position just before [[Nasi (month)|the month of Nasi']] began. If Nasīʾ meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between 1 AH and 10 AH are uncertain; Western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the [[Battle of Badr]], the [[Battle of Uhud]] and the [[Battle of the Trench]], should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two or even three lunar months.

This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the [[The Farewell Sermon|farewell sermon]] which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijja 10 AH (Julian date Friday March 6, AD 632) on [[Mount Arafat]] during the [[The Farewell Pilgrimage|farewell pilgrimage]] to Mecca.

{{quote|Certainly the Nasi' is an impious addition, which has led the infidels into error. One year they authorise the Nasi', another year they forbid it. They observe the divine precept with respect to the number of the sacred months, but in fact they profane that which God has declared to be inviolable, and sanctify that which God has declared to be profane. Assuredly time, in its revolution, has returned to such as it was at the creation of the heavens and the earth. In the eyes of God the number of the months is twelve. Among these twelve months four are sacred, namely, Rajab, which stands alone, and three others which are consecutive.|translated by Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby&lt;ref&gt;Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, ''[http://www.archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars]'' (London: 1901) 370.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The three successive forbidden months mentioned by Muhammad (months in which battles are forbidden) are [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]], [[Dhu al-Hijjah]], and [[Muharram]], months 11, 12, and 1. The single forbidden month is [[Rajab]], month 7. These months were considered forbidden both within the new Islamic calendar and within the old pagan Meccan calendar.

==Numbering the years==
{{main|Hijri year}}
[[File:Lunar eclipse al-Biruni.jpg|250px|thumb|An illustration from [[al-Biruni]]'s astronomical works, explains the different [[phases of the moon]].]]

In pre-Islamic Arabia, it was customary to identify a year after a major event which took place in it. Thus, according to Islamic tradition, [[Abraha]], governor of Yemen, then a province of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Aksumite Empire|Kingdom of Aksum]] ([[Ethiopia]]), attempted to destroy the [[Kaaba]] with an army which included several [[elephant]]s. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year became known as the ''[[Year of the Elephant]]'', during which Muhammad was born (sura [[al-Fil]]). Most equate this to the year AD 570, but a minority use AD 571.

The first ten years of the Hijra were not numbered, but were named after events in the life of Muhammad according to [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [http://www.archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) 376.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The year of permission.
# The year of the order of fighting.
# The year of the trial.
# The year of congratulation on marriage.
# The year of the earthquake.
# The year of enquiring.
# The year of gaining victory.
# The year of equality.
# The year of exemption.
# The year of farewell.

In AD 638 (17 AH), [[Abu Musa Ashaari]], one of the officials of the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] in [[Basra]]h, complained about the absence of any years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims.  After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should include the date of Muhammad's arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad's arrival). [[Uthman ibn Affan]] then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muis.gov.sg/cms/uploadedFiles/PortalSG/Community/Khutbah/E08Jan11%20-%20Appreciating%20Islamic%20History.doc Appreciating Islamic History] (Microsoft Word document, 569KB)&lt;/ref&gt; The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad's arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi' I.&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;/&gt; Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijra calendar.

The first day of the first month of the Islamic calendar (1 Muharram 1 AH) was Friday, 16 July AD 622, the equivalent civil tabular date (same daylight period) in the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [http://www.archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) pp.373-5, 382-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html ''Calendrica'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic day began at the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July. This Julian date (16 July) was determined by [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Muslim astronomers]] by projecting back in time their own [[tabular Islamic calendar]], which had alternating 30- and 29-day months in each lunar year plus eleven leap days every 30 years. For example, al-Biruni mentioned this Julian date in the year AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[[al-Biruni]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=kUpmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327 ''The chronology of ancient nations''], tr. [[C. Edward Sachau]] (1000/1879) 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not used by either medieval Muslim astronomers or modern scholars to determine the Islamic epoch, the thin [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] would have also first become visible (assuming clouds did not obscure it) shortly after the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July, 1.5 days after the associated [[dark moon]] (astronomical [[new moon]]) on the morning of 14 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases0601.html NASA phases of the moon 601–700]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[Michael Cook (historian)|Cook]] and [[Patricia Crone|Crone]] in ''[[Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'' cite a coin from 17 AH, the first surviving attested use of a Hijri calendar date alongside a date in another calendar ([[Coptic calendar|Coptic]]) is on a [[papyrus]] from [[Egypt]] in 22 AH, [[PERF 558]].

==Astronomical considerations==

The Islamic calendar is not to be confused with a [[lunar calendar]] that is based on astronomical calculations. The latter is based on a year of 12 months adding up to 354.37 days. Each lunar month begins at the time of the monthly &quot;conjunction&quot;, when the Moon is located on a straight line between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a rotation of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e. the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds one day to the Gregorian calendar, every four years.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Biémont, Rythmes du temps, Astronomie et calendriers, De Borck, 2000, 393p&lt;/ref&gt; The technical details of the adjustment are described in [[Tabular Islamic calendar]].

The Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabsir.net/?p=633#more-633 Khalid Chraibi: Issues in the Islamic Calendar, Tabsir.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Each month has either 29 or 30 days, but usually in no discernible order. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the [[Hilal (crescent moon)|hilal]] (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries.

This traditional practice is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring the beginning of a new month on its territory. But, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Karim Meziane et [[Nidhal Guessoum]]: La visibilité du croissant lunaire et le ramadan, La Recherche n° 316, janvier 1999, pp. 66–71&lt;/ref&gt; Given the fact that the moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its &quot;age&quot; since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48 h period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.

A number of Muslim countries try to overcome some of these difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries say they do on this subject, and what they actually do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moonsighting.com/methods.html Moonsighting.com - Methods for beginning of Islamic months in different countries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oumma.com/Le-mois-islamique-est-il-universel Khalid Chraibi: Le mois islamique est-il universel ou national ?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological considerations==
If the Islamic calendar were prepared using astronomical calculations, Muslims throughout the Muslim world could use it to meet all their needs, the way they use the Gregorian calendar today. But, there are divergent views on whether it is licit to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Allal el Fassi : « Aljawab assahih wannass-hi al-khaliss ‘an nazilati fas wama yata’allaqo bimabda-i acchouhouri al-islamiyati al-arabiyah », &quot;[...] and the beginning of Islamic Arab months&quot;, report prepared at the request of King Hassan II of Morocco, Rabat, 1965 (36 p.), with no indication of editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of theologians oppose the use of calculations (beyond the constraint that each month must be not less than 29 nor more than 30 days) on the grounds that the latter would not conform with Muhammad's recommendation to observe the new moon of Ramadan and Shawal in order to determine the beginning of these months.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Mutawalla al-Shaârawi : Fiqh al-halal wal haram (edited by Ahmad Azzaâbi), Dar al-Qalam, Beyrouth, 2000, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some theologians also interpret Surah al-Baqarah 2:185 as requiring direct sighting, but they represent only a minority. The Quranic verse reads as follows : &quot;185. The month of Ramadân in which was revealed the Qur'ân, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadân i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Saum (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Saum (fasts) must be made up] from other days. God intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify God [i.e. to say Takbîr (Allāhu-Akbar; God is the Most Great) on seeing the crescent of the months of Ramadân and Shawwâl] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlivo.com/translations/Hilali%20Khan.htm Interpretation of the Meaning of The Noble Quran Translated into the English Language By Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali Ph.D. &amp; Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some [[Ulama|jurists]] see no contradiction between Muhammad's teachings and the use of calculations to determine the beginnings of lunar months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/Arabic/contemporary/2003/10/article03.shtml Abderrahman al-Haj : « The faqih, the politician and the determination of lunar months » (in arabic)]&lt;/ref&gt; They consider that Muhammad's recommendation was adapted to the culture of the times, and should not be confused with the acts of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Allal el Fassi : &quot;Aljawab assahih...&quot; op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The dynasty of Fatimids in Egypt used a tabular pre-calculated calendar over a period of two centuries, between the 10th and 12th centuries, before a change of political regime reactivated the procedure of observation of the new moon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/islamic.html Helmer Aslaksen: The Islamic calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, jurists [[Ahmad Muhammad Shakir]] and [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] both endorsed the use of calculations to determine the beginning of all months of the Islamic calendar, in 1939 and 2004 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahmadmuhammadshakir.blogspot.com/ Ahmad Shakir : « The beginning of arab months … is it legal to determine it using astronomical calculations? » (published in arabic in 1939) reproduced in the Arab daily « Al-Madina », 13 october 2006 (n° 15878)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/Arabic/contemporary/2004/10/article01b.shtml Yusuf al-Qaradawi : « Astronomical calculations and determination of the beginning of months » (in arabic)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of Shakir's legal opinion on the subject, see &quot;Issue N° 9&quot; in [http://tabsir.net/?p=633#more-633 Khalid Chraibi: Issues in the Islamic Calendar, Tabsir.net]&lt;/ref&gt; So did the &quot;[[Fiqh Council of North America]]&quot; (FCNA) in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiqhcouncil.org/Default.aspx?tabid=55 Fiqh Council of North America Islamic lunar calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbwayland.org/include/CalculationsFiqhPosition.pdf Zulfikar Ali Shah The astronomical calculations: a fiqhi discussion]&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;[[European Council for Fatwa and Research]]&quot; (ECFR) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbwayland.org/include/MoonsightingDecisionWeb.pdf Islamic Center of Boston, Wayland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of the issues and the FCNA and ECFR positions, see : [http://tabsir.net/?p=621#more-621 Khalid Chraibi: Can the Umm al Qura calendar serve as a global Islamic calendar? Tabsir.net]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[Dawoodi Bohra]] follows the tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) prepared on the basis of astronomical calculations from the days of Fatimid [[imam]]s.

==Saudi Arabia's Umm al-Qura calendar==
[[Saudi Arabia]] uses the sighting method to determine the beginning of each month of the Hijri calendar. Since AH 1419 (1998/99) several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month. Nevertheless, the religious authorities also allow the testimony of less experienced observers and thus often announce the sighting of the lunar crescent on a date when none of the official committees could see it.

The country also uses the Umm al-Qura calendar, based on astronomical calculations, but this is restricted to administrative purposes. The parameters used in the establishment of this calendar underwent significant changes over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.icoproject.org/pdf/khan_2001.pdf Crescent sighting using the Uml al Qura calendar in Saudi Arabia]|268&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/ummalqura.htm The Umm al-Qura Calendar of Saudi Arabia by Robert Harry van Gent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before AH 1420 (before 18 April 1999), if the moon's age at sunset in [[Riyadh]] was at least 12 hours, then the day ''ending'' at that sunset was the first day of the month. This often caused the Saudis to celebrate holy days one or even two days before other predominantly Muslim countries, including the dates for the Hajj, which can only be dated using Saudi dates because it is performed in Mecca.

For AH 1420–22, if moonset occurred after sunset at Mecca, then the day beginning at that sunset was the first day of a Saudi month, essentially the same rule used by Malaysia, Indonesia, and others (except for the location from which the hilal was observed).

Since the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.

In 2007, the [[Islamic Society of North America]], the Fiqh Council of North America and the European Council for Fatwa and Research announced that they will henceforth use a calendar based on calculations, using the same parameters as the Umm al-Qura calendar, to determine (well in advance) the beginning of all lunar months (and therefore the days associated with all religious observances). This was intended as a first step on the way to unify Muslims' calendars throughout the world, in some future time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://progmuslim.meetup.com/14/messages/boards/thread/3449676 Ramadan and Eid announcement by the Fiqh Council of North America (revised)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tabsir.net/?p=621#more-621 Khalid Chraibi : Can the Umm al Qura calendar serve as a global Islamic calendar?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other calendars using the Islamic era==
The [[Iranian_calendars#Modern calendar (Solar_Hejri)|Solar Hejri]] is a solar calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan which counts its years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in AD 622.

==Tabular Islamic calendar==
{{Main|Tabular Islamic calendar}}
There exists a variation of the Islamic calendar known as the tabular Islamic calendar in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation. It has a 30-year cycle with 11 [[leap year]]s of 355 days and 19 years of 354 days. In the long term, it is accurate to one day in about 2,500 years. It also deviates up to about one or two days in the short term.This calendar is a type of Fatimid calendar and followed by the Dawoodi Bohra in true sense.

==Kuwaiti algorithm==
{{Main|Kuwaiti algorithm}}
[[Microsoft]] uses the &quot;Kuwaiti algorithm&quot;, a variant of the tabular Islamic calendar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/islam_tabcal.htm#kuwait The &quot;Kuwaiti Algorithm&quot;] (Robert van Gent)&lt;/ref&gt; to convert Gregorian dates to the Islamic ones. Microsoft claims that the variant is based on a statistical analysis of historical data from [[Kuwait]].

==Notable dates==
{{Main|Muslim holidays}}
Important dates in the Islamic (Hijri) year are:
* 1 Muharram ([[Islamic New Year]])
* 10 Muharram ([[Day of Ashura]]) For [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]s, the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] by [[Moses]] ([[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]]). For [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]]s, the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of Muhammad, and his followers.
* 12 Rabi al Awal ([[Mawlid|Mawlid an Nabi]] for some Sunnis)
* 17 Rabi al Awal (Mawlid an Nabi for [[Twelver]]s and some Sunnis)
* 27 Rajab ([[Isra and Mi'raj]] for some Muslims)
* 15 Sha'ban ([[Mid-Sha'ban]], or Night of Forgiveness), and for Twelvers the birthday of [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]] (The Twelfth Imam)
* 1 Ramadan (First day of fasting)
* 27 Ramadan (Nuzul Al-Qur'an) The day Muhammad received the first verses of the [[Qur'an]] (17 Ramadan in Indonesia and Malaysia)
* Last third of Ramadan which includes [[Laylat al-Qadr]]
* 1 Shawwal ([[Eid ul-Fitr]])
* 8-13 Dhu al-Hijjah (the Hajj to Mecca)
* 9 Dhu al-Hijjah ([[Day of Arafa]])
* 10 Dhu al-Hijjah ([[Eid al-Adha]])

Days considered important only in Shia Islam:
* 21 Ramadan Ali ibn Abi Talib's martyrdom.
* 3 Sha'ban (Birthday of Husayn ibn Ali.)
* 13 Rajab (Birthday of Ali ibn Abi Talib)

==Convert Hijri to civil date or civil to Hijri date==
[[File:Inscription of years by A.H.&amp;A.D. eras.jpg|thumb|400px|Civil &amp; Hijri date of the library establishment in Old city, Jerusalem]]
Conversions may be done online (see list of programmes at the bottom of this page), using the Tabular Islamic calendar (see section above) or, most accurately, through the Jewish calendar, which is accurate to one day in 15,186 years.   Theoretically, the days of the months correspond in both calendars if the displacements which are a feature of the Jewish system are ignored.   The table below gives, for nineteen years, the Muslim month which corresponds to the first Jewish month.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

This table may be extended since every nineteen years the Muslim month number increases by seven.   When it goes above twelve, subtract twelve and add one to the year AH.   From AD412 to AD632 inclusive the month number is 1 and the calculation gives the month correct to a month or so.   AD622 corresponds to BH1 and AH1.   For earlier years, year BH = (623 or 622) - year AD).

An example calculation: What is the civil date and year AH of the first day of the first month in the year AD20875?

We first find the Muslim month number corresponding to the first month of the Jewish year which begins in AD20874.   Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12.   Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12.   The two years are therefore (1098-106)=992x19 years apart.   The Muslim month number corresponding to the first Jewish month is therefore (992x7)=6944 higher than in 2026.   To convert into years and months divide by twelve - 6944/12=578 years and 8 months.   Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y - 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m.   Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in AD20874 corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH20874.   The worked example in [[Hebrew calendar#Conversion between Jewish and civil dates]] shows that the civil date of the first day of this month (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June.   The year AH20875 will therefore begin seven months later, on the first day of the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, AD20875 (again ignoring the displacements).   The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.

A reading of the section which follows will show that the year AH20875 is wholly contained within the year AD20875, also that in the Gregorian calendar this correspondence will occur one year earlier.   The reason for the discrepancy is that the Gregorian year (like the Julian) is slightly too long, so the Gregorian date for a given AH date will be earlier and the Muslim calendar catches up sooner.
&lt;!-- Mean civil year = 365d 05h 48m 48s (Milankovic), synodic month = 29d 12h 44 1/18m, hence mean calendar year = 354d 08h 48 12/18m. --&gt;

=== Current correlations ===
An Islamic year will be entirely within a Gregorian year of the same number in the year 20874, after which year the number of the Islamic year will always be greater than the number of the concurrent civil year. The Islamic calendar year of 1429 occurred entirely within the civil calendar year of 2008. Such years occur once every 33 or 34 Islamic years (32 or 33 civil years). More are listed here:

Because a hijri or Islamic lunar year is between 10 and 12 days shorter than a civil year, it begins 10–12 days earlier in the civil year following the civil year in which the previous hijri year began. Once every 33 or 34 hijri years, or once every 32 or 33 civil years, the beginning of a hijri year (1 Muharram) coincides with one of the first ten days of January. Subsequent hijri New Years move backward through the civil year back to the beginning of January again, passing through each civil month from December to January.

==Uses==
The Islamic calendar is now used primarily for religious purposes, and for official dating of public events and documents in Muslim countries. Because of its nature as a purely lunar calendar, it cannot be used for agricultural purposes and historically Islamic communities have used other calendars for this purpose: the [[Egyptian calendar]] was formerly widespread in Islamic countries, and the [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] and the 1789 [[Rumi calendar|Ottoman calendar]] (a modified Julian calendar) were also used for agriculture in their countries. In [[Morocco]], the [[Berber calendar]] (another Julian calendar) is still used by farmers in the countryside. These local solar calendars have receded in importance with the near-universal adoption of the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes. As noted above, Saudi Arabia uses the Islamic calendar to date religious occasions such as Ramadan, Hajj, etc. and the Umm-al-Qura calendar, based on calculations, for administrative purposes and daily government business.&lt;ref&gt;Glassé, Cyril (2001). ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', pp. 98-99. Rowman Altamira. ISBN 0-7591-0190-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Indonesia, the [[Javanese calendar]], created by [[Sultan Agung of Mataram|Sultan Agung]] in 1633, combines elements of the Islamic and pre-Islamic [[Indian national calendar|Saka]] calendars.

British author Nicholas Hagger writes that after seizing control of [[Libya]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] &quot;declared&quot; on 1 December 1978 &quot;that the Muslim calendar should start with the death of the prophet Mohammed in 632 rather than the hijra (Mohammed's 'emigration' from Mecca to Medina) in 622&quot;. This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagger|first=Nicholas|title=The Libyan Revolution: Its Origins and Legacy|year=2009|publisher=O Books|location=Winchester, UK|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the ''Encyclopedia of the Developing World'' in 2006, &quot;More confusing still is Qaddafi's unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet's birth, or sometimes from his death. The months July and August, named after [[Julius Caesar|Julius]] and [[Augustus]] Caesar, are now [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and [[Hannibal]] respectively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Developing World'' (2007), volume 3, p. 1338.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter [[Neil MacFarquhar]] observed, &quot;Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year it was. The year of my visit was officially 1369. But just two years earlier Libyans had been living through 1429. No one could quite name for me the day the count changed, especially since both remained in play. ...
