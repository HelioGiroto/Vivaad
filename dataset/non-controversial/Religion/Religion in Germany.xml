[[Christianity]] is the largest '''religion in Germany''' with 52 million adherents (2010/2011) (about 62% of population &lt;ref name=REMID&gt;[http://www.remid.de/remid_info_zahlen.htm Religionen in Deutschland - Mitglieder und Anhänger]&lt;/ref&gt;, 2008: 62.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekd.de/statistik/mitglieder.html |title=EKD-Statistik: Christen in Deutschland 2007 |publisher=Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2006: 67.1%.&lt;ref name=REMID/&gt; The second largest religion is [[Islam]] with 4 million adherents (5%)&lt;ref name=REMID /&gt; followed by [[Buddhism]] and [[Judaism]]. During the last few decades, the two largest churches in [[Germany]] (the Protestant [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) and the [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic Church]]), have lost significant number of adherents, both are down to roughly 30% (by the end of 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbk.de/imperia/md/content/kirchlichestatistik/bevoelkerung_und_katholiken_1965-2008.pdf Bevölkerung und Katholiken, 1965–2008]&lt;/ref&gt;. The percentage of Catholics in West Germany alone, starting in 1965 (43.8%) until 2011 (29.9%), under a united Germany, including the eastern states, reflects this difference&lt;ref name =autogenerated2&gt;[http://fowid.de/fileadmin/datenarchiv/Religionszugehoerigkeit_Bevoelkerung__1950-2008.pdf FOWID religious adherence of the German population 1950–2008 (including the divided, post-war Germany, then reunited Germany of 1989), document in German issued March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The most notable losses occurred in the Protestant churches, in East Germany largely owing to the atheistic policy under the communistic regime.

==History==
[[File:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|thumb|The religious situation in the German Empire about 1895. Tan, red and pink areas are predominantly Protestant, blue areas predominantly Catholic.]]

Roman Catholicism was the sole established religion in the country in the 15th century, but the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed this drastically. In 1517 Martin Luther challenged the Catholic Church as he saw it as a corruption of Christian faith. Through this, he altered the course of European and world history and established Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Plass, Ewald M., ''What Luther Says: An Anthology'', St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1959, 2:964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history. The war was fought primarily in what is now Germany, and at various points involved most of the countries of Europe. The war was fought largely as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Frederick, ''History of the Thirty Years' War'', p.1, Harper Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious freedom ===
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Germany}}
Since 1949 the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] guarantees freedom of [[faith]] and [[religion]]. It also states that no one may be [[discrimination|discriminated]] against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Law Art. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Religious communities that are of considerable size and stability and are loyal to the constitution can be recognised as &quot;Körperschaften öffentlichen Rechtes&quot; (statutory corporation). This gives them certain privileges, for example being able to give religious instruction in state schools (as enshrined in the German constitution, though some states are exempt from this) and having membership fees collected (for a fee) by the German revenue department as ''[[Church tax]]''. It is a surcharge amounting to between 8 or 9% of the income tax. The status mainly applies to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the mainline [[Protestant]] [[Evangelical Church in Germany|EKD]], and [[Jewish]] communities. There have been numerous discussions of allowing other religious groups like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Muslims]] into this system as well. The Muslim efforts were hampered by the Muslims' own disorganised state in Germany, with many small rivalling organisations and no central leadership, which does not fit well into a legal frame that was originally created with well-organized, large [[Christianity|Christian]] churches in mind.

== Secularism ==
[[File:Berlin skyline 2009w.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin]] has a non-religious majority]]

Before World War II, about two-thirds of the German population was Protestant and one-third was Roman Catholic. In the north and northeast of Germany especially, Protestants dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Ericksen &amp; Heschel, ''Betrayal: German churches and the Holocaust'', p.10, Fortress Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the former [[West Germany]] between 1945 and 1990, which contained nearly all of Germany's historically Catholic areas, Catholics have had a small majority since the 1980s. Protestant areas were much more affected by secularism than predominantly Catholic areas. The predominantly secularised states, such as [[Hamburg]] or the East German states, used to be Lutheran or [[United and uniting churches|United Protestant]] strongholds.

There is a non-religious majority in [[Hamburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. In the eastern state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] only 19.7 percent belong to the two big denominations of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekd.de/download/kimi_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is the state where Martin Luther was born.

In eastern Germany both religious observance and affiliation are much lower than in the rest of the country after forty years of Communist rule. The government of the [[German Democratic Republic]] encouraged an atheist&lt;!--do not change this to &quot;secular&quot; without a good source; &quot;atheist&quot; is more accurate--&gt; worldview through institutions such as [[Jugendweihe]]n (youth consecrations), [[Secular coming of age ceremony|secular coming-of-age ceremonies]] akin to Christian confirmation which all young people were strongly encouraged to attend (and disadvantaged socially if they did not). The average church attendance is now one of the lowest in the world, with only 5% attending at least once per week, compared to 14% in the rest of the country according to a recent study.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The number of christenings, religious weddings and funerals is also lower than in the West.

According to a survey among German youths (aged between 12 and 24) in the year 2006, 30% of German youths believe in a personal god, 19% believe in some kind of supernatural power, 23% share agnostic views and 28% are atheists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Gensicke: Jugend und Religiosität.

Islam is the largest [[minority religion]] in the country. The large majority of Muslims in Germany are of [[Turkey|Turkish]] origin (63.2%), followed by smaller groups from [[Pakistan]], countries of the [[former Yugoslavia]], [[Arab world|Arab countries]], [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]].  As of 2006, according to the U.S. Department of State, approximately 3.2 million Muslims live in Germany. This figure includes the different denominations of Islam, such as [[Sunni]], [[Shia]], [[Ahmadiyya]] and [[Alevi]]tes.

Muslims first came to Germany as part of the diplomatic, military and economic relations between Germany and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emz-berlin.de/projekte_e/pj20_1E.htm State Policies Towards Muslim Minorities.

The first mosque was established in Berlin in 1915 for these prisoners, though it was closed in 1930. After the West German Government invited [[foreign workers]] in 1961, the Muslim population continuously rose.

Today Germany, especially its capital Berlin, has the fastest growing Jewish community worldwide. About ninety thousand Jews from the former Eastern Bloc, mostly from ex-Soviet Union countries, settled in Germany since the fall of the Berlin wall. This is mainly due to a German government policy which basically grants an immigration ticket to anyone from the CIS and the Baltic states with Jewish heritage, and the fact that today's Germans are seen as significantly more accepting of Jews than many people in the ex-Soviet realm. Some of the about 60,000 long-time resident German Jews have expressed some mixed feelings about this immigration that they perceive as making them a minority not only in their own country but also in their own community. Prior to Nazism, about 600,000 Jews lived in Germany, going back to Roman times or even earlier. Many [[Jews]] from [[Russia]] and other former [[communist]] countries in [[Germany]] adhere to [[Reform Judaism]].

== Cults, Sects, Religious movements ==
The German government as well as the churches are actively involved in disseminating information and warnings about [[sect]]s and [[cult]]s (in colloquial language the German word {{lang|de|''Sekte''}} is used in both senses{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}) and [[new religious movement]]s. In public opinion, minor religious groups are often referred to as {{lang|de|''Sekten''}}, which can both refer to [[destructive cult]]s but also to all religious movements which are not Christian or different from the Roman Catholicism and the mainstream Protestantism. However, major [[world religion]]s like mainstream Orthodox Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism and Islam are not referred to as {{lang|de|''Sekten''}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

;Information by the ''Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland'' (Evangelic Church in Germany) and Roman Catholic Church
[[File:DurlacherAllee KirchenSchilder.jpg|thumb|upright|A free Pentecostal congregation has joined the mainline churches on this official sign.]]
When classifying religious groups, the Roman Catholic Church and the mainline [[Protestant]] [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) use a three-level hierarchy of &quot;churches&quot;, &quot;free churches&quot; and {{lang|de|''Sekten''}}:
# {{lang|de|''Kirchen''}} (churches) is the term generally applied to the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]'s member churches ([[Landeskirche]]n), and the Orthodox Churches. The churches are not only granted the status of a [[non-profit organisation]], but they have additional rights as ''statutory corporations'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts|Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts]]}}), which means they have the right to employ civil servants ([[Beamter]]), do official duties or issue official documents.
# {{lang|de|''Freikirchen''}} ([[free church]]es) is the term generally applied to Protestant organisations outside of the EKD, e.g. [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], independent Lutherans, [[Pentecostals]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. However, the [[Old Catholics]] can be referred to as a free church as well&lt;ref&gt;[http://uni-protokolle.de/Lexikon/Freikirchen.html Altkatholiken Freikirche]&lt;/ref&gt; The free churches are not only granted the tax-free status of a non-profit organisation, but many of them have additional rights as ''statutory corporations''.
# {{lang|de|''Sekten''}} is the term for religious groups which do not see themselves as part of a major religion (but maybe as the only real believers of a major religion).&lt;ref name=&quot;Definition Sekte&quot;&gt;[http://www.hilfe24.de/sekten_definition.htm Definition &quot;Sekte&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Definition Sekte&quot;/&gt; Although these religious groups have full religious freedom and protection against discrimination of their members, their organisations in most cases are not granted the tax-free status of a non-profit organisation{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

Every Protestant {{lang|de|''Landeskirche''}} (church whose canonical jurisdiction extends over one or several states, or {{lang|de|''Länder''}}) and Catholic episcopacy has a {{lang|de|''Sektenbeauftragter''}} ({{lang|de|''Sekten''}} delegate) from whom information about religious movements may be obtained.

;Information by the government
The German government also provides information about [[cult]]s, [[sect]]s, and [[new religious movement]]s. In 1997, the parliament set up a commission for ''Sogenannte Sekten und Psychogruppen''  (literally &quot;so-called sects and psychic groups&quot;) which delivered an extensive report on the situation in Germany regarding NRMs in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agpf.de/Bundestag-Enquete-english.pdf  Final report of the  commission of the Bundestag on the investigation into so-called sects and psycho groups]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Federal Constitutional Court upheld the governmental right to provide critical information on religious organizations being referred to as ''Sekte'', but stated that &quot;defamatory, discriminating, or falsifying accounts&quot; were illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court: [http://www.telemedicus.info/urteile/443-1-BvR-67091.html BVerfG, Urteil v. 26.06.2002, Az. 1 BvR 670/91]&lt;/ref&gt;
