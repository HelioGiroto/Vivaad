      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7419">The '''''Acts of Pilate''''' ({{lang-la|Acta Pilati}}; {{lang-grc|Πράξεις Πιλάτου}}), also called the '''''Gospel of Pilate''''', is a purported official document from [[Pontius Pilate]] (or composed from reports at the [[praetorium]] at Jerusalem) reporting events in Judea to Emperor [[Tiberius]], and referring to the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], as well as his miracles.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm501 &gt;''New Testament Apocrypha, Vol. 1'' by Wilhelm Schneemelcher and R. Mcl. Wilson (Dec 1, 1990) ISBN 066422721X pages 501-502&lt;/ref&gt; 

The authenticity of the document is unlikely and there is no historical basis that Roman governors wrote reports about non-citizens who were put to death.&lt;ref name=Voorst6568&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 page 51&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern scholars view the Acts of Pilate as not authentic and as a Christian composition designed to rebuff pagan sources.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm501 /&gt;

The dates of its accreted sections are uncertain, but scholars agree in assigning the resulting work to the middle of the fourth century.&lt;ref name=dating&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Acta Pilati|last=Reid|first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is found in the Greek ''[[Acts of Peter and Paul]]'' and as an appendix to the medieval Latin ''Gospel of Nicodemus'' rumored to be written by a member of the Order of Nicodemus, although there is no intrinsic relation between the independent texts.

==History and authenticity==
The oldest sections of the book appear first in [[Greek language|Greek]].  The text contains multiple parts, which are uneven in style and would seem to be by different hands. The ''Acts of Pilate'' does not purport to have been written by Pilate (thus is not [[pseudepigraphical]]), but does claim to have been derived from the official acts preserved in the [[praetorium]] at Jerusalem. 

The authenticity of the document is unlikely and there is no historical basis that Roman governors wrote reports about non-citizens who were put to death.&lt;ref name=Voorst6568&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 page 51&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern scholars view the Acts of Pilate as not authentic and as a Christian composition designed to rebuff pagan sources.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm501 /&gt;

== Core texts ==
The main body of ''Acta Pilati'' is in two sections, with an appendix,  ''[[Harrowing of Hell|Descensus ad Infernos]]''&amp;mdash;the Harrowing of Hell&amp;mdash;that does not exist in the Greek texts, and is a later addition to the Latin versions. The first (chapters i&amp;ndash;xi) contains the trial of Jesus based upon [[Gospel of Luke|Luke 23]].  The second part (xii&amp;ndash;xvi) regards the Resurrection.  In it, [[Leucius Charinus|Leucius and Charinus]], the two souls raised from the dead after the Crucifixion, relate to the [[Sanhedrin]] the circumstances of the descent of Christ to Limbo. A literature of [[Romance (heroic literature)|miracle-tale romance]] developed around a conflated &quot;Leucius Charinus&quot; as an author of further texts. The Harrowing of Hell episode depicts St [[Dismas]] accompanying [[Christ]] in [[Hell]], and the deliverance of the righteous [[Old Testament]] [[patriarch]]s.

An appended text purports to be a written report made by [[Pontius Pilate]] to [[Claudius]], containing an anti-Semitic description of the [[crucifixion]], as well as an account of the  [[resurrection of Jesus]]; both are presented as if in an official report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/reportpilate.html Report of Pilate]&lt;/ref&gt; One series of Latin manuscripts includes as an appendix or continuation, the episode ''Cura Sanitatis Tiberii'' (&quot;The Cure of Tiberius&quot;), the oldest form of the [[Saint Veronica|Veronica legend]], according to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', in which [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]] is cured of his malady. (Compare the legend of the [[Image of Edessa]].)

== Dating and readership ==
The Church historian  [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (writing ''c.'' 325), shows no acquaintance with this work, although he was aware of &quot;Letters of Pilate&quot; referred to by Justin and Tertullian. He was also aware of an anti-Christian text called ''Acts of Pilate'', which was prescribed for reading in schools under the emperor [[Maximinus]] during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Hennecke, ''New Testament Apocrypha'' (1963 ed.) vol. 1 p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We are forced to admit that [the Christian ''Acts of Pilate''] is of later origin, and scholars agree in assigning it to the middle of the fourth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=dating /&gt; [[Epiphanius]] refers to an ''Acta Pilati'' (''c.'' 376), but the extant Greek texts show evidence of later editing.

Though the ''Acta Pilati'' purports to be a report by Pontius Pilate containing evidence of Jesus Christ's [[messiah]]ship and [[god]]head, there is no record in early Christian lore of Pilate's conversion to [[Christianity]]. It seems unlikely that the work was ever meant to have been taken seriously by Christians; instead, its purpose was to offer further conjectural details about the life of Christ as a pious entertainment, part of a larger body of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate literature]].

Justin the Martyr wrote, &quot;And that these things did happen, you can ascertain from the Acts of Pontius Pilate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The First and Second Apology of Justin, Chapter 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Apology letters were written and addressed by name to the Roman Emperor Pius and the Roman Governor Urbicus. All three of these men lived between 138&amp;ndash;161 AD.

The ''Acta Pilati'' have had a long history inspiring devotional works. A ''Meditatione sopra la Passione del nostro signore iesu christo'', drawing in part on ''Acta Pilati'' for its expanded anecdotal elements in the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], was printed twenty-eight times in Italy between about 1476 and 1500, and inspired the depiction of Christ before Pilate by [[Pontormo]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura M. Giles, &quot;Christ before Pilate: a major composition study by Pontormo&quot;, ''Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies'' '''17'''.1 (1991:34-51).&lt;/ref&gt;
