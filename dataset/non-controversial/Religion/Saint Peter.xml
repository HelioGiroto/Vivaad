'''Saint Peter''' or '''Simon Peter''' was an [[early Christianity|early Christian]] leader and one of the [[twelve apostles]] of [[Jesus]]. Peter is featured prominently in the [[New Testament]] Gospels and the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and is venerated as a [[saint]]. The son of John or of Jonah or Jona&lt;ref&gt;[[King James Bible]] (KJB), [[Douay–Rheims Bible]] (D-R)&lt;/ref&gt;, he was from the village of [[Bethsaida]] in the province of [[Galilee]] or [[Gaulanitis]]. His brother [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]] was also an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]]. Peter is venerated in multiple churches and is regarded as the first [[pope]] by the [[Catholic Church]]. After working to establish the church of [[Antioch]], and presiding for seven years as the leader of the city's Christian community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Patriarchate of Antioch: Founded by Saints Peter and Paul |url=http://www.antiochian.org/patofant}}&lt;/ref&gt; he preached, or his epistle was preached, to scattered communities of believers: [[Jews#Judaism|Jews]], [[Jewish Christian|Hebrew Christians]] and the [[gentile]]s, in [[Pontus]], [[Galatia]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Bithynia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/1_peter/1-1.htm] Online Parallel Bible Project - 1 Peter 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to Rome, where in the second year of [[Claudius]], it is claimed, he overthrew [[Simon Magus]] and held the [[Sacerdotal]] Chair for 25 years.&lt;!-- No biblical support for the preceding claim. --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He is said to have been put to death at the hand of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Nero]].{{by who|date=August 2012}}

Peter wrote two [[general epistles]]. The [[Gospel of Mark]] is also ascribed to him (as Mark was his disciple and interpreter). Several other books bearing his name—the [[Acts of Peter]], [[Gospel of Peter]], [[Clementine literature|Preaching of Peter]], [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and [[Judgment of Peter]]—are rejected by the [[Catholic Church]] as [[apocryphal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Fathers of the Church}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Patrick Halton, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=uqzY1zBtKg0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22I+simon+Peter%22+%22Ones+who+are+scattered%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20simon%20Peter%22%20%22Ones%20who%20are%20scattered%22&amp;f=false On Illustrious Men], v. 100, CUA Press, 1999, pp 5–7 ISBN 0-8132-0100-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm Early Church Fathers] Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to New Testament accounts, Peter was one of twelve apostles chosen by Jesus from his first [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]. Originally a fisherman, he was assigned a leadership role by Jesus and was with Jesus during events witnessed by only a few apostles, such as the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot;&gt;&quot;Peter, St. &quot; F. L., Cross, ''The Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church'', Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Cephas (Aramaic) and Peter (Greek) both mean &quot;rock&quot;. According to the New Testament, Peter confessed Jesus as the [[Messiah]],&lt;ref&gt; New Testament: Gospel of Matthew 16:16&lt;/ref&gt; was part of Jesus' inner circle,&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Gospel of Mark 5:37&lt;/ref&gt; walked on water,&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Gospel of Matthew 14:29&lt;/ref&gt; witnessed Jesus' transfiguration, denied Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Gospel of Luke 9:28, Luke 22:54-62&lt;/ref&gt; was restored by Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Gospel of John 21:15-19&lt;/ref&gt; and preached on the day of [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Gospel of Acts 2:14-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter is said to have been crucified under Emperor Nero, the cross being upside down at his own request since he saw himself unworthy to be crucified in the same way as Jesus Christ. Catholic tradition holds that Saint Peter's site of crucifixion is located in the [[Clementine Chapel]], while his mortal bones and remains are contained in the underground [[Saint Peter's tomb|Confessio]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], a site where [[Pope Paul VI]] announced the excavation discovery of a first-century A.D. Roman [[cemetery]] in 1968. Since 1969, a life-size statue of Saint Peter is crowned every year in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] with a [[papal tiara]], [[ring of the fisherman]], and papal vestments every 29 June, commemorating the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|holy feast of Saints Peter and Paul]].

==Names and etymologies==
His original name was [[Shimon (disambiguation)|Shimon]] or Simeon, Simon in modern English.  He was later given the name Peter, a name derived from &quot;Petrus&quot; which is a [[Grammatical gender|masculinized]] form of the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] [[Latin]] word ''petra (f)'' which means ''rock'' (cf. [[petroleum]]). For what concerns [[Greek language|Greek]], the same idea holds: &quot;Πέτρος (Petros)&quot; is derived from ''πέτρα (petra)''. The [[Latin]] word &quot;petra&quot; is a [[loanword]] from [[Greek language|Greek]].

The English and German &quot;Peter&quot;, the French &quot;Pierre&quot;, the Italian &quot;Pietro&quot;, the Spanish and Portuguese &quot;Pedro&quot;, the Polish and Russian &quot;Piotr&quot; are derived from &quot;Petrus&quot;.  The pun with &quot;rock&quot; also works in Italian (''pietra (f)''), French (''pierre (f)'') and Portuguese (''pedra (f)'').

On the other hand, the [[Syriac]] or [[Aramaic]] word for &quot;rock&quot; is &quot;cephas&quot;, which became {{lang-el|[[Wikt:Πέτρος|Πέτρος]]}}, also meaning &quot;rock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblelexicon.org/matthew/16-18.htm |title=Bible Lexicon |publisher=Bible Lexicon |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cepha (cephah) is a native Aramaic ''Syriac'' word ({{lang-syr|ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ}} ''Kîpâ'');see John Maclean, M.A., F.R.G.S. [http://www.archive.org/stream/adictionarydial00maclgoog#page/n152/mode/1up &quot;A Dictionary of the Dialects of Vernacular Syriac as Spoken by the Eastern Syrians of Kurdistan, Northwest Persia, and the Plain of Moṣul&quot;] ''Cambridge at the University Press,'' 1895. Accessed Jun. 16, 2011: p. 124. However, a &quot;loose language&quot; modern Aramaic (Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, &amp;c.,) dictionary may define Cepha, e.g., such as in {{lang-he-n|כֵּיפׇא \ כֵּיף}}, to mean Rock, yet, may ''not'' explain the actual origin of the word itself, e.g., Marcus Jastrow [http://www.archive.org/stream/dictionaryoftarg01jastuoft#page/634/mode/1up &quot;Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature&quot;], 1903. Accessed Jun. 16, 2011: P. 634 It is unlikely that one will find this particular word {{lang|syr|ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ}} in any &quot;strict language&quot; Aramaic dictionary other than that of the Aramaic ''Syriac'' dictionary. For instance the Hebrew word for Cepha ({{Hebrew|כֵּיפׇא}}) would not be present, while {{Hebrew|סֶלַֽע}} (ßĕ'lặᵉ); i.e., rock, cliff, Petra]; Karl Feyerabend, PhD [http://www.archive.org/stream/acompletehebrewe00feyeuoft#page/233/mode/1up &quot;A complete Hebrew-English pocket-dictionary to the Old Testament&quot;] ''Cöthen, Germany,'' 1910. Accessed Jun. 16, 2011: P. 233 would, for {{Hebrew|סֶלַֽע}} is a native Hebrew word. Within a &quot;strict language&quot; dictionary the word will be in its native and original form, thus ''rock'' will be translated into the language that is being used, e.g., &quot;''English-Hebrew dictionary''&quot;. See: A. S. Waldstein [http://www.archive.org/stream/englishhebrewdic00walduoft#page/442/mode/1up &quot;English-Hebrew dictionary&quot;] ''Jerusalem,'' 1920. Accessed Jun. 16, 2011: P. 442, where the word(s) for ''rock'' is translated as such : ({{Hebrew|הִתְנַדְנֵד−.פ, הִתְנוֹעֵעַ, הׇנֵעַ, נַדְנֵד, סֶלַע, צוּר, ש. (ריִֹק}} ''and not'' {{Hebrew|כֵּיפׇא \ כֵּיף}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as '''Simon Peter''', '''Cephas''' ({{lang-el|Κηφᾶς}}) and '''Kepha''' ({{lang-he|כיפא}}). Both Cephas and Kepha also mean rock.&lt;ref&gt;The ({{lang-he|כֵּיפׇא \ כֵּיף}}) is an indirect transliteration of the Syriac ({{lang|syr|ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ}}), however the ({{lang-el|Κηφᾶς}}) is a direct transliteration of the Syriac ({{lang|syr|ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ}}) and the ({{lang-he|כֵּיפׇא \ כֵּיף}}) a direct transliteration of the Greek. Though the Hebrew word ({{lang-he|כאפא}}) is also used to which is a direct transliteration of the Syriac. (''cƒ.''  ''Interlinear Peshitta Aramaic New Testament Bible'' [http://peshitta.info/gospel/matthew_16.htm Matthew xvi. 18]). He is sometimes  '''Simon Cephas''' ({{lang-el|Σιμων Κηφᾶς}} ''Simōn Kēphas''; {{lang-arc|}} ''Šimʻōn Kêfâ''; {{lang-syr|ܫܶܡܥܽܘܢ ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ}} ''Sëmʻān Kêfâ'') after his name in [[Hellenised]] Aramaic.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament account==
[[File:Ancient capernum is.JPG|thumb|left|Ruins of ancient [[Capernaum]] on north side of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. An Orthodox church is built on top of traditional site of Apostle Peter's house.]]

Peter's life story is told in the four [[Canonical Gospels]], The [[Book of Acts]], New Testament Letters, Non-Canonical [[Gospel According to the Hebrews]] and other [[Early Church]] accounts of his life and death. In the [[New Testament]], he is among the first&lt;!-- not THE first: in John, Andrew is called first --&gt; of the disciples called during Jesus' ministry. It was during his first meeting with Jesus that Jesus named him Peter. Peter was to become the first Apostle ordained by Jesus in the early church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- This section is backwards, starting with accounts from the gospels (AD 60 - 100) and ending with accounts from Paul's epistles (''c'' 56). It should start with the earliest accounts. --&gt;

Peter ran a fishing business in [[Bethsaida]].{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:44}} He was named Simon, son of Jonah or John.&lt;ref&gt;His father's name is given as 'Jonah',{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:42}} {{Bibleref2c|Matt.|16:17}} although some manuscripts of John give his father's name as ''John''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synoptic Gospels]] all recount how Peter's mother-in-law [[Healing the mother of Peter's wife|was healed by Jesus]] at their home in [[Capernaum]]{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|8:14-17}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|1:29-31}} {{Bibleref2c|Lk.|4:38}} which, coupled with {{Bibleref2|1 Cor.|9:5}}, clearly depict Peter as married or a widower. 

In the [[Synoptic Gospels]], Peter (then Simon) was a fisherman along with his brother [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] and the sons of Zebedee, James and John. The [[Gospel of John]] also depicts Peter fishing, even after the resurrection of Jesus, in the story of the [[Miraculous Draught of Fish|Catch of 153 fish]].

In Matthew and Mark, Jesus called Simon and his brother [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] to be &quot;fishers of men&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|4:18-19}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|1:16-17}}
{{Saint Peter}}
In [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Simon Peter owns the boat that Jesus uses to preach to the multitudes who were pressing on him at the shore of [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Gennesaret]].{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|5:3}} Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|5:4-11}}

The Gospel of John gives a comparable account of &quot;The First Disciples&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:35-42}} In John, we are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the &quot;[[Lamb of God]]&quot; and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went and fetched his brother Simon, saying, &quot;We have found the [[Messiah]]&quot;, and then brought Simon to Jesus.

===The &quot;Rock&quot; dialogue===&lt;!-- [[Rock of the faith]] redirects here --&gt;
In a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples ({{bibleverse||Matthew|16:13-20|KJV}}), Jesus asks, “Who do people say that the [[Son of Man]] is?” The disciples give various answers. When he asks, &quot;Who do you say that I am?&quot; Simon Peter answers, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; In turn, Jesus declares Peter to be &quot;blessed&quot; for having recognized Jesus' true identity and attributes this recognition to a divine revelation. Then Jesus addresses Simon by what seems to have been the nickname &quot;Peter&quot; (''Cephas'' in Aramaic, ''Petros'' [stone] in Greek) and says, &quot;On this rock (''petra'' in Greek) I will build my church, and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it.&quot;

A common exegetical interpretation of Peter is provided by [[Daniel J. Harrington|Daniel Harrington]] who suggests that Peter was an unlikely symbol of stability. While he was one of the first disciples called and served as the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of &quot;little faith&quot; in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|14}}, will soon have Jesus say to him, &quot;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot; and will eventually deny Jesus three times.  In light of the Easter event, then, Peter became an exemplar of the forgiven sinner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel J. Harrington|Harrington, Daniel J.]] &quot;Peter the Rock.&quot; ''America,'' August 18–25, 2008. Accessed Oct. 9, 2009: p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A great variance of opinions exists as to the interpretation of this passage with respect to what authority and responsibility, if any, Jesus was giving to Peter.

''Petros '' had not previously been used as a name, but in the Greek-speaking world it became a popular Christian name, after the tradition of Peter's prominence in the early Christian church had been established.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] this passage is interpreted as not implying a special prominence to the person of Peter, but to Peter's position as representative of the Apostles. The word used for &quot;rock&quot; (''petra'') grammatically refers to &quot;a small detachment of the massive ledge&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rienecker | first = Fritz | authorlink = Frotz Rienecker | last2 = Rogers | first2 = Cleon | author2-link = Cleon Rogers | title = Linguistic key to the Greek New Testament | place = Grand Rapids MI | publisher = Regency Reference Library ([[Zondervan Publishing House]]) | year = 1976 | volume = | edition = | page = 49 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-310-32050-X | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to a massive boulder. Thus, Orthodox [[Sacred Tradition]] understands Jesus' words as referring to the apostolic faith.

The great majority of Western scholars concur with the interpretation that the &quot;rock&quot; was Peter, not Jesus himself or Peter's faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saint Peter the Apostle |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=2009 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=25 November 2009 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453832/Saint-Peter-the-Apostle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position among the apostles===
[[File:Church peters primacy.jpg|thumb|Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]]. Traditional site where [[Jesus Christ]] appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and, according to Catholic tradition, established Peter's supreme jurisdiction over the Christian church.]]

Peter is listed first among the Twelve Apostles in the canonical gospels&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matt.|10:2-4}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk.|3:16-19}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk.|6:14-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Book of Acts (Acts 1:13). He is also frequently mentioned in the Gospels as forming with [[James, son of Zebedee|James the Elder]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] a special group within the Twelve Apostles, present at incidents at which the others were not present, such as at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]]. He often confesses his faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

Peter is often depicted in the Gospels as spokesman of all the Apostles. Catholics refer to him as chief of the Apostles,&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf212.ii.v.xlii.html |title=Sermon by Leo the Great (440–461) |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/downloads/files/english/voo/2005/11VOO05E |title=Archbishop Stylianos of Australia |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/PZakka/Jubilee.htm |title=Patriarch H.H.Ignatius Zakka I Iwas |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syrianorthodoxchurch.com/Identity.htm Identity of the Syriac Orthodox Church]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Coptic Orthodox Church Liturgy, he is once referred to as ''“Prominent”'' or ''&quot;head&quot;'' among the Apostles, a title shared with St. Paul in the text (''The Fraction of Fast and Feast of the Apostles Peter and Paul in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria''). Some, including the Orthodox Churches, believe this is not the same as saying that the other Apostles were under Peter's orders. In contrast, [[Jewish Christians]] are said to have argued that [[James the Just]] was the leader of the group.&lt;ref&gt;http://cbi.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/1/73.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue James was the Patriarch of Jerusalem and that this position at times gave him privilege in some (but not all) situations. The early Church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] (c. AD 325) records [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. AD 190) as saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;For they say that Peter and [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] after the ascension of our Saviour, as if also preferred by our Lord, strove not after honor, but chose [[James the Just]] [[bishop]] of Jerusalem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm |title=[Church History Book II, Chapter I, quoting Clement of Alexandria's Sixth book of Hypotyposes |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul affirms that Peter had the special charge of being apostle to the Jews, just as he, Paul, was apostle to the Gentiles.

===Walking on water===
Three of the four canonical Gospels—Matthew, Mark and John—recount the story of Jesus walking on water. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment, but beginning to sink when his faith wavered.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|14:28-31}}

===Washing of feet===
At the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus responded: &quot;If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me&quot;, Peter replied: &quot;Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|13:2-11}} The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].

===Arrest of Jesus===
[[File:The capture of Christ mg 1674.jpg|thumb|Apostle Peter striking Malchus with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane.]]]]
The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the High Priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matt.|26:51}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk.|14:47}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk.|22:50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|18:10}} Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|22:49-51}}
This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.

===Denial of Jesus by Peter===
{{Main|Denial of Peter}}
All four canonical gospels recount that, during the [[Last Supper]], Jesus foretold that Peter would deny him three times before the following cockcrow (&quot;before the cock crows twice&quot; in Mark's account).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:
# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), &quot;the rooster crowed&quot;. Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was &quot;sitting&quot;; according to John, he was &quot;standing&quot;.
# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, &quot;the rooster crowed&quot;.
# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, &quot;the rooster crowed&quot;. John, though, does not mention the Galilean accent.

Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual.

[[File:Gustave Doré, St Peter Denying Christ.jpg|thumb|St. Peter Denying Christ, by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].

In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus' prediction of Peter's denial is coupled with a prediction that all the apostles (&quot;you&quot;, plural) would be &quot;sifted like wheat&quot;, but that it would be Peter's task (&quot;you&quot;, singular), when he had turned again, to strengthen his brethren.

In a reminiscent&lt;ref name=&quot;May Metzger&quot;&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; scene in John's epilogue, Peter affirms three times that he loves Jesus.

===Empty tomb===
In John's gospel, Peter is the first person to enter the [[empty tomb]], although the women and the [[beloved disciple]] see it before him.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|20:1-9}} In Luke's account, the women's report of the empty tomb is dismissed by the apostles, and Peter is the only one who goes to check for himself. In fact, he runs to the tomb. After seeing the graveclothes he goes home, apparently without informing the other disciples.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:1-12}}

===Resurrection appearances===
[[File:StMarysAylesburyDetail6.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Statue of St. Peter on the south door of St Mary's Church in [[Aylesbury]], [[United Kingdom]]]]
Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1Cor|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a list of [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]], the first of which is an appearance to Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1Cor|15:3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here Paul apparently follows an early tradition that Peter was the first to see the risen Christ,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt; which however did not seem to have survived to the time when the Gospels were written.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:8-10}}, {{Bibleref2|John|20:16}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:13-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[John 21|final chapter]] of the Gospel of John, Peter, in one of the resurrection appearances of Jesus, three times affirmed his love for Jesus, balancing his threefold denial, and Jesus reconfirmed Peter's position.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|21:15-17}} Some{{Who|date=April 2011}} scholars hypothesize that it was added later to bolster Peter's status.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie, T. L. (1997). The Gospel according to John a literary and theological commentary. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 574&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the early church===
The author of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] portrays Peter as an extremely important figure within the early Christian community, with Peter delivering a significant [[Open-air preaching|open-air sermon]] during [[Pentecost]]. According to the same book, Peter took the lead in selecting a replacement for [[Judas Iscariot]].{{Bibleref2c|Acts|1:15}} He was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|4:7-22}} {{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|5:18-42}} He undertook a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|9:32-10:2}} becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|10}}

About halfway through, the [[Acts of the Apostles]] turns its attention away from Peter and to the activities of Paul, and the Bible is mostly silent on what occurred to Peter afterwards.

John Vidmar writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Both Catholic and Protestant scholars agree that Peter had an authority that superseded that of the other apostles. Peter is their spokesman at several events, he conducts the election of Matthias, his opinion in the debate over converting Gentiles was crucial, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=John+Vidmar#v=onepage&amp;q=Both%20Catholic%20and%20Protestant%20scholars%20agree&amp;f=false |title=John Vidmar, The Catholic Church through the ages: a history. pp. 39–40 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2005-07|accessdate=2010-09-12|isbn=978-0-8091-4234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rescue from prison===
{{Main|Liberation of Saint Peter}}
{{bibleverse||Acts|12|KJV}} tells how Peter was put into prison by [[Agrippa I|King Herod]], but was rescued by an angel.

===Council of Jerusalem===
{{Main|Council of Jerusalem}}
At the council of Jerusalem (c. 50), the early Church, Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem church met and decided to embrace Gentile converts. Acts portrays Peter as successfully opposing the Christian Pharisees who insisted on [[circumcision]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot; /&gt;

===Epistles===
Peter/Cephas is mentioned briefly in Paul's [[Epistle to the Galatians]], which mentions a trip by Paul to [[Jerusalem]] where he meets Peter (Galatians 1:18), and a trip by Cephas to [[Antioch]]{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|2:11-14}} where Paul rebuked him for treating Gentile converts as inferior to Jewish Christian (see the [[Incident at Antioch]]). Galatians is accepted as authentic by almost all scholars, so these are the earliest mentions of Peter to be written.

Church tradition ascribes the epistles [[First Epistle of Peter|First]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|Second Peter]] to Apostle Peter, as does the text of Second Peter itself. First Peter implies the author is in &quot;Babylon,&quot; which has been held to be a coded reference to Rome&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot; /&gt; (1 Peter 5:13). Although, [[Babylon (Egypt)|Babylon]] was an important [[Babylon Fortress|fortress city]] in Egypt, just north of today's Cairo and this fact is combined with the &quot;greetings from Marc&quot; (1 Peter 5:13), who is regarded as founder of the [[Church of Alexandria]] (Egypt); thus other scholars put the First Peter epistle to be written in Egypt. Some{{Who|date=April 2011}} scholars regard First Peter as not authored by him, and there is still considerable debate about the Petrine authorship of Second Peter. However the Greek in both books is similar, and the early Church was adamantly opposed to [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudographical]] authorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

==Accounts outside the New Testament==
In Catholic tradition, Peter is said to have founded the church in Rome with Paul, served as its bishop, authored two epistles, and then met martyrdom there along with Paul.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt;

===Antioch and Corinth===
Later accounts expand on the brief Biblical mention of his visit to [[Antioch]]. The ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' (9th century) mentions Peter as having served as bishop of Antioch for seven years and having potentially left his family in the Greek city before his journey to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Ropes Loomis, The Book of Popes (Liber Pontificalis). Merchantville, NJ: Evolution Publishing. ISBN 1-889758-86-8 (Reprint of the 1916 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of direct blood lineage from Simon Peter among the old population of Antioch existed in the 1st century and continue to exist today, notably by certain [[Semaan]] families of modern-day Syria and Lebanon. Historians have furnished other evidence of Peter's sojourn in Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;This is provided in Downey, ''A History of Antioch'', pp. 583–586. This evidence is accepted by M. Lapidge, among others, see Bischoff and Lapidge, ''Biblical Commentaries from the Canterbury School'' (Cambridge, 1994) p. 16. Lastly, see Finegan, ''The Archaeology of the New Testament'', pp. 63–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent tradition held that Peter had been the first [[Patriarch of Antioch]].

Peter might have visited [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], as a party of &quot;Cephas&quot; existed there.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt;

[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (Eusebius Caesariensis, ca 260-ca 340), in his &quot;[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]&quot;, while naming some of the Seventy Disciples of Jesus, says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;... and the history by [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]]'' (of Alexandria, c.150 - c. 215)'', in the fifth ''(chapter)'' of '''Hypotyposeis'''; in which Cefas, the one mentioned by Paul'' (in the citation):'' «when Cefas came to Antioch, I confronted him face to face» ''(Galatians 2:11)'', it is said he was one of the Seventy Disciples, having the same name with Peter the Apostle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(ἡ δ᾿ ἱστορία παρὰ Κλήμεντι κατὰ τὴν πέμπτην τῶν Ὑποτυπώσεων· ἐν ᾗ καὶ Κηφᾶν, περὶ οὗ φησιν ὁ Παῦλος· «ὅτε δὲ ἦλθεν Κηφᾶς εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῷ ἀντέστην», ἕνα φησὶ γεγονέναι τῶν ἑβδομήκοντα μαθητῶν, ὁμώνυμον Πέτρῳ τυγχάνοντα τῷ ἀποστόλῳ.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Death===
In the epilogue&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; of the Gospel of John, Jesus hints at the death by which Peter would glorify God,{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|21:18-19}}saying &quot;…when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and take you where you do not want to go.&quot; This is interpreted by some as a reference to Peter's crucifixion.&lt;ref name=&quot;May Metzger&quot; /&gt;

According to the 1911 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', St. Peter labored in Rome during the last portion of his life, and there ended his life by martyrdom.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of St. Peter is attested to by [[Tertullian]] at the end of the 2nd century, and by [[Origen]] in ''Eusebius'', Church History III.1. Origen says: &quot;Peter was crucified at Rome with his head downwards, as he himself had desired to suffer.&quot;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; This is why an upside down cross is generally accepted as a symbol of Peter, who would not have considered himself worthy enough to die the same way as his Savior.&lt;ref&gt;Granger Ryan &amp; Helmut Ripperger, ''The Golden Legend Of Jacobus De Voragine Part One'', 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status===
[[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]] of Rome identifies Peter and Paul as the outstanding heroes of the faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt; Papias reported that the Gospel of Mark was based on Peter's memoirs, a tradition still accepted by some scholars today.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt;

===Martyrdom===
[[File:Caravaggio-Crucifixion of Peter.jpg|thumb|[[Caravaggio]]'s depiction of the crucifixion of Apostle Peter.]]
The mention in the [[New Testament]] of the death of Peter says that Jesus indicated its form by saying: &quot;You will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God&quot; ({{Bibleref2c|Jn.|21:19}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Early church tradition (as indicated below) says Peter probably died by [[crucifixion]] (with arms outstretched) at the time of the [[Great Fire of Rome]] of the year 64. [[Margherita Guarducci]], who led the research leading to the rediscovery of Peter’s tomb in its last stages (1963–1968), concludes Peter died on 13 October AD 64 during the festivities on the occasion of the “dies imperii” of Emperor Nero. This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor wished to blame the Christians. This “dies imperii” (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was ‘as usual’ accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. According to the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down. Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.

[[Clement of Rome]], in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80–98, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: &quot;Let us take the noble examples of our own generation. Through jealousy and envy the greatest and most just pillars of the Church were persecuted, and came even unto death… Peter, through unjust envy, endured not one or two but many labours, and at last, having delivered his testimony, departed unto the place of glory due to him.&quot;

The [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Peter]] is also thought to be the source for the tradition about the famous phrase &quot;[[Quo Vadis|Quo vadis, Domine?]]&quot; (or &quot;Pou Hupageis, Kurie?&quot; which means, &quot;Where are you going, Master?&quot;). According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution, asked the question of a vision of Jesus, to which Jesus allegedly responded that he was &quot;going to Rome to be crucified again.&quot; On hearing this, Peter decided to return to the city to accept martyrdom. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting. The [[Quo Vadis (church)|Church of Quo Vadis]], near the [[Catacombs]] of [[Pope Callistus I|Saint Callistus]], contains a stone in which Jesus' footprints from this event are supposedly preserved, though this was apparently an ''[[ex-voto]]'' from a [[pilgrim]], and indeed a copy of the original, housed in the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Basilica of St Sebastian]].

The ancient historian [[Josephus]] describes how Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions, and it is likely that this would have been known to the author of the ''Acts of Peter''. The position attributed to Peter's crucifixion is thus plausible, either as having happened historically or as being an invention by the author of the ''Acts of Peter''. Death, after crucifixion head down, is unlikely to be caused by [[suffocation]], the usual &quot;cause of death in ordinary crucifixion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=V8IjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA350&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;dq=usual+cause+of+death+in+ordinary+crucifixion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Oj5qMM_nu&amp;sig=HzhmsLQbqxgjVpB6ejvMlk0TOZs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mm0aUJ7AE-Ly2QWe0YCABA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=usual%20cause%20of%20death%20in%20ordinary%20crucifixion&amp;f=false] The Holy Bible, according to the authorized version (A.D. 1611) - Frederic Charles Cook - J. Murray, 1881 - page 350&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[The Middle Ages|medieval]] tradition {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} was that the [[Mamertine Prison]] in Rome is the place where Peter was imprisoned before his execution. Catholic tradition holds that his inverted crucifixion occurred on the spot now occupied by the [[Clementine Chapel]] in the grottoes of Saint Peter's Basilica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people = Vatican Cardinal Angelo Comastri (interviewee)| year = 2011| title = Secret Access: The Vatican | medium = Video| language = English, Italian| trans_title = | publisher = A&amp;E Studio Entertainment| location = Vatican City, Rome, Italy| accessdate = June 2, 2012| time = 94 minutes| quote = This is the holiest site in the Basilica, where the Apostle Peter was crucified and his blood shed to the ground}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, human bones were found buried underneath the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. The bones have been claimed by many to have been those of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, ''The Bones of St. Peter: A 1st Full Account of the Search for the Apostle's Body''&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to contradict these claims was made in 1953 by the excavation of what some believe to be [[St Peter's tomb]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Finegan, ''The Archeology of the New Testament'', pp. 368–370.&lt;/ref&gt; However along with supposed tomb of Peter bearing his previous name Simon, tombs bearing the names of Jesus, Mary, James, John, and the rest of the apostles were also found at the same excavation—though all these names were very common among Jews at the time.

In the 1960s, some previously discarded debris from the excavations beneath [[St Peter's Basilica]] were re-examined, and the bones of a male person were identified. A forensic examination found them to be a male of about 61 years of age from the 1st century. This caused Pope Paul VI in 1968 to announce them most likely to be the relics of Apostle Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/JW/TheBonesofStPeter-1.htm |title=The Bones of St. Peter |publisher=Saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further doubt on finding bones in Rome is cast by Pope Vitalian's letter to King Oswy of the Britons (665 AD), offering him the remains (then called relics) of the apostle Peter and Paul, along with those of the Holy Martyrs Laurentius, John, Gregory and Pancratius as a reward for the emergence of British faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book3.html |title=Venerable Bede,Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum: The Ecclesiastical History of the English People.

===Connection to Rome===

{{See also|Papal supremacy#First phase of papal supremacy|l1=First phase of papal supremacy}}

The See of Rome is traditionally said to be founded by Peter and Paul, see also [[Primacy of Simon Peter]], who had invested it with [[Apostolic Succession|apostolic authority]].  The New Testament says nothing directly about Peter's connection to Rome, but an early Catholic tradition supports such a connection.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt;

That Peter was bishop of Rome is corroborated by both positive and negative evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The evidence that Peter was &quot;bishop&quot; of Rome is corroborated by both positive and &quot;negative&quot; evidence. Positively, Clement's letter to the Corinthians situates Peter in Rome by mentioning his death there. Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Romans and says, &quot;I do not command you as Peter and Paul did.&quot; The lists of Roman bishops given by Irenaeus and Tertullian support this, as does the honor given Peter's supposed burial place on Vatican Hill. Eamon Duffy's text for a BBC production, Saints and Sinners, soft-pedals the position of Peter as bishop. Duffy claims that there were five Christian neighborhoods in Rome, and that Peter could not possibly have been supervisor over all of them. One argument against this is the fact that the historical letters (from Paul, Ignatius, and Clement) are all addressed to &quot;the Romans,&quot; and not one particular community in Rome. Historians cite negative evidence as well, namely that there is no rival tradition. No other city claims Peter as its bishop except Antioch, and even it conceded that Peter had moved on to Rome.&quot;
John Vidmar&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some historians have challenged this traditional view of Peter's role in the early Roman Church.&lt;ref name=BrownMeier&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antioch and Rome: New Testament Cradles of Christianity |publisher=Paulist Press |year=1983 |page=98 |quote=As for Peter, we have no knowledge at all of when he came to Rome and what he did there before he was martyred.  Certainly he was ''not'' the original missionary who brought Christianity to Rome (and therefore ''not'' the founder of the church of Rome in that sense). There is no serious proof that he was the bishop (or local ecclesiastical officer) of the Roman church—a claim not made till the third century. Most likely he did not spend any major time at Rome before 58 when Paul wrote to the Romans, and so it may have been only in the 60s and relatively shortly before his martyrdom that Peter came to the capital. |author=Brown, Raymond E. and  Meier, John P.|isbn=0-8091-0339-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullman&gt;{{Cite book|first=Oscar |last=Cullmann |title=Peter:  Disciple, Apostle, Martyr,  2nd ed. |publisher=Westminster Press |year=1962 |page=234 |quote=&quot;In the New Testament [Jerusalem] is the only church of which we hear that Peter stood at its head.

The assertion that he was Bishop of Rome we first find at a much later time. From the second half of the second century we do possess texts that mention the apostolic foundation of Rome, and at this time, which is indeed rather late, this foundation is traced back to Peter and Paul, an assertion that cannot be supported historically.

[[First Letter of Clement|1 Clement]], a document that has been dated from the 90s to the 120s, is one of the earliest sources adduced in support of Peter's stay in Rome, but questions have been raised about the text's authenticity and whether it has any knowledge about Peter's life beyond what is contained in the New Testament ''Acts''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwierlein review&quot;/&gt;  The ''Letter to the Romans'' attributed to St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] implies that Peter and Paul had special authority over the Roman church,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt; telling the Roman Christians: &quot;I do not command you, as Peter and Paul did&quot; (ch. 4). However, the authenticity of this document and its traditional dating to c. 105–10 have also been questioned, and it may date from the final decades of the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwierlein review&quot;/&gt;

Later in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] believed that Peter and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] had been the founders of the Church in Rome and had appointed [[Pope Linus|Linus]] as succeeding [[bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.iv.html |title=Irenaeus Against Heresies 3.3.2 |quote = …[the] Church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops…  The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (Book III, Chapter III, paragraphs 2–3), Irenaeus wrote:
{{bquote|Since, however, it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the succession of all the churches, we shall confound all those who, in whatever manner, whether through self-satisfaction or vainglory, or through blindness and wicked opinion, assemble other than where it is proper, by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all, founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, that church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles. With that church, because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree, that is, all the faithful in the whole world, and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition.}}

{{bquote|The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate. Of this Linus, Paul makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy. To him succeeded Anacletus; and after him, in the third place from the apostles, Clement was allotted the bishopric. This man, as he had seen the blessed apostles, and had been conversant with them, might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone [in this], for there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the apostles. In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having occurred among the brethren at Corinth, the Church in Rome dispatched a most powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to peace, renewing their faith, and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the apostles…}}

[[Tertullian]] also writes: &quot;But if you are near Italy, you have Rome, where authority is at hand for us too. What a happy church that is, on which the apostles poured out their whole doctrine with their blood; where Peter had a passion like that of the Lord, where Paul was crowned with the death of John (the Baptist, by being beheaded).&quot; [[Dionysius of Corinth]] also serves as a late 2nd-century witness to the tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt; He wrote: &quot;You (Pope Soter) have also, by your very admonition, brought together the planting that was made by Peter and Paul at Rome and at Corinth; for both of them alike planted in our Corinth and taught us; and both alike, teaching similarly in Italy, suffered martyrdom at the same time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Pope Soter AD 170, in Eusebius, ''History of the Church'' 2:25:8&lt;/ref&gt; Later tradition, first found in Saint Jerome, attributes to Peter a 25-year episcopate (or apostolate) in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Peter&quot; /&gt;

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, there was a Christian community at Rome before either Peter or Paul arrived there:
{{bquote|Even on the Day of Pentecost, &quot;Roman strangers&quot; (advenœ Romani, Acts 2:10) were present at Jerusalem, and they surely must have carried the good news to their fellow-citizens at Rome… according to the pseudo-Clementine Epistles, St. Barnabas was the first to preach the Gospel in the Eternal City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13164a.htm |title=&quot;Rome&quot;, '&amp;#39;Catholic Encyclopedia'&amp;#39; |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-02-01 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] {{Bibleverse-nb|Romans||16}} (c. 58) attests to a large Christian community already there,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Rome&quot;&gt;Cross, FL, ed.

===Non-canonical sayings of Peter===
Two sayings are attributed to Peter in the gnostic [[Gospel of Thomas]]. In the first, Peter compares Jesus to a &quot;just messenger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm |title=Gospel of Thomas 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second, Peter asks Jesus to &quot;make Mary leave us, for females don't deserve life,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm |title=Gospel of Thomas 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the verse containing the latter is regarded by most scholars as a dubious, later addition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], Peter holds a dialogue with Jesus about the [[parable of the fig tree]] and the fate of [[sinners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/apocalypsepeter-mrjames.html |title=Apocalypse of Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gospel of Mary]], whose text is largely fragmented, Peter appears to be jealous of &quot;Mary&quot; (probably [[Mary Magdalene]]). He says to the other disciples, &quot;Did He really speak privately with a woman and not openly to us? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did He prefer her to us?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/marygosp.htm |title=Gospel of Mary 9:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply to this, [[Saint Matthew|Levi]] says &quot;Peter, you have always been hot tempered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/marygosp.htm |title=Gospel of Mary 9:6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noncanonical texts that attribute sayings to Peter include the [[Secret Book of James]] and the [[Acts of Peter]].

===Denial of Jesus===
In the [[Fayyum Fragment]] of the end of the 3rd century, Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him three times before a [[Rooster|cock]] crows (on the following morning). The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]], either an abbreviation of the account in the Synoptics or a source text on which they were based.

===Post-Jesus===
The fragmentary [[Gospel of Peter]], attributed to Peter, contains an account of the death of Jesus differing significantly from the canonical gospels. It contains little information about Peter himself, except that after the discovery of the [[empty tomb]], &quot;I, Simon Peter, and Andrew my brother, took our fishing nets and went to the sea.&quot;

===19th century===
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the founder of [[Mormonism]], recorded in multiple revelations that Peter appeared to him and [[Oliver Cowdery]] in 1829 in order to bestow the apostleship and keys of the kingdom as part of a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration of priesthood authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/27/12-13#12|title=Doctrine &amp; Covenants 27:12–13|publisher=Scriptures.lds.org|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/128/20-21#20|title=Doctrine &amp; Covenants 128:20–21|publisher=Scriptures.lds.org|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Primacy of the Roman Pontiff}}
According to Catholic belief, Peter was the first [[Bishop of Rome]] and chief [[pastor]] of the entire [[Catholic Church]]—the [[Vicar of Christ]] upon Earth.&lt;ref name=CEPope&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Pope}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peter never bore the title of &quot;[[Pope]]&quot;, or &quot;Vicar of Christ&quot;, the Catholic Church believes him to be the first Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Wilken, p. 281, quote: &quot;Some (Christian communities) had been founded by Peter, the disciple Jesus designated as the founder of his church. ... Once the position was institutionalized, historians looked back and recognized Peter as the first pope of the Christian church in Rome&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they consider every pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].

The Catholic Church's recognition of Peter as head of its church on Earth (with Christ being its [[heaven]]ly head) is based on its interpretation of two passages from the [[Canonical Gospels]] of the [[New Testament]]; as well as [[Sacred Tradition]]. The first passage is {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} which is: &quot;Feed my lambs, feed my lambs, feed my sheep&quot; (within the Greek it is Ποίμαινε i.e., to feed and rule [as a Shepherd]., v. 16 while Βόσκε i.e., to feed., for v.15 &amp; v. 17)&lt;ref&gt;[http://tr.biblos.com/john/21.htm &quot;Greek New Testament&quot;] Greek New Testament. John xxi 11 Jun. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;—which is seen by Catholics as Christ promising the spiritual supremacy to Peter. The Catholic Encyclopedia sees in this passage Jesus &quot;charging [Peter] with the superintendency of all his sheep, without exception; and consequently of his whole flock, that is, of his own church”.&lt;ref name= CEPope/&gt; The second passage is {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:17-20}}:

{{bquote|I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hell will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven&quot;.|Matthew 16:18-20 (NIV)}}

Christ spoke here in the Syriac tongue, hence:

&lt;div dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;
{{quote|{{lang|syr|2=&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:160%&quot;&gt;ܐܳܦ݂ ܐܶܢܳܐ ܐܳܡܰܪ ܐ݈ܢܳܐ ܠܳܟ݂ ܕ݁ܰܐܢ݈ܬ݁ ܗ݈ܽܘ ''ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ'' ܘܥܰܠ ܗܳܕ݂ܶܐ ''ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ'' ܐܶܒ݂ܢܶܝܗ ܠܥܺܕ݈݁ܬ݁ܝ ܘܬ݂ܰܪܥܶܐ ܕ݁ܰܫܝܽܘܠ ܠܳܐ ܢܶܚܣܢܽܘܢܳܗ܂ &lt;/span&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;| (Peshitta) {{lang|syr|ܡܬܝ ܝܘ. ܝܚ - ܟ }}}}

{{bquote|also I say I to you that you are Keepa (Cephah) and on this Keepa (Cephah) I will build my Church and the gates of Sheol not will subdue it.}}

{{bquote|Thou art a rock, and upon this rock: or, Thou art Peter, and upon this peter will I build my Church:}}

Pétrus ({{lang|grc|Πέτρος}}) and pétra ({{lang|grc|πέτρᾳ}}) are the Greek equivalent to the Syriac Cephah ({{lang|syr|ܟ݁ܺܐܦ݂ܳܐ}}) which means &quot;rock&quot;, and there is no difference at all between Pétrus and
pétra.

To better understand what Christ meant, St. Basil elaborates:&lt;ref name=&quot;Basil&quot;&gt;Basil li. De poenit. cƒ. Matth. v. 14 ; Luke xxii. 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{bquote|Though Peter be a rock, yet he is not a rock as Christ is. For Christ is the true unmoveable rock of himself, Peter is unmoveable by Christ the rock. For Jesus doth communicate and impart his dignities, not voiding himself of them, but holding them to himself, bestoweth them also upon others. He is the light, and yet 2. You are the light: he is the Priest, and yet he 3. maketh Priests: he is the rock, and he made a rock.| Basil li. De poenit. cƒ. Matth. v. 14 ; Luke xxii. 19}}

In reference to Peter's occupation before becoming an Apostle, the popes wear the [[Fisherman's Ring]], which bears an image of the saint casting his nets from a fishing boat. The keys used as a symbol of the pope's authority refer to the &quot;keys of the kingdom of Heaven&quot; promised to Peter.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|16:18-19}} The terminology of this &quot;commission&quot; of Peter is unmistakably parallel to the commissioning of Eliakim ben Hilkiah in {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:15-23}}. Peter is often depicted in both Western and Eastern Christian art holding a [[Key (lock)|key]] or a set of keys.

Though the authenticity of this account has been challenged, the general consensus is that these are Jesus' words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453832/Saint-Peter-the-Apostle &quot;Saint Peter the Apostle.&quot;] Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feast days====
[[File:SaintPeterRelic.jpg|thumb|Looking down into the ''[[crypt|confessio]]'' near the tomb of Apostle Peter, [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], [[Rome]].]]
The [[Roman Martyrology]] assigns 29 June as the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of both Peter and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], without thereby declaring that to be the day of their deaths. St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: &quot;One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.&quot;

This is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

In the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul's outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.

Before [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].

====St. Peter's Basilica====
{{Main|St. Peter's Basilica}}
In the early 4th century, the [[Emperor Constantine I]] decided to honour Peter with a large [[basilica]]. Because the precise location of Peter's burial was so firmly fixed in the belief of the Christians of Rome, the church to house the basilica had to be erected on a site that was not convenient to construction. The slope of the Vatican Hill had to be excavated, even though the church could much more easily have been built on level ground only slightly to the south. There were also moral and legal issues, such as demolishing a cemetery to make room for the building. The focal point of the Basilica, both in its original form and in its later complete reconstruction, is the altar located over what is said to be the point of Peter's burial.

===Protestants and other views===
A major debate between Catholics and Protestants centers on Matthew 16:18 where Jesus tells Peter: &quot;You are ''Peter'', and on this ''rock'' I will build my Church...&quot; Catholics interpret the verse as saying that Jesus would build his church on Peter, the apostle. The traditional Catholic interpretation has been that Jesus told Peter (Rock) that he would build his Church on this Rock (Peter), and that Peter was made the shepherd of the apostolic flock{{Bibleref2c|Jn|21:15-19}}—hence their assertion of the Primacy of the Roman Pontiff.

====Meaning of &quot;Rock&quot;====
In the original [[Greek language|Greek]] the word translated as &quot;Peter&quot; is ''Πέτρος'' (Petros) and that translated as &quot;rock&quot; is ''πέτρα'' (petra), two words that, while not identical, give an impression of one of many times when Jesus used a play on words.  Furthermore, since Jesus presumably spoke to Peter in their native [[Aramaic language]], he would have used ''kepha'' in both instances.&lt;ref name=&quot;keating&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Peter_the_Rock.asp |title=http://www.catholic.com/library/Peter_the_Rock.asp |publisher=Catholic.com | date =2004-08-10 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peshitta Text and the Old Syriac text use the word &quot;kepha&quot; for both &quot;Peter&quot; and &quot;rock&quot; in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.peshitta.org/pdf/Mattich16.pdf |title=http://www.peshitta.org/pdf/Mattich16.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|John|1:42}} says Jesus called Simon &quot;Cephas&quot;, as does Paul in some letters. He was instructed by Christ to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles.{{Bibleref2c|Lk|22:31-32}} Peter also had a leadership role in the early Christian church at Jerusalem according to The Acts of the Apostles chapters 1–2, 10–11, and 15.

Early Catholic Latin and Greek writers (such as St. [[John Chrysostom]]) considered the &quot;foundation rock&quot; as applying to both Peter personally and his confession of faith (or the faith of his confession) symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=&quot;Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition&quot; in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press| pages= 61–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This &quot;double meaning&quot; interpretation is present in the current [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], Articles 424 and 552&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestant counter-claims to the Catholic interpretation are largely based on the difference between the Greek words translated &quot;Rock&quot; in the Matthean passage. In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant &quot;pebble,&quot; while ''petra'' meant &quot;boulder&quot; or &quot;cliff.&quot; Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean &quot;pebble,&quot; they argue that the &quot;rock&quot; in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koiné Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.

[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481–82)]]
However, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase &quot;on this rock I will build my church,&quot; the word ''petra'' (πέτρα in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: &quot;They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.&quot;

Although {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the 16th century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;Mathison, Keith A., [http://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this claim, many Fathers saw a connection between Matthew 16:18 and the primacy of Peter and his office, such as [[Tertullian]], writing: ''the Lord said to Peter, ‘On this rock I will build my Church, I have given you the keys of the kingdom of heaven [and] whatever you shall have bound or loosed on earth will be bound or loosed in heaven’ [Matt. 16:18–19]. . . . Upon you, he says, I will build my Church; and I will give to you the keys, not to the Church.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/tracts/peters-primacy ''Peter's Primacy | Catholic Answers] &lt;/ref&gt;

Other theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A. Carson who claim that there is no distinction between the words ''petros'' and ''petra'' in Koine Greek. The Lutheran theologians state that the dictionaries of [[Koine Greek|Koine/NT Greek]], including the authoritative&lt;ref&gt;Rykle Borger, &quot;Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Worterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis,&quot; Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker, Bernard A. Tayler (et al. eds.) pp. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bauer lexicon|Bauer-Danker-Arndt-Gingrich Lexicon]], indeed list both words and the passages that give different meanings for each. The Lutheran theologians further note that:

{{bquote|We honor Peter and in fact some of our churches are named after him, but he was not the first pope, nor was he Roman Catholic. If you read his first letter, you will see that he did not teach a Roman hierarchy, but that all Christians are royal priests. The same keys given to Peter in Matthew 16 are given to the whole church of believers in Matthew 18''&lt;ref name=&quot;WELS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkiv.lbk.cc/faq/site.pl@1518cutopic_topicid19cuitem_itemid6106.htm |title=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |publisher=Arkiv.lbk.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Partial Protestant support====
Partial support for the Catholic position comes from one of Protestantism's most distinguished Church historians, Oscar Cullmann, a Lutheran theologian. He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by &quot;rock&quot; Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that &quot;Kepha&quot; was the Aramaic word for &quot;rock&quot;, and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Yet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: &quot;In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.&quot; While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as &quot;warrant of the papal succession.&quot;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite news|author=Monday, Dec. 07, 1953 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter &amp; the Rock |publisher=TIME |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

There are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about &quot;Rock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish &quot;stone,&quot; there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.&lt;ref name=&quot;keating&quot; /&gt;

Yet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means &quot;this very&quot; or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for &quot;and&quot;, ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus, Peter &amp; the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodox===
[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards Apostle Peter, together with Apostle Paul, as &quot;Preeminent Apostles&quot;. Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as &quot;Choir-director&quot;, or lead singer.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, ISBN 978-0-88141-125-6)&lt;/ref&gt; The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any &quot;princely&quot; role over his fellow Apostles.

The New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).

Eastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that &quot;Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.&quot;

With regard to Jesus' words to Peter, &quot;Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church&quot;, the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church.  This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says &quot;upon this rock&quot; (ταύτῃ τῇ πέτρᾳ); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, ISBN 0-944359-13-2) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;gender distinction&quot; argument is also held by some Protestants.

====Feast days====
In the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:

* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]—This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]]
* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]—commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1-11}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].

===Syriac Orthodox Church===
The Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to be the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.

The Syriac Fathers following the rabbinic tradition call Jesus “[[Kepha]]” for they see “rock” in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer at Saint Peter as &quot;Saint Simon the Generous&quot; or Simon Karam&quot;) . When Christ gave his own name “Kepha” to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else’s name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He says Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.

Again he says in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from “rock” (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. Our Lord accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him [[Kepha]]. When he speaks about transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. In Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records Peter the Rock shunned honour Who was the head of the Apostles. In a ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.

Both [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church building, marriage, ordination etc. reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=&quot;Primacy of St. Peter&quot; - by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Apostolic Church===
The [[New Apostolic Church]], who believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or &quot;[[Mormons]]&quot;) along with other sects of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] believe that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church, but reject papal succession. In interpreting {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:13-19}} the LDS Church has stated, &quot;The things of God are known only by the power of his Spirit.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1981/05/upon-this-rock?lang=eng |title=Upon This Rock|publisher=www.lds.org |date= |accessdate=1981-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;That which the world calls Mormonism is based upon the rock of revelation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1973/07/the-rock-of-revelation?lang=eng |title=The Rock of Revelation|publisher=www.lds.org |date= |accessdate=1973-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;And how could it be otherwise?&quot; asked Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Council of the Twelve. In his April 1981 general conference address, he identified the rock of which the Savior spoke as the rock of revelation. &quot;There is no other foundation upon which the Lord could build His Church and kingdom. . . .&quot;Revelation: Pure, perfect, personal revelation - this is the rock! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/21017/Christ-built-Church-on-rock-of-revelation.html |title=Christ built Church on rock of revelation|publisher=www.ldschurchnews.com |date= |accessdate=1991-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Latter-day saints believe that Peter, [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] came from heaven and conferred the keys of the [[Melchizedek Priesthood]] upon [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] in 1829, near [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] as part of the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration of priesthood authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/27/12-13#12 Doctrine &amp; Covenants 27: 12–13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic literature===
{{Main|Saint Peter and Islam}}
[[Muslim]]s accept [[Jesus]] as a [[prophet]] of [[Islam]]. The [[Qur'an]] also speaks of Jesus's disciples but does not mention their names, instead referring to them as &quot;helpers to the [[prophet of God]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 3:49-53&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim exegesis and [[Qur'an]] commentary, however, names them and includes Peter amongst the disciples.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; An old tradition, which involves the legend of [[Habib the Carpenter]], mentions that Peter was one of the three disciples sent to [[Antioch]] to preach to the people there.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes Dictionary of Islam'', ''Habib the Carpenter''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s see a parallel in the figure of Peter to [[Ali]] at [[Muhammad]]'s time. They look upon Ali as being the [[vicegerent]], with [[Muhammad]] being the [[prophet]]; likewise, they see Peter as the [[vicegerent]], behind [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] the [[prophet]] and [[Masih]]. Peter's role as the first proper leader of the church is also seen by Shia's to be a parallel to their belief in Ali as the first [[caliph]] after Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''No god but God'', Reza Aslan, Dictionary: ''Simon Peter''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Traditionally, two canonical epistles ([[1 Peter|1]] and [[2 Peter]]) and several apocryphal works have been attributed to Peter.

===New Testament===
The [[New Testament]] includes two letters (''epistles'') ascribed to Peter. Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. However, the author of the first epistle explicitly claims to be using a secretary (see below), and this explanation would allow for discrepancies in style without entailing a different source. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. This means at the most that Peter could not have authored both, or at the least that he used a different secretary for each letter. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&amp;nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.

Of the two epistles, the [[First Epistle of Peter|first epistle]] is considered the earlier. A number of scholars have argued that the textual discrepancies with what would be expected of the biblical Peter are due to it having been written with the help of a secretary or as an [[amanuensis]]. Indeed in the first epistle the use of a secretary is clearly described: &quot;By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|5:12|ESV|1 Pet. 5:12}} Thus, in regards to at least the first epistle, the claims that Peter would have written Greek poorly seem irrelevant. The letter refers to Roman persecution of Christians, apparently of an official nature.  The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example [[Eusebius of Caesarea]](''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in 1 Peter must be this Neronian persecution. On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that 1 Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81–96), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:
:
{{bquote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1-2}}}}

Those scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1-2.
 
The [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied 2 Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text. Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and 2 Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150, there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian [[Eusebius]] claimed that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250. Even in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and 2 Peter was often not included in the [[Biblical Canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the east the [[Syrian Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.

Traditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter, hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to [[Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:

{{bquote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14–16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:

{{bquote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Based on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's Gospel about St. Peter would be based on eyewitness material. It should be noted, however, that some scholars (for differing reasons) dispute the attribution of the Gospel of Mark to its traditional author. The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.

===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===
[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-Überwasserkirche-Schlüssel.jpg|thumb|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]
There are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, not recognized by the Church, that have been either attributed to or written about St. Peter. They were from antiquity regarded as [[pseudepigrapha]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} These include:

*[[Gospel of Peter]], a partially [[docetism|Docetic]] narrative that has survived in part
*[[Acts of Peter]]
*[[Acts of Peter and Andrew]]
*[[Acts of Peter and Paul]]
*[[Acts of Peter and the Twelve]]
*[[Gnostic Apocalypse of Peter]]
*A [[Letter of Peter to Philip]], which was preserved in the [[Nag Hammadi library]]
*[[Apocalypse of Peter]], which was considered as genuine by many Christians as late as the 4th century
*The Epistula Petri, the introductory letter ascribed to Apostle Peter that appears at the beginning of at least one version of the [[Clementine literature]]

==Iconography==
In traditional [[iconography]], Peter has been shown very consistently since [[early Christian art]] as an oldish thick-set man with a &quot;slightly combative&quot; face and a short beard, and usually white hair, sometimes balding.  He thus contrasts with [[Saint Paul]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face.  One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard.  Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Higgitt, John, &quot;The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin&quot;, pp. 267-272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David &amp; Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''. Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 1989 ISBN 0-85115-610-X ISBN 9780851156101, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3jPRV2hUGE8C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=%22levis+theca%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JJeALlvmG_&amp;sig=t4R7U88hU-xz6nRP2SYugrsSIkg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C1YbT_bMJcvc8QO4hrC9Cw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22levis%20theca%22&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the Middle Ages his [[emblem|attribute]] is one or two large keys in his hand or hanging from his belt, first seen in the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Higgitt, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; More than many medieval attributes, this continued to be depicted in the Renaissance and afterwards.  By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons. 

The depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists (see next section) is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God.  Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the Gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers.  Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial.  In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.

==Popular culture==
Over the years &quot;St. Peter&quot; has evolved into a [[stock character]] that is now widely used in [[joke]]s, [[cartoon]]s, [[comedy|comedies]], [[drama]]s, and [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. Such caricatures almost all play upon Peter's role as the &quot;keeper of the keys of the [[Kingdom of God|kingdom of heaven]]&quot; in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:19}}, on the basis of which he is often depicted as an elderly, bearded man who sits at the [[pearly gates]] that serve as heaven's main entrance, often portrayed as a sort of hotel-style [[doorman (profession)|doorman]] / [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] who personally interviews prospective entrants into Heaven, often seated behind a desk, or standing at a lectern. He usually has a big book in which the names of the saved are written.

==Holy relics==
[[File:Francesco del Cossa 017.jpg|thumb|Pius XII ordered [[archaeological excavations]] under [[St Peter's Basilica]] in Rome to determine whether the tomb of St Peter was there. At the conclusion of the Holy Year in 1950 he confirmed that the tomb of Peter had been found underneath the basilica&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenico Cardinale Tardini 1960, p. 76&quot;&gt;Domenico Cardinale Tardini, ''Pio XII'', Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Pope Vitalian]] sent filings from Apostle Peter's chains to [[Oswy]], King of [[Northumbria]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall&quot;&gt;Wall, J. Charles. (1912), ''Porches and Fonts.'' Pub. London: Wells Gardner and Darton. P. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's remains continue to be subject of investigation, but his tomb is located under Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, which was announced by [[Pope Pius XII]] on Christmas Day in 1950 after years of painstaking research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenico Cardinale Tardini 1960, p. 76&quot;/&gt;

==Revisionist views==
Many Protestant scholars accept the traditional story of Peter's martyrdom in Rome. Some Protestants, however, have rejected Peter's martyrdom as a later invention, arguing that evidence of Peter exists only in Biblical accounts.

It has also been claimed that there was a serious division between Peter's [[Jewish Christian]] party and Paul's Hellenizing party, seen in e.g. the [[Incident at Antioch]], which later Christian accounts have downplayed.&lt;ref&gt;White, L. Michael (2004). From Jesus to Christianity. HarperSanFrancisco. pp. 170. ISBN 0-06-052655-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another revisionist view was developed by supporters of the [[Christ myth theory]], which holds that the figure of Peter is largely a development from some mythological doorkeeper figures. According to [[Arthur Drews]] and [[George Albert Wells|G. A. Wells]], if there was a historical Peter, then all that is known about him is the brief mentions in Galatians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egodeath.com/arthurdrewslegendstpeter.htm |title=Arthur Drews - The Legend of St. Peter |publisher=Egodeath.com |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Albert Wells]], &quot;St. Peter as Bishop of Rome&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
