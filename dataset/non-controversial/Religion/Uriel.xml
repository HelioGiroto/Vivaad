'''Uriel''' ('''אוּרִיאֵל''' &quot;El/[[Dominus illuminatio mea|God is my light]]&quot;, Auriel/Oriel (God is my light) [[Standard Hebrew]] '''{{Unicode|Uriʾel''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''ʾÛrîʾēl}}''') is one of the [[archangel]]s of post-Exilic [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic]] tradition, and also of certain [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions. His name may have analogies with ''[[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]]''.  

In apocryphal, kabbalistic and occult works Uriel has been equated or confused with Urial,&lt;ref&gt;''Forward Day by Day'', August–September–October 2011, p. 61, entry for September 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuriel]], Uryan, Jeremiel, Vretil, [[Sariel]], Suriel, Puruel, Phanuel, Jehoel, [[Jacob]], Ezrail/[[Azrael]] and Israfil/[[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]].

==In Judaism and Christianity==
===Name and origins===
{{Original research|section|date=March 2012}}
The angels mentioned in the older books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] are without names. Indeed, rabbi [[Simeon ben Lakish of Tiberias]] (230–270), asserted that all the specific names for the angels were brought back by the Jews from Babylon, and some modern commentators would tend to agree. Of the [[seven Archangels]] in the angelology of post-Exilic Judaism, only two, [[Gabriel]], and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], are mentioned by name in the Scriptures consistently recognised by both the post-[[Council of Jamnia|Jamnia]] Jewish tradition and the books common to both the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] biblical canon and the smaller Protestant one. Raphael features prominently in the [[deuterocanonical]] book [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] (initially accepted by both the Jewish and Christian canons, but removed from the Jewish canon in late antiquity and rejected by the Protestant reformers in the 17th century). The Book of Tobit is accepted as scriptural by the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]].

Where a fourth archangel is added to the named three, to represent the four cardinal points, Uriel is generally the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Uriel is listed as the fourth angel in Christian [[Gnostic]]s (under the name [[Phanuel (angel)|Phanuel]]), by [[Gregory the Great]], and in the angelology of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]]. However, the Book of Enoch clearly distinguishes the two Angels; Uriel means 'the Light of God' while Phanuel means &quot;the Face of God.&quot;  Uriel is the third angel listed in the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'', the fourth being [[Sabrael]].

Uriel also appears in the ''[[2 Esdras|Second Book of Esdras]]''&lt;ref&gt;2 Esdras 4:1; 5:20; 10:28&lt;/ref&gt; (found in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha section]] of many bibles, and sometimes called Esdras IV in Catholic versions, which makes up part of the [[apocalyptic literature]] of ''[[Esdras]]''), in which the prophet [[Ezra]] asks God a series of questions, and Uriel is sent by God to instruct him. According to the Revelation of [[Esdras]], the angels that will rule at the end of the world are [[Saint Michael|Michael]], [[Gabriel]], Uriel, [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], [[Gabuthelon]], [[Beburos]], [[Zebuleon]], [[Aker (angel)|Aker]], and [[Arphugitonos]]. The last five listed only appear in this book and nowhere else in apocryphal or apocalyptic works.

[[File:&quot;Madonna of the Rocks&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci, Louvre version.jpg|thumb|left|Uriel, right, in the [[Virgin of the Rocks]] ([[Louvre]] version) by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], 1483-86.]] 

In Christian [[apocrypha]]l gospels Uriel plays a role, differing between sources, in the rescue of [[Jesus]]' cousin [[John the Baptist]] from the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] ordered by King [[Herod the Great|Herod]]. He carries John and his mother [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Saint Elizabeth]] to join the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight into Egypt]]. Their reunion is depicted in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]].

Uriel is often identified as a [[Cherubim|cherub]] and angel of repentance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Books of Adam|Book of Adam and Eve]]&lt;/ref&gt; He &quot;stands at the Gate of Eden with a fiery sword,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abbot Anscar Vonier, 1964. 'The Teaching of the Catholic Church'&lt;/ref&gt; or as the angel who &quot;watches over thunder and terror.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch?&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Apocalypse of Peter]]'' he appears as the Angel of Repentance, who is graphically represented as being as pitiless as any demon. In the ''[[Life of Adam and Eve]]'', Uriel is regarded as the spirit (i.e., one of the cherubs) of the third chapter of Genesis. He is also identified as one of the angels who helped bury Adam and Abel in Paradise.

Stemming from medieval Jewish mystical traditions, Uriel has also become the Angel of Sunday (''Jewish Encyclopedia''), the Angel of Poetry, and one of the Holy [[Sephiroth (Kabbalah)|Sephiroth]]. Uriel is depicted as the destroyer of the hosts of [[Sennacherib]]. 

He checked the doors of [[Egypt]] for lamb's blood during the plague. He also holds the key to [[Hell|the Pit]] during the [[End Times]] and led [[Abraham]] to the West.

In modern [[angelology]], Uriel is identified variously as a [[seraph]], [[cherub]], regent of the sun, flame of God, angel of the Divine Presence, presider over Tartarus (hell), archangel of salvation, and, in later scriptures, identified with [[Phanuel (angel)|Phanuel]] &quot;face of God.&quot; He is often depicted carrying a book or a papyrus scroll representing wisdom. Uriel is a patron of the Arts.

[[Eastern Orthodox Church]] [[icon]] of the &quot;Seven [[Archangel]]s.&quot; From left to right: [[Jhudiel|St Jehudiel]], [[Gabriel|St Gabriel]], [[Selaphiel|St Selatiel]], [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]], St Uriel, [[Raphael (archangel)|St Raphael]], [[Barachiel|St Barachiel]]. Beneath the [[mandorla]] of Christ [[Emmanuel]] are representations of [[Cherubim]] (blue) and [[Seraphim]] (red).]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Uriel is commemorated together with the other archangels and angels with a [[feast day]] of the &quot;[[Synaxis]] of the Archangel Michael and the Other [[Bodiless Powers]]&quot; on November 8 of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] (for those churches which follow the [[Julian Calendar]], November 8 falls on November 21 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). In addition, every Monday throughout the year is dedicated to the angels.

In [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''Hierarchy of Blessed Angels'' (1635), Uriel is described as an Angel of the Earth. Heywood's list is actually of the Angels of the Four Winds: Uriel (south), Michael (east), Raphael (west) (serving also a governor of the south, with Uriel), and Gabriel (north). He is also listed as an Angel of the four winds in the medieval Jewish ''Book of the Angel Raziel''&lt;ref&gt;''Sepher Rezial Hemelach''&lt;/ref&gt; which lists him as Usiel (Uzziel); according to it, this book was inscribed on a sapphire stone and handed down from Seraph to [[Metatron]] and then to Adam.

At the Council of Rome of 745, [[Pope Zachary|Pope St. Zachary]], intending to clarify the Church's teaching on the subject of angels and curb a tendency toward angel worship, condemned obsession with angelic intervention and angelolatry, but reaffirmed the approval of the practice of the reverence of angels. This synod struck many angels' names from the list of those eligible for veneration in the Church of Rome, including Uriel. Only the reverence of the archangels mentioned in the recognized Catholic canon of scriptures, Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, remained licit.  

In the first half of the 11th century Bulgarian followers of the dualist heresy called [[Bogomilism]] who lived in the dukedom of [[Ahtum]] in present day [[Banat]] invoked Uriel in rituals. This is witnessed by [[Gerard Sagredo]], Catholic bishop of the area after 1028.

In [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s translation of ''[[The Golden Legend]]'', Uriel is one of the angels of the seven planets. Uriel is the angel of Mars. He is also listed as such in [[Benjamin Camfield]]'s ''A Theological Discourse of Angels'' (1678).&lt;ref&gt;Canfield, ''A Theological Discourse of Angels, Wherein Their Existence, Nature, Number, Order and Offices, are modestly treated of...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly Uriel's highest position is that of an Angel of Presence, Prince of Presence, Angel of the Face, Angel of Sanctification, Angel of Glory. A Prince of the Presence is an angel who is allowed to enter the presence of God. Uriel along with [[Suriel]], [[Jehoel]], [[Zagagel]], [[Akatriel]], Metatron, [[Yefefiah]], [[Michael]], [[Gabriel]], [[Raphael]], and [[Nathanel]] ([[Zathael]]) holds this position. The Angel of His Presence title is often taken to mean [[Shekinah]] but it and the other terms mentioned are also often used as alternate names for the angel Metatron. [[R. H. Charles]] comments in his translation of ''The Book Of Enoch'' that in later Judaism &quot;we find Uriel instead of Phanuel&quot; as one of the four angels of the presence.

A scriptural reference to an angel of presence is found in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=is%2063:9;&amp;version=9; 63:9] — &lt;blockquote&gt;''In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Enoch===
{{Main|Book of Enoch}}
The [[Book of Enoch]], which presents itself as written by [[Enoch (Biblical figure)|Enoch]], mentions Uriel in many of the component books. In Chapter IX which is part of &quot;The Book of the Watchers&quot; (2nd century BCE) only four Angels are mentioned by name these are Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and [[Gabriel]]. However the later Chapter XX lists the name and function of seven archangels these are &quot;Uriel, one of the holy angels, who is over the world and over [[Tartarus]]&quot;, Raphael, [[Raguel (archangel)|Raguel]], Michael, Saraqâêl, Gabriel, and [[Remiel (archangel)|Remiel]].

The Book of the Angels as a whole tells us that Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel were present before God to testify on behalf of [[Humankind]]. They wish to ask for divine intervention during the reign of the Fallen Gregori (Fallen Watchers). These fallen take human wives and produced half-angel, half-human offspring called the [[Nephilim]]. Uriel is responsible for contacting [[Noah]] about the upcoming [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]].

:''Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spoke, and sent Uriel to the son of Lamech, and said to him: &quot;&lt;Go to Noah&gt; and tell him in my name 'Hide thyself!' and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it.&quot;

After judgment has been brought on the Nephilim and the fallen ones including the two main leaders [[Samyaza]] and [[Azazel]], Uriel discusses their fates.

:&quot;And Uriel said to me: 'Here shall stand the angels who have connected themselves with women, and their spirits assuming many different forms are defiling mankind and shall lead them astray into sacrificing to demons 'as gods', (here shall they stand,) till 'the day of' the great judgment in which they shall be judged till they are made an end of. And the women also of the angels who went astray shall become sirens.' And I, Enoch alone, saw the vision, the ends of all things; and no man shall see as I have seen.&quot;

Uriel then acts as a guide for Enoch for the rest of the Book of Watchers. He fulfills this capacity in many of the other books that make up 1 Enoch.

===In Anglican tradition===
In the traditions and [[hagiography]] of the [[Episcopal Church USA|Episcopal]] and other [[Anglican]] churches, Uriel is mentioned as an archangel.  
He is also recognized as the [[Patron Saint]] of the [[Sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]]. He is celebrated in the Anglican liturgical calendars on the [[Feast of the Archangels]].&lt;ref&gt;Lesser Feasts and Fasts, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/254.html Anglican.org website Michaelmas page]. Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stgeorgeslennoxville.com/WhatareAnglicansAnyway.dsp St. George's Lennoxville website, What Are Anglicans, Anyway? page].

Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglican intercessional prayer to Saint Uriel the Archangel is as follows;
::''Oh holy Saint Uriel, intercede for us that our hearts may burn with the fire of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.''
::''Assist us in co-operating with the graces of our confirmation that the gifts of the''
::''Holy Spirit may bear much fruit in our souls.''
::''Obtain for us the grace to use the sword of truth to pare away all that is not in conformity to the most adorable''
::''Will of God in our lives, that we may fully participate in the army of the Church''
::''Amen''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urielsg.org/Sections-read-7.html Saint Uriel Church website patron Saint web page]. Retrieved September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and popular culture==
=== In literature ===
In [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' Book III, Uriel, in charge of the Orb of the Sun, serves as the eyes of God, but unwittingly steers Satan towards the newly created earth. He also fills the role of fourth cardinal point (see above). Milton describes him as the &quot;sharpest sighted spirit in all of Heaven.&quot; He is also responsible along with Raphael for defeating [[Adramelech]].

In [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|Creation]]'', Uriel (tenor) is one of the three angelic narrators (with Gabriel (soprano) and Raphael (bass).

In [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Ralph Waldo Emerson's]] poem &quot;[[Uriel (poem)|Uriel]]&quot;, regarded as a poetic summary of many strains of thought in Emerson's early philosophy, Uriel is a young god in [[Paradise]], who upsets the world of gods by proclaiming [[relativism]] and the [[eternal return]].

In [[George Eliot|George Eliot's]] ''[[Middlemarch]]'', ch. XLI, to Uriel, &quot;watching the progress of planetary history from the sun, the one result would be just as much of a coincidence as the other&quot;.

In [[Madeleine L'Engle|Madeleine L'Engle's]] book, ''[[A Wrinkle In Time]]'', Uriel is a fictional planet of the galaxy [[Messier 101]] with mountains and beautiful flowers.

In L'Engle's novel ''[[Many Waters]]'', Uriel is a character, one of the Seraphim.

In [[Dean Koontz|Dean Koontz's]] book ''[[Hideaway (novel)|Hideaway]]'', Uriel speaks and acts through Hatch, one of the book's protagonists, to battle the demon [[Vassago]], who &quot;hitched a ride&quot; with Jeremy Nyebern after he was reanimated.

In [[Katherine Kurtz|Katherine Kurtz's]] series of novels ''[[Deryni novels#The Chronicles of the Deryni|Chronicles of the Deryni]],'' Uriel is the angel of death, escorting souls across the line of life to the afterlife.

In [[Clive Barker|Clive Barker's]] novel ''[[Weaveworld]]'', the Scourge declares its eternal name as Uriel. The major character Shadwell recognizes learning &quot;...of all the angels and archangels by heart: and amongst the mighty Uriel was of the mightiest. The archangel of salvation; called by some the flame of God.&quot; and &quot;Uriel had been the angel left to stand guard at the gates of Eden.&quot;

In the apocrypha of [[White Wolf Publishing]]'s ''Vampire: The Masquerade'' series, Uriel is the last of the angels sent to Cain, after Cain rejects the offers of redemption from Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Uriel tells Cain of Golconda, and that it is the last road of redemption open to Cain and his &quot;children&quot;.

In [[Jim Butcher|Jim Butcher's]] novel, ''[[Small Favor]]'', Uriel is a subtle but powerful player in the war with the Black Council and the Fallen/Denarians. Called the &quot;Watchman&quot;, he only reveals himself to the book's protagonist, Harry Dresden, as a janitor named &quot;Jake&quot;. In the novel, Harry receives the power of ''soulfire'' and believes that it came from Uriel. He is also referred to as Heaven's &quot;spook&quot;.  Uriel also appears at the end of Jim Butcher's [[novella]] ''The Warrior'', which was released as a part of the anthology, ''Mean Streets''. Uriel appears again in ''[[Changes (novel)|Changes]]'', when Harry Dresden asks him for help, after being paralyzed from the waist down. Uriel tells him that he cannot help him, and that he is limited to what he has already done. He also tells Harry that Maggie is indeed his daughter, something that he hadn't been entirely sure of. In Ghost Story, Uriel uses his influence to offer Harry the opportunity to come back to Earth as a spirit to find out the identity of his killer.  This is not revealed until close to the end of the book, when Uriel also shows Harry that his friends and family will be okay in his absence.  He also shows how Harry was unduly influenced to take up the mantle of the Winter Knight and redresses this imbalance by telling him that Mab, the Winter Queen cannot change who he is.  Unlike his appearances in ''[[Small Favor]]'' and ''The Warrior'', Uriel's form in ''[[Changes (novel)|Changes]]'' and Ghost Story is that of a young man with blond hair, rather than an old janitor. He is not bound by linear time, and is responsible for protecting Free Will.  The author has described the character as a VP of Creation. 

In ''Angelglass'' by [[David Barnett]], Uriel meddles in Earth's affairs and is cast down to see if he can &quot;improve&quot; the course of history by personal intervention.

In [[William J. Clark|William J. Clark's]] novel, ''Winning the Lottery'', Uriel is the guardian angel of the narrator, and later of his wife and children. He and the other three archangels, Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, play an active role in various plot elements, and become a common thread in an attempt to open a dialog between the Western and the [[Muslim]] worlds.

In [[Richard Kadrey| Richard Kadrey's]] ''Kill the Dead'', Uriel is one of the original fallen angels and revealed to be the father of protagonist James &quot;Sandman Slim&quot; Stark.

In [[Garth Nix| Garth Nix's]] [[Abhorsen Trilogy]] one of the &quot;nine bright shiners&quot; is named Yrael and appears as a being of living fire.
