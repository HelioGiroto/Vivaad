The movement arose in British and American [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century among [[evangelical Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandeen (1970), need p num.&lt;/ref&gt; These Protestants, in addition to [[Catholicism|Catholic]] fundamentalists, reacted against [[Christianity_in_the_19th_century#Modernism_in_Christian_theology|modernist theology]]. In true [[Church militant and church triumphant|Church Militant]] fashion of defending the Word of God, they asserted that the [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy of the Bible]] and Church teaching were essential for true Christianity and was being violated by the modernists.&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{cite book|title=Faith, Religion &amp; Theology: A Contemporary Introduction|author=Brennan Hill, Paul F.

They fear that Christian societites have replaced systems of absolute moral norms with subjective decision making and relativism. Like Protestant fundamentalists, Catholic fundamentalists propose a worldview that is rigorous and clear cut.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an organized movement, it began in the 1920s within Protestant churches — especially Baptist and Presbyterian — in the United States. Fundamentalist Christianity is often intertwined with [[Biblical literalism]]. Many such churches adopted a &quot;fighting style&quot; and certain theological elements, such as [[Dispensationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marsden (1980), pp. 55-62, 118-23&lt;/ref&gt; The broader term &quot;[[evangelical]]&quot; includes fundamentalists as well as people with similar or identical religious beliefs who do not engage the outside challenge to the Bible as actively.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet A. Harris, ''Fundamentalism and Evangelicals'' (2008) pp 39 313&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fundamentalism is a movement, rather than a denomination or a systematic theology, which gained ascendance after the release of a ten-volume set of essays, apologetic and polemic, written by many well-known conservative Protestant theologians to defend what they saw as Protestant [[orthodoxy]]&amp;mdash;covering a wide range of topics, from defenses of the [[Divinity of Jesus|Divinity of Jesus Christ]], his [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]], of the historicity of Biblical narratives, [[Mosaic authorship]] of the [[Pentateuch]], and of Biblical inerrancy against the prevalent [[higher criticism|higher-critical]] theories of the day, to the falsity of theological systems such as [[Christian Science]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses|&quot;Millennial Dawnism&quot;]], [[Mormonism]], to the errors of [[Catholic Church|&quot;Romanism&quot;]]&amp;mdash;over the course of 1910-1915, called ''[[The Fundamentals|The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth]]'', from which the movement receives its eponymous name. Catholic Fundamentalism stresses the need for adherence to literal interpretation of Vatican declarations, particularly those pronounced by the [[Pope]].&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;{{cite book|title=Faith, Religion &amp; Theology: A Contemporary Introduction|author=Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ek6bzhrlJL8C&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326&amp;dq=%22Catholic+fundamentalism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0LR_fhJDNK&amp;sig=vJ27nrBKxbzLGMipmaRx6_cA3as&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cf9T5bZH8m2rQHXgZ2LCQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Catholic%20fundamentalism%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Twenty-Third Publications]]|quote=Catholic fundamentalism also has its distinctive traits.

However, both Catholic and Protestant fundamentalists have been criticized for presenting God &quot;more as a God of judgement and punishment than as a God of love and mercy.&quot;&lt;ref name=God&gt;{{cite book|title=Faith, Religion &amp; Theology: A Contemporary Introduction|author=Brennan Hill, Paul F.

==Terminology==
The term ''fundamentalism'' was coined by Baptist editor Curtis Lee Laws in 1920 to designate Christians who were ready &quot;to do battle royal for the Fundamentals&quot;. The term was quickly adopted by all sides. Laws borrowed it from the title of a series of essays published between 1910 and 1915 called ''[[The Fundamentals|The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth]]''. The term &quot;Fundamentalism&quot; entered the English language in 1922, and is often capitalized when referring to the religious movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwebster&quot;/&gt;  

The term ''fundamentalist'' is controversial in the 21st century, as it can carry the connotation of religious [[extremism]], even though it was coined by movement leaders. Some who hold these beliefs reject the label of &quot;fundamentalism&quot;, seeing it as too pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Dale A.|title=What is a Fundamentalist Christian?|place=Grass Valley, CA|publisher=[[Victorious Publications]]|year=1995|url=http://www.victorious.org/chur21.htm|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while to others it has become a banner of pride. Such Christians prefer to use the term ''fundamental'', as opposed to ''fundamentalist'' (e.g., [[Independent Fundamental Baptist]] and [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horton|first=Ron|title=Christian Education at Bob Jones University|location=Greenville, SC|publisher=[[Bob Jones University]]|url=http://www.bju.edu/academics/christian-education.php|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes confused with ''[[Legalism (theology)|Christian legalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovrlnd.com/Apologetics/Liberalism_and_Scripture.html|title=Legalism and the Authority of Scripture|last=Wilson|first=William P.|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblebelievers.com/Morton_legalism-liberty.html|title=From Liberty to Legalism - A Candid Study of Legalism, &quot;Pharisees,&quot; and Christian Liberty|last=Morton|first=Timothy S.|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentalist movement in the United States==
Fundamentalism had multiple roots in British and American theology of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeen (1970), ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; One root was [[Dispensationalism]], a new interpretation of the Bible developed in the 1830s in England. It was a [[Millennialism|millenarian theory]] that divided all of time into seven different stages, called &quot;dispensations,&quot; which were seen as stages of God's revelation. At the end of each stage, according to this theory, God punished humanity for having been found wanting in God's testing. [[Secularism]], liberalism, and immorality in the 1920s were believed to be signs that humanity had again failed God's testing. This means that the world is on the verge of the last stage, where a final battle will take place at [[Armageddon]], followed by [[Second Coming of Christ|Christ's return]] and 1,000 year reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kee|first=Howard Clark|title=Christianity: A Social and Cultural History|year=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-578071-3|pages=484|coauthors=Emily Albu, Carter Lindberg, J. William Frost, Dana L. Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important sign is the rebirth of Israel, support for which became the centerpiece of Fundamentalist foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron William Stone, ''Dispensationalism and United States foreign policy with Israel'' *2008) [http://books.google.com/books?id=d2q8oKwWRMsC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=dispensationalism+israel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zdhDTrjhAsPisQKIy6TACQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second stream came from [[Princeton Theology]] in the mid-19th century, which developed the [[Biblical inerrancy|doctrine of inerrancy]] in response to [[higher criticism]] of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden (1980), pp 109-118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandeen (1970) pp 103-31&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Charles Hodge]] influenced fundamental insistence that the Bible was inerrant because it had been dictated by God and written by men who took that dictation. This meant that the Bible should be read differently from any other historical document, and also that [[modernism]] and [[liberalism]] were believed to lead people to hell just like non-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kee|first=Howard Clark|title=Christianity: A Social and Cultural History|year=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-578071-3|pages=484|coauthors=Emily Albu, Carter Lindberg, J. William Frost, Dana L. Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third strand—and the name itself—came from a 12-volume study ''The Fundamentals'', published 1910-1915.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeen (1970) pp 188-207&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsors subsidized the free distribution of over three million individual volumes to clergy, laymen and libraries. This version&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/6528/fundcont.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:18:43 ''The Fundamentals A Testimony to the Truth'']&lt;/ref&gt;  stressed several core beliefs, including:
* The inerrancy of the Bible
* The literal nature of the Biblical accounts, especially regarding Christ's miracles and the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation account in Genesis]].
* The Virgin Birth of Christ
* The bodily resurrection and physical return of Christ
* The [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ on the cross

By the late 1920s the first two points had become central to Fundamentalism. A fourth strand was the growing concern among many evangelical Christians with modernism and the higher criticism of the Bible. This strand concentrated on opposition to [[Darwinism]]. A fifth strand was the strong sense of the need for public revivals, a common theme among many Evangelicals who did not become Fundamentalists. Numerous efforts to form coordinating bodies failed, and the most influential treatise came much later, in ''Systematic Theology'' (1947) by [[Lewis S. Chafer]], who founded the [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] in 1924.

[[Martin E. Marty]] has written that within Catholicism, the movement has stressed &quot;items that will 'stand out,' such as [[Latin Mass|Mass in Latin]], opposition to [[Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women|women priests]], optional [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]], or support for dismissals of 'artificial birth control.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Selection&gt;{{cite book|title=Faith, Religion &amp; Theology: A Contemporary Introduction|author=Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ek6bzhrlJL8C&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326&amp;dq=%22Catholic+fundamentalism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0LR_fhJDNK&amp;sig=vJ27nrBKxbzLGMipmaRx6_cA3as&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cf9T5bZH8m2rQHXgZ2LCQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Catholic%20fundamentalism%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Twenty-Third Publications]]|quote=As Martin Marty has noted, Catholic fundamentalists may overlook-of course, without necessarily denying-the big &quot;fundamentals&quot; such as the Trinity. They will instead &quot;select items that will 'stand out,' such as Mass in Latin, opposition to women priests, optional clerical celibacy, or support for dismissals of 'artificial birth control.'&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of St. Pius X]], a product of [[Marcel Lefebvre|Lefebvre]], is stronghold for Catholic fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=Lefebvre&gt;{{cite book|title=The HarperCollins Encyclopedia of Catholicism|author=Richard P. McBrien|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WlNfJC6RveAC&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=catholic+Fundamentalist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DnDrT_n-IoGG8QSaxZHRBQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=catholic%20Fundamentalist&amp;f=false|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|quote=There are also fundamentalist communities ranging from the Lefebvre schism within the Catholic Church to movements of a dubious spirituality or to unapproved religious communities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Latin&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence, Society, and the Church: A Cultural Approach|author=Gerald A. Arbuckle|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gdKD8E7-798C&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=%22catholic+Fundamentalism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BPlMwYNGdw&amp;sig=2Ij44qqO423Q8PQ1YTNCbREBOhc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QNP9T8-ODKrD0QHYlYzsBg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22catholic%20Fundamentalism%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Liturgical Press]]|page=208|quote=Catholic fundamentalists belong to a particularly aggressive form of restorationism noted for...Concern for accidentals, not for the substance of issues, e.g., the Lefebvre sect stresses Latin for the Mass, failing to see that this does not pertain to authentic tradition. Attempts by fundamentalists groups, e.g., Opus Dei, to infiltrate governmental structures of the Church in order to obtain legitimacy for their views and to ompose them on the whole Church.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the enthusiasm for mobilizing Fundamentalism came from &quot;Bible Colleges&quot;, especially those modeled after the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in Chicago.  [[Dwight Moody]] was influential in preaching the imminence of the Kingdom of God that was so important to dispensationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kee|first=Howard Clark|title=Christianity: A Social and Cultural History|year=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=484|coauthors=Emily Albu, Carter Lindberg, J. William Frost, Dana L. Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible colleges prepared ministers who lacked college or seminary experience with intense study of the Bible, often using the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' of 1909, which was the King James version with detailed notes explaining how to interpret Dispensationalist passages.

==Organization==
Fundamentalist movements were found in most North American Protestant denominations by 1919, with the attack on modernism in theology launched by the Fundamentalists in the [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] churches. Fundamentalism was especially controversial among Presbyterians. Although it began in the North its greatest popular strength was in the South, especially among [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]]. By the late 1920s the national media had identified it with the South, largely ignoring manifestations elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Swetnam Mathews, ''Rethinking Zion: how the print media placed fundamentalism in the South'' (2006) page xi&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading organizer of the Fundamentalist campaign against modernism was [[William Bell Riley]], a Northern Baptist based in Minneapolis, where his Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School (1902), Northwestern Evangelical Seminary (1935), and Northwestern College (1944) produced thousands of graduates. Riley created, at a large conference in Philadelphia in 1919, the World's Christian Fundamentals Association (WCFA). It became the chief interdenominational fundamentalist organization in the 1920s. Although the fundamentalist drive of the 1920s to take control of the major Protestant denominations failed at the national level, the network of churches and missions fostered by Riley shows the movement was growing in strength, especially in [[Southern United States|The South]]. Both rural and urban in character, the flourishing movement acted as a denominational surrogate and aimed at a militant orthodoxy of evangelical Christianity. Riley was president until 1929, after which the WFCA faded in importance and was never replaced.&lt;ref&gt;William Vance Trollinger, Jr. &quot;Riley's Empire: Northwestern Bible School and Fundamentalism in the Upper Midwest&quot;. ''Church History'' 1988 57(2): 197-212. 0009-6407&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literalism==
{{further|Biblical literalism}}
A Biblical literalist is someone who literally interprets the words of the Bible. A literal Biblical interpretation is associated with the fundamentalist and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] approach to Scripture, and is used almost exclusively by [[Conservatism|conservative]] Christians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=97803346 ''Beyond Biblical Literalism and Inerrancy: Conservative Protestants and the Hermeneutic Interpretation of Scripture''], John Bartkowski, Sociology of Religion, 57, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Baptist]], [[Conservative Mennonites]] and other similar groups.

Catholic Fundamentalists, however, also believe in a literal interpretation of [[Holy See|Vatican]] declarations, particularly those pronounced by the [[Pope]].&lt;ref name=Description&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence, Society, and the Church: A Cultural Approach|author=Gerald A.

Consquently, individual freedom must be directed by the right authority. In the case of Catholic fundamentlaism, this means literal adherance fully to past tradition, or who have difficulty assenting to every official statement of the hierarchial magisterium, are judged harshly. Such sinners, say fundamentalists, are condemned by God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamentalists in the 1920s devoted themselves to fighting the teaching of [[Theory of evolution|evolution]] in the nation's schools and colleges, especially by passing state laws that affected public schools. Riley took the initiative in the [[Scopes Trial]] in Tennessee in 1925 to bring in famed politician [[William Jennings Bryan]] as an assistant to the local prosecutor. Liberals saw a division between educated, tolerant Christians and narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist Christians.&lt;ref&gt;David Goetz, &quot;The Monkey Trial&quot;. ''Christian History'' 1997 16(3): 10-18. 0891-9666; Burton W. Folsom, , Jr. &quot;The Scopes Trial Reconsidered.&quot; ''Continuity'' 1988 (12): 103-127. 0277-1446, by a leading conservative scholar&lt;/ref&gt; In the half century after the Scopes Trial the Fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and generally were defeated in their efforts to reshape the mainline denominations. The [[Mainline Protestant]] denominations refused to join the attacks on evolution and welcomed modern ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kee|first=Howard Clark|title=Christianity: A Social and Cultural History|year=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-578071-3|pages=484|coauthors=Emily Albu, Carter Lindberg, J. William Frost, Dana L. Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

However Edwards (2000) challenges the consensus view among scholars that in the wake of the Scopes trial a humiliated fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint evidenced in the movie &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; and the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, he argues, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory and not a defeat, but Bryan's death soon after created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Bryan, unlike the other leaders, brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist religious groups to argue for the anti-evolutionist position.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edwards, &quot;Rethinking the Failure of Fundamentalist Political Antievolutionism after 1925&quot;. ''Fides Et Historia'' 2000 32(2): 89-106. 0884-5379&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatewood (1969) analyzes the transition from the anti-evolution crusade of the 1920s to the [[creation science]] movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to scientific objections to Darwin's theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized scientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan instead of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Willard B. Gatewood, Jr., ed. ''Controversy in the Twenties: Fundamentalism, Modernism, &amp; Evolution'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other states===
Webb (1991) traces the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and Darwinists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. These included Reverends R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California, all supported by distinguished laymen. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era, which inspired increased faith in evolutionism.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Webb, &quot;The Evolution Controversy in Arizona and California: From the 1920s to the 1980s.&quot; ''Journal of the Southwest'' 1991 33(2): 133-150. 0894-8410. See also  Christopher K. Curtis, &quot;Mississippi's Anti-Evolution Law of 1926.&quot; ''Journal Of Mississippi History'' 1986 48(1): 15-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Militancy and evangelicals==
Fundamentalism is defined by historian [[George M. Marsden]] in his seminal work ''Fundamentalism and American Culture'' as &quot;militant anti-[[modernist]] [[Protestant]] [[evangelicalism]].&quot; Marsden explains that [[Christianity|Christian]] [[fundamentalists]] were American evangelical Christians who in the 20th century opposed &quot;both  modernism in  theology and the cultural changes that modernism endorsed. Militant opposition to modernism was what most clearly set off fundamentalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marsden (1980), ''Fundamentalism and American Culture'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians agree that militancy is a core characteristic of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;See Philip H. Melling, Fundamentalism in America: millennialism, identity and militant religion (1999). As another scholar points out, &quot;One of the major distinctives of fundamentalism is militancy.&quot; Ung Kyu Pak, ''Millennialism in the Korean Protestant Church'' (2005) p. 211. A Catholic scholar says: &quot;Essentially, fundamentalists see themselves as defending authentic Christian religion... The militant aspect helps to explain the desire of fundamentalists to become active in political change&quot; Ronald D. Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'' (2001) p 2 &lt;/ref&gt;  

The Fundamentalists from the 1920s insisted on &quot;militant&quot; action to counteract modernism and historians emphasize that theme too. &quot;Militant does not mean &quot;violent&quot;, it means &quot;aggressively active in a cause.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Militant&quot; in '' Merriam Webster Third Unabridged Dictionary'' (1961) which cites &quot;militant suffragist&quot; and &quot;militant trade unionism&quot; as example.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholars differentiate &quot;fundamentalists&quot; from &quot;evangelicals&quot; by arguing the former were more militant and less willing to collaborate with groups considered &quot;modernist&quot; in theology.  McKim and Wright (1992) argue,&quot;in the 1920s, militant conservatives (fundamentalists) united to mount a conservative counter-offensive. Fundamentalists sought to rescue their denominations from the growth of modernism at home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. McKim and David F. Wright, ''Encyclopedia of the Reformed faith'' (1992) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s the more moderate faction of fundamentalists (or &quot;postfundamentalists&quot;) maintained the same theology but began calling themselves  &quot;evangelicals&quot; to stress their less militant position. Olson (2007) points out, &quot;Most postfundamentalist evangelicals do not wish to be called fundamentalists, even though their basic theological orientation is not very different.&quot; A key event, Olson says, was the formation of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE) in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Roger E. Olson, ''Pocket History of Evangelical Theology'' (2007) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; As Hankins (2008) notes, &quot;Beginning in the 1940s....militant and separatist evangelicals came to be called fundamentalists, while culturally engaged and non-militant evangelicals were supposed to be called evangelicals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Hankins, ''Francis Schaeffer and the shaping of Evangelical America'' (2008) p 233&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
For example, American evangelist [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]] came from a fundamentalist background, but parted company with that movement because of his choice, early in his ministry (1950s), to cooperate with other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/marchweb-only/53.0.html Bob Jones University Drops Interracial Dating Ban | Christianity Today|A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Graham represents a movement that arose within fundamentalism, but has increasingly become distinct from it, known as neo-evangelicalism or New Evangelicalism (a term coined by Harold J. Ockenga, the &quot;Father of New Evangelicalism&quot;).

The original Fundamentalist Movement divided along clearly defined lines within conservative Evangelical Protestantism as issues progressed. Many groupings, large and small, were produced by this schism. [[Neo-evangelicalism]], Reformed and Lutheran Confessionalism, the [[David Barton (author)|Heritage movement]], and [[Paleo-Orthodoxy]] have all developed distinct identities, but none of them acknowledge any more than an historical overlap with the Fundamentalist Movement, and the term is seldom used of them.

== Christian right ==
{{Main|Christian right}}
The latter half of the twentieth century witnessed a surge interest in politics by organized fundamentalists in the U.S. The sparks that ignited their interest were decisions by the United States Supreme Court in 1962 to prohibit state-sanctioned prayer in public schools in the case of [[Engel v. Vitale]] and in 1963 to prohibit mandatory Bible reading in public schools in the case of [[Abington School District v. Schempp]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Dierenfield, ''The Battle over School Prayer'' (2007) p 236&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[Ronald Reagan]] ran for the presidency in 1980, fundamentalist preachers, like the prohibitionist ministers of the early 20th century, were organizing their congregations to vote for supportive candidates.&lt;ref&gt; Oran Smith, ''The Rise of Baptist Republicanism'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the political force included [[Robert Grant (Christian leader)|Rob Grant]] and [[Jerry Falwell]]. Beginning with Grant's American Christian Cause in 1974, [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]] throughout the 1970s and Falwell's [[Moral Majority]] in the 1980s, the [[Christian Right]] began to have a major impact on American politics. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Christian Right was influencing elections and policy with groups such as the [[Family Research Council]] (founded 1981 by [[James Dobson]]) and the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] (formed in 1989 by [[Pat Robertson]]) helping conservative politicians, especially [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to win state and national elections.&lt;ref&gt; Albert J. Menendez, ''Evangelicals at the Ballot Box'' (1996) pp 128-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada, Fundamentalism was less of a force,&lt;ref&gt;John G. Stackhouse, ''Canadian Evangelicalism in the Twentieth Century'' (1993)
&lt;/ref&gt; but it had an aggressive leader in  Englishman [[Thomas Todhunter Shields]] (1873–1955), who led 80 churches out of the Baptist federation in Ontario in 1927 and formed the Union of regular Baptist churches of Ontario and Quebec. He was affiliated with the &quot;Baptist Bible Union&quot;, based in the United States. His newspaper, ''The Gospel Witness,'' reached 30,000 subscribers in 16 countries, giving him an international reputation. He was one of the founders of the international Council of Christian Churches.&lt;ref&gt;C. Allyn Russell, &quot;Thomas Todhunter Shields: Canadian Fundamentalist,&quot;   ''Foundations, 1981, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 15-31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oswald J. Smith]]  (1889–1986), reared in rural Ontario and educated at [[Moody Church]] in Chicago, set up [[The Peoples Church]] in Toronto in 1928. A dynamic preacher and leader in Canadian fundamentalism, Smith wrote 35 books and engaged in missionary work worldwide. The reverend [[Billy Graham]] called him, &quot;the greatest combination pastor, hymn writer, missionary statesman, an evangelist of our time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Elliott, &quot;Knowing No Borders: Canadian Contributions to American Fundamentalism,&quot; in George A. Rawlyk and Mark A. Noll, eds., ''Amazing Grace: Evangelicalism in Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
