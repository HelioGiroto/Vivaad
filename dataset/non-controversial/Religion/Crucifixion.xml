{{Capital punishment}}

'''Crucifixion''' is an ancient method of deliberately painful [[capital punishment|execution]] in which the condemned person is tied or [[Nail (fastener)|nailed]] to a large wooden [[cross]] and left to hang until dead.

Crucifixion was in use at a comparatively high rate among the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] from about the 6th century BC to the 4th century AD. In the year 337, Emperor [[Constantine I]] abolished it in the Roman Empire out of veneration for [[Jesus Christ]], the most famous victim of crucifixion.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028045 |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online: crucifixion |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mb-soft.com/believe/text/crucifix.htm |title=Crucifixion |publisher=Mb-soft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used as a form of execution in Japan for criminals, inflicted also on [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan|some Christians]].

A [[crucifix]] (an image of Christ crucified on a cross) is the main religious symbol for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], but most [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christians prefer to use a [[Christian cross|cross]] without the figure (the &quot;corpus&quot;: [[Latin]] for &quot;body&quot;) of Christ. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a Latin cross, rather than any other shape, such as a Tau cross or a Greek cross.&lt;ref&gt;For the significance of these terms, see [[Christian cross#Forms of the Cross]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Ancient Greek has two verbs for crucify: ''ana-stauro'' (ἀνασταυρόω), from ''stauros'', &quot;stake&quot;, and ''apo-tumpanizo'' (ἀποτυμπανίζω) &quot;crucify on a plank.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)potumpani%2Fzw&amp;highlight=crucify LSJ apotumpanizo] ἀποτυμπα^ν-ίζω (later ἀποτύμπα^ν-τυπ- UPZ119 (ii B.C.), POxy.1798.1.7), A. crucify on a plank, D.8.61,9.61:—Pass., Lys.13.56, D.19.137, Arist. Rh. 1383a5, Beros. ap. J.Ap.1.20. 2. generally, destroy, Plu.2.1049d.&lt;/ref&gt; together with ''anaskolopizo'' (ἀνασκολοπίζω &quot;impale&quot;). In earlier pre-Roman Greek texts ''anastauro'' usually means &quot;impale.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;LSJ anastauro ἀνασταυρ-όω , = foreg., Hdt.3.125, 6.30, al.; identical with ἀνασκολοπίζω, 9.78:—Pass., Th. 1.110, Pl.Grg.473c. II. in Rom. times, affix to a cross, crucify, Plb. 1.11.5, al., Plu.Fab.6, al. 2. crucify afresh, Ep.Hebr.6.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch Fabius Maximus 6.3 &quot;Hannibal now perceived the mistake in his position, and its peril, and crucified the native guides who were responsible for it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius 1.11.5 [5] Καρχηδόνιοι δὲ τὸν μὲν στρατηγὸν αὐτῶν ἀνεσταύρωσαν, νομίσαντες αὐτὸν ἀβούλως, ἅμα δ᾽ ἀνάνδρως προέσθαι τὴν ἀκρόπολιν: Historiae. Polybius. Theodorus Büttner-Wobst after L. Dindorf. Leipzig. Teubner. 1893-.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''xylon'' &quot;piece of wood&quot; was also used, but for a gallows, not a stake, as in the [[Aristophanes]] comedy ''[[The Frogs]]''; &quot;if you stumble, at least you'll hang from a respectable tree.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, Frogs translated Matthew Dillon line 718 So too the citizens whom we know to be noble and virtuous, ... But if you stumble, at least you'll hang from a respectable tree—&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term ''crux'' may mean a gallows&lt;ref&gt;crux , ŭcis, f. (m., Enn. ap. Non. p. 195, 13; Gracch. ap. Fest. s. v. masculino, p. 150, 24, and 151, 12 Müll.) [perh. kindred with circus].

Tullius Cicero. The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero, literally translated by C. D. Yonge. London. George Bell &amp; Sons. 1903. Against Verres 2.1.7 The punishments of Roman citizens are driving him mad, some of whom he has delivered to the executioner, others he has put to death in prison, others he has crucified while demanding their rights as freemen and as Roman citizens.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term [[crucifix]] derives from the [[Latin]] ''crucifixus'' or ''cruci fixus'', past participle passive of ''crucifigere'' or ''cruci figere'', meaning &quot;to crucify&quot; or &quot;to fix to a cross&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crucify |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
[[File:Caravaggio-Crucifixion of Peter.jpg|left|thumb|220px|''Crucifixion of [[St. Peter]]'' by [[Caravaggio]]]]

Crucifixion was often performed to terrorize and dissuade its witnesses from perpetrating particularly heinous crimes. Victims were left on display after death as warnings to others who might attempt dissent. Crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term ''excruciating'', literally &quot;out of crucifying&quot;), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal. Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and time period.

The Greek and Latin words corresponding to &quot;crucifixion&quot; applied to many different forms of painful execution, from [[impalement|impaling on a stake]] to affixing to a tree, to an upright pole (a ''crux simplex'') or to a combination of an upright (in Latin, ''stipes'') and a crossbeam (in Latin, ''patibulum'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger]] wrote: &quot;I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet&quot; ([http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/sen.consolatione2.shtml Dialogue &quot;To Marcia on Consolation&quot;, 6.20.3]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam on his shoulders to the place of execution. A whole cross would weigh well over 300 pounds (135&amp;nbsp;kg), but the crossbeam would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 75–125 pounds (35–60&amp;nbsp;kg).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the [[Esquiline Gate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann2.shtml#32 |title=Annales 2:32.2 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann15.shtml#60 |title=Annales 15:60.1 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.

The person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails are mentioned in a passage by the Judean historian [[Josephus]], where he states that at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)]], &quot;the soldiers out of rage and hatred, ''nailed'' those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jewish War V.II&lt;/ref&gt; Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as [[amulets]] with perceived medicinal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Mishna, Shabbath 6.10, quoted in [http://www.centuryone.org/crucifixion2.html Crucifixion in Antiquity]&lt;/ref&gt;

While a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible. Although artists have depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals, writings by [[Seneca the Younger]] suggest that victims were crucified completely nude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seneca 1946&quot;&gt;Seneca, Dialogue &quot;To Marcia on Consolation&quot;, in ''Moral Essays'', 6.20.3, trans. John W. Basore, The Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1946) 2:69&lt;/ref&gt; When the victim had to urinate or defecate, they had to do so in the open, in view of passers-by, resulting in discomfort and the attraction of insects. Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape mention by some of their eminent orators. [[Cicero]] for example, described crucifixion as &quot;a most cruel and disgusting punishment&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Licona |first=Michael |title=The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach |year=2010 |publisher=InterVarsity Press,|isbn=978-0-8308-2719-0 |oclc=620836940 |authorlink=Michael Licona |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that &quot;the very mention of the cross should be far removed not only from a Roman citizen’s body, but from his mind, his eyes, his ears.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Conway |first=Colleen M. |title=Behold the Man: Jesus and Greco-Roman Masculinity |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-532532-4 |page=67}} (citing Cicero, ''pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reo'' [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Cic.%20Rab.%20Perd.%2019 5.16]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, the legs of the person executed were broken or shattered with an iron club, an act called ''crurifragium'', which was also frequently applied without crucifixion to slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Koskenniemi | first = Erkki | coauthors = Kirsi Nisula and Jorma Toppari | title = Wine Mixed with Myrrh (Mark 15.23) and Crurifragium (John 19.31-32): Two Details of the Passion Narratives | journal = Journal for the Study of the New Testament | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 379–391 | publisher = SAGE Publications | year = 2005 | url = http://jnt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/379 | doi = 10.1177/0142064X05055745 | accessdate = 2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act hastened the death of the person but was also meant to [[Punishment#Deterrence (prevention)|deter]] those who observed the crucifixion from committing offenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine&quot;/&gt;

The [[gibbet]] on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes. [[Josephus]] describes multiple tortures and positions of crucifixion during the [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as [[Titus]] crucified the rebels;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Wars of the Jews'', 5.11.1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Seneca the Younger]] recounts: &quot;I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some [[Impalement|impale]] their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seneca 1946&quot;/&gt;

At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin ''crux simplex''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=bBOqGJc6tpcC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=crucifixion+%22crux+simplex%22+tree&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ftlTTqqLFIuKhQftr7ifBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=crucifixion%20%22crux%20simplex%22%20tree&amp;f=false William Barclay, ''The Apostles' Creed'' 1998 ISBN 978-0-664-25826-9, p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (''crux commissa'') or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (''crux immissa'').&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The ... oldest depiction of a crucifixion ... was uncovered by archaeologists more than a century ago on the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome. It is a second-century [[graffiti]] scratched into a wall that was part of the imperial palace complex. It includes a caption&amp;nbsp;— not by a Christian, but by someone taunting and deriding Christians and the crucifixions they underwent. It shows crude [[stick figure|stick-figures]] of a boy reverencing his &quot;God,&quot; who has the head of a [[donkey|jackass]] and is upon a cross with arms spread wide and with hands nailed to the crossbeam. Here we have a Roman sketch of a Roman crucifixion, and it is in the traditional cross shape&quot; ([http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9110fea1.asp Clayton F. Bower, Jr: Cross or Torture Stake?]). Some second-century writers took it for granted that a crucified person would have his or her arms stretched out, not connected to a single stake: [[Lucian]] speaks of [[Prometheus]] as crucified &quot;above the ravine with his hands outstretched&quot; and explains that the letter T (the Greek letter [[tau]]) was looked upon as an unlucky letter or sign (similar to the way the number thirteen is looked upon today as an unlucky number), saying that the letter got its &quot;evil significance&quot; because of the &quot;evil instrument&quot; which had that shape, an instrument which tyrants hung men on (ibidem).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witness]]es [[Instrument of Jesus' crucifixion|argue]] that Jesus was crucified on a ''crux simplex'', and that the ''crux immissa'' was an invention of [[Emperor Constantine]].  Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y.

The New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross, but the early writings that do speak of its shape, from about the year 100 on, describe it as shaped like the letter T (the Greek letter tau)&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[s:Epistle of Barnabas#Chapter 9|Chapter 9]]. The document no doubt belongs to the end of the first or beginning of the second century.[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas-intro.html]&lt;/ref&gt; or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small ledge in the upright.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The very form of the cross, too, has five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails&quot; ([[Irenaeus]] (c. 130–202), ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' II, xxiv, 4 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nail placement===
[[File:CrucifixionSt.Matts.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crucifixion window by [[Henry E. Sharp]], 1872, in [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]], Charleston, South Carolina]]
In popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of {{bibleverse||John|20:25}} the wounds are described as being &quot;in his hands&quot;), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands. But in Greek the word &quot;χείρ&quot;, usually translated as &quot;hand&quot;, referred to arm and hand together,&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Iliad]] XX, 478-480, a spear-point is said to have pierced the χεῖρ &quot;where the sinews of the elbow join&quot; (ἵνα τε ξενέχουσι τένοντες / ἀγκῶνος, τῇ τόν γε φίλης διὰ χειρὸς ἔπειρεν / αἰχμῇ χακλκείῃ).&lt;/ref&gt; and to denote the ''hand'' as distinct from the ''arm'' some other word was added, as &quot;ἄκρην οὔτασε χεῖρα&quot; (he wounded the end of the χείρ, i.e., he wounded her hand).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057;query=entry%3D%23113561;layout=;loc=xei%2Fr Liddell and Scott on χείρ]. Cf. [http://www.apu.edu/infocus/2002/03/crucifixion/ The Science of the Crucifixion].&lt;/ref&gt;

A possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, between the two bones of the forearm (the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and the [[ulna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Wynne-Jones |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why the BBC thinks Christ did not die this way |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/16/nrowan216.xml |work= |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment that was the subject of a documentary on the [[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=5:35 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7291066/#storyContinued/ |title=a brief news article |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-03-25 |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a person can be suspended by the palm of the hand. Nailing the feet to the side of the cross relieves strain on the wrists by placing most of the weight on the lower body.

Another possibility, suggested by [[Frederick Zugibe]], is that the nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region at the base of the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the [[carpal tunnel]].

A foot-rest (''suppedaneum'') attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the [[Alexamenos graffito]], the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The beauty of the cross: the passion of Christ in theology and the arts, from the catacombs to the eve of the Renaissance |last=Viladesau |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518811-0 |oclc=58791208 |page=21 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=cTFh4tm9cMwC |accessdate=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient sources also mention the ''sedile'', a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&amp;letter=C |title=Crucifixion |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have served a similar purpose.

In 1968, archaeologists discovered at [[Giv'at ha-Mivtar]] in northeast [[Jerusalem]] the remains of one [[Jehohanan]], who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4.53&amp;nbsp;inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf |title=Some Notes on Crucifixion |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C David W.

===Cause of death===
The length of time required to reach death could range from hours to days depending on method, the victim's health, and the environment. Death could result from any combination of causes, including blood loss resulting in [[hypovolemic shock]], [[sepsis]] following infection due to the wounds caused by the nails or by the [[flagellation|scourging]] that sometimes preceded the crucifixion, or eventual [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edwards WD, Gabel WJ, Hosmer FE |title=On the physical death of Jesus Christ |journal=JAMA |volume=255 |issue=11 |pages=1455–63 |year=1986 |month=March |pmid=3512867 |doi=10.1001/jama.1986.03370110077025 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/255/11/1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patho&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Retief FP, Cilliers L |title=The history and pathology of crucifixion |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=93 |issue=12 |pages=938–41 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14750495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory attributed to [[Pierre Barbet (physician)|Pierre Barbet]] holds that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/barbet.html Columbia University page of Pierre Barbet on Crucifixion]&lt;/ref&gt; He conjectured that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by his arms, leading to [[exhaustion]], or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Experiments by [[Frederick Zugibe]] have, however, revealed that, when suspended with arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical, test subjects had no difficulty breathing. Subjects did suffer rapidly increasing pain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zugibe|first=Frederick T|authorlink=Frederick Zugibe|title=The cross and the shroud: a medical inquiry into the crucifixion|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|year=1988|isbn=0-913729-75-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zugibe, Frederick T. |title=The Crucifixion Of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry |publisher=M.

Legs were often broken to hasten death through severe traumatic shock and [[fat embolism]].

===Survival===
Since death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year [[#As a devotional practice|as a devotional practice]] to be non-lethally crucified.

There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted. [[Josephus]] recounts: &quot;I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to [[Titus]], and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/autobiog.htm The Life Of Flavius Josephus], 75&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.

==Ancient practice==
Despite the fact that the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, as well as other sources, refers to the crucifixion of thousands of people by the Romans, there is only a single archaeological discovery of a crucified body dating back to the Roman Empire around the time of Jesus.  This was discovered in Jerusalem in 1968. It is not necessarily surprising that there is only one such discovery, because a crucified body was usually left to decay on the cross and therefore would not be preserved. The only reason these archaeological remains were preserved was because family members gave this particular individual a customary burial.

The remains were found accidentally in an [[ossuary]] with the crucified man’s name on it, 'Yehohanan, the son of Hagakol'.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Nicu. “Anthropological observations on the skeletal remains from Giv’at ha-Mivtar”, Israel Exploration Journal 20 (1-2), 1970: 38-59; Tzaferis, Vassilios. &quot;Crucifixion&amp;nbsp;– The Archaeological Evidence&quot;, ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 11 (February, 1985): 44–53; Zias, Joseph. &quot;The Crucified Man from Giv’at Ha-Mivtar: A Reappraisal&quot;, ''Israel Exploration Journal'' 35 (1), 1985: 22–27; [[Martin Hengel|Hengel, Martin]].

See also [http://books.google.com/books?id=__IOAAAAQAAJ Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome, by Donald G. Kyle] p. 181, note 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Hnb67CuoHugC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq='Yehohanan+crucified |title=In the Fullness of Time, by Paul L. Maier |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19|isbn=978-0-8254-3329-0|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicu Haas, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree. Since [[Olive#Description|olive trees]] are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified at eye level.

Additionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death as described in {{bibleverse||John|19:31-35|NIV}}. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this fact could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.

Haas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position. However, much of Haas' findings have been challenged. The scratches in the wrist area were determined to be non-traumatic and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Exploration Journal 35:22–27; The Crucified Man from Giv’at ha-Mivtar: A Reappraisal'&lt;/ref&gt; A later reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but nailed separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Crucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by [[Achaemenid Persia|Persians]], [[Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Death was often hastened. &quot;The attending Roman guards could only leave the site after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim.&quot;&lt;ref name=patho/&gt;

The Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/Stavros.html Stavros, Scolops (σταῦρός, σκόλοψ). The cross;] encyclopedia Hellinica&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his ''Histories'', ix.120–122, the Greek writer [[Herodotus]] describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BC: &quot;They nailed him to a plank and hung him up ... this [[Artayctes]] who suffered death by crucifixion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Aubrey de Selincourt. The original, &quot;σανίδα προσπασσαλεύσαντες, ἀνεκρέμασαν ... Τούτου δὲ τοῦ Ἀρταύκτεω τοῦ ἀνακρεμασθέντος  ...&quot;, is translated by Henry Cary (Bohn's Classical Library: ''Herodotus Literally Translated''. London, G. Bell and Sons 1917, pp. 591-592) as: &quot;They nailed him to a plank and hoisted him aloft ... this Artayctes who was hoisted aloft&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Commentary on Herodotus'' by How and Wells remarks: &quot;They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf. vii.33. This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W.W. How and J. Wells, ''A Commentary on Herodotus'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1912), vol. 2, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian [[theologian]]s, beginning with [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] writing in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Gal|3:13}}, have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in [[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|21:22-23}}. This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with [[lynching]] or traditional hanging. However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;See Mishnah, Sanhedrin 7:1, translated in Jacob Neusner, The Mishnah: A New Translation 591 (1988), supra note 8, at 595-96 (indicating that court ordered execution by stoning, burning, decapitation, or strangulation only)&lt;/ref&gt; The Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: &quot;God [will set] right errors. [He will judge] revealed sins. Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept. Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by [crucif]ixion. Let not the nail touch him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/scrolls_deadsea/uncovered/uncovered05.htm Levi,''Aramaic Testament of Levi'' 4Q541 column 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]] is reputed to have crucified 2000 survivors from his siege of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t09.html Quintus Curtius Rufus, ''History of Alexander the Great of Macedonia'' 4.4.21]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the doctor who unsuccessfully treated Alexander's friend [[Hephaestion]]. Some historians have also conjectured that Alexander crucified [[Callisthenes]], his official historian and biographer, for objecting to Alexander's adoption of the Persian ceremony of royal [[adoration]].

In [[Carthage]], crucifixion was an established mode of execution, which could even be imposed on generals for suffering a major defeat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=h-VlDC4Jt6gC&amp;pg=PT92&amp;lpg=PT92&amp;dq=%22recalled+to+Carthage+and+crucified%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HSR5G9wsmo&amp;sig=RbKO8dM1K9bJjE_PLavwuzSkuC8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GGtAUMrwFc-4hAfYooCAAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22recalled%20to%20Carthage%20and%20crucified%22&amp;f=false Richard A.

===Ancient Rome===
The hypothesis that the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of ''arbori suspendere''—hanging on an ''arbor infelix'' (unfortunate tree) dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the ''supplicium more maiorum'', punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/TAPA/39/Supplicium_de_More_Maiorum*.html |title=Livy I.26 and the Supplicium de More Maiorum |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&amp;yr=200&amp;aa=AA&amp;at=AA&amp;ref=tertullian&amp;URL=http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticus.htm |title=''Apologia'', IX, 1 |publisher=Grtbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Seneca the Younger]] earlier used the phrase ''infelix lignum'' (unfortunate wood) for the transom (&quot;patibulum&quot;) or the whole cross.&lt;ref&gt;After quoting a poem by [[Maecenas]] that speaks of preferring life to death even when life is burdened with all the disadvantages of old age or even with acute torture (&quot;vel acuta si sedeam cruce&quot;), Seneca disagrees with the sentiment, saying death would be better for a crucified person hanging from the patibulum: &quot;I should deem him most despicable had he wished to live to the point of crucifixion ... Is it worth so much to weigh down upon one's own wound, and hang stretched out from a patibulum? ... Is anyone found who, after being fastened to that accursed wood, already weakened, already deformed, swelling with ugly weals on shoulders and chest, with many reasons for dying even before getting to the cross, would wish to prolong a life-breath that is about to experience so many torments?&quot; (&quot;Contemptissimum putarem, si vivere vellet usque ad crucem ... Est tanti vulnus suum premere et patibulo pendere districtum ... Invenitur, qui velit adactus ad illud infelix lignum, iam debilis, iam pravus et in foedum scapularum ac pectoris tuber elisus, cui multae moriendi causae etiam citra crucem fuerant, trahere animam tot tormenta tracturam?&quot; - [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep17-18.shtml Letter 101, 12-14])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plautus]] and [[Plutarch]] are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright [[stipes]].&lt;ref&gt;Titus Maccius Plautus ''Miles gloriosus''  Mason Hammond, Arthur M. Mack - 1997 Page 109 , &quot;The patibulum (in the next line) was a crossbar which the convicted criminal carried on his shoulders, with his arms fastened to it, to the place for ...

Crucifixion was used for [[slavery|slaves]], [[piracy|pirates]], and enemies of the state. It was considered a most shameful and disgraceful way to die. Condemned Roman citizens were usually exempt from crucifixion (like feudal nobles from hanging, dying more honorably by decapitation) except for major crimes against the state, such as high [[treason]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Notorious mass crucifixions followed the [[Third Servile War]] in 73–71 BC (the slave rebellion under [[Spartacus]]), other [[Roman civil wars]] in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the [[Destruction of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD. To frighten other slaves from revolting, [[Crassus]] crucified 6,000 of Spartacus' men along the [[Appian Way]] from Capua to Rome.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Josephus tells a story of the Romans crucifying people along the walls of Jerusalem. He also says that the Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions. In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die. The dead body was left up for [[vulture]]s and other birds to consume.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Under ancient Roman penal practice, crucifixion was also a means of exhibiting the criminal’s low social status. It was the most dishonourable death imaginable, originally reserved for slaves, hence still called &quot;supplicium servile&quot; by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], later extended to provincial freedmen of obscure station ('humiles').{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The citizen class of Roman society were almost never subject to capital punishments; instead, they were fined or exiled. Josephus mentions Jews of high rank who were crucified, but this was to point out that their status had been taken away from them. The Romans often broke the prisoner's legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A cruel prelude was occasionally [[flagellation|scourging]], which would cause the condemned to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (''patibulum'' in [[Latin]]) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding [[centurion]] and four soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} When it was done in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (''stipes'') could even be permanently embedded in the ground.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The condemned was usually stripped naked—all the [[New Testament]] [[gospel]]s describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:35}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|15:24}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:34}}, {{bibleverse||John|19:23-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'nails' were tapered iron spikes approximately {{convert|5|to|7|in|cm}} long, with a square shaft {{convert|3/8|in|mm|0}} across. In some cases, the nails were gathered afterward and used as healing amulets.

[[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]], the first Christian [[Roman Empire|emperor]], abolished crucifixion in the Roman Empire in 337 out of veneration for Jesus Christ, its most famous victim.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GGJmFIf6mtIC Dictionary of Images and Symbols in Counselling By William Stewart] 1998 ISBN 1-85302-351-5, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bible-archaeology.info/crucifixion.htm |title=Archaeology of the Bible |publisher=Bible-archaeology.info |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Qur'an===
The [[Qur'an]] mentions crucifixion several times. In [[Sura]]h 7:124, [[Islamic view of the Pharaoh of the Exodus|Firaun]] (Arabic for Pharaoh) says that he will ''crucify'' his chief wizards.&lt;ref name=surat7&gt;[http://quran.com/7 Surat Al-'A`rāf (The Heights)]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Surah 12:41 mentions Prophet [[Islamic view of Joseph|Yusuf]] (Joseph) prophesying that the king (the current ruler of the land he was stranded in) would crucify one of his prisoners.&lt;ref name=surat12&gt;[http://quran.com/12 Surat Yūsuf (Joseph)]&lt;/ref&gt;

:'And the wizards fell down prostrate, crying: &quot;We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, The Lord of [[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]] and [[Islamic view of Aaron|Harun]]&quot;. Firaun said: &quot;Ye believe in Him before I give you leave! Lo! this is the plot that ye have plotted in the city that ye may drive its people hence. But ye shall come to know! Surely I shall have your hands and feet cut off upon alternate sides. Then I shall crucify you every one.&quot;' Surah 7:120-124&lt;ref name=surat7/&gt;

:'O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire.' Surah 12:41&lt;ref name=surat12/&gt;

In Surah 5:33, The Qur'an mentions crucifixion as a form of punishment. There are four different punishments for the different severities of crime. Crucifixion is the punishment for the robber who kills his victim after robbing him.

:'The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.' Surah 5:33&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/5 Surat Al-Mā'idah (The Table Spread)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Japanese Crucifixion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Early Meiji-era crucifixion of Sokichi, [[Yokohama]], Japan]]

Crucifixion was introduced into [[Japan]] during the [[Sengoku period]] (1467–1573), after a 350-year period with no capital punishment.&lt;ref name=JapaneseMind&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Japanese mind: essentials of Japanese philosophy and culture|last=Moore |first=Charles Alexander |coauthors= Aldyth V.

The condemned, usually a commoner convicted by the local feudal authorities, was hoisted upon a T-shaped cross. The [[executioner]] finished him off with spear thrusts from below the ribcage, then the body was left to hang for a time as a public display before disposal.

In 1597, twenty-six [[Christian]]s were nailed to crosses at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan. Among those executed were [[Paulo Miki]], [[Philip of Jesus]] and [[Pedro Bautista]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Franciscan]] who had worked about ten years in the [[Philippines]]. The executions marked the beginning of a long history of [[Japanese Martyrs|persecution of Christianity in Japan]], which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.

In the [[Bakumatsu]] or early [[Meiji period]] (c. 1865-8), the 25 year-old servant Sokichi was executed by crucifixion for the murder of the son of his employer, a store-owner, during the course of a robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wD4U34XRlU4C&amp;q=crucifixion+of+sokichi&amp;dq=crucifixion+of+sokichi&amp;cd=2|first=William A.|last=Ewing|title=The body: photographs of the human form|year=1994|publisher=Chronicle Books|page=250|isbn=0-8118-0762-2|accessdate=2010-03-18|others=photograph by [[Felice Beato]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was affixed to a stake with two cross-pieces by tying, rather than nailing.

Crucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during [[World War II]]. [[Ringer Edwards]], an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others. He survived 63 hours before being let down.

===Europe===
During [[World War I]], there were persistent rumors that German soldiers [[the Crucified Soldier|had crucified a Canadian soldier]] on a tree or barn door with [[bayonet]]s or combat knives. The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the [[1st Canadian Division]]. Two investigations, one a post-war official investigation, and the other an independent investigation by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], concluded that there was no evidence to support the story.&lt;ref name=PotJ&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prisoners of the Japanese: literary imagination and the prisoner-of-war experience |last=Bourke |first=Roger  |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=University of Queensland Press  |isbn=978-0-7022-3564-1 |oclc=70257905 |page=184 n.8 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JpKAYepQJN4C |accessdate=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, British documentary maker [[Iain Overton]] in 2001 published an article claiming that the story was true, identifying the soldier as [[Harry Band]].&lt;ref name=PotJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Iain |last=Overton |title=Revealed, the soldier who was crucified by Germans |publisher=International Express |date=2001-04-17 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overton's article was the basis for a 2002 episode of the [[Channel 4]] documentary show ''[[Secret History (television documentary series)|Secret History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Crucified Soldier| episodelink = The Crucified Soldier| series = Secret History| serieslink = Secret History (TV documentary series)| network = [[Channel 4]]| airdate = 2002-07-04| season = 9| number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that crucifixion was used in several cases against the [[Germany|German]] civil population of [[East Prussia]] when it was occupied by [[USSR|Soviet]] forces at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings, ''Armageddon: the Battle for Germany 1944-45'', ISBN 0-330-49062-1, ISBN 978-0-330-49062-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, crucifixion is still one of the [[Hadd]] punishments in the Islamic Republic of [[Iran]] (Iran's Islamic Criminal Law, Article 195),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-law.com/IMG/pdf/Iran_Criminal_Code_in_English.pdf Crucifixion in the Islamic Republic of Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://revcurentjur.ro/arhiva/attachments_201003/recjurid103_13F.pdf The Sanctions of the Islamic Criminal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not actually applied{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and there is no example of its use. If a crucified person were to survive three days of crucifixion, that person would be allowed to live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7863/3/Case_Study_in_Iranian_Criminal_system.pdf Case Study in Iranian Criminal System]&lt;/ref&gt; Execution by hanging is described as follows: &quot;In execution by hanging, the prisoner will be hung on a hanging truss which should look like a cross, while his (her) back is toward the cross, and (s)he faces the direction of Mecca [in Saudi Arabia], and his (her) legs are vertical and distant from the ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mehr.org/jazaa.pdf ''Judicial Law on Retaliation, Stoning, Execution, Crucifixion, Hanging and Whipping'', section 5, article 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sudan]]'s [[penal code]], based upon the government's interpretation of [[Shari'a]], includes execution followed by crucifixion as a penalty. When, in 2002, 88 people were sentenced to execution, Amnesty International speculated that they could be executed by either hanging or crucifixion. The accused were convicted of crimes relating to murder, armed robbery, and participating in ethnic clashes in Southern [[Darfur]] that killed at least 10 people, but [[Amnesty International]] believes that the convicted were tortured and did not receive fair trials and adequate legal representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAFR540132002 |title=Sudan: Imminent Execution/Torture/Unfair trial &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |date=2002-07-17 |accessdate=2009-12-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080605044330/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAFR540132002 |archivedate = June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 50th Session of the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] (1994), local bishops reported several cases of crucifixion of Christian priests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The human rights group Karen Women Organization documented a case of [[Tatmadaw]] forces crucifying several [[Karen people|Karen]] villagers in 2000 in the [[Dooplaya District]] in [[Burma]]'s [[Kayin State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karenwomen.org/Reports/WalkingAmongstSharpKnives.pdf |title=Walking amongst sharp knives |author= |date=February 2010 |work= |publisher=Karen Women Organization |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/35194/regime-human-rights |title=Regime's human rights abuses go unpunished |author= |date=28 March 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Bangkok Post]] |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucifixion of a nun in [[Romania]] made news in 2005. 23 year-old Maricica Irina Cornici was believed to be possessed by the devil. Father Daniel, the superior of the [[Romanian Orthodox]] monastery who ordered the crucifixion, did not understand why journalists were making a fuss over the story, claiming that &quot;Exorcism is a common practice in the heart of the Romanian Orthodox church and my methods are not at all unknown to other priests.&quot; Father Daniel and four nuns were charged with imprisonment leading to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107524.stm |title=Crucified nun dies in 'exorcism' |date=2005-06-18 |accessdate=November 6, 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 2009 in [[Saudi Arabia]], a 22-year-old man was sentenced to beheading and posthumous crucifixion, by having his beheaded body tied to wooden beams to be displayed to the public after the beheading. The man was convicted of and admitted to abducting and raping five children, aged between 3 and 7 years, whom he left out in the desert to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-43639120091103 |title=Saudi court upholds child rapist crucifixion ruling |publisher=In.reuters.com |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2011, the Gyeongbuk Provincial Police Agency investigated a dead taxi driver in his late 50s who was crucified in an abandoned mine near [[Mungyeong]], [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 택시운전사, 십자가에 못박혀 숨진 채 발견…경북 문경서 | date = 2011-05-03 | url = http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201105032052171&amp;code=940202 | work = The Kyunghyang Shinmun | accessdate = 2011-11-19 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a devotional practice==
[[File:Crucifixion in San Fernando, Pampanga, Philippines, easter 2006, p-ad20060414-12h54m52s-r.jpg|left|275px|thumb|Devotional crucifixion in San Fernando, Pampanga, Philippines, Easter 2006]]

Since at least the mid-19th century, a group of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[flagellants]] in [[New Mexico]] called Hermanos de Luz (&quot;Brothers of Light&quot;) have annually conducted reenactments of Jesus Christ's crucifixion during [[Holy Week]], in which a penitent is tied—but not nailed—to a cross.

Some Catholics are voluntarily, non-lethally crucified for a limited time on [[Good Friday]], to imitate the suffering of Jesus Christ, although the [[Catholic Church|Church]] greatly discourages this practice. A notable example is the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of [[Iztapalapa]], on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]], since 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257 |title=Religion-Mexico: The Passion According to Iztapalapa |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date= |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotional crucifixions are also common in the [[Philippines]]. Worshipers drive thin nails through the palm of the hand, a step is used to stand on, and the period is short, not a full crucifixion. One man named Rolando del Campo who was a carpenter in Pampanga vowed to be crucified every [[Good Friday]] for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://religiousfreaks.com/2006/04/12/man-crucifies-himself-every-good-friday/ |title=Man Crucifies Himself Every Good Friday |publisher=Religious Freaks |date=2006-04-12 |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[San Pedro Cutud]], devotee [[Ruben Enaje]] has been crucified 21 times, as of 2007, during [[Passion Week]] celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/international/international-philippines-crucifixions.html |title=International Philippines crucifixions | work=The New York Times}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/story.jsp?floc=FF-APO-1104&amp;idq=/ff/story/0001%2F20060414%2F0726996803.htm&amp;sc=1104 | work=CNN | title=Home | Propeller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the country's dominant Catholic Church disapproves of the ritual, the Filipino government says it cannot stop the devotees from crucifying and whipping themselves. The health department insists that those taking part in the rituals should have [[tetanus]] shots and that the nails used to pierce their limbs should be sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-540453/Boy-15-nailed-cross-Filipinos-whip-crucify-gory-Good-Friday-ritual.html |title=Boy, 15, nailed to a cross as Filipinos whip and crucify themselves in gory Good Friday ritual |accessdate = November 6, 2010 | location=London |work=Daily Mail |date=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the person portraying Jesus is first subjected to [[flagellation]] and wears a [[crown of thorns]]. Sometimes there is a whole [[passion play]], sometimes only the mortification of the flesh.

==Famous crucifixions==
*The [[crucifixion of Jesus]]: [[Jesus of Nazareth]]'s death by crucifixion by [[Pontius Pilate]] (most likely in AD 30 or 33), recounted in the four first-century canonical Gospels, is referred to repeatedly as something well known in the earlier letters of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], for instance, five times in his First Letter to the Corinthians, written in AD 57 (1:13, 1:18, 1:23, 2:2, 2:8). Pilate was the Roman governor of [[Iudaea province]] at the time, and he is explicitly linked with the condemnation of Jesus not only by the Gospels but also by [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annals', 15.44.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus]] for details). The civil charge was a claim to be [[INRI|King of the Jews]].
*The rebel slaves of the [[Third Servile War]]: Between 73 BC and 71 BC a band of slaves, eventually numbering about 120,000, under the (at least partial) leadership of [[Spartacus]] were in open revolt against the [[Roman republic]]. The rebellion was eventually crushed, and while Spartacus himself most likely died in the final battle of the revolt, approximately 6,000 of his followers were crucified along the 200&amp;nbsp;km road between Capua and Rome, as a warning to any other would-be rebels.
*[[Saint Peter]], Christian apostle: according to tradition, Peter was crucified upside-down at his own request (hence the [[Cross of St. Peter]]), as he did not feel worthy to die the same way as Jesus.
*[[Saint Andrew]], Christian apostle and [[Saint Peter]]'s brother: crucified, according to tradition, on an X-shaped cross, hence the name [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]]
*[[Simeon of Jerusalem]], 2nd [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]], crucified either 106 or 107
*[[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] was an English boy whose disappearance in 1255 prompted a [[blood libel]] against the local Jews. A Jewish man was tortured until he confessed to killing the child. The story of Little Saint Hugh became well known through medieval ballad poetry.
*[[Archbishop Joachim of Nizhny Novgorod|Archbishop Joachim]] of [[Nizhny Novgorod]]: reportedly crucified upside down, on the Royal Doors of the Cathedral in [[Sevastopol]], [[Russia]] in 1920
*[[Wilgefortis]] was venerated as a saint and represented as a crucified woman, however her legend comes from a misinterpretation of the full-clothed [[Volto Santo of Lucca|crucifix of Lucca]].
