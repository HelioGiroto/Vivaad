== Binitarianism ==
This position was echoed by the late Herbert W. Armstrong, a 20th century radio preacher who founded The Worldwide Church of God, whose position brought others to describe him as an admixture of Mormonism (&quot;social trinitarianism&quot; might be called &quot;social conception of Deity&quot;) and the Jehovah's Witnesses (&quot;simple Godhead&quot; or &quot;simple unitarianism&quot;).

The fact that nontrinitarian translations of the English Bible appeared so early Christendom is another key point that illustrates the widespread social acceptance within Christendom of the (seemingly) minority conception of 'Theology proper' (the nature of Deity) among churchgoers professing to believe.

Scoping out the broad historical matrix in which this discussion was carried out publicly AND theologically among scholars within and outside Christendom is something Wikipedians could hope to do, and their doing so with succinct rigor could offer a great intellectual service to inquiring readers. ''--20:19, 15 September 2012‎ MaynardClark''

:We have an article on [[Binitarianism]], but it's never gained much support within traditional mainstream &quot;orthodox&quot; Christianity.  Otherwise, I'm not sure how you would propose to improve the article. [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 20:24, 15 September 2012 (UTC)

== Logical Coherency ==
Someone explain why the sourced references to two Church doctors on logical coherency, Augustine and Hilary of Poitiers, (and the Athanasian Creed) were removed as &quot;unsourced opinions&quot;. And why we have an unsourced reference to Bernard Lonergan which does not even explain his position (I have never heard of him). Reading the wikipedia article on Lonergan, he stated the trinity &quot;is a theological mystery in the strict sense and can only be understood analogically.&quot; What does that have to do with logical coherency? Lonergan will not be understood until the opinions of at least Augustine and Aquinas are stated, but why does this reference a 20th century Jesuit priest rather than a doctor of the Church?  Or shall I add just Augustine and Aquinas and leave out Hilary? Or pull in an Orthodox doctor? The section on logical coherency is lending undue weight to one opinion since 2010 and needs to be fixed. As I had explained the Trinity is regarded by most Christians as a mystery (especially the Orthodox), and questions on logical coherency seems to be only addressed from within the Catholic tradition.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Doug Webber|Doug Webber]] ([[User talk:Doug Webber|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Doug Webber|contribs]]) 16:59, 28 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Did I miss whatever source you cited for your claim that &quot;the questionable logical coherency of the doctrine of a Trinity defined as three persons is apparent in the Athanasian Creed itself&quot;?  I still can't find it.  And &quot;unfathomable&quot; does not mean &quot;incoherent&quot;, an idea that moreover lacks a reliable-source citation.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 19:58, 28 September 2012 (UTC)
:: I had rewritten it, that was removed - but for the reason that the Athanasian Creed isn't accepted among the Orthodox. Hilary's statement that God is unfathomable has nothing to do with logical coherency, its to the infinity of God which will never be understood - thus most state its a mystery and leave it at that. Its still incomplete - if Lonergan (or someone else) said something significant I would really like to know what it was.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Doug Webber|Doug Webber]] ([[User talk:Doug Webber|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Doug Webber|contribs]]) 03:34, 30 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I'm not sure whether someone in the discussion above may be referring to the occurrence of the word &quot;incomprehensible&quot; in the Athanasian Creed, but that's actually a 16th-century '''mis'''translation of the Latin word ''immensus'', which means something like &quot;unlimited&quot; or &quot;infinite&quot; much more than it does &quot;incomprehensible&quot;...

==Mormonism and the Trinity==

The introduction to this article asserts that Mormonism is polytheistic or henotheistic. This viewpoint is hotly debated, with many divergent views, and should not be stated as if factual in the introduction. Describing the Mormon view of the Trinity as &quot;three gods in three persons&quot; is also a huge oversimplification, to the point of being misleading. The Mormon view is much closer to &quot;social Trinitarianism&quot; than polytheism or henotheism. See, for example, http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700065755/Daniel-C-Peterson-Mormons-and-the-Holy-Trinity.html?pg=all . [[Special:Contributions/67.166.126.67|67.166.126.67]] ([[User talk:67.166.126.67|talk]]) 08:27, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

:During at least part of the 19th-century, the Mormon understanding of the Trinity seems to have been influenced by the [[Adam–God doctrine]], or at least that's what many &quot;mainstream&quot; Christians think... [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 13:24, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

: I'm not sure how you could describe Mormonism as anything but polytheistic, since God is a being who once was a man, and every man has the potential to become as God is. If anyone has become as God is, then there is more than one god, hence polytheism.

:Beyond that, Mormonism affirms that there is a fundamental ontological difference between the Holy Spirit and The Father and the Son. The Father and Son are bodily, have flesh and bones. The Spirit is entirely non-corporeal. They cannot be considered to be Trinitarian if one Person of the godhead is not homoousia with the other two.

:&quot;The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.&quot; - {{cite book|title=Doctrine and Covenants|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22?lang=eng#21|accessdate=15 October 2012|chapter=130:22}}[[User:ReformedArsenal|ReformedArsenal]] ([[User talk:ReformedArsenal|talk]]) 13:29, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

:*Comment: I've read a lot of the scholarly sources and from what I've read, Mormonism is best described as falling under [[Social trinity|social trinitarianism]] or [[non-Trinitarianism]]. The stuff about polytheism usually comes from non-scholarly polemics, and the stuff about henotheism seems to be original research (or at best [[WP:Synth|synthesis]]) as I've not seen it described that way in a scholarly source. &lt;p&gt;By the way, the citation to Bushman's book at the end of the Lead is wrong. Page 40 is talking about Joseph Smith's &quot;[[First Vision]]&quot;. The passage cited says nothing about theisms, three deities, or Godheads, and ironically doesn't even mention that there were two &quot;personages&quot; in the vision until the next page. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; text-shadow: 0 0 .2em #7af&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 13:52, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

::: If you have three distinct persons who are not of the same essence but are truly God... that is polytheism. Whatever it is, it certainly isn't Trinitarianism.[[User:ReformedArsenal|ReformedArsenal]] ([[User talk:ReformedArsenal|talk]]) 13:55, 15 October 2012 (UTC)
::::I'm certainly not arguing that it's Trinitarian. I don't even think Mormonism belongs in the Lead of this article. You should probably have a look at the [[Social trinity]] aricle, and perhaps the source the IP provided. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; text-shadow: 0 0 .2em #7af&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 14:03, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

:::::Definitely agree that it should not be in the lead section of the article.  If it's thought to be necessary to run through various alternatives to traditional/mainstream Trinitarian doctrine, then there are names of ancient heresies which cover almost all permutations.  If the Mormon view is complex (or more complex than many people think), then it's not really a useful contrast for the top section of the article (where nothing can be explained at length)... [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 14:06, 15 October 2012 (UTC)

::::::Mormons are best described as '''[[non-Trinitarianism]]'''. [[Polytheism]] is the belief that there are multiple gods in a pantheon of gods that can be worshiped. Mormons believe and worship one God. Mormons subscribe to the statement of Paul in the New Testament that states, ''&quot;As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.&quot;'' (1 Corinthians 8:4-6) 

::::::While Mormon teachings allow for the existence of others who could be considered gods, or the ability to progress to become like God, Mormon teachings clearly state that we have only one God and that he will always be &quot;our God forever and ever&quot; (Psalms 48:14) (See [http://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-2], [http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/God_the_Father], [http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Jesus_Christ], and [http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Godhead] for accurate information on Mormon belief in God).

::::::[[Social trinity|Social trinitarianism]] describes the Trinity as ''&quot;three individualities in one indivisible being.&quot;'' Mormonism believes in three separate beings. [[User:Dromidaon|Dromidaon]] ([[User talk:Dromidaon|talk]]) 20:15, 15 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
