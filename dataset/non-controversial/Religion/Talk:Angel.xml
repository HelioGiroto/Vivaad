== Gender / sexuality of angels ==

What is known about the gender of angels in christian tradition? I think they are all considered male, because all their names are male, but art tend to show them genderless / asexual... So what's the official belief? --[[User:Euyyn|euyyn]] 13:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
:As far as Judaism is concerned, they are essencially little more than asexual robot messengers who are the physical manifestation of the will of G-d. [[User:SpaceFalcon2001|SF2K1]]
:: A simple anectode is that the word malaka in Sanskrit renders the meaning female messanger or confidante [[http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche]]. --[[User:Xact|Xact]] ([[User talk:Xact|talk]]) 06:51, 14 November 2009 (UTC)

::In the [[Unification Church]], all angels are male. God will make female angels at a later date (unspecified for now). Jude 1:6-7 hints that angels can engage in sexually immoral acts with human beings. This is a key to [[Unification Theology]] about the [[fall of man]]. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 15:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

:::The Roman Catholic view (as far as I know) is that angles are Asexual. I think the names became Male after there use for angels, not befor.

The part of this section that reads: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The base of the English word angel is the Koine Greek term άγγελος, a masculine noun, and the Latin derivation angelus is also masculine. The word &quot;angel&quot; in English (from Old English engel), French (from Old French angele), German, Spanish, and many other European languages are derived from the Latin, and are viewed as masculine nouns in those languages which assign gender to nouns.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
is fallacious. Gender is used to mean grammatical gender, not natural gender, in the above text. [[Grammatical gender]] is often synonymous with [[noun class]] - it is a way of partitioning nouns into groups that behave (or behaved) in grammatically different ways, thus the assignments of grammatical gender are not necessarily made with regards to natural gender. The material quoted attempts to support an argument that angels are often view as male by confusing the meaning of gender. The argument could be salvaged by providing evidence that in the languages concerned the grammatical gender aligns very closely with a nouns natural gender, providing evidence that speakers of such languages perceived or thought about angels as masculine, thus their languages would classify the noun as belonging to the related grammatical gender. I have made a quick fix to this section by making clear the fact that the gender being referred to is grammatical not natural.

Although the religions mentioned above do not view angels as having gender in the human sense, however, angels are given a masculine aspect.  For example, in the Jewish [[Tanakh]] the [[Hebrew]] form of the words used to denote angels are always masculine, and their described roles are masculine.  Angelic roles in the Tanakh are those of a [[warrior]], [[herald]], [[guard]] (at the gates of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]), [[wrestler]] (of [[Jacob]]; &quot;a man,&quot; according to Genesis 32:24, or &quot;the angel,&quot; according to Hosea 12:4).  In Christianity and Islam, the masculine tone of angels is also adopted, as in the story of the mover of large stones (at the tomb of [[Christ]]).  The suggestion in each religion is that in traditional societies these would all have been tasks typically performed by men. The few canonical names of angels (e.g., [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]] and [[Gabriel]]) are recognized in Judaism as masculine names, and have been widely adopted by other cultures.  The base of the English word ''angel'' is the [[Koine Greek]] term ''άγγελος'', a [[grammatical gender#Grammatical vs. natural gender|grammatically masculine]] noun, and the [[Latin]] derivation ''angelus'' is also grammatically masculine. The word &quot;angel&quot; in [[English language|English]] (from Old English ''engel''), [[French language|French]] (from Old French ''angele''), [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and many other [[European languages]] are derived from the Latin, and are viewed as grammatically masculine nouns in those languages which assign grammatical gender to nouns.  However, the study of linguistics recognizes no correspondence between linguistic &quot;gender&quot; and any gender-related properties of actual words.

In Islam angels are genderless, I think this fact should be mentioned  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/59.103.222.237|59.103.222.237]] ([[User talk:59.103.222.237|talk]]) 15:05, 9 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Peer review of Judaism section ==

I'm not sure what &quot;Biblical books&quot; say that angels have free will.  Can anyone source that or disprove it?  I don't think it's correct.

The quotation from Maimonides' &quot;Guide to the Perplexed&quot; is unusually long for a Wikipedia article, especially considering that the opinions of other Jewish authorities are not quoted verbatim at all.  It will take some work, but shortening and summarizing the quotation from Maimonides will make it more readable and more consistent with NPOV if other opinions can be quoted alongside Maimonides.

::Yeah, I was suprised to see that. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Satan a &quot;fallen&quot; angel?

I don't mean that it's faulty or anything, just that it can be easy to take it out of context.

Don't get me wrong. I don't have any problem with Persian (Iran, Iraq) nor people speak Urdu (Pakistan, North India). However, IMO, when talked about Islam, it should use Arabic for Islamic terms.  None of the persian nor urdu words familiar to muslims except to those who speak the language.

== 'Christian beliefs' section removed here from article -- almost exclusively [[WP:SYNTH]] of the bible ==

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Raphael and Tobias.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] and Tobias, after [[Adam Elsheimer]], c1610. The Archangel appears in nearly normal clothes; there is even the suggestion of trousers]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;  

===New Testament references===
In the [[New Testament]] angels appear frequently as the ministers of God and the agents of revelation (''e.g.'' {{bibleref|Matthew|1:20}} (to Joseph), 4:11. (to Jesus), [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26 (to Mary), [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 12:7 (to Peter)); and Jesus speaks of angels as fulfilling such functions (''e.g.'' [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 8:38, 13:27), implying in one saying that they neither marry nor are given in marriage (Mark 12:25). Angels are most prominent at the birth of Jesus and at Jesus' [[resurrection]]. The New Testament takes little interest in the idea of the angelic hierarchy, but there are traces of the doctrine. The distinction of good and bad angels is recognized. Good angels mentioned by name are [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (Luke 1:19; Daniel 12:1). Scripture also mentions a tempter [[Satan]], the scribes name the ruler of demons as [[Beelzebub]], and the angel of the abyss [[Apollyon]] (Mark 1:13, 3:22; Rev. 9:11). [[Apollyon]], (Hebrew [[Abaddon]]) a name for an angel mentioned in Revelation 9:11, is believed by some to be a good angel that guards the gates to the traditionally known hell.  Revelation 10:1 describes another angel, although unnamed, some say it is [[Metatron]].
The Christian Greek scriptures also imply an angelic hierarchy; archangels (namely Michael, mentioned in both Daniel 10:13 and Jude 9, Gabriel, and Raphael), principalities and powers (Rom. 8:38; Col. 2:10), thrones and dominions (Col 1:16). The hierarchies of principalities, powers, thrones, and dominions are questionable by some Christian denominations due to the ambiguity of the context. Romans 8:38 May refer to other things besides angels if the context includes opposition beyond spirits themselves. The scope of Col. 1:16 covering &quot;all things created&quot; also extends far beyond angels by themselves. Other hierarchies accepted from the Old Testament include [[seraphim]] and cherubim.

===Theological development===
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:The Wilton Diptych (Right).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Angels of about 1400, in the Wilton diptych]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Since [[Saint Gregory]] and the [[Pseudo-Dionysian]] ''[[Celestial Hierarchy]]'' (5th century), Catholic theology has assumed nine orders of angelic beings; Angels, Virtues, Powers (called Lords), Principalities, Dominions (also called Kings), Thrones ([[Ophanim]]), [[Cherubim]], [[Seraphim]] and [[Archangels]], endorsed by medieval [[scholasticism]] (''[[Summa Theologica]]''). This is not official Church doctrine or dogma, however, and in general the faithful are not required to adhere to this categorization.

Angels occur in groups of four or seven (Rev 7:1). The Angels of the Seven Churches of Asia Minor are described in Rev. 1-3; the angels are the representative angels of the seven congregations. Daniel 10:12,13 also appears to depict angels in opposition (presumably fallen angels) to other angels, taking on the roles of prince-angels (of the order of Principalities) for nations, in this case the &quot;prince of the kingdom of Persia.&quot; It is well-known that there are angels for nations, organizations, parishes, families, and individuals (angels presiding over individuals are called guardian angels.)

The angel Gabriel appeared to [[The Virgin Mary|Mary]] in the traditional role of messenger to inform her that her child would be the [[Messiah]], and other angels were present to herald his birth. In Matt. 28:2, an angel appeared at [[Jesus]]' tomb, frightened the Roman guards, rolled away the stone from the tomb, and later told the [[myrrh-bearing women]] of Jesus' [[resurrection]]. Alternately, in Mark 16:5, the angel is not seen until the women enter the already-opened tomb, and he is described simply as &quot;a young man.&quot; In Luke's version of the resurrection tale (Luke 24:4), two angels suddenly appear next to the women within the tomb; they are described as being clothed in &quot;shining apparel.&quot; This is most similar to the version in John 20:12, where Mary alone speaks to &quot;two angels in white&quot; within the tomb of Jesus.

Two angels witnessed Jesus' ascent into [[Heaven]] and prophesied his return. When [[Saint Peter|Peter]] was imprisoned, an angel put his guards to sleep, released him from his chains, and led him out of the prison. Angels fill a number of different roles in the Book of Revelation. Among other things, they are seen gathered around the Throne of God saying the thrice-holy [[hymn]].

===Depiction in art===
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Angel ivory Louvre OA5839213922.jpg|thumb|left|260px|A [[Gothic art|Gothic]] angel in [[ivory]], c1250, [[Louvre]]]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
While angels and demons alike are generally regarded as invisible to human sight, they are frequently depicted as human-like creatures with wings, though many [[theology|theologians]] have argued that they have no physical existence, but can take on human form (the traditional [[Eastern Orthodox]] term for angels is ''asomata'', &quot;bodiless [ones]&quot;).  Descriptions of angels in their angelic form mention wings (as in Isaiah, Zachariah, etc.) however, when appearing in human form, they look like men, or as young men. [[Seraphim]] are shown in art as having six wings (in accordance with {{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:1-3|HE}}), and [[Cherubim]] four, having a quadruple face of lion, ox, eagle, and man. [[Putto]] are often confused with [[Cherubim]], although they are completely different.

Most theologians agree that angels have no gender (see more extended discussion below). Therefore, they usually appear as androgynous, although guardian angels appear more feminine and maternal. Their exceptional beauty was well attested in Scripture. The long plain dress or tunic traditionally given to most angels comes hardly altered from the [[Byzantine]] tradition, where it had, if anything, a male connotation.  In the [[Renaissance]] these were shown often bright-coloured, but before and after were mostly plain white. 

Byzantine angels were also often shown in military outfits, and, transmitted by [[icon]]s from [[Crete]] in particular, this tradition was transferred to [[Western art]], especially for [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], who wear versions of Byzantine officer's armour and clothing into the [[Baroque]] period and later.  The same archangels, when in attendance on Christ or the Virgin, wear the ''[[Byzantine dress|loros]]'', a jeweled strip of cloth hanging vertically down the front of the body.  This was worn only by the [[Imperial family]] and their [[bodyguard]]; the archangels were seen as God's bodyguard.  They also often carry long white [[staff of office|staves of office]].  Hence, when a high-ranking Byzantine in a visionary dream in 586 saw two men he took to be bodyguards of the Emperor, they subsequently turned out to be angels.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, &quot;Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons&quot;, p. 67, 1985, George Philip, London, ISBN 054001085-5&lt;/ref&gt;  For other scenes, the same angels must appear ''incognito'' to accord with, for example, their appearance to Abraham.  However artists are very reluctant to depict them in normal clothes, or without wings. The wings represent the angels' role as messengers of God (cf. [[Hermes]]).

Angels are often shown making music in heaven, sometimes in bands of a fair size, or in depictions of the Book of Revelation, blowing [[trumpet]]s in accordance with the text.  In the 15th century West in particular, angels are sometimes shown wearing versions of contemporary clerical [[vestment]]s, especially the [[alb]] and crossed [[stole]].  There was a theological comparison developed between the role of Gabriel in the Annunciation and that of the priest saying Mass. 

In the Renaissance, the classical [[putto]], usually naked, was first revived in secular and mythological subjects, but they soon appeared, often in great quantity, as newly-created angels, becoming almost the norm in compositions with a number of angels merely in attendance.

{{main|Angels in Islam}}
In the [[Qur'an]], angels are referred to as &quot;Malaaikah&quot; ([[Arabic]] مَلَائِكَة). The belief in angels is central to the religion of [[Islam]], which articles of faith includes Belief in God, Belief in Angels, Belief in Books ([[Holy Scripture]]), Belief in [[Prophets]] and Messengers, Belief in [[Qiyamah]] ([[Resurrection]]/[[Doomsday]]) and finally Belief in Qada and [[Qadar]] (Arabic القضاء و القدر) (predestination) beginning with the belief that the Qur'an was dictated to [[Muhammad]] by the chief of all angels, the archangel [[Jibril]] ([[Gabriel]]).  Angels are thus the ministers of God, as well as the agents of revelation in Islam.

In Islamic tradition, angels are benevolent beings created from a Divine Light. They do not possess free will, thus are incapable of doing evil or disobeying God. Unlike the Christian tradition, the Islamic tradition considers [[Satan]] ([[Iblis]]) to be a jinn, not an angel. Jinn, like humans, have free will. With rationality this Islamic actuality affords Satan ([[Iblis]]) the opportunity to forego a command by God, causing his eventual fall from Grace. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Behold! We said to the angels, &quot;Bow down to Adam&quot;: They bowed down except Iblis. He was one of the Jinns, and he broke the Command of his Lord. Will ye then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me? And they are enemies to you! Evil would be the exchange for the wrong-doers! &lt;br&gt; 
(Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|18|50}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Angels are wholly devoted to the worship of God. They are regarded as messengers of God, carrying out specific duties on His command. Angels are ranked and vary in their abilities and duties. Duties may include recording every human being's actions, placing a soul in a newborn child, maintaining certain environmental conditions of the planet (such as nurturing vegetation and distributing the rain), taking the soul at the time of death and more. 

Angels are described as preternaturally beautiful. Having varying sizes and counts of wings.

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels, messengers with wings,- two, or three, or four (pairs): He adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things. &lt;br&gt; (Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|35|1}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Angels are considered genderless . 

&lt;blockquote&gt; Those who believe not in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names. &lt;br&gt; (Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|53|27}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Angels can take on human form, but only in appearance. As such, angels do not eat, procreate nor commit sin as humans do. Humans cannot become angels upon death or otherwise, nor can angels become human.

Unlike a Christian tradition, angels and not Satan guard the gates of Hell. Instead, Satan resides on earth, waylaying man until the Day of Resurrection, after which he will be cast into hell along with the unbelievers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And We have set none but angels as Guardians of the Fire; and We have fixed their number only as a trial for Unbelievers,- in order that the People of the Book may arrive at certainty, and the Believers may increase in Faith,- and that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the Believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the Unbelievers may say, &quot;What symbol doth Allah intend by this ?&quot; Thus doth Allah leave to stray whom He pleaseth, and guide whom He pleaseth: and none can know the forces of thy Lord, except He and this is no other than a warning to mankind. &lt;br&gt; (Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|74|31}})
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The archangel Gabriel is attributed with sending the message of God to all the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophets]], including the [[Psalms]], [[Torah]], [[Bible]] and [[Qur'an]] (as opposed to the Christian view that Gabriel is the angel of good news).{{Failed verification|date=March 2008}} Other angels include [[Michael (archangel)|Mikail]] (Michael) who discharges control of vegetation and rain,{{Failed verification|date=March 2008}} [[Israfeel]] who will blow the trumpet at the [[Qiyamah|Day of Resurrection]],&lt;ref name = &quot;JE&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1521&amp;letter=A&amp;search=malak#4378 JewishEncyclopedia.com - ANGELOLOGY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali|Imam `Ali]] explained the creation of Angels in the following words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Then He created the openings between high skies and filled them with all classes of His angels. Some of them are in prostration and do not kneel up. Others in kneeling position and do not stand up. Some of them are in array and do not leave their position. Others are extolling God and do not get tired. The sleep of the eye or the slip of wit, or languor of the body or the effect of forgetfulness does not affect them. 
Among them are those who work as trusted bearers of His message, those who serve as speaking tongues for His prophets and those who carry to and fro His orders and injunctions. Among them are the protectors of His creatures and guards of the doors of the gardens of Paradise. Among them are those also whose steps are fixed on earth but their necks are protruding into the skies, their limbs are getting out on all sides, their shoulders are in accord with the columns of the Divine Throne, their eyes are downcast before it, they have spread down their wings under it and they have rendered between themselves and all else curtains of honour and screens of power. They do not think of their Creator through image, do not impute to Him attributes of the created, do not confine Him within abodes and do not point at Him through illustrations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[s:Imam Ali's First Sermon in His Peak of Eloquence|The Creation of the Angels,]]&quot; excerpt from &quot;Imam Ali's First Sermon in His Peak of Eloquence,&quot; translated by Askari Jafri, hosted at [[s:Main Page|Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Okay, I think what Hrafn suggests with bringing up &quot;without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge&quot; is that as long as the information is bible/quran references, and near quotes, everything is okay.

The unsigned comment on the top of the page has a point.  The fact that this page is missing any mention of the popularly secular view of angels (as in &quot;mommy died and went to heaven and now she's an angel&quot;) is a gross oversight.  This would be a particularly interesting inclusion to contrast it from the proper Christian dogma on angels (in which angels are not deceased human beings, but a different type of being altogether) given popular Western culture's tendency to confuse the two.

== Etymology ==

I am fixing the etymology of angel from the Greek ''aggelos''. Obviously, the pronunciation of the first gamma as 'ni' in double gamma roots caused the confusion.

;It simply is standard practice to transliterate gamma gamma (as in a-g-g-e-l-o-s) as ng. Thus the transliteration is angleos, not aggelos. IMO, probably no one should have ever come up with the rule to transliterate gg as ng, but that is the standard scholarly practice; so one sticks with it.

===LDS belief===

I reinstated some edits, this time including references for the two additions:
* Pre-mortal beings = angels - see the Bible Dictionary reference where it talks about one type of angel being those who &quot;have not yet obtained a body of flesh and bone (unembodied)&quot; as opposed to those who have lived, died, and await resurrection.
* Adam ''is'' Michael - &quot;is now&quot; doesn't work as the sources I've included indicate LDS belief that Adam was also known as Michael before his earth life.
* Nephite civilization in upstate NY - Some LDS would agree with this, but some would not - this variety of belief is evident from [[Limited geography model]] and [[Hill Cumorah#Archaeology]]. IMO the location is irrelevant to the topic at hand, and so being silent on the location is acceptable.

If I understand your edit summary, you're saying that &quot;is now&quot; is indefinite on whether he was or wasn't Pre-Eden. But since LDS Theology is explicitly definite that he was Michael Pre-Eden (and even during his mortal life - [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/107/54#54 D&amp;C 107:24]), would not the more definite &quot;Adam is Michael&quot; be better? --[[User:FyzixFighter|FyzixFighter]] ([[User talk:FyzixFighter|talk]]) 21:04, 18 April 2009 (UTC)

I am editing the verbiage that angels are spirits (per se). In LDS historical accounts, most angels referenced have been either resurrected beings (spirits with resurrected physical bodies of flesh and bones - but no blood, since that would mean they were mortal), and &quot;translated&quot; beings, that is, persons who, like resurrected beings, have bodies of flesh and bones (though whether they have blood or not, is not necessarily known, since they are not yet resurrected, and yet they cannot die). 

For example, Moroni was a resurrected being. Besides the account of the three witnesses being shown the gold plates, etc, by (purportedly) the angel Moroni (in heavnely glory), David Whitmer gives an account of seeing him &quot;sans glory&quot; as a traveler walking by him, Oliver Cowdery &amp; Joseph Smith as they rode in a horse drawn wagon in the late 1820's going from PA to NY. In that account, this 'angel' said that it was warm, and wiped his brow, indicating he physically felt the heat of the day, which, presumably, a personage of only spirit would not be able to do.

John the Baptist was apparently the first angel who appeared in glory that Oliver Cowdery himself witnessed. Oliver Cowdery said of this encounter - &quot;On a sudden, as from the midst of eternity,....the angel of God came down clothed with glory, and delivered the anxiously looked for message, and....our eyes beheld, our ears heard, as in the 'blaze of day'; yes, more—above the glitter of the May sunbeam, which then shed its brilliancy over the face of nature!  Then his voice, though mild, pierced to the center, and his words, 'I am thy fellow-servant,' dispelled every fear.  We listened, we gazed, we admired!  'Twas the voice of an angel from glory, 'twas a message from the Most High!  And as we heard we rejoiced, while His love enkindled upon our souls,...&quot;

Cowdery continues— &quot;But, dear brother, think, further think for a moment, what joy filled our hearts, and with what surprise we must have bowed, (for who would not have bowed the knee for such a blessing?) when we received under his hand the Holy Priesthood as he said, 'Upon you my fellow-servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer this Priesthood and this authority...

Oliver then added— &quot;I shall not attempt to paint to you the feelings of this heart, nor the majestic beauty and glory which surrounded us on this occasion; but you will believe me when I say, that earth, nor men, with the eloquence of time, cannot begin to clothe language in as interesting and sublime a manner as this holy personage.

(Pearl of Great Price | JS-History Notes:5-7)

The physicality of this &quot;re-headed&quot; (via resurrection) John the Baptist, though also appearing in &quot;great glory (or 'light')&quot;, by this account, should not be in doubt.

Indeed, that angels needed to be beings with physical beings with bodies of flesh and bones is a topic which is pointed out in great detail in LDS doctrine. Moses and Elias (Elijah) appearing to Peter, James and John in/on the 'Mount of Transfiguration' and the &quot;keys&quot; of previous &quot;gospel dispensations&quot; we are taught (in the LDS religion) that were bestowed on this apostolic &quot;first presidency&quot; by those beings is made quite clear. Both Elijah and even Moses, who was &quot;buried unto the Lord&quot; (what is taught in LDS doctrine as a euphemism that he [Moses] was 'taken up' or &quot;translated&quot;, as John the Beloved/Revelator likewise was done centuries later, is carefully confirmed.

Peter, James and John, also appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Diligentdave|Diligentdave]] ([[User talk:Diligentdave|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Diligentdave|contribs]]) 19:29, 8 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Angelism==
There ought to an entry on the notion of [[angelism]], which is defined as a theory of human existence that minimizes concupiscence and therefore ignores the need for moral vigilance to cope with the consequences of humanity's sin. It could also be described as a type of logical fallacy in which for something to be true, it quite literally has to be angelic, or at least morally unattackable, which puts impossible moral obstacles in the path of common human undersanding and acceptance of reality as it is.

== Non-Religious ==

Why are non-religious angels completely vacant from the Wiki angels page? Angels are common in fantasy fiction (especially stories intended for a female audience), so where are the sections discussing the non-religious depictions? More people will want to read on the fantasy depictions than the religious. (Considering both people who feature them in their religion ''and'' those not of those religions can enjoy seeing them in a non-religious context.)  Maybe put it in an &quot;in popular culture&quot; section, or if willing to really look into it give it a linked over page of its own that goes into greater detail. (FYI to the over-religious, angels and demons exist outside of western religions.)


:Its odd no one answered your question. The entire world isn't under the Atheistic religion/belief, so not all believe Angels aren't real. You shouldn't assume its a universally accepted idea. Frankly I find it hard to believe all things exploding from nothing isn't supernatural. Therefore I consider &quot;Evolution&quot; which is described as an intelligence being, although they outwardly say otherwise and actually have no explanation for, to be a religion/supernatural belief. I don't know what you mean by over-religious, but the Angels and Demons that are trying to be described under this article are the ones that exist, and not the pseudo-western culture idea of Angels and Demons. All the world believes in religions, including you, so don't count yourself out of &quot;over-religious&quot; people. FYI to you, science exists outside your western religion.

It's not &quot;odd&quot; at all, new threads placed at the ''top'' of a talk page (instead of at the ''bottom'', where they belong) often get missed. As to why this hasn't been included in the article, I can suggest two possible reasons:
#Lack of reliable [[WP:SECONDARY]] sources discussing this depiction.
#The likelihood that winged-huminoids ''lacking'' religious overtones will frequently be called something ''other'' than 'angels' in fantasy settings ([[Runequest]]'s [[Glorantha]] mythos calls them 'Wind Children' for example).

Spritual being&quot; and &quot;mythological&quot; are can in no way be considered &quot;slightly different words&quot;. If you read the article in spiritural beings (which btw, does not once use the word &quot;mythological&quot; in explaining what they are) you will find almost no similarities whatsoever. The issue here I think, is you interpret &quot;spiritual beings&quot; in a strange way, a way which is rather uncommon and unfortunately not correct.

Furthermore, I was curious as to your use of the phrase &quot;over and over&quot;. In it's current form, the point is not made ones that Angel's are mythological...when we consider the fact that you erroneously consider &quot;angel&quot; and &quot;spiritual being&quot; to be completely synonmous, then placing mythological would mean that point is only said twice. &quot;over and over&quot; however, suggests a plethora of repeated information. I'd kindly ask then for you to direct me to these additional instances of repeat...and perhaps I can then recognise or challenge them and we shall be able to resolve this.

In that case, the word myth was avoided after all participants has overdosed on pain killers. I suggest just avoiding that debate, for it will most probably end up the same place, for most Wikipedia articles on religion and spirituality are written as &quot;myth free&quot; for if the limit is pushed the word myth will have to be inserted in most paragraphs on spirituality, e.g. whenever God is mentioned.

But that completely goes against reason and uniformity. You make a strong argument for not including any phrase relating to &quot;myth&quot;, but not an encyclopedic one. If you look at any articles relating to Aztec religous beliefs for example, you'll find an abundance of litterings of &quot;myth&quot;, &quot;mythological&quot;, &quot;legendary&quot;. I'm familiar with this because it is a subject that interests me. Based purely upon this page, and the one you suggested to check-out...I'm going to assume that such words evoke a huge backlash on pages dealing with religious beliefs in the Abrahamic tradition (no doubt connected to the fact that the vast majority of the world identify as christian/muslim).

I'm sure many of these people are offended by &quot;mythological&quot;, as to them it might seem to suggest their beliefs are fanciful tales, but regardless of belief...it need not. Something being mythological doesn't necessarily mean it is untrue.

Regardless though, the above is all a moot point. Wikipedia exists to convey factual knowledge, not to present an image everybody can be happy with. Regardless of how it may make many people feel, the facts need to be presented- and Angels fall rather squarely into the realm of mythology.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.231.252.200|131.231.252.200]] ([[User talk:131.231.252.200|talk]]) 21:24, 30 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Again, this is incorrect. I would again direct you to the articles on Aztec religious beliefs, or ancient pagan religions across Europe (Greece/Rome for example). Furthermore, just because one article is not up to scratch- doesn't mean this one shouldn't be. Wikipedia cannot use itself, articles are created independantly accroding to Wikipedia's encyclopedic guidelines.

Also Hrafn, you have not addressed my point and are instead paraphasing yourself. You also contradict yourself, if ALL spiritual beings in SOME religions are mythological- then it is really quite necessary to include the word.

Aside from this point however, this is an enyclopedia. Encyclopedia's present information explicitly, information is not to implied and left to be logically induced from a statement elsewhere. I'd direct you to the good article on horse for example. The very first line explains the horse is a &quot;mammal&quot; and the article then goes on to explain the horse belongs to the family &quot;Equidae&quot;. All Equidae's are mammals, so is it obsolete to state the horse is a mammal?

No, because this is an encyclopedia- not an elitist document in which important information can be left out, because some people have some prior knowledge of the subject already.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.231.252.200|131.231.252.200]] ([[User talk:131.231.252.200|talk]]) 14:09, 31 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

No, you and Hrafn aren't in agreement. You want the same end result, but for completely different reasons. You don't believe Angels are mythological, and wish the article to reflect this as part of a religous agenda. Hrafn on the otherhand, believes Angels are mythological, and (misguidingly) believes this is already reflected in the article, which it could be argued that it is- but not in an encyclopedically acceptable way.

&quot;You also contradict yourself, if ALL spiritual beings in SOME religions are mythological- then it is really quite necessary to include the word.&quot; -- [[WP:Complete bollocks]]. Just because an adjective is inherent, does not mean that it is worthy of mention. All mares are female, that does not mean that we have to say &quot;female mare&quot; instead of &quot;mare&quot; to be clear as to what we are saying. &quot;mythological spiritual beings…&quot; does not tell the reader any more than &quot;spiritual beings…&quot; would.

Again, you have completely failed to understand. You are consistently making the flawed assumption (despite yourself making a statement AGAINST that rigidly held-belief), that &quot;mythological&quot; and &quot;spiritual being&quot; are synonmous. Look at their respective definitions. You've even confused my argument, despite clearly stated. You are absolutely right that just because an adjective is inherent that it is not worthy of mention, though that is completely irrelevant.

In this case, the adjective is not inherent- but you can't possibly say that it is not a critically important aspect of angels that they are apart of Abrahamic mythology. The most important point in the history of the topic is that they stem from this Abrahamic mythological tradition.

It seems your entire argument hinges on the fact that &quot;spiritual beings&quot; imply mythological. I strongly suggest, for a third and final time, to review the definitions of those words. I've demonstrated this is not the case, but you are ignoring reason in favour of personal obstinance. From your valiant attempts to create a valid argument (which is indeed impressive, as one doesn't exist) I can see you are atleast somewhat above average intelligence, and are probably therefore not used to having to back away from a defeated argument in the face of a superior intellect- but I implore you, as a philisopher (I checked your use-page) to accept reason and swallow your pride.

Now, I'd like to give you a final chance to craft a valid point- essentially, attempt to demonstrate &quot;spiritual beings&quot; and &quot;mythological&quot; are, as you put it &quot;slightly different words&quot; and are not (as they unfortunately are), completely distinct in meaning- and we can move on and improve this article.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.231.252.200|131.231.252.200]] ([[User talk:131.231.252.200|talk]]) 16:55, 31 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:More [[WP:Complete bollocks]]. You have in no way demonstrated that &quot;mythological [[spiritual being]]s found in many religious traditions&quot; provides any more information than &quot;[[spiritual being]]s found in many religious traditions&quot;. &quot;Mythological&quot; beings are supernatural (an adjective that encompasses &quot;spiritual&quot;) beings that are contained in a culture or religion's traditional stories (which encompasses &quot;religious traditions&quot; about such beings).

I cannot. I'm sure some exist, observable animals that some culture has ascribed a spiritual significance to at some point or other- though I cannot think of any of the top of my head. However, that's not particulary important- you ask what extra information it provides? Simple- the word itself, it states they are mythological (most importantly, it does so EXPLICITLY). You argue that &quot;spiritual being&quot; achieves that already, and I agree with you to an extent (though many would not)- but it does not do so adaquately, and certainly not in a fashion fit for an encyclopedia.

If &quot;spiritual being&quot; and &quot;mythological&quot; were truly synonmous, as you earlier attempted to argue but have fortunately backed away from- then you would be correct. But they are not, they have some degree of overlap (not particulary strong, if you look at the definitions for both- which for a final time I'd STRONGLY suggest you do, please stop ignoring that request and stop fearing contradictory evidence). This minor degree of overlap is not nearly strong enough to warrant calling them synonmous- and if spiritual being is not synonmous with mythological, then you are plainly dead wrong when you make attempts to claim including mythological would amount to the article repeating itself.

I agree, that many readers (chiefly those belonging to European-influenced western culture) will equate spiritual being to mythological, but a sizable minority won't. Wikipedia is an enyclopedia, not a source of information directed at those with cognitive processes matching those of one editor- all information must be presented precisely in no uncertain terms (NOT IMPLIED).

This article cannot, and willnot, be flawed in such a respect. It is not acceptable for an encyclopedia to merely imply important information (if you return to arguing that it is not important that angels are mythological, that's another debate- one that will end rather quickly), even if that implied information can be converted into the fact that should have been clearly expressed. I've seen your userpage, you value precision- let's strive to create a more precise article, one that expresses clearly important facts rather than leaves them obscured through a wishy-washy subjective implication.

#I could do, but doing some would both be tiresome and pointless considering my next statement. I still stand by my point that many (especially those outside Western-culture, or children perhaps) would not understand the implication- but even if 100% did understand fully, it's still not acceptable for an enyclopedia as information must be stated explicitly. I'd direct you to the Good Article on horse again, it's described as a mammal even though this is implied through it being a member of equidae. In that case, it's even less useful than it is here- as nobody contests all equidae are mammals.
#I'll be brief, as this is similair to the point above. Though many might imply mythological from &quot;spiritual being&quot; (ignoring for now my contestion that a sizable minority wouldn't), implication is not an acceptable way for an encyclopedia to disclose informationn.

===Arbitrary break===
#(i) Your &quot;aspect[s] of spiritual&quot; appear to have no relevance to my original question of whether &quot;an example of a '[[spiritual being]] found in a religious tradition' that is unambiguously ''not'' mythological&quot; exists.&quot; (ii) Ghosts would generally be considered a 'spiritual being', but are not generally considered to be &quot;pertaining to God or a Church; sacred&quot;, so your argument, on this irrelevant point, would appear flawed.
#If you aren't going to substantiate it, then as far as I'm concerned it has no value and you have nothing to &quot;stand by&quot;. I see ''far to many'' unsubstantiated assertions to waste my time on them. I will continue to 'ignore' this one.
#You have offered no compelling evidence that addition of a single word will make the sentence magically 'much more encyclopedical', so I will ignore this assertion.
#That your bombastic claims were substance-free ''rhetoric'' was exactly my point.
#&quot;Is their presence in Abrahamic mythology an important aspect of 'Angels'- either (or both) in terms of their origin or identity?&quot; This question is not answerable without a clear and ''authoritative'' definition of 'Abrahamic mythology'. If it is the common story threads between the sacred books of the Abrahamic religions (i.e. between the Old Testament &amp; the Koran), then I'd state an unambiguous 'no'. If it means the sum of these sacred books, then the answer is ambiguous. It is only when the total sum of the &quot;religious traditions&quot; (including post-Biblical speculation, that is a large bulk of the information on angels) is considered that the answer becomes an unambiguous 'yes'. Does this mean that '(Abrahamic) mythology' adds any more clarity beyond 'religious traditions (of the religions under discussion)'. No it does not.
#&quot;Does describing something as 'spiritual being' EXPLICITLY express that said object is mythological?&quot; No, but that is not the question at hand. &quot;spiritual beings found in many religious traditions&quot; contains the ''very strong implication'' that the beings in question are &quot;mythological&quot;. It also contains the very strong implication that the beings in question are 'supernatural', 'otherwordly', 'ethereal', and who knows what else. (i) &quot;Angels are supernatural otherwordly ethereal mythological spiritual beings found in many religious traditions&quot; appears to be overkill. (ii) But there is no indication that 'mythological' adds any more information (i.e. acts in a way dissimilar to a close ''synonym'' in this context) or magically makes the sentence 'much more encyclopedical' than any of these other, equally superfluous, alternatives.
Your questions do not resolve anything. You have not presented any compelling arguments (merely unsubstantiated, even when challenged, assertions). You have not garnered a [[WP:CONSENSUS]] for your change.

There was a similar cycle with the scriptural accounts of man's origin in the [[Book of Genesis]] and in other religious traditions. The question was whether to call these accounts ''myths'' or what?

See:
*[[Creation myth]], redirect from
*#[[Creation story]]
*#[[Creation account]]
*[[Myth of origins]]

IIRC, the dispute was between those who said academics use the term ''myth'' in scholarly sense that imputes no connotation of validity or invalidity; and those who said that &quot;myth&quot; implies outdated or erroneous beliefs.

The point for this article is that contemporary religious believers consider angels to be real spiritual beings. If this is an article about religion, then we contributors don't have to say whether the beliefs are true or false; we need only report what is believed by whom. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 17:19, 26 January 2012 (UTC)

== Angels in other religions ==

The article currently mentions angels as existing in several religions
unrelated to the original Jewish concept (while the Christian/Muslim version
''is'' related). IMO, this is an abuse of the word, which detracts from the
article. If these need mention (may well be the case), it should explicitly
be in the form &quot;religion A has a similar being called B&quot;, ''not'' &quot;religion
A also has angels&quot;.

Apart from being formally incorrect, this abuse also brings a risk of
misunderstandings and misassociations, because the various concepts will merely
be ''similar'', not identical.

== Sumerian angels ==

It is unbelievable that you could write a section on angels and leave out Sumerian angels. First of all, the oldest depictions of angels are Sumerian. Akkadians mixed with Sumerians and eventually ruled Mesopotamia by 3000 BC. The language of the Akkadians was Semitic and the Sumerian language was non-Semitic, but by the time of Abraham the entire region was speaking a Semitic dialect. Abraham was born and raised in Mesopotamia. He brought his Semitic language and his Sumerian/Akkadian beliefs in angels with him to Canaan. Anyone who studies religions can trace how an older religion evolves into newer ones. Mesopotamia was the birthplace of western civilizations, and the birthplace of western religions. Since the oldest records we have are the cuneiform tablets of the Sumerians, that is the oldest religion with written records. That is the religion of Abraham's parents. Abraham eventually settled in Canaan, and helped give birth to Judaism, and Islam, both incorporating beliefs in angels. Then Christianity evolved from Judaism. Leaving out Sumerian beliefs is naive, because scholars trace the roots of the three major Western religions to Sumerian beliefs. Once you have read the Sumerian version of the great flood, and then compared it to the Old Testament version, you will be convinced they are the same story. Personally, I remember listening to a group of American tourists talking about a 4000 BC clay angel in the Sumerian exhibit at the national archeology museum in Beijing. They asked the guide if the Sumerians were Jewish, and thus believed in angels. The guide gave a short history as I discussed previously and we walked away. Everyone was in disbelief that the Jewish/Christian angels could be a carry over from a pagan religion. With regards to the possibility of Egyptian winged gods being the ancestor for Judeo-Christian angels, Semitic tribes with beliefs in angels were trading with Egyptians before the ancient Egyptian empires began. If you look up hieroglyphics in Wikipedia you will see that this writing evolved from Sumerian cuneiform. It is unlikely that the Egyptians who learned Sumerian cuneiform were not exposed to Sumerian religious beliefs. In fact there are ample similarities to conclude that ancient Egyptian religious beliefs were an offshoot of Sumerian beliefs. You need to do a little more research and rewrite this section on angels giving credit to the real origins of such beliefs.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.229.90.216|66.229.90.216]] ([[User talk:66.229.90.216|talk]]) 03:35, 21 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Those interested may wish to read Ezekiel 28 and Isaiah 14 where many believe that the history of satan is addressed (e.g., KJV Lucifer in Isaiah 14). Note the repetitive &quot;I WILL's.&quot; ([[User:EnochBethany|EnochBethany]] ([[User talk:EnochBethany|talk]]) 23:10, 27 January 2011 (UTC))
:Try reading the whole chapters.  Ezekiel 28:2 says &quot;Son of man, say to the '''ruler of Tyre''', 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; you are a mere '''mortal'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;, 28:11 says &quot;take up a lament concerning the '''king of Tyre''' and say to him...&quot;  That chapter is specifically addressed to the ''human'' king of Tyre.  It is only by taking 28:14 completely out of context, throwing away the rest of the chapter, and forgetting what a simile is (&quot;anointed ''as'' a guardian cherub,&quot; or 'anointed ''like'' a guardian cherub') that anyone came to the conclusion that it has anything to do with Satan.  Isaiah 14:4 says &quot;take up this proverb against the '''king of Babylon'''&quot;.  In 14:12, the part that says &quot;How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning&quot; is (in context) mocking the king of Babylon (who refered to himself as &quot;Helel,&quot; or &quot;Morning star&quot;).  Kings of all sorts are typically proud, and mesopotamian kings often claimed to be gods.  The &quot;I will&quot; stuff in 14:13 and 14 is just showing how high-and-mighty the king of Babylon thinks he is.  It goes on to say in 14:16 &quot;They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, '''Is this the man''' that made the earth to tremble, '''that did shake kingdoms'''&quot; - again, it's about a mortal king.  14:19 and onward are pretty much 'Hey, King of Babylon, you're gonna die, Babylon is gonna fall.'  Also, Wikipedia does not do [[WP:OR|exegesis]] and [[WP:NPOV|does not make  any doctrinal decisions]], it only repeats a text and reports has been written about the Bible.

::Well, you certainly are taking an interpretive stance &amp; making a doctrinal decision, &amp; rather dogmatically, I might add. Also in apparent ignorance of the views of others, you seem to pontificate.  But this is the talk page. Myself, with great magnanimous magnanimity &amp; gentlemanly sensitivity, threw out the FACT that some have taken those passages to refer to satan &amp; referred those interested to the texts. Such persons may wish to compare Prince vs. King &amp; see if they think they are the same person. They may also wish to compare the Prince of Persia &amp; Prince of Greece in Dan 10 &amp; see if they think those are human kings or part of a demonic government functioning above the human; cf. also Eph 5-6 &quot;we wrestle not vs flesh &amp; blood but against principalities, as well as reference to the Prince of the Power of the Air in scripture.

===ORGANIZATION OF THE ARTICLE===

This article first allegedly takes up the subject of Angels in Judaism and then in Christianity.  The topic &quot;Judaism&quot; is miscontructed. The system of thought in the Tanach / Old Testament is far different from Judaism, using that term to apply to the thought of Jewish persons after the destruction of the Temple, as embodied in the Talmuds and their core, the Mishnah.  Thus to avoid categorical distortion of the subject and anachronism, the article would be better divided into

:A. Malach in the Tanach / Old Testament
:B. Angelos in the New Testament
:C. Malach in post-biblical Judaism.

:That'd be fine, but just as we shouldn't shove Rabbinical Judaism into the Tanakh, we shouldn't shove Christianity into it either. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 18:29, 28 January 2011 (UTC)

::Who suggested shoving Christianity into anything? Christianity, however, is to some extent a development out of the Tanach. The largest part of the scripture of Christianity is the Tanach, which is regarded as the Very Word of YHWH. And much fulfillment of prophecy in the Tanach took place in the  life of Christ. My outline suggested none of the above, however. Neither was it intended to be part of anti-Christianity or Biblephobia.([[User:EnochBethany|EnochBethany]] ([[User talk:EnochBethany|talk]]) 07:05, 30 January 2011 (UTC))
:::Your original treatment of Malakh YHWH in the article pushed heavily towards a modern Protestant interpretation, without much in the way of acknowledging non-Christian or historical interpretations.

==NPOV==

In order to have a neutral POV, '''the places''' which attempt to pit one part of the Bible vs. another as if God's Word disagreed with itself (impossible since God is omniscient and cannot lie) '''need revision'''. One section can be from the POV that the Bible is consistent with itself and another for those determined to impose internal contradiction on the text.  ([[User:EnochBethany|EnochBethany]] ([[User talk:EnochBethany|talk]]) 23:03, 27 January 2011 (UTC))

:To say that different parts of the Bible do not say the same thing as other parts isn't POV, to try and turn the article into an apologetics work would be, though. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 18:29, 28 January 2011 (UTC)

:::It certainly is POV. Since no parts of the Bible advocate opposing conceptions, those who assert such are showing a non-neutral POV. The article should not be an exercise in Biblephobia. You can never advocate that the Bible contradicts itself without debate with those who find it systematically consistent. And it is generally deceitful to present material in an anti-biblicist paradigm without recognizing that the other POV exists. ([[User:EnochBethany|EnochBethany]] ([[User talk:EnochBethany|talk]]) 06:35, 30 January 2011 (UTC))
::::It is your POV that there are no parts of the Bible advocating opposing conceptions.  It would be POV to try and push for the idea that the Bible shouldn't be trusted because of contradictions, but I never said that.  NPOV would simply state that one part says this, another part says that, and let the reader decide for themselves, perhaps reporting particularly notable interpretations.  The Bible is not primarily a work of angelology and it is not by a single author, so it is a non-issue if different people in different times had different conceptions of angels.

==Malach YHWH==

Somewhere also there must be inclusion of the apparent equation in the Tanach between Malach YHWH and YHWH Himself. No doubt this also will require separate sections (1) for those who recognize that equation and find no other explanation, except that the Malach YHWH in the Tanach is Yehoshua', Jesus Christ making a pre-incarnate appearance and (2) for those who wish to promulgate another POV. ([[User:EnochBethany|EnochBethany]] ([[User talk:EnochBethany|talk]]) 23:03, 27 January 2011 (UTC))

:That is interpretational.  Wikipedia does not take any stance on doctrine or interpretation, it simply reports what has been said about a text. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 18:29, 28 January 2011 (UTC)

== Move Maimonides quote to Philosophy section? ==

I suggest this for two reasons: (1) The Phil. section contains a reference to Aquinas, so it now leans towards a Christian interpretation and could use the Maimonides quote for balance (and to keep it religiously neutral); and (2) The quote refers to Aristotle, which fits better in the Phil. section than in the Judaism section.

== Comment only ==

Meaning, no change being sought, at this time. The [[Angels#Bah.C3.A1.27.C3.AD_Faith|Baha'i Faith]] section seems incomplete, as there are many ways that people can talk, and think, about angels beyond the one shown. For instance, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/qr/050.htm KAF] has this -- 
::''We created man: and we know what his soul whispereth to him, and we are closer to him than his neck-vein.'' 
::''When the two angels charged with taking account shall take it, one sitting on the right hand, the other on the left''
::''Not a word doth he utter, but there is a watcher with him ready to note it down'' 
-- that addresses what might be an almost universally held notion. Has anyone collected, and analyzed [http://yahyay19.blogspot.com/2011/05/angels-super-man.html or used], those references to angels that are specifically mentioned in the Quran? Especially, seeing as how they can actually be made applicable. [[User:JMSwtlk|jmswtlk]] ([[User talk:JMSwtlk|talk]]) 20:59, 26 May 2011 (UTC)

== Contemporary belief in angels ==

This section refers almost entirely to views in the USA - which which I suspect are quite untypical.  Are there any surveys in parts of the world other than north America?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/124.197.15.138|124.197.15.138]] ([[User talk:124.197.15.138|talk]]) 05:54, 1 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: Yes there are many thousands of such surveys and you're right, the US is untypical in a number of ways.

:No other country has anything like the quality of data on Angel beliefs as the US.  In Europe for example, belief in Angels isnt even addressed in our most rigorous poll of social beliefs  ( [[Eurobarometer]] ).  For the US we can gauge the % of believers with a margin of error of less than 10%, we can track how belief has varied over time, and we can be quite specific about the sort of the belief we're taling about - i.e. belief that Angels are actually active in the world, not just a existential belief in their existence on another plane.   Another interesting difference is in the US belief in Angels seems to have been steadily rising year on year for the past few decades, even as mainstream Christianity has  slightly declined.  In most advanced countries the change of belief in Angels seems to correlate with the change in fortunes of organised religion. (though its important to note a great many non religious people belief in Angels, some sources say the proportion is over 50% ) 

:Probably you're thinking the proportion of belief in the US in untypically high, and you'd be right, though only for the advanced economies.

:In North and Central Europe, belief in Angels averages at about 35%. Its seems to have been stable recently in Scandinavia, and has possibly  began rising slightly in the core countries  -England, France , Netherlands &amp; Germany - though with a few exceptions like Scotland and especially Ireland where belief is sadly falling  (though from a higher starting point, it was over 75% in Ireland until very recently)

:In Southern Europe, belief is close to 70%, but is generally falling, especially in Spain.

:In Australia &amp; New Zeland, its around 50% , has been falling over the past few decades, but possibly is beginning to stabilise.

:In South America, belief in most countries exceeds 80% and is fairly stable.

:In India, there are millions of Christians and Muslims who believe in Angels. Hindus dont specifically believe in Angels, but they belief in a whole family ethereal beings that play a similar role. If we include Hindus, the proportion of believers is probably above 80%. (there are some Hindus who dont believe in ethereal beings, theres a lot of variety in that religion.).  

:Its hard to find polls for China and Japan, but from speaking to folk from these countries Id guess belief levels are about 40% (as with India this assumes we include believe in similar ethereal beings.) Belief levels seem to have fell drastically in the mid to late 20th century, but seem to have stablised in the 21st, and may now be slightly rising .  

:For rest of Asia, belief tends to be somewhere between Indian and Chinese levels.
  
:In African countries, belief often exceeds 80%.  

:Margin of error for these figures: 15% for most, except 20% for Africa and 30% for China and Japan. You might find wildly different figures from individual polls, but as noted most non US polls on belief in Angels are not particular rigorous.

:Please dont ask me to integrate this into the article.  There far too many militant atheists on Wikipedia for it to reliable in reflecting the very pleasing trends in supernatural belief and the gradual world wide return of organised religion in public life. They seem to sincerely consider belief in the supernatural and organised religion to be net negatives, and they have at least a basic understanding of Constructivist theory and the power of popularity. So they try to downplay these topics on Wikipedia. Whenever accurate articles are created, they swarm all over them and either try to edit them to reflect a sceptical view or to have them deleted with cries of &quot;Synth&quot; and “ringe.  Happily, despite the power of Wikipedia, global beliefs are generally moving in the opposite direction.    There are hundreds of papers and books to research if your interested in this.    [[God is Back]] by the editor in chief of ''The Economist'' is perhaps the best book to show the global trend. A good single article  (though only about religion, not belief in the supernatural) is  [http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/publication/1591/religions_flame_burns_brighter_than_ever.html?breadcrumb=%2Fexperts%2F1100%2Ftimothy_samuel_shah Religion's Flame Burns Brighter Than Ever] , it was previously published in Foreign Affairs magazine and is now hosted over at Harvard.
