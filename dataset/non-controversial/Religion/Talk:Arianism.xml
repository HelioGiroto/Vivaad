Hello I came across this article and found the introduction very difficult to understand even though I know a little about the history of the christian church. I appreciate that theological concepts can be difficult to describe but I found the intro completely opaque. Please could you describe it in more simple language.

'''Agree!'''  
The below is just some of the jargon that needs to be cleaned up so that ordinary people can understand it. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism#Beliefs &lt;br&gt;
the Son (Jesus?) is 1) an eructation, others that he is 2) a production, others that he is 3) also unbegotten.

...the Son is 4) not unbegotten

...For he (Jesus?) was 4b) not unbegotten. We are persecuted, because we say that the Son has 5) a beginning, but that God is 6) without beginning.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism#Origin  &lt;br&gt;
&quot;...He taught that the pre-incarnate  Jesus was a divine being created by (and therefore inferior to) God the Father at some point, before which the Son did not exist   In English-language works, it is sometimes said that Arians believe that Jesus is or was a &quot;creature&quot;, in the sense of &quot;created being&quot;. &quot;  &lt;br&gt; Isn't that what most people believe and what the Christmas story teaches?  It seems like much over little.  Yes or not, this point should be explained. 

And if Jesus wasn't a &quot;creature&quot;, wouldn't the short crucification as punishment/sacrifice be far, far less sacrifice than a modern long cancer death? &quot;''Only three days of torture with a ticket to heavan!?  Where do I get into THAT line?!''&quot; 

quotes from:
'''Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lead section)'''

:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LEAD  &lt;br&gt;
:The lead section (also known as the introduction, lead, or lede of a Wikipedia article is the section before the table of contents and the first heading. The lead serves both as an introduction to the article and as a summary of its most important aspects.

:The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article.   It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies. The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources, and the notability of the article's subject should usually be established in the first few sentences.

:While consideration should be given to creating interest in reading more of the article, the lead nonetheless should not &quot;tease&quot; the reader by hinting at—but not explaining—important facts that will appear later in the article. The lead should contain no more than four paragraphs, must be carefully sourced as appropriate, and should be written in a clear, accessible style with a neutral point of view to invite a reading of the full article.....


:... Introductory text    
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MOSINTRO#Introductory_text 
  
'''Provide an accessible overview'''  

:The lead section should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article. The reason for the topic being noteworthy should be established early on in the lead. It is even more important here than for the rest of the article that the text be accessible. 

&quot;...In general, specialized terminology and symbols should be avoided in an introduction. ....Where uncommon terms are essential to describing the subject, they should be placed in context, briefly defined, and linked.  The subject should be placed in a context with which many readers could be expected to be familiar.

:'''First sentence'''
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MOSINTRO#First_sentence   &lt;br&gt;
:The article should begin with a declarative sentence telling the nonspecialist reader what (or who) is the subject.
...If its subject is amenable to definition, then the first sentence should give a concise definition: where possible, one that puts the article in context for the nonspecialist. Similarly, if the title is a specialised term, provide the context as early as possible.

== Theodosius and Arianism in this Article ==

A large portion of the latter half of this article describes Theodosius and his role in early Christianity.  Isn't this information extraneous in an article specifically about Arianism? -- DH

:Thedosius forms a critical part of the history of Arianism, especially in Italy. Removing it would leave a huge question mark as to why it disappeared in Rome. [[User:24.247.157.122|24.247.157.122]] 01:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

::Definitely.  Theodosius essentially ended the Arian-Nicene conflict by bringing the apparatus of the Roman state decisively down on the Nicene side. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] 01:58, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

== Idiots' guide ==

I may have misunderstood this concept when I studied it at Uni, but I thought it could be summed up for idiots (like me) as follows:

First God was the Father... then the Son... and then he became the Holy Spirit

Is that simplistic rendering totally inaccurate? Or just usefully simplistic? Or just a waste of a couple of minutes' typing? --[[User:Dweller|Dweller]] 14:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

::It is a simplistic rendering of a complex theological idea: The Arian's Believe that Jesus was created by god, as he was born, the fundamental idea in the Nicene creed is that Jesus was created by god, long before his birth, and that &quot;In the beginning was the Word...&quot;, was that &quot;The Word&quot; was God's promise, and that Jesus was the fulfillment of that promise, and the Holy spirit was the source of the divine life of Jesus on earth. All of this is read aloud by Catholics and Anglicans every Sunday, so for them, its literally rote reading, and for others who wish to find the words of that expound on that idea, then one merely needs to read the idiots guide called &quot;The Book of common prayer.&quot; [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/WestIndies/HC.htm Book Of Common Prayer]

:Are you talking about the views of mainstream Christianity, or Arianism?  Christians who follow the Nicene creed (which is pretty much anyone who calls him or herself a Christian today) believe that Jesus has always existed (beginning of Gospel of John: &quot;In the beginning was the Word...&quot;, the Word being Jesus).  Some early Christians (who tend to be lumped together as Ariana, though they wouldn't have all necessarily called themselves that) believed that the Son was created by the Father at some point after the beginning of time, though they did not agreed on whether that made Jesus &quot;inferior&quot; in some way to God the Father.

:::Fundamentally, from the Sola scriptana, Jesus said My father is greater.
::::And Hermeneutics, &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the word was God.&quot; The Word, was Gods promise given in integrity, in which he is promising salvation, by means of Jesus, and the fulfillment of the prophecy, i.e. The prophecy is Gods promise. So logically if A gives you B, and B Gives you C, then A does give you C, It is NOT C, but gives you C. Lets be clear.  

:I admit that I don't really understand how the Holy Spirit fits into all this.  But both Nicene and Ariana's don't believe that one person of the trinity replaced another.  The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are believed to all coexist and yet together make up one God. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 15:07, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:::It would be essentially apropos to insert the text of the actual Nicene creed. It kind of spells it out.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, who spake by the prophets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::Sorry, I thought it was clear that I was trying to give an Idiot's Guide to the Arian doctrine. I also thought that a central plank of that was that the entities '''didn't''' co-exist. I must've been wrong. --[[User:Dweller|Dweller]] 15:13, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:::I think the idea is that in Arian beliefs they didn't ''always'' coexist.  That is, at some point there was just the Father, and later the Father and the Son.  But one did not replace the other.

:::Again, I don't know how the Holy Ghost fits in.  He is a wily character, that one. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 15:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

::::lol --[[User:Dweller|Dweller]] 15:34, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

Arianism, in a nutshell: &quot;There was when he [the Son], was not&quot; (an Arian slogan).  The issue (from Arius' perspective) is that the 1st person of the trinity (Father) most in some some way &quot;produce&quot; (whether creation or begetting) the 2nd person of the Trinity -- and thus there must be a time when the 2nd person was not.  The Spirit was not really considered until after Nicaea, other than to acknowledge that the SPirit is also divine.  [[User:Pastordavid|Pastordavid]] 11:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

:Obviously Jesus believed he was younger than Yahweh.  Why the heck would he call himself the Son, if he didn't believe he was younger than the Father?  If he thought he was the same age as Yahweh, he would have used the word &quot;brother&quot; instead of &quot;son&quot; in Matthew 21:37, Mark 12:6 and Luke 20:13.

:If believing that Jesus is younger than his Father makes you Arian, then Jesus himself was Arian.  --WillJ [[User:70.168.185.11|70.168.185.11]] 04:27, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

::I think the idea is that while Jesus as Jesus was born in 4 BC or whenever, the Word, as the beginning of the gospel of John says, had always existed and was co-eternal with the Father.  Jesus was the Word made flesh.  I'm not a Christian, so this all has a certain angels-dancing-on-a-pin quality for me, but the belief that all three persons of the Trinity have always existed in one form or another has defined mainstream Christianity for the last 1700 years. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 02:02, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

:: I think really what we are saying is, so that we can continue to support the Pope as divinely assigned political role, we should close our eyes and continue to spout the Trinitarian dogma.

== Arianism ==

&quot;Most orthodox or mainstream Christian historians define and minimize the Arian conflict as the exclusive construct of Arius and handful of rogue bishops engaging in &quot;heresy.&quot; Of the roughly three hundred bishops in attendance at the Council of Nicea, only three bishops did not sign the Nicene Creed.&quot;

Would be useful to add here the information about the total of bishops at that time was about 1800, as shown at [[Heresy]]:Early Christian heresies and [[First Council of Nicaea]]:Attendees? I think that to say that only 3 bishops out of 318 did not sign the [[Nicene Creed]] would be more properly understandable if this info is added. What do you think?

==&quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;irrelevant&quot;==
This was added and removed: &quot;'''Trivia''' In Chilean TV Programm &quot;Tertulia&quot; broadcast in [[Canal 13 Cable]] is a recurring joke between José Luis Rosasco and Monseñor Luis Eugenio Silva to say that Rosasco is &quot;Semi-Arian&quot;&quot;
In order to underrstand the banter one needs to known what &quot;Arian&quot; means: i.e. &quot;Arian&quot; is relevant at [[Canal 13 Cable]]. The converse however is not true: this statement is vacuous (a technical term, not just a &quot;pejorative&quot;). This needs to be re-explained a thousand times at Wikipedia: relevance is not a concept taught in public schools. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 07:26, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
:I have to agree. If someone wants to set up a wiki on the subject of television programming in Chile, '''then''' they can include this reference. As it happens, I recall an abstruse joke being made about Arianism at a faculty cocktail party I attended more than a decade ago. I forbore to include a retelling of the incident in this article. . . . --[[User:Mksmith|Michael K. Smith]] ([[User talk:Mksmith|talk]]) 19:00, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

== For clarity's sake ==

Arianism is a [[Trinitarian]] heresy, not a [[christological]] heresy.  That is, Arianism is fundamentally about how the Father is related to the Son (the doctrine of the Trinity), not about how the divine and human are related in the person of Christ (the Christological doctrine).  Yes, as in most trinitarian controversies, there are Christological implications -- but the issue was fundamentally understood as dealing with the relations of the persons of the Godhead.  -- [[User:Pastordavid|Pastordavid]] 11:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

== Some General Concerns ==

Does Arianism refer to the teachings of Arius of Alexandria in particular,  to the various concerns of the school of Lucian, or to the various different-substance, similar-substance, and like-substance groups of the 4th-6th centuries? In the first case, the article should stick as closely as possible to Arius, and should limit references to other teachers (e.g. Auxentius) propounding other not-same-substance teachings. In the second case, the article should focus much more on Lucian, much less on Arius, and much more on different teachers addressing recurring concerns, some with teachings closer to Nicaea, and some with teachings farther from Nicaea. But that could be another article (Co-Lucianism?). In the third case, I don't know. [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 20:13, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

IIRC, some authors suggest that the Logos may be not uncreated, and not created at some specific time, but continually created, and perhaps changible (within limits) or perhaps unchangible. Thus the idea of the created Logos does not imply the idea of a time before the creation of the Logos, although Arius probably taight that &quot;there was a time when He was not&quot; early in the controversy. Eunomius of Cyzicus considers and rejects the theory of continual creation in his First Apology (chapter 23). [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 20:13, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

== Name Issues Persist ==

[I asked about this on talk: Naming conventions.] The term [[Arianism]] is very common, but suffers several problems. It is a derogatory name given by its opponents; it has acquired additional meanings (e.g. teaching that Jesus was not divine) that would exclude Arius et al.; and it describes two larger overlapping groups ((1) the critics of Nicaea and (2) Lucian of Antioch and his followers) as well as one smaller subgroup (Arius of Alexandria and his followers). So it's hard to tell when the article means &quot;Arians, as in Arius, Eusebius, George, Aetius, Wulfila, etc.&quot; or &quot;Arians, as in Arius, but not these other guys.&quot; [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 04:47, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

== Mormons Support Arius? ==

I have to question the addition of Mormonism in the list of faiths prescribing to Arius' teachings.  Without reference side by side with what Arius taught vs. what Mormons believe, it seems as though this section is trying to find ways to prove Mormons follow Arius' teachings.  In fact, I can prove via cited reference that they do *not* subscribe to Arius' teachings.  Please see [http://www.geocities.com/essays12/UScreeds.pdf http://www.geocities.com/essays12/UScreeds.pdf] for a great explanation on Mormon beliefs on the subject.  Without cited evidence to the contrary, I suggest Mormons be removed from the list, as I think more than anything, Mormons support the Catholic belief that Arius was a Heretic.[[User:Jstayii|Jstayii]] 22:52, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

:Hi there, did you read the paragraph leading into that list at all?  Or the ''headline'', &quot;'Arian' as a polemical epithet&quot;?  The point is not that the groups on that list are Arians -- in fact, the intro material states ''exactly the opposite.''  The point is that the groups don't follow the Nicene Creed, and thus have been labelled Arians ''by others.'' --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 22:33, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

::Did you read the example I provided?  It makes very good evidence that Mormons ''do'' support the Nicene creed.  We may have different interpretations of what 1 in 3 and 3 in 1 actually mean, but Mormons agree with the sections of the Nicene creed and others that were added to contradict Arianism.  Should Mormons be in that list, Catholics should as well for the same reasons as Mormons.  Catholics and Mormons are very much in agreement with not following ''any'' of the teachings of Arius. [[User:Jstayii|Jstayii]] 22:52, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

:::Look, I think we're arguing at counterpurposes here.  I, and more importantly, this article, is in no way arguing that Mormons (or Jehovah's Witnesses or Muslims or whatever) are really secret Arians or something.  I'm not that familiar with Mormon trinitarianism, so apologies if I misspoke.  But such accusations have historically been a feature of anti-Mormon polemic.  The interesting thing from the standpoint of this article is that the Arian controversy so marked the early Church that &quot;Arian&quot; became frequently used insult or attack word in debates about the trinity, centuries after the last Arians (in the strict sense of &quot;those who follow the teachings of Arius&quot;) died out.  To summarize: ''This article is not trying to say that Mormons are Arians.  This article is only noting that others have called Mormons Arians.''

:::Frankly, this whole section is a bother and it may need to be eliminated or seriously rewritten.  The problem is that this exact thing keeps happening over and over: someone sees their religion on this list, feels that Wikipedia is insulting them by calling them Arians, and adds some elaborate theological argument proving that they aren't, really.  I'm pretty sure I wrote this section way back when, and it originally just noted that &quot;Arian&quot; was used in theological debates about the trinity, and then mentioned in passing some of the groups that have been so accused.  Then everyone wanted to add descriptions.  The rest is sorry history, and I'm open to suggestions on how it can be reworked to make it more obvious that Wikipedia isn't in the business of deciding who's an Arian and who isn't. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 01:57, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

::::Yeah, I would say cut the section.  The fact is, any non-trinitatian or subordinationist group will always be compared to arianism.  Indeed, throughout the middle ages it was a common term to through around as an accusation against one's theological opponents.  Arians are Arians - and that is what this article should be concerned with.  Not who is like arians, or has been accused of being like arians.  -- [[User:Pastordavid|Pastordavid]] 02:44, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

:::::Yep. And there are very different non-trinitarian theologies. [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 03:17, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

::::::I do honestly think it's worthwhile to keep the part that points out that &quot;Arian&quot; is a frequent term of abuse in theological disputation -- it may be the first context in which most people will encounter the term, so they'll be confused if they come here and find that they all died out in the firth century.  I think the list of not-Arians can be safely cut, though. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 03:20, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

::::I agree - thanks for cutting it.  It either needs to be rewritten to state your purposes, or removed to avoid any evidence of bias.  I realize it wasn't the intent, but the wording made it look as so.  I think if it were to be shown again, references of people calling certain religions &quot;Arian&quot; should be cited, along with cited references of both sides of the story on why people claim such, and why the particular religion does not agree that they subscribe to Arian teachings. So long as it remains neutral there should be no complaints on either side.  That, unfortunately is not an easy thing to do - hence why I think it's just a good idea to remove the section. [[User:Jstayii|Jstayii]] 04:18, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

:::::Not to grumble, but I did state my purposes -- the text said clearly that there was no historical continuity between Arians and the listed groups and that the members of those groups didn't consider themselves Arians.  I'm not sure how much clearer I could have made it.  I just got sick of the endless fights and the pointless &quot;they say&quot;-&quot;they say&quot; accretions of text to this section. --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 04:37, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

== Modern times arianism? ==

It should probably be stated that “even, there has been no historically continuous survival of Arianism into the modern era, there are in the modern times, religious that held the arian point of view, such as Jehovah Witness, and others”.

:Oh man, please read the entire previous section of this talk page for the troubles ''that'' starts.  Thanks.  --[[User:Jfruh|Jfruh]] ([[User talk:Jfruh|talk]]) 22:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

::To call a modern view &quot;Arianism&quot;, in addition to being horrible POV, is an anachronism.  Please read above.  -- [[User:Pastordavid|Pastordavid]] 01:35, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

== Arianism as heresy ==

I don't know why this is covered up. According to [[heresy]] and the source quoted in it: 
: ''Heresy, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is a &quot;theological or religious opinion or doctrine maintained in opposition, or held to be contrary, to the Roman Catholic or Orthodox doctrine of the Christian Church, or, by extension, to that of any church, creed, or religious system, considered as orthodox. By extension, heresy is an opinion or doctrine in philosophy, politics, science, art, etc., at variance with those generally accepted as authoritative.&quot; ''
Moreover, the scholarly sources invoked in this page study Arianism under the sign of heresy. 
Is any ground to consider Arianism not a heresy? [[User:Daizus|Daizus]] 11:17, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

:Wikipedia should cover the issues. Nicaea condemned Arianism as heresy. Wikipedia should state that Nicaea did so (and the article does). Wikipedia should not, however, condemn any tradition as heresy, as that violates NPOV (as the category tag would). [[User:Jacob Haller|Jacob Haller]] 11:38, 21 April 2007 (UTC)
:A personal issue: I am not an Arian (closer to Anomean) but my own position is also condemned by Nicaea. I try not to push my own POV, but to stay neutral and stay close to the sources. If our positions were reversed, if history had gone another way, and people were tagging Athanasianism as heresy, I hope I would not be doing so.

:: Wikipedia simply has to follow the sources and the sources say Arianism was a heresy. To say it was not it means to engage in original research. Also to say it is a NPOV violation it means there's another POV represented by reliable sources. Yet I don't see it. Is any scholarship claiming Arianism was not a heresy? Is any scholarship claiming the Nicene creed was not mainstream/orthodox at that time? [[User:Daizus|Daizus]] 11:44, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. It is a point of view that is neutral – that is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To label the subject '''Heresy''' is in opposition to its subject.
&lt;blockquote&gt;NPOV requires views to be represented without bias.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''assert facts, including facts about opinions — but do not assert the opinions themselves'''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are going to characterize disputes neutrally, we should present competing views with a consistently fair and sensitive tone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Let the facts speak for themselves'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ#Religion]] also addresses this issue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;NPOV policy often means presenting multiple points of view. This means providing not only the points of view of different groups today, but also different groups in the past.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Arianism is a heresy and this should be stated ==

Ok, I know that some people today do accept the teachings of Arius. However, that does NOT remove the fact that the original Christian Church declared Arius a heretic and his teachings as heresies.
If we are to claim Arius is a &quot;Christian&quot;, then we HAVE to clarify that his teachings are considered heresies BY Christians. We cannot simply state that Arianism is a &quot;Christian&quot; idea. It HAS to be pointed out in the first sentences that it is considered a heresy by the majority of Christians out there.

: We have no real idea what Arius teachings were, because they were all destroyed, except for what his enemies painted them to be.  Basically, anyone who disagrees with the trinitarian formula becomes a heretic along with Arius, because there are in fact no known specifics to Arius. Here is a sample Dialogue:
::Bill: Jesus must have been very powerful and great, he must have been a Superhero to perform all those miracles.
::Chuck: No Bill, if he were a superhero, then his miracles could have been flawed and in fact guided by evil. He must have been an angel to perform those miracles.
::Bill: Actually Chuck, if he were just an angel, then he could have been a fallen angel like Satan.  He must be divine. He must be part of God. 
::Chuck: You're right! That would make everything he did and said right.
::Arius: You guys are nuts.
:: Bill and Chuck (together): Heretic!

This is the SAME as Mormonism. Many Mormons would like to see themselves to be considered to be Christians. HOWEVER, that DOES NOT make them Christians.

Another example... Today, if someone in the Republican party turns and begins to espouse views that are in heavy agreement with the Democrats, is it not right then for the Republican party to &quot;Disown&quot; that person and thus call him a Democrat?

Christians original DID have a solid set of doctrines they had to adhere to. You can even read the Gospels and Epistles and find this. The Apostles repeatedly denounce heretics and people that taught false doctrines. Just because one believes in Jesus as the messiah doesn't always make them a Christian. As I said, we can see this in the New Testament. The Apostles (and God even) denounce &quot;heretics&quot; for their teachings and call for their repentence and the resistance of Christians.

Therefore, is it not also right to show to the world that these people are considered heretics by Christians? It does NOT matter what more liberal Christians believe today about different people or different issues. The fact remains that the early Christians, who were taught by the Apostles themselves and the disciples of the Apostles thus saw that the people teaching these doctrines were straying dangerously far away from what the Apostles and their disciples had taught, and thus called these people heretics.

The First Council of Nicaea was in 325 A.D.
St. Alexander of Alexandria presided over this. He was the Bishop of Alexandria, an Apostolic See.
Here is the succession of Alexander...
Pope Alexander&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Achillas&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Peter I&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Theonas&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Maximus&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Dionysius&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Heraclas&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Demetrius&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Julian&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Agrippinus&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Celadion&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Markianos&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Eumenes&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Justus&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Primus&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Kedron&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Avilus (about this time was when St. John the Theologian reposed)&lt;br /&gt;
Pope Anianus (ordained by St. Mark the Evangelist)&lt;br /&gt;
St. Mark the Evangelist&lt;br /&gt;

That is not very many Popes/bishops that continued the Church in Alexandria which was founded by the Apostles. We can easily do this with the other Apostolic Sees and the bishops that participated in the Council of Nicaea.

They were simply continuing the tradition and beliefs of the Apostles and the Disciples of the Apostles. How then, can we claim that Arianism is NOT heretical/heterodox when it contradicts the teachings of the Apostles, their Disciples and the successors to them? &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:KCMODevin|KCMODevin]] ([[User talk:KCMODevin|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/KCMODevin|contribs]])  20:01, 1 August 2008 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:BTW -- the reason to call Arius a heretic is not that he's &quot;wrong.&quot;  Let's say that he's &quot;right.&quot;  Let's say that the New Testament and apostles believed and taught Arianism, and yet the large corpus of the religion we call Christianity actually sabotaged the true faith.  Nevertheless, they now use the name and are identified under that title.  As their self definition is the Nicene Creed, which specifically prohibits Arianism, Arianism is now a heresy with respect to the Christian church -- simply meaning that the belief is not accepted within the mainstream of the religion known by the name &quot;Christianity.&quot;  The same is true for any set of ideas.  Messianic Jews claim to represent Judaism, but by Jewish standards (Orthodoxy) Messianic Judaism is a heresy -- meaning that it does NOT represent the group normally known as &quot;Judaism.&quot;  The word heresy doesn't mean you are wrong -- only that you are different from the group giving you that label.  If you don't CLAIM to be in that group, you may never get the label.  For instance, Hindus are not &quot;heretics&quot; by Christian standards for the simple reason that they don't CLAIM to be Christians.  They are simply a different religion.  Clarity and consistency in terms and definitions in their historical context are the reasons to make distinctions on Wikipedia, not truth and falsehood.  No doubt you do not consider the Roman Catholic church to be heretical.  But if you were a third century Pharisee you would.

The opening paragraph reads:
:'''Arianism''' is the heretical/heterodox teachings of the [[Christian]] [[heretic]] [[Arius]] (c. AD 250-336), who lived and taught in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], in the early 4th century. The most controversial of his teachings, considered contrary to the [[Nicene creed]] and [[heretical]] by the [[Council of Nicaea]], dealt with the relationship between [[God the Father#God the Father in Christianity|God the Father]] and the person of [[Jesus]], saying that Jesus was not one with the father, and that he was not fully, although almost, divine in nature. 

I have reverted the new edits in the first sentence so that there is not the repetition of heretic. However, some editors insist that it is the preferred language. I find the language clumsy and repetitive. I think the way it should read is:
:'''Arianism''' is the heterodox teachings of the [[Christian]] [[Arius]] (c. AD 250-336), who lived and taught in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], in the early 4th century. 

The fact we state it is a heterodox teaching already covers the topic of heretical. Heterodox is defined as being &quot;not in accordance with established or accepted doctrines or opinions, esp. in theology; unorthodox&quot;.[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/heterodox] I am not questioning the fact that the teaching was heretical, I am seeking for using better sentence structure. 

As an aside, Arius was to have been brought back into communion the day after he died. At the time of his death it would appear that his personal beliefs were in accordance with the church. To me this language is just exaggerated repetition. The language I have proposed states the same thing that is desired, but states it sensibly and without overkill. --[[User:Storm Rider|Storm Rider]] [[User talk:Storm Rider|&lt;sup&gt;(talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:25, 5 August 2008 (UTC)

==Origin section contentious==

This part: &quot;That doctrine that Arius wrote was the main theology of the first century Christians. Scriptures such as John 14:28 where Jesus says that the father is &quot;greater than I&quot; to John 17:20-26 where Jesus asks that the Apostles become &quot;one as we are one&quot; so that all of them including Jesus and God become one, thus demonstrating that the oneness refers to thought and will, and not a physical Trinity.&quot; is both a grammatical chaos and contentious.  It attempts to hoist Arianism onto 1st century christianity which is tantamount to saying &quot;the Bible supports Arianism&quot;.  It is true that the full blown Trinity is not there, and that the early years of Christianity were at least partly marked by subordinationism; but that is not the same as Arianism.

Indeed, the whole section is written from a pro-arian perspective. [[User:Grahbudd|Grahbudd]] ([[User talk:Grahbudd|talk]]) 06:27, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

==Crucifixion==
Perhaps the article could clarify the Arian view of the Crucifixion. Did they reject that the Crucifixion had happened, or was it merely that they did not view it as an act of redemption for the world, as the orthodox Christians do? The article suggests that Arianism, unlike Islam, did believe that there was a Crucifixion. I was under the impression that they did not.

== Heresy as a method of disqualifying the Enemy ==

Although I have read the whole Wikipedia on the Arianism issue, as well as other sources, I haven't read anywhere a clear analysis about the practicalities of the problem nor the relationship between the whole &quot;heretic&quot; issue and the political motivations.

Philosophically speaking, and having studied eastern and western mysticism and philosophy, it is most probably that Arianism is more accurate to the truth about Christ, Logos, God, etc. than the politically motivated &quot;official dogma&quot;.

The Church's Fathers and Doctors were, most probably, good men, but not sages. And many of their dogmas, if not reinterpretations of old doctrines, were mere convenient opinions: If Jesus is God, then the Church would have the monopoly on spirituality. And in a time where Religion is the official knowledge (in the same way that today's official epistemology is scientific) this would be a source of earthly power.

Why this specific issue doesn't arise on the study of heresies and dogmas?--[[User:Giordano1507|Giordano1507]] ([[User talk:Giordano1507|talk]]) 15:28, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

Is there any evidence to suggest that Arius advocated a personalist form of christology and an accompanied doctrine on freedom of conscience ?  According to Fr. [[John S. Romanides|Romanides]], Arius insisted that the Father is related to and generates the Son not by nature, but by will. Athanasius insisted that the Father is related to and generates the Son not by will, but by nature.

==References and [[WP:NFC]]==
I have removed from the footnotes several pages worth of material taken from [[Michael Pomazansky]], ''Orthodox Dogmatic Theology''. I haven't found any indication that the original (much less the foreign language translation) are public domain. We can't quote extensively from copyrighted texts even in footnotes--certainly not when that extensive quotations basically amounts to several pages worth of material. This is inconsistent with [[WP:NFC]]. If it can be verified that the original and the translation are both PD, please feel free to restore. Otherwise, it may be appropriate to paraphrase as long as the paraphrase doesn't follow too closely on the original. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:15, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

== Examples in Modern Culture ==

We need a section on modern examples of Arianism. Something like experts in a field that attempt to edit Wikipedia Articles and are accused of Vandalism and generally being East Geman. Also any attempt at humor on a users own talk page is another example of Arianism.[[Special:Contributions/66.236.143.130|66.236.143.130]] ([[User talk:66.236.143.130|talk]]) 16:47, 25 August 2009 (UTC)


== Arian and Nicene (Catholic) congregations?==
During the 400's and 500's were there distinct Arian and Nicene congregations in Constantinople, Ravenna and other places? If so, how did the congregational hierarchies work? [[Special:Contributions/118.208.238.98|118.208.238.98]] ([[User talk:118.208.238.98|talk]]) 02:39, 12 September 2009 (UTC)

==Remnants in the West, 5th-7th C.==
Present text suggests that Islam was a factor in the attrition of the sect. This is misleading, if not incorrect. Arianism, being a form of unitarianism, was closer to Islamic Christology. In fact, the attrition, if any, due to Islam is likely to be due to the adherents of the sect merging into Islam. If the preceding commentary is supported by existing mainstream scholorship, I would like to amend the section accordingly.

:I saw that too, and intended to make a note here. Instead I'm going to remove the subclause blaming Islam. If there had been Arianism left when they reached the Iberian peninsula, then the survival of Arianism would have been far longer than it really was, c.f. the pre-Calchedonian Syrian Orthodoxes and the (nowadays formerly) Nestorians in the Assyrian Church of the East.

:The real reason why Arianism finally &quot;failed&quot; in the West was that the Visigothic kings forcibly merged the Arian church with the Catholic church. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit.

== Arius' bishop's prayer ==

The claim that &quot;Arius' own bishop&quot; prayed for Arius' death was added on 23 Oct 2008. It seems to be an attempt to weaken the suggestion that Arius was poisoned while also insinuating that Arius' death was a divine act. I doubt a proper citation can ever be produced, and I suspect the statement should just be removed.[[User:TrippingTroubadour|TrippingTroubadour]] ([[User talk:TrippingTroubadour|talk]]) 19:26, 10 May 2011 (UTC)

Interesting enough to be dumped here:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 90%; background: white; border: 1px blue solid; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;

It was also one of the earliest apostasies away from the teachings of the Christ, and his apostles. While the so-called doctrine of &quot;Arianism&quot; was among the earliest Christian doctrines disputed by the early Catholic religion, it was only one of many that defy the teachings of the Bible.

It is said to be based on John 14:28 and Proverbs 8:22. That may be true of the position taken by Arius, but in fact other scriptures also support the doctrine. In particular, Colossians 1:15-16, where the Christ Jesus, &quot;the Son&quot;( of verse 13), is referred to as; &quot;He is the image of the invisible God, the &lt;I&gt;firstborn&lt;/I&gt; of all creation&quot;. Other scriptures that disprove the &quot;Trinity&quot; doctrine and support the more ancient teaching of a &quot;Unitarian&quot; God include Acts 7:55-56, Matthew 26:39, John 8:17-18, Revelation 3:14, Mark 13:32, Matthew 20:20-23, Matthew 12:31-32, 1 Corinthians 11:3, 15:27-28, John 17:1-3, 1 Corinthians 8:5-6, 1 Peter 1:3, and others.

A number of reference works also indicate that the so-called &quot;orthodox&quot; view is in error include &lt;I&gt;The New Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/I&gt;, which states:

:“The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century. But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma. Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.”—(1967), Vol. XIV, p. 299.

&lt;I&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana&lt;/I&gt; reads: “Christianity derived from Judaism and Judaism was strictly Unitarian [believing that God is one person]. The road which led from Jerusalem to Nicea was scarcely a straight one. Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on the contrary, a deviation from this teaching.”—(1956), Vol. XXVII, p. 294L. [See &lt;I&gt;Reasoning From the Scriptures&lt;/I&gt;, pp. 405-423.]

&lt;/div&gt;

There are a few troubles with the text: 
* the writing style is not [[WP:NPOV|neutral]],
* the text is somewhat valid and true, but it partially duplicates information already elsewhere in the text,

The possible benefits:
* the tertiary references, ''Catholic Encyclopedia, —(1967), Vol. XIV, p. 299'' and ''—(1956), Vol. XXVII, p. 294L. [See &lt;I&gt;Reasoning From the Scriptures&lt;/I&gt;, pp. 405-423.]'' can be salvaged for relevant passages already in the article,
* it {{blue|'''stresses'''}} the '''widely known secret''' that original Christianity was undefined regarding trinity, christology etc..

== Information box for &quot;Germanic Peoples&quot; at bottom of page ==

There is an information box for &quot;Germanic peoples&quot; located at the bottom of this page. Most likely this was placed here due to confusion with the &quot;Aryanism&quot; page.

== Who cares? ==


I would like to see some discussion of why it mattered whether the father and the son were of different substances, similar substances or identical substances.  It seems now (to me) that these arguments are academic or even semantic, but it must have seemed very important in the fourth century.  It may have been a matter of eclesiastical power politics, but I sense there must have been something more.

On the basis of no evidence I offer some speculations in the hope that someone with the appropriate scholarship can add a section that fleshes out what I consider the sterility of this contoversy:

1)  A personal connection with many gods and spirits is probably more satisfying than trying to connect to the one distant and authoritarian god of a monotheism.  A few intermediaries like Mary and Jesus, might help but it probably wouldn't matter how you conceived them provided they were your path to God.  On the other hand perhaps the heresies of those times were trying to work out just how near to man and how near to God these intermediaries needed to be.

2)  If salvation were as important then as it became in the middle ages, then ecclesiastical power would presumably be increased by convincing the people that there was only one correct path through a field of error leading to salvation.  Any theological distinction would be useful in that case and provide the grounds for appropriating the truth.[[User:RobLandau|RobLandau]] ([[User talk:RobLandau|talk]]) 17:28, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

== Mormonism ==

I know this has been discussed already, but the [[Latter-Day Saint]]s should be mentioned at least somewhere on this page. I don't know who it was that suggested that Mormons still believe in some kind of trinity or accept parts of the Nicene Creed, but we most definitely do not. We believe that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are three separate beings with a unity of purpose but a separation of substance. This may not be exactly what Arius taught but we are certainly closer to Arianism than we are to Nicene trinitarianism. I am not ashamed of this label because I personally have great respect for Arius—anyone who was persecuted by the Catholic Church for &quot;heresy&quot; is a hero in my book. --[[User:Antodav2007|Antodav2007]] ([[User talk:Antodav2007|talk]]) 04:43, 2 November 2011 (UTC)

::You are right! I looked into it also and it is as you say. When I came to this article it looked a little weird, went to comment section to see if anyone talked about it, and there you are! It indeed says &quot;O ΑΓΙΟΣ ΣΠΥΡΙΔΩΝ&quot;. Perhaps the information for the picture could have been changed to have it say that he was a great opponent of Arius (he debated against him during the ecumenical council) but it does not feel right to have that as the first picture. The icon of him debating Arius would have been more fitting, but I just left it all blank so the modern Arians would not go insane ;P (A JOKE!)[[Special:Contributions/75.73.114.111|75.73.114.111]] ([[User talk:75.73.114.111|talk]]) 10:31, 29 September 2012 (UTC)</text>
