=='''ALL RHYWUN GYFIETHU'R DUDALEN HON I GYMRAEG?'''==
Could someone translate this page into Welsh?

==Karaite section==
The section on Karaite Synagogues only has a picture. If it is not expanded with text, I suggest we remove the section, and just leave the picture interspersed with the others. I've marked it as &quot;expansion necessary.&quot; -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] 16:00, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
:I agree that there's no obvious need for this section. One could argue about whether Karaism has any place in this article at all. I genuinely don't know if it can still be considered a stream of Judaism, or if it is too 'heretical' because of its rejection of all of the Oral Torah. I'm removiing the section, until someone can both convince me that it has a place and that there is anything to say. [[User:Nomist|Nomist]] 01:31, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

Well, some people say although they removed the TORAH, it also means that they new a lot about it! In others they say they do not need. It me seem horrible to us.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.74.34.16|66.74.34.16]] ([[User talk:66.74.34.16|talk]]) 23:41, 20 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Etymology of &quot;Synagogue&quot;==

According to the Online Eymology Dictionary:
c.1175, from O.Fr. sinagoge (11c.), from L.L. synagoga &quot;congregation of Jews,&quot; from Gk. synagoge &quot;place of assembly, synagogue,&quot; lit. &quot;meeting, assembly,&quot; from synagein &quot;to gather, assemble,&quot; from syn- &quot;together&quot; + agein &quot;bring, lead.&quot; Used by Gk. translators of the Old Testament as a loan-translation of late Heb. keneseth &quot;assembly&quot; (cf. beth keneseth &quot;synagogue,&quot; lit. &quot;house of assembly.&quot;) [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=s&amp;p=53] [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]] | [[User_talk:Jayjg|&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:54, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)
: I love the Online Etymological Dictionary, but doesn't use diacritics. And it makes a difference. The LL synagoga should be syagōga, but no big deal, it usually wouldn't be written that way anyway - in the same way accents in Russian are only written for learners. But with the Greek it does make a difference. Whether ''y'' or ''u'' not so much, but since the ''o'' and ''e'' in this word are infact ω and η it should be transliterated ''synagōg&amp;#7703;'' and he Greek has an accent on the end I believe, like: συναγωγή. I guess if you don't have unicode it could be a problem, but other languages should be given the same consideration we give the French cedilla or German umlaut in my opinion - and unicode is the way of the future (I'm as crazy for Unicode as Wikipedia though!). Also, why is there no Hebrew, like בית כנסת? I suppose I'm in the linguistically fanatical minority of Wikipedia that believes in putting the original language in parenthesis whenever appropriate though!

==Masada==
I changed the text that read &quot;the small ruined synagogue at [[Masada]] is believed to be the world's oldest, and the only one known to date from the time of the [[Second Temple]].&quot;  This is untrue, as many synagogues have been found which predate the one at Masada, but that is the only one discussed by Josephus (to my knowledge) and so the best known.  I think thre were others at Herodium and Gamla which date from the second temple period, but I am not sure.  Also, is possible that those of Ostia, Dura Europus, and Stobi date from this period, but not certain.  [[User:The lesbian|The lesbian]] 21:30, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
==Esnoga==
the term Esnoga is mentioned in Zohar. From Hebrew &quot;Esh Nogah&quot; meaning &quot;fire of splendor&quot; (see Ezechiel) hence the term &quot;synagogue&quot;
[[Moshe 08:07 04 Nov 2005 ]]
:The Zohar uses &quot;esnoga&quot; because [[Moses de Leon]] spoke Spanish, and that was the Spanish word for a synagogue. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 04:36, 7 November 2003 (UTC)

==Altneu shul in Prague==
The name has no connection to &quot;oldnew&quot; In hebrew &quot;Al tneye&quot; means&quot;on condition&quot;. The synagogue was dedicated on condition, that it be a study-hall. So it will have less restrictions than a prayer-hall.[[Moshe 08:14 04 Nov 2005 ]]
:That's very inventive.  Nevertheless, Alt-nue means &quot;old-new&quot; in Yiddish, the vernacular of the Jews of Prague. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 04:37, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

I have actually heard of this version, but I think it does not need to be elaborated on ''this'' page but on the Altneushul's own page. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 08:12, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

:Only if it can be tied to a source. The Jewish community in Prague's version is that it was originally called the ''neu shul'' when it was built, and got the name ''altneu'' after a later synagogue opened. --[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] 18:31, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

==Divine Presence?==

The article says, &quot;According to tradition, the Divine Presence can be found wherever there is a minyan (a quorum of ten—in Orthodox Judaism, defined as ten Jewish men aged 13 or over).&quot; I'm not sure I like this wording, as it suggests the Divine Presence isn't there if there isn't a minyan. But the Mishnah Pirkei Avot 3:3[http://www.shechem.org/torah/avot.html#chap3] says &quot;But when two sit together and words of Torah pass between them, the Divine Presence rests.&quot; And the Divine Presence is often referred to as Makom, meaning Omnipresent. It's my understanding that minyan is required to recite certain prayers, but is not required for the Divine Presence to be found. The [[minyan]] article quotes Maimonides that the Divine Presence is more likely to listen to a prayer from a community, but doesn't say the Divine Presence isn't there if there is no minyan.

Does anyone know more about this than me? [[User:Ferret-aaron|Ferret-aaron]] 16:09, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

:It appears that when it comes to communal prayers, an ''edah'' (ceremonial group) is required. From textual inference, the Talmud defines an ''edah'' as consisting of &gt;=10 adult males. I don't think the Divine Presence is a prerequisite, but rather a result. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 02:25, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

::This isn't my point. The Shechinah (Divine Presence) is believed to be omnipresent, and as I pointed out in the quoted section of Pirkei Avot, the Shechinah is certainly thought to be present if only two people are together. The wording in the article &quot;the Divine Presence can be found&quot; suggests that this isn't the case- that The Shechinah is only present when a minyan gathers. This is a wrong inference, and Jews don't believe that the Shechinah is only present when a minyan gathers. Rather, they believe that God will be more inclined to hear a congregation's prayer if there is a minyan. [[User:Ferret-aaron|Ferret-aaron]] 19:35, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

== Where is the information about Synagogues? ==

I am leaving a complaint about &quot;oka is so smart&quot;, the whole article is gone and this sentence is left throughout the article instead. I came to learn about synagogues not to know that some oka is smart! Restore the article.

:This was a case of vandalism, which I fixed. --[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] 20:19, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::I'm not amused as I can still see the article with the words &quot;Oka is so smart&quot;.

:::I have refreshed the browser and the article came up. Excellent.

::::ok, I will be calling in here now and again to check on any form of vandalism. I hate vandalism and I don't find it funny. I shall be checking around.
:You can help by learning how to fix vandalism. Its really quite easy. Click on the history tab and then click on the previous version of the article. It will usually be intact. Then click edit this page.

==Definition of need for expansion==
I identify the areas in which this article needs expansion as:
*History: There is a significant amount missing between the Exile and the development of the [[kloiz]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. Consider history of [[Sephardic]] synagogues in [[Israel]], [[North Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[India]] as well.
*Function: This section is geared primarily to [[North America]]n synagogues. The whole article needs a more international, multi-cultural tone.
*Design: Only the development of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] temples is fleshed out. Again, information is missing from the period of time between the Exile and [[19th century]] [[Germany]]. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] 08:56, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:Agree to most of this. Please keep in mind, though, the distinction between Sephardi and Mizrahi. (There are very few Sephardi synagogues in India, for instance.) -- [[User:Olve|Olve]] 22:34, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

== A new synagogue and a new record holder? ==

I heard that a new synagogue was inaugurated, maybe in Costa Rica, which is presently the greatest synagogue of the world. It is an orthodox synagogue. I haven't found more data about it in Google. I wonder if anyone knows or can find more about it. [[User:Adam78|Adam78]] 02:50, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

Where do you get the information about Bevis Marks being the oldest continuously functioning synagogue in the world?  Amsterdam is older (or is the point that it did not function during the second world war?); and what about the synagogues in Venice? -- [[User:Sirmylesnagopaleentheda|Sir Myles na Gopaleen (the da)]] 14:09, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

== Edit ==

Reverted article from the vandalized version

== [[List of synagogues]] ==

How come there is no list, as there is a [[List of churches]] and [[List of mosques]]?  [[User:IP Address|IP Address]] 14:53, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

It seems to me that the section on the Budapest Synagogue, added on May 31, 2006 would be better off in a seperate article. The level of detail on this one synagogue does not belong in the general article.

== Formatting problem ==

The section &quot;Traditional and Orthodox synagogues&quot; has all its items bulleted, but I do not see the bullet for the first one of the list (the Ark). Is the picture interfering somehow? Is it just my browswer, or do others see this too? Please fix! Thanx --[[User:Keeves|Keeves]] 11:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
:Okay, I fixed that by moving the picture to the right side. --[[User:Keeves|Keeves]] 23:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

== Budapest Synagogue ==

I think the Budapest Synagogue section is long enough to get spun off as a separate article. Anyone agree or disagree? (Also, if we decide to do it, is there are way to keep its history intact, rather than just looking like a brand new article?) --[[User:Keeves|Keeves]] 23:35, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

Just what I thought, reading the article :) --[[User:Serinde|Serinde]] 15:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

== Messianic synagogues ==

A section on &quot;Messianic synagogues&quot; was added today. I'd love to delete it on the grounds that [[Messianic Judaism]] is not a form of Judaism but of Christianity, but it is clear from that article that their members would disagree. So here's my question: Has an official Wikipedia policy been formed on this? Have there been precendents set that we can cite? For example, has someone tried to add a section about Messianic practices to the [[Passover]] article? Can anyone offer suggestions? --[[User:Keeves|Keeves]] 01:53, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

: See [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] and [[Messianic Judaism#Jewish objections]]. Despite the name, &quot;Messianic Judaism is a Christian movement that began in the 1970s combining a mixture of Jewish ritual and Christianity.&quot; [http://www.messiahtruth.com/response.html]. ←[[User:Humus sapiens|Humus sapiens]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Humus sapiens|ну?]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks. I saw [[Messianic Judaism#Jewish objections]], but I felt that it is pretty much balanced out by  [[Messianic Judaism#Christian objections]], which says that they're ''not'' Christian. That simple solution is that they are neither Jewish nor Christian. Thanks also for the reference to [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]], which would strongly support the suggestion which I will now make: This information about Messianic synagogues should not appear in ''this'' article, but it can appear in its ''own'' article, ''and'' have a link from here to it. In other words, those who want this information to appear in Wikipedia are free to start a new article titled [[Messianic synagogues]], and then to come back to this article (which is about Jewish synagogues only) and add a link to it in the &quot;See Also&quot; section. --[[User:Keeves|Keeves]] 13:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:::The past 30 edits have consisted of nothing but the insertion and deletion of ''This listing does not include those synagogues of alternative movements in Judaism.'', with (as far as I can tell) absolutely no substantive eplanation of what the objection is to including it. To me, it sure sounds very similar to the suggestion I made above. I've been patiently sitting here on the sidelines watching the others go back and forth, and I really do not understand what is going on. I am tempted to edit the article myself, but I fear that whatever I do will get undone. Is anyone interested in a mature discussion of the pros and cons? --[[User:Keeves|Keeves]] 12:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

== The Controversy ==

I will re-list the Messianic Synogogues for the time being and attach a Note that says the validity of this section of the article being displayed is under debate, until we have it solved whether or not it belongs. Messianic Judaism is Torah-based religion and has a majority of ethnically Jewish practitioners, thus there is no reason to have it removed (at least, not without a conclusive debate). With over 200 synagogues, the movement is just too big to treat as if it were non-existant. Thank you.

Also, before my edits Reconstructionist Judaism synagogues only had one sentence! I expanded it to a paragraph, so hopefully that can even begin to give readers an idea.
:To the vast majority of Jews, &quot;Messianic Judaism is Torah-based religion&quot; the same way that Christianity and Islam are Torah-based religions. That is, they do place a certain amount of value in the Torah, but then they add and detract in such a manner as to make a new religion of it. How about this idea: At the top of the article, we'll have a disambiguate section: ''This article is about synagogues in mainstream Judaism. For synagogues in [[Messianic Judaism]], see [[Synagogue (Messianic)]].'' --[[User:Keeves|Keeves]] 13:24, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

::That will be relatively suffiecient if you add a disambiguate section saying that this article is about mainstream synogogues, thanks Keeves. And no, it isn't &quot;Torah-based as Christianity and Islam are&quot;. Chrsitianity explicitly denies Torah and Hebrew traditions as a relic of the past, and Islam is Quran-based (a book that states the Bible has been changed by men past recognition, despite the fact that the Torah codes and Dead Sea Scrolls completely show otherwise). Messianic Judaism, on the other hand, is majority ethnic Jewish, with most members: keeping Kosher, observing Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur, Chanukkah, and Rosh HaShannah, use the Talmud, and hold Torah readings mainly in Hebrew. How many Reform and Reconstructionist Jews can even say these things of themselves? Calling Messianic Judaism non-Judaism or Christianity isn't a satisfactory explanation for it; I consider it &quot;running for the hills&quot;.

Tell me why you reverse my edits before actually doing it, and that includes any other Joe as much as it includes PinchasC. That will let me AT LEAST know that that you know what I changed before removing it. Of course, you'll probably never respond to this message, because that may require actually changing your mind about something.

When and if an article on Messianic synagogues is created, the edit Keeves suggested up should suffice.  To expand on what Humus mentioned, there's no reason we would put a statement like &quot;the list below doesn't include Baptist Churches&quot; either.  And you threw in Jewish Renewal, but since it's more of a movement that isn't even always separate from the mainline denominations it doesn't make sense to say &quot;the synagogues below don't include Jewish Renewal&quot;. --[[User:MPerel|&lt;font color=&quot;#330000&quot;&gt;M&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#334400&quot;&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#338800&quot;&gt;er&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#33cc00&quot;&gt;el &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;( [[user_talk:MPerel|&lt;font color=&quot;#11bb00&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]] | [[Special:contributions/MPerel|&lt;font color=&quot;3399FF&quot;&gt;contrib&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 01:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

== Synagogue/Συναγωγή ==

Since [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is an ancient language, I'm guessing as old as if not older than [[Greek language|Greek]], why use a greek word and not a hebrew one? I've always wondered that and was hoping to find a paragraph in this article explaining how a greek word was adopted. Does it have anything to do with the large population of Jews in Alexandria where Greek was the predominant language?  --[[User:Kimonandreou|Kimonandreou]] 13:42, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
: I think that quite possibly synagogues may have developed initially to a significant extent among Greek-speaking Jews, of whom there were enough even in Jerusalem that the inscription of the synagogue in Jerusalem that (very likely) predates the destruction of the second temple is in Greek. All of the oldest written references to synagogues are in Greek. However, I have not found any explanation regarding why this might be the case this in reliable (scholarly) sources, so I think your question cannot be answered in the Wikipedia article.

I am questioning [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synagogue&amp;diff=94332576&amp;oldid=94332369 this blanking]. The edit summary says: &quot;Wikipedia is not an image gallery with no text to accompany them; upload your pictures to Wikimedia Commons)&quot;. Why was this done without any discussion?

== &quot;Habura&quot;? ==

On what grounds is חבורה transliterated ''chabura'' instead of ''chavura''? I've never heard the former pronunciation, nor can I think of any grammatical justification for it. [[User:Flourdustedhazzn|Flourdustedhazzn]] 18:54, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
:Egyptian Jews as well as a few other communities don't differentiate between beth and veth.  It's possible that it was transliterated by someone from such a tradition...or it's possible that it was transliterated by someone who is insufficiently familiar with spoken Hebrew to have realized their mistake.

== Synagogue is not  a replica of the Temple ==

I have replaced this section. 
:[[Orthodox Judaism]] has considered synagogue construction over the last two thousand years as following the outlines of the original [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]], which was also the outline for the temples in Jerusalem.
Synagogues are not replicas of the temple or tabernacle. There is no source for this and it does not happen in practice. It is a myth. [[User:85.64.200.41|85.64.200.41]] 05:59, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

== Any spanish synagogue? ==
Why there is not in the article any spanish synagogue? Samuel ha Levi's synagogue was built in 1356; synagogue of Santa María la Blanca was built in 1180 and modified in XIII century; Cordoba's synagogue was built in 1315.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/89.128.20.23|89.128.20.23]] ([[User talk:89.128.20.23|talk]]) 07:16, 27 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Description of &quot;minyan&quot; in the lead==

The lead describes a minyan as simply &quot;ten jews&quot;.  I know the subtleties are covered in the article for minyan, but based on what I read there, is this a case of oversimplifying something to the point where it's a bit misleading?  How about something like:

&quot;Jewish worshop can take place anywhere, although a 'minyan' of ten Jews (traditionally but not always adult men) is required for some rituals.&quot;

Not a big change, but maybe the extra words convey both the subtlety and the fact that there isn't consensus between different schools?  Your call. [[User:Señor Service|Señor Service]] ([[User talk:Señor Service|talk]]) 20:21, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

== Plum Street Temple ==

Perhaps the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati would be a good addition to the Reform Synagogue section. It is both a very historical and beautiful Synagogue.

==Perennial issues==
I just did a major clean-up of the page, which suffers from the impulse to clutter usually caused by those adding true but trial=vial facts, or disquisitions on some aspect of synagogue life such as detailed explications of customs of chasidim, reform, Sephardim, etc. , or material about theology, development of the reform movement, etc., which would be better added to articles on specific topics that can be linked here.  

*I also tried to select photos that will show the antiquity of the synagogue, the range of synagogue styles, and the way the interior of the synagogue looks to those who are unfamiliar.   What wikipedia really needs are many good photo os synagogues added to articles such as [[Bimah]] and to articles on individual synagogues or to [[Jewish ceremonial art]], or to particular styles of synagogue art and architecture.  We could use, for example, articles on [[Synagogue wall paintings]], [[Synagogue menorahs]]. And on the synagogues of particular styles or regions in the manner of the article on [[Wooden synagogues]].  Not everything we know about synagogues needs to find a spot on this page.

This may seem a bit trivial, but if the Delos Synagogue is a Samaritan one surely it should not be listed in the list of 'oldest synagogues' as Samritanism is clearly not Judaism - just as Messianic Judaism isn't Judaism, but it is a related religion sharing many features.--[[User:Grammarbishop8|Grammarbishop8]] ([[User talk:Grammarbishop8|talk]]) 12:31, 23 July 2012 (UTC)

==Synagogue, Hekhal, D'bhir==
I erased the following from the lead: [Synagogues have a large hall for prayer (the main sanctuary)] &quot;called &quot;Hekhal&quot; from which is derived the term 'Hykala'. Beyond this is the D'bhir  or ''holy of holies'' (from which is derived the term &quot;M'dbha&quot;)&quot; attributed to Stinespring W. F. (1962) 'Temple, Jerusalem' in 'The interpreters Dictionary of the Bible' vol 4 p 536. For one, this distinction is unclear. It seems to claim these are two separate rooms, which they are not. Actually the sanctuary has an Ark which is a sort of cabinet, not a room. Second, this sentence was unsuited to the lead (what is a Hykala or a M'dbha?).Third, the body of the article (-&gt;Interior Elements) was much better and more accurate on this point and quite sufficient.
