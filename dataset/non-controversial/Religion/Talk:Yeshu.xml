== Does the Rambam (Maimonides) belong here? ==

Does the Rambam at the end of Judges:Kings chapter 11 (uncensored) belong here? True, he says Yehua and clearly refers to the NT Jesus, but he says, &quot;he was killed in Bet Din&quot;. Wouldn't that indicate that he was referring to the Talmudic version, as the notes in the Shabsai Frankel critical edition indicate? Or would one need more proof?[[User:Mzk1|Mzk1]] ([[User talk:Mzk1|talk]]) 21:09, 22 October 2011 (UTC)

:His opinion, whatever it was, would indicate this is NOT Jesus because  Christian scripture (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John ALL) say that Bet Din did not kill Jesus.  That is why this article should contrast what Christian scripture says about Jesus next to every item suggesting that there is a reference in Talmud to Jesus.  Both scriptures need equal time, for one thing, and for another, it would show that they say different things about the character under discussion.  It's not possible to assume that people interested in this topic have a copy of Christian scripture around.

== Oh, please ==

The term &quot;Yeshu&quot; is still used as a pejorative and slander against Jesus. Everybody knows these references in the Talmud are about him. Give me a break.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.201.173.75|69.201.173.75]] ([[User talk:69.201.173.75|talk]]) 06:11, 25 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Even though one reference is 100 years too early, and another appears to be too late? Your unbacked assertion proves something?[[User:Mzk1|Mzk1]] ([[User talk:Mzk1|talk]]) 05:13, 1 November 2011 (UTC)

:Agree.  &quot;Everybody knows&quot; means the commentor has a very limited range of knowledge and no contact with the people familiar with Talmud who reject this conclusion for good reason.

== Meaning of Pandera and Lack of Hebrew/Aramaic Original Text Quotations ==

I am curious if the Editors have read the original texts quoted in the Talmud?  I'm sure I could grab a copy, but that the Aramaic is not present in the article seems to be a glaring omission.  Afterall, a translation is already an intepretation.  Also, if Pandera is spelled פנדרה/פנדרא or similar, perhaps its a suggestion to Pandora?  Its uncommon for someone to be referred to as son/daughter or a female, but here the meaning would be loaded... if there is any basis for that interpretation... [[User:LFevas|LFevas]] ([[User talk:LFevas|talk]]) 22:08, 12 January 2012 (UTC)
:: Relating Pandera to Pandora requires a showing that the people referring to Pandera have a familiarity with Greek mythology.  Greek was prohibited reading among Jews for some time, which Talmud records.  It would require a showing why people concerned with Jewish law, history and culture would bother to refer to a particular character from Greek mythology.

== Yeshu ha Notsri section  misleading ==

This should not be a separate section.  It should be in the later section that discusses the various terms.
