{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|history}}

'''[[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]] and [[Judah]]''' were related [[Archaeology of Israel#Iron Age/Israelite period|Iron Age]] kingdoms of the ancient [[History of the Levant|Levante]]. The [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] emerged as an important local power by the 9th century BCE before falling to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE. Israel's southern neighbor, the [[Kingdom of Judah]], emerged in the 8th century&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe 2008, pp. 225–6&quot;&gt;Grabbe 2008, pp. 225–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and enjoyed a period of prosperity as a [[client-state]] of first Assyria and then [[Babylon]] before a revolt against the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] led to its destruction in 586&amp;nbsp;BCE. Following the fall of Babylon to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king [[Cyrus the Great]], 539&amp;nbsp;BCE, some Judean exiles returned to Jerusalem, inaugurating the formative period in the development of a distinctive Judahite identity in the Persian province of [[Yehud Medinata|Yehud]]. Yehud was absorbed into the subsequent Hellenistic kingdoms that followed the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], but in the 2nd century BCE the Judaeans revolted against the Hellenist [[Seleucid Empire]] and created the [[Hasmonean]] kingdom. This, the last nominally independent [[Judea]]n kingdom, came to an end in 63&amp;nbsp;BCE with its conquest by [[Roman Republic|Rome]].

==Sources==
The sources for the history of ancient Israel and Judah can be broadly divided into the biblical narrative (the Hebrew [[Bible]], [[Deuterocanonical]] and non-biblical works for the [[Intertestamental period|later period]]) and the archaeological record. The latter can again be divided between [[epigraphy]] (written inscriptions, both from Israel and other lands including Mesopotamia and Egypt) and the material record (everything else).

===The biblical narrative===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains &quot;sagas, heroic epics, oral traditions, annals, biographies, narrative histories, novellae, ''belles lettres'', proverbs and wisdom-sayings, poetry, prophecy, apocalyptic, and much more ... the whole finally woven into a composite, highly complex literary fabric sometime in the Hellenistic era.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dever 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The archaeological record===

By the 1920s, the idea of an Israelite conquest of [[Canaan]] - the story of the [[book of Joshua]] - was not supported by the archaeological record. The response of the time was to propose that the main biblical idea was still correct, but that the [[Israelites]] entered Canaan peacefully instead of through conquest. Later, this compromise was abandoned, and the Israelites were interpreted to be indigenous Canaanites. The revision of Israelite origins has implications for Israelite religion: whereas the Bible had depicted them as monotheists from the beginning, the new understanding is that they were polytheists who harboured a small and ultimately successful group of monotheistic revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Rendsberg, pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The new understanding, even if it recognised the Israelites as Canaanites by origin, still treated the post-Conquest biblical story as real history. But eventually this came under challenge. The most radical reconstruction states that the Jews originated as a &quot;mixed multitude&quot; of settlers sent to Jerusalem by the Persians, where they concocted a past for themselves. There are few scholars who believe this, but it demonstrates how the paradigm has shifted.&lt;ref&gt;Rendsberg, pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating of remains to the biblical history is made difficult by the Bible's lack of datable events and its unreliable [[Chronology of the Bible|internal chronology]]; the interpretation of remains has been influenced by religious and nationalistic arguments, as evidenced by arguments over burials from the highland settlement phase; and no material remains have been found which can reliably separate Israelite from non-Israelite (Canaanite) sites in the earliest period.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch-Smith, pp.27,29,30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Bronze Age Background (1600&amp;nbsp;BCE - 1200&amp;nbsp;BCE)==
[[File:Baal Ugarit Louvre AO17330.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Canaanite god Ba'al, 14th–12th century BCE ([[Louvre]] museum, Paris)]]
The [[eastern Mediterranean]] seaboard – the [[Levant]] – stretches 400 miles north to south from the [[Taurus Mountains]] to the [[Sinai desert]], and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the [[Arabian desert]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal plain of the southern Levant, broad in the south and narrowing to the north, is backed in its southernmost portion by a zone of foothills, the Shephelah; like the plain this narrows as it goes northwards, ending in the promontory of Mount Carmel. East of the plain and the Shephelah is a mountainous ridge, the &quot;hill country of Judah&quot; in the south, the &quot;hill country of Ephraim&quot; north of that, then Galilee and the Lebanon mountains. To the east again lie the steep-sided valley occupied by the [[Jordan River]], the [[Dead Sea]], and the wadi of the Arabah, which continues down to the eastern arm of the Red Sea. Beyond the plateau is the Syrian desert, separating the Levant from Mesopotamia. To the southwest is Egypt, to the northeast Mesopotamia. &quot;The Levant thus constitutes a narrow corridor whose geographical setting made it a constant area of contention between more powerful entities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 1998, pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canaan]] in the Late Bronze Age was a shadow of what it had been centuries earlier: many cities were abandoned, others shrank in size, and the total settled population was probably not much more than a hundred thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein 2001, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement was concentrated in cities along the coastal plain and along major communication routes; the central and northern hill country which would later become the biblical kingdom of Israel was only sparsely inhabited&lt;ref name=killebrew38&gt;Killebrew 2005, pp. 38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; although letters from the Egyptian archives indicate that [[Jerusalem]] was already a Canaanite city-state recognising Egyptian overlordship.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill in Vaughn 1992, pp. 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Politically and culturally it was dominated by Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Kuhrt 1995, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; each city under its own ruler, constantly at odds with its neighbours, and appealing to the Egyptians to adjudicate their differences.&lt;ref name=killebrew38/&gt;

The Canaanite city-state system [[Bronze Age collapse|broke down at the end of the Late Bronze period]],&lt;ref&gt;Killebrew 2005, pp. 10–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and Canaanite culture was then gradually absorbed into that of the Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Golden 2004b, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The process was gradual rather than swift:&lt;ref name=mcnutt47&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; a strong Egyptian presence continued into the 12th century BCE, and, while some Canaanite cities were destroyed, others continued to exist in Iron I.&lt;ref&gt;Golden 2004a, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron Age I (1200&amp;nbsp;BCE - 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE)==
[[Image:Merneptah Israel Stele Cairo.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Merneptah stele]] (JE 31408), bearing the first record of the name Israel ([[Cairo Museum]])]]

The name Israel first appears in the [[Merneptah stele|stele]] of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Merneptah]] c. 1209&amp;nbsp;BCE, &quot;Israel is laid waste and his seed is no more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stager in Coogan 1998, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;Israel&quot; was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands, well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their [[hegemony]], but an ethnic group rather than an organised state;&lt;ref&gt;Dever 2003, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Paula McNutt says: &quot;It is probably ... during Iron Age I [that] a population began to identify itself as 'Israelite',&quot; differentiating itself from its neighbours via prohibitions on [[cultural exogamy|intermarriage]], an emphasis on [[family history]] and [[genealogy]], and religion.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt 1999, pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Late Bronze Age there were no more than about 25 villages in the highlands, but this increased to over 300 by the end of Iron I, while the settled population doubled from 20,000 to 40,000.&lt;ref name=mcnutt70&gt;McNutt 1999, pp.46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The villages were more numerous and larger in the north, and probably shared the highlands with [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] [[nomad]]s who left no remains.&lt;ref name=mcnutt69&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists and historians attempting to trace the origins of these villagers have found it impossible to identify any distinctive features that could define them as specifically Israelite – [[pithos|collared-rim jars]] and four-room houses have been identified outside the highlands and thus cannot be used to distinguish Israelite sites,&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and while the pottery of the highland villages is far more limited than that of lowland Canaanite sites, it develops typologically out of Canaanite pottery that came before.&lt;ref name=killebrew13&gt;Killebrew 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Finkelstein]] proposed that the oval or circular layout that distinguishes some of the earliest highland sites, and the notable absence of pig bones from hill sites, could be taken as a marker of ethnicity, but others have cautioned that these can be a &quot;common-sense&quot; adaptation to highland life and not necessarily revelatory of origins.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman in Brett 2002, p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Aramaean sites also demonstrate a contemporary absence of pig remains at that time, unlike earlier Canaanite and later Philistine excavations.  Modern scholars therefore see Israel arising peacefully and internally in the highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Gnuse 1997, pp.28,31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron Age II (1000&amp;nbsp;BCE - 550&amp;nbsp;BCE)==
[[Image:A reconstructed israelite house, Monarchy period3.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Israelite house, 10th–7th century BCE. [[Eretz Israel Museum]], Tel Aviv.]]
Unusually favourable climatic conditions in the first two centuries of Iron Age II brought about an expansion of population, settlements and trade throughout the region.&lt;ref name=thompson408&gt;Thompson 1992, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; In the central highlands this resulted in unification in a kingdom with the [[Samaria (ancient city)|city of Samaria]] as its capital,&lt;ref name=thompson408/&gt; possibly by the second half of the 10th century BCE when an inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Shoshenq I]], the biblical [[Shishak]], records a series of campaigns directed at the area.&lt;ref name=mazar163&gt;Mazar in Finkelstein 2007, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel had clearly emerged by the middle of the 9th century BCE, when the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] names &quot;[[Ahab]] the Israelite&quot; among his enemies at the [[battle of Qarqar]] (853). At this time Israel was apparently engaged in a three-way contest with Damascus and Tyre for control of the [[Jezreel Valley]] and Galilee in the north, and with [[Moab]], [[Ammon]] and [[Damascus]] in the east for control of [[Gilead]];&lt;ref name=thompson408/&gt; the [[Mesha stele]] (c. 830), left by a king of Moab, celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the &quot;House of [[Omri]]&quot; (i.e. Israel).  It bears what is generally thought to be the earliest extra-biblical [[Semitic]] reference to the [[Yahweh (name)|name ''Yahweh'']] ([[YHWH]]), whose temple goods were plundered by Mesha and brought before his own god [[Kemosh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Moab#The_Mesha_stele |title=Moab |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
French scholar [[André Lemaire]] has reconstructed a portion of line 31 of the [[stele]] as mentioning the &quot;House of [[David]]&quot;.,&lt;ref name=&quot;mazar163&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biblical Archaeology Review'' [May/June 1994], pp. 30–37&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tel Dan]] stele (c. 841) tells of the death of a king of Israel, probably [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], at the hands of a king of [[Aram Damascus]].&lt;ref name=mazar163/&gt; A century later it came into increasing conflict with the expanding [[neo-Assyrian empire]], which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (722). Both the biblical and Assyrian sources speak of a massive deportation of people from Israel and their replacement with settlers from other parts of the empire – such population exchanges were an established part of Assyrian imperial policy, a means of breaking the old power structure - and the former Israel never again became an independent political entity.&lt;ref&gt;Lemche 1998, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judah emerged somewhat later than Israel, probably during the 9th century BCE, but the subject is one of considerable controversy and there is no definite answer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe 2008, pp. 225–6&quot;/&gt; Surface surveys indicate that during the 10th and 9th centuries BCE the southern highlands had been divided between a number of centres, none with clear primacy,.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman in Vaughn 1992, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Hezekiah]], between c. 715 and 686&amp;nbsp;BCE, a notable increase in the power of the [[Judean]] state can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Carr, Writing on the Tablet of the Heart: Origins of Scripture and Literature, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected by archaeological sites and  findings such as the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]], defensive city wall in [[Jerusalem]], [[Hezekiah's Tunnel]], an aqueduct designed to provide Jerusalem with water during an impending siege by the [[Assyrians]], led by [[Sennacherib]]. [[Siloam Inscription]], lintel inscription, found over the doorway of a tomb, has been ascribed to his comptroller [[Shebna]]. [[LMLK seals]] on storage jar handles, excavated from strata formed by Sennacherib's destruction as well as immediately above that layer suggesting they were used throughout his 29-year reign, and [[Bulla (seal)|Bulla]]e from sealed documents, some that belonged to Hezekiah himself, while others name his servants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmlk.com/research/lmlk_ahoh.htm Seal of Amariah Hananiah--Servant of Hezekiah]&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Ahaz's Seal]] which is a piece of reddish-brown clay that belonged to King [[Ahaz]] of Judah, who ruled from 732 to 716&amp;nbsp;BCE. The seal contains not only the name of the king, but the name of his father, King [[Jotham of Judah|Yehotam]]. In addition, Ahaz is specifically identified as &quot;king of Judah.&quot; The [[Hebrew]] inscription, which is set on three lines, reads as follows: &quot;l'hz*y/hwtm*mlk*/yhdh&quot;, which translates as &quot;belonging to Ahaz (son of) Yehotam, King of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological-center.com/en/monographs/m1 First Impression: What We Learn from King Ahaz’s Seal (#m1)], by Robert Deutsch, Archaeological Center&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 7th century Jerusalem grew to contain a population many times greater than before and achieved clear dominance over its neighbours.&lt;ref name=thompson410&gt;Thompson 1992, pp. 410–1.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred at the same time that Israel was being destroyed by Assyria, and was probably the result of a cooperative arrangement with the Assyrians to establish Judah as an Assyrian vassal controlling the valuable olive industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;thompson410&quot;/&gt; Judah prospered as an Assyrian vassal state, despite a disastrous rebellion against [[Sennacherib]]), but in the last half of the 7th century BCE Assyria suddenly collapsed, and the ensuing competition between the Egyptian and [[Neo-Babylonian empire]]s for control of Palestine led to the destruction of Judah in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582.&lt;ref name=thompson410/&gt;

==Babylonian period==
[[File:Fotothek df ps 0002470 Innenräume ^ Ausstellungsgebäude.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]]]]
Babylonian Judah suffered a steep decline in both economy and population&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe 2004, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and lost the Negev, the Shephelah, and part of the Judean hill country, including Hebron, to encroachments from Edom and other neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Lemaire in Blenkinsopp 2003, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem, while probably not totally abandoned, was much smaller than previously, and the town of [[Mizpah in Benjamin]] in the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom became the capital of the new Babylonian province of [[Yehud Medinata]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (This was standard Babylonian practice: when the Philistine city of [[Ashkalon]] was conquered in 604, the political, religious and economic elite (but not the bulk of the population) was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location).&lt;ref&gt;Lipschits 2005, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong probability that for most or all of the period the temple at [[Bethel]] in Benjamin replaced that at Jerusalem, boosting the prestige of Bethel's priests (the Aaronites) against those of Jerusalem (the Zadokites), now in exile in Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsopp in Blenkinsopp 2003, pp. 103–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babylonian conquest entailed not just the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, but the liquidation of the entire infrastructure which had sustained Judah for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsopp 2009, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant casualty was the state ideology of &quot;Zion theology,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas 2005, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that  the god of Israel had chosen Jerusalem for his dwelling-place and that the [[Davidic dynasty]] would reign there forever.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the city and the end of Davidic kingship forced the leaders of the exile community – kings, priests, scribes and prophets – to reformulate the concepts of community, faith and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas 2005, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The exile community in Babylon thus became the source of significant portions of the Hebrew Bible: [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 40–55, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], the final version of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], the work of the [[Priestly source]] in the Pentateuch, and the final form of the history of Israel from [[Deuteronomy]] to [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]]&lt;ref name=middlemas10&gt;Middlemas 2005, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically, they were responsible for the doctrines of individual responsibility and universalism (the concept that one god controls the entire world), and for the increased emphasis on purity and holiness.&lt;ref name=middlemas10/&gt; Most significantly, the trauma of the exile experience led to the development of a strong sense of identity as a people distinct from other peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased emphasis on symbols such as circumcision and Sabbath-observance to maintain that separation.&lt;ref&gt;Bedford 2001, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration of the biblical literature on the experience of the exiles in Babylon disguises the fact that the great majority of the population remained in Judah, and for them life after the fall of Jerusalem probably went on much as it had before.&lt;ref&gt;Barstad 2008, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It may even have improved, as they were rewarded with the land and property of the deportees, much to the anger of the exile community in Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Albertz 2003a, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination of the Babylonian governor around 582 by a disaffected member of the former royal house of David provoked a Babylonian crackdown, possibly reflected in the [[Book of Lamentations]], but the situation seems to have soon stabilised again.&lt;ref&gt;Albertz 2003a, pp. 95–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the unwalled cities and towns that remained were subject to slave raids by the Phoenicians and intervention in their internal affairs from [[Samaritan]]s, Arabs and Ammonites.&lt;ref&gt;Albertz 2003a, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian period==
{{main|Yehud Medinata}}

When Babylon fell to the Persian [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539&amp;nbsp;BCE, Judah (or [[Yehud medinata]], the &quot;province of Yehud&quot;) became an administrative division within the [[Achaemenid empire|Persian empire]]. Cyrus was succeeded as king by [[Cambyses]], who added Egypt to the empire, incidentally transforming Yehud and the Philistine plain into an important frontier zone. His death in 522 was followed by a period of turmoil until [[Darius the Great]] seized the throne in about 521. Darius introduced a reform of the administrative arrangements of the empire including the collection, codification and administration of local law codes, and it is reasonable to suppose that this policy lay behind the redaction of the Jewish [[Torah]].&lt;ref name=blenkinsopp64&gt;Blenkinsopp 1988, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; After 404 the Persians lost control of Egypt, which became Persia's main rival outside Europe, causing the Persian authorities to tighten their administrative control over Yehud and the rest of the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;Lipschits in Lipschits 2006, pp. 86–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was eventually reconquered, but soon afterward Persia fell to [[Alexander the Great]], ushering in the Hellenistic period in the Levant.

Yehud's population over the entire period was probably never more than about 30,000, and that of Jerusalem no more than about 1,500, most of them connected in some way to the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe 2004, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biblical history, one of the first acts of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], the Persian conqueror of Babylon, was to commission the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple, a task which they are said to have completed c. 515.&lt;ref&gt;Nodet 1999, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was probably only in the middle of the next century, at the earliest, that Jerusalem again became the capital of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Davies in Amit 2006, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians may have experimented initially with ruling Yehud as a Dividic client-kingdom under descendants of [[Jehoiachin]],&lt;ref&gt;Niehr in Becking 1999, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the mid–5th century BCE Yehud had become in practice a theocracy, ruled by hereditary High Priests&lt;ref&gt;Wylen 1996, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Persian-appointed governor, frequently Jewish, charged with keeping order and seeing that tribute was paid.&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe 2004, pp. 154–5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biblical history [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] arrived in Jerusalem in the middle of the 5th century BCE, the first empowered by the Persian king to enforce the Torah, the second with the status of governor and a royal mission to restore the walls of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Soggin 1998, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The biblical history mentions tension between the returnees and those who had remained in Yehud, the former rebuffing the attempt of the &quot;peoples of the land&quot; to participate in the rebuilding of the Temple; this attitude was based partly on the exclusivism which the exiles had developed while in Babylon and, probably, partly on disputes over property.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; The careers of [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] in the 5th century BCE were thus a kind of religious colonisation in reverse, an attempt by one of the many Jewish factions in Babylon to create a self-segregated, ritually pure society inspired by the prophesies of [[Ezekiel]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsopp 2009, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian era, and especially the period 538–400, laid the foundations of later Jewish and Christian religion and the beginnings of a scriptural canon.&lt;ref&gt;Albertz 1994, pp. 437–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important landmarks include the replacement of Hebrew by Aramaic as the everyday language of Judah (although it continued to be used for religious and literary purposes),&lt;ref&gt;Kottsieper in Lipschits 2006, pp. 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and Darius's reform of the administrative arrangements of the empire, which may lie behind the redaction of the Jewish [[Torah]].&lt;ref name=blenkinsopp64/&gt; The Israel of the Persian period included descendants of the inhabitants of the old kingdom of Judah, returnees from the Babylonian exile community, Mesopotamians who had joined them or had been exiled themselves to Samaria at a far earlier period, Samaritans and others.&lt;ref&gt;Becking in Albertz 2003b, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenistic period==
[[File:Hasmoneese rijk.PNG|thumb|150px|The [[Hasmonean]] kingdom at its largest extent]]

On the death of [[Alexander the Great]] (322) his generals divided the empire between them. [[Ptolemy I]], the ruler of Egypt, seized [[Palestine]], but his successors lost it to the [[Seleucids]] of Syria in 198. At first relations between the Seleucids and the Jews were cordial, but the attempt of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (174–163) to impose Hellenic culture sparked a national rebellion, which ended in the expulsion of the Syrians and the establishment of an independent Jewish kingdom under the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty. Some modern commentators see this period as a civil war between hellenized and orthodox Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2005/12/the_maccabees_and_the_hellenists.html |title=Hanukkah as Jewish civil war - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/the_revolt_of_the_maccabees/ |title=The Revolt of the Maccabees |publisher=Simpletoremember.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hasmonean kingdom was a conscious attempt to revive the Judah described in the Bible: a Jewish monarchy ruled from Jerusalem and stretching over all the territories once ruled by David and Solomon. In order to carry out this project the [[Hasmonean]]s  forcibly converted to Judaism the one-time Moabites, Edomites and Ammonites, as well as the lost kingdom of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1992, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that a &quot;[[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Jewish biblical canon]]&quot; was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies in ''The Canon Debate'', page 50: &quot;With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63&amp;nbsp;BCE the Roman general [[Pompey]] conquered Jerusalem and made the Jewish kingdom a [[Client state|client]] of Rome. In 40–39, [[Herod the Great]] was appointed [[Herodian Dynasty|King of the Jews]] by the [[Roman Senate]], and in 6&amp;nbsp;CE the last [[ethnarch]] of Judea was deposed by the emperor [[Augustus]] and his territories were combined with [[Idumea]] and [[Samaria]] and annexed as [[Iudaea Province]] under direct [[Roman empire|Roman]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson 1976, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Judea (Iudaea) was removed after the revolt of [[Simon Bar Kochba]] in 135&amp;nbsp;CE, after which the area was called [[Syria Palaestina]], (Greek: Παλαιστίνη, Palaistinē; Latin: Palaestina.)

==Religion==

===Iron Age Yahwism===
The development of Israelite monotheism was a gradual process which began with the normal beliefs and practices of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Gnuse 1997, pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of the Israelites of Iron Age I, like the Canaanite faith from which it evolved&lt;ref&gt;Tubbs, Jonathan (2006)&quot;The Canaanites&quot; (BBC Books)&lt;/ref&gt; and many other Ancient Near Eastern religions, was based on the cult of the ancestors and the worship of family gods (the &quot;gods of the fathers&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn 1996, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The major deities were not numerous – El, [[Asherah]], and Yahweh, with [[Baal]] as a fourth god, and perhaps Shamash (the sun) in the early period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2002, p. 57&quot;&gt;Smith 2002, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early monarchy El and Yahweh had become unified and Asherah did not continue as a separate state cult,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2002, p. 57&quot;/&gt; although she continued to be popular at a community level until Persian times.&lt;ref&gt;Dever (2005), p.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]], later the [[national god]] of both Israel and Judah seems to have originated in [[Edom]] and [[Midian]] in southern Canaan, and may have been brought north to Israel by the [[Kenites]] and [[Midianites]] at an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn 1999, p. 911–3.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the emergence of monarchy at the beginning of Iron Age II the king promoted his own family god, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]], as the god of the kingdom, but beyond the royal court religion continued to be both polytheistic and family-centered, as it was also for other societies in the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn 1996, p. 181–2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a general consensus among scholars that the first formative event in the emergence of the distinctive religion described in the Bible was triggered by the destruction of Israel by Assyria in c.722&amp;nbsp;BCE. Refugees came south to Judah, bringing with them laws and a Prophetic tradition that Yahweh was the only god who should be served. These beliefs were adopted by the &quot;people of the land&quot;, meaning the landed families who provided the administrative class of the kingdom, and in 640&amp;nbsp;BCE these circles were decisive in placing on the throne the eight-year-old [[Josiah]]. Judah at this time was a vassal of Assyria, but Assyrian power collapsed in the 630s, and in around 622 Josiah and the [[Deuteronomist]]s, as the circle around him are called by modern scholars, launched a bid for independence expressed as loyalty to &quot;Yahweh alone&quot; and the law-code in the book of [[Deuteronomy]], written in the form of a treaty between Judah and Yahweh to replace the vassal-treaty with Assyria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn and Rogerson, pp.153–154&quot;&gt;Dunn and Rogerson, pp.153–154&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest [[Israelite]] inscription found, relating to Yahveh as the redeemer of Jerusalem, dates to 7th century BCE. [[Khirbet Beit Lei|Beit Lehi]] also contains the oldest known [[Hebrew]] writing of the word “Jerusalem”  It's written as the inscription   “I am [[YHWH]] thy Lord. I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem” and “Absolve us oh merciful God. Absolve us oh YHWH.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beitlehifoundation.org/history/ |title=Site History |publisher=Beit Lehi Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the theology of the Deuteronomists the terms of the treaty with Yahweh were that he would preserve both the city and the king in return for their worship and obedience to the law-code. The destruction of Jerusalem, the Temple, and the Davidic dynasty by Babylon in 587/586&amp;nbsp;BCE was therefore a deeply traumatic event, and led to much theological reflection on the meaning of the national tragedy. The solution, set out in the series of history books from [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] to [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]], was to interpret the Babylonian destruction as divinely-ordained punishment for the failure of the kings, both before and after Josiah to worship Yahweh alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn and Rogerson, pp.153–154&quot;/&gt;

===Second Temple Judaism===
{{main|Second Temple Judaism}}
The [[Second Temple period]] (520&amp;nbsp;BCE-70&amp;nbsp;CE) differed in significant ways from what had gone before.&lt;ref&gt;Avery Peck, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars believe that [[Monotheism]] emerged among the priests of  the Temple establishment during the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, as did beliefs regarding [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe (2004), pp. 243-244&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that the [[Documentary hypothesis|Torah was written]], [[Religious male circumcision#In the Tanakh|circumcision]] and [[Shabbat|Sabbath-observance]] became symbols of Jewish identity, and the institution of the [[synagogue]] became increasingly important.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avery Peck, p.59&quot;&gt;Avery Peck, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;
