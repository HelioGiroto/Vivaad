      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33089">{{God}}'''Pantheism''' is a word derived from the Greek roots ''[[wikt:pan-|pan]]'' (meaning &quot;all&quot;) and ''[[wikt:theos|theos]]'' (meaning &quot;God&quot;).  It is the belief that everything composes an all-encompassing, [[immanence|immanent]] God,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy ed. Paul Edwards |publisher=Macmillan and Free Press |year = 1967 |location = New York|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the [[Universe]] (or [[Nature]]) is identical with [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English  | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford  | pages =  1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pantheists thus do not believe in a [[personal god|personal]] or [[anthropomorphic]] god, but differ in exact interpretation of the term.

Pantheism was popularized in the modern era as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Picton/&gt;{{rp|p.7}} whose treatise, ''Ethics'', was an answer to Descartes' famous [[Dualism|dualist]] theory that the body and spirit are separate.&lt;ref name=Plumptre /&gt; Spinoza held that the two are the same, and this [[monism]] is a fundamental quality of his philosophy. He was described as a &quot;God-intoxicated man,&quot; and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.&lt;ref name=Plumptre&gt;{{cite book|last=Plumptre|first=Constance|title=General sketch of the history of pantheism, Volume 2|year=1879|publisher=Samuel Deacon and Co|location=London|isbn=9780766155022|pages=3–5, 8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term Pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as the most celebrated advocate of pantheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoham|first=Schlomo Giora|title=To Test the Limits of Our Endurance|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=1443820687|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There are a variety of definitions of pantheism. Some consider it a theological and philosophical [[Conceptions of god|position concerning God]].&lt;ref name=Picton&gt;{{cite book|last=Picton|first=James Allanson|title=Pantheism: its story and significance|year=1905|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; CO LTD.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1419140082|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-_yjarZwEhoC&amp;pg=PP8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.8}} Viewed as a religious position, Pantheism has been described as the polar opposite of Atheism.&lt;ref name=Plumptre&gt;{{cite book|last=Plumptre|first=Constance|title=General sketch of the history of pantheism, Volume 2|year=1879|publisher=Samuel Deacon and Co|location=London|isbn=9780766155022|p 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this standpoint, Pantheism is the view that everything is part of an all-encompassing, immanent God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;/&gt; All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that &quot;Being&quot;, or identical with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deity&quot;&gt;Owen, H. P. ''Concepts of Deity''. London: Macmillan, 1971, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others hold that Pantheism is a philosophical position closely related to [[Atheism]].  To them, Pantheism is the view that the Universe and God are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English|publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998|location = Oxford|pages=1341|isbn=0-19-861263-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first known use of the term pantheism was by English mathematician [[Joseph Raphson]] in his work ''De spatio reali'', written in Latin and published in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Thomson; Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment, 2008, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''De spatio reali'', Raphson begins with a distinction between atheistic ‘panhylists’ (from the Greek roots ''[[wikt:pan-|pan]]'', &quot;all&quot;, and ''[[wikt:hyle|hyle]]'', &quot;matter&quot;), who believe everything is matter, and ‘pantheists’ who believe in “a certain universal substance, material as well as intelligent, that fashions all things that exist out of its own essence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raphson|first=Joseph|title=De spatio reali|year=1697|publisher=Londini|pages=2|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suttle|first=Gary|title=Joseph Raphson: 1648-1715|url=http://naturepantheist.org/raph-son.html|publisher=Pantheist Association for Nature|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphson found the universe to be immeasurable in respect to a human's capacity of understanding, and believed that humans would never be able to comprehend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koyré|first=Alexander|title=From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe|year=1957|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=0801803470|pages=190–204|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/cwiu/cwiu11.htm#page_190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was borrowed and first used in English by [[Irish people|Irish]] writer [[John Toland]] in his 1705 work &quot;[[Socinianism]] Truly Stated, by a pantheist&quot;. He clarified his idea of pantheism in a 1710 letter to [[Gottfried Leibniz]] when he referred to &quot;the pantheistic opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, Ted, ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p.641: &quot;First used by John Toland in 1705, the term 'pantheist' designates one who holds both that everything there is constitutes a unity and that this unity is divine.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Ann, ''Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment'', Oxford University Press, 2008, p 133,  ISBN 9780199236190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Paul Harrison, ''Elements of Pantheism'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term &quot;Pantheism&quot; did not exist before the 17th century, various pre-Christian religions and philosophies can be regarded as pantheistic. They include some of the [[Presocratics]], such as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Anaximander]].&lt;ref&gt;Thilly, Frank, &quot;Pantheism&quot;, in  ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 18'', Hastings, James (Ed.), Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (reprint, originally published 1908), p 614,  ISBN 9780766136953.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Stoics]] were Pantheists, beginning with [[Zeno of Citium]] and culminating in the emperor-philosopher [[Marcus Aurelius]].   During the pre-Christian Roman Empire, [[Stoicism]] was one of the three dominant schools of philosophy, along with [[Epicureanism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=AH|title=The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy|year=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978052104-549|pages=57, 60, 161, 186, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLynn|first=Frank|title=Marcus Aurelius: A Life|year=2010|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780306819162|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Daoism|Taoism]] of [[Lao Zi]] and [[Zhuangzi]] is also sometimes considered pantheistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|160px|The philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]] is often regarded as pantheism, although he did not use that term.&lt;ref name=Picton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Fraser, Alexander Campbell &quot;Philosophy of Theism&quot;, William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p 163.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Catholic church]] regarded pantheism as heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Collinge, William, ''Historical Dictionary of Catholicism''	, Scarecrow Press, 2012, p 188,  ISBN	  9780810879799.&lt;/ref&gt;   Italian monk [[Giordano Bruno]], burned at the stake in 1600 for heresy, is considered by some to be a pantheist.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, James Lewis, ''Giordano Bruno'', Macmillan, 1903, p 316.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics'', finished in 1675, was the major source from which pantheism spread.&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (October 2, 1996), ISBN 978-0-415-10782-2, Page: 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Toland]] was influenced by both Spinoza and Bruno, and sometimes used the terms 'pantheist' and '[[Spinozist]]' interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Sullivan, &quot;John Toland and the Deist controversy: A Study in Adaptations&quot;, Harvard University Press, 1982, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720 he wrote the ''Pantheisticon: or The Form of Celebrating the Socratic-Society'' in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Toland: The father of modern pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/toland.htm|work=Pantheist History|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, a major controversy about Spinoza's philosophy known in German as the [[Pantheism controversy|Pantheismus-Streit (Pantheism controversy)]] between critic [[Friedrich Jacobi]] and defender [[Moses Mendelssohn]] helped to spread pantheism to many German thinkers in the late 18th and in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-jacobi/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (plato.stanford.edu)].&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time during the 19th century pantheism was the theological viewpoint of many leading writers and philosophers, attracting figures such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Coleridge]] in Britain; [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in Germany; [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] in the USA. Seen as a growing threat by the Vatican, it came under attack 1862 in the [[Syllabus of Errors]] of [[Pope Pius XI|Pius IX]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9syll.htm Syllabus of Errors 1.1 (papalencyclicals.net)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-eighteenth century, English theologian [[Daniel Waterland]] defined pantheism as:  &quot;It supposes God and nature, or God and the whole universe, to be one and the same substance—one universal being; insomuch that men's souls are only modifications of the divine substance.&quot;&lt;ref name=Worman&gt;Worman, J. H., &quot;Pantheism&quot;, in ''Cyclopædia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 1'',   John McClintock, James Strong (Eds),    Harper &amp; Brothers, 1896, pp 616&amp;ndash;624.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worman cites Waterland, Works, viii, p 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early nineteenth century,  German theologian [[Julius Wegscheider]] defined pantheism as the belief that God and the world established by God are one and the same.&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worman cites Wegscheider, Inst 57, p 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, pantheism was often declared to be the underlying &quot;theology&quot; of [[Neopaganism]],&lt;ref&gt;Margot Adler, Drawing Down the Moon, Beacon Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pantheists began forming organizations devoted specifically to Pantheism and treating it as a separate religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Recent developments===
In 2006, Prominent atheist [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The God Delusion]]'' described pantheism as &quot;sexed-up atheism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|year=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0-618-68000-4|pages=11–12|url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Downloads/News/GodDelusion_extract_revised.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Einstein 1921 portrait2.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Albert Einstein]] is considered to be a pantheist by some commentators.]]
In 2008, [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1954 German letter in which he dismissed belief in a personal God was auctioned off for more than US$330,000. Einstein wrote, &quot;We followers of [[Spinoza]] see our God in the wonderful order and lawfulness of all that exists and in its soul (&quot;Beseeltheit&quot;) as it reveals itself in man and animal.&quot; in a letter to Eduard Büsching (25 October 1929) after Büsching sent Einstein a copy of his book ''Es gibt keinen Gott''. Einstein responded that the book only dealt with the concept of a personal God and not the impersonal God of pantheism.  &quot;I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly,&quot; he wrote in another letter in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Belief in God a 'product of human weaknesses': Einstein letter| publisher=CBC Canada| date=2008-05-13 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2008/05/13/einstein-religion.html| accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy See|Vatican]] mentioned Pantheism in a 2009 Papal encyclical&lt;ref name=Caritas&gt;Caritas In Veritate, July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2010 New Year's Day statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI For The Celebration Of The World Day Of Peace|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20111208_xlv-world-day-peace_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing Pantheism for denying the superiority of humans over nature and &quot;seeing the source of man{{'s}} salvation in nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=Caritas/&gt; Author [[Ross Douthat]], in a review of 2009 film [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]], described pantheism as &quot;Hollywood’s religion of choice for a generation now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Heaven and Nature, Ross Douthat, New York Times, December 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an 1866 letter written by [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] law partner, was auctioned off for US$30,000.&lt;ref name=Letter&gt;{{cite web|title=Sold - Herndon's Revelations on Lincoln’s Religion|url=http://www.raabcollection.com/abraham-lincoln-autograph/Abraham-Lincoln-Autograph-Religion/|publisher=Raab Collection|accessdate=5 June 2012|first=William|last=Herndon|format=Excerpt and review|date=February 4, 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, Herndon writes of the U.S. President's [[Abraham Lincoln and religion|evolving religious views]], which included Pantheism.
:''Mr. Lincoln’s religion is too well known to me to allow of even a shadow of a doubt; he is or was a Theist &amp; a Rationalist, denying all extraordinary - supernatural inspiration or revelation. At one time in his life, to say the least, he was an elevated Pantheist, doubting the immortality of the soul as the Christian world understands that term. He believed that the soul lost its identity and was immortal as a force. Subsequent to this he rose to the belief of a God, and this is all the change he ever underwent.''&lt;ref name=Letter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Guy|title='Pantheist' Lincoln would be unelectable today|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pantheist-lincoln-would-be-unelectable-today-2269024.html|accessdate=5 June 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 April 2011|authorlink=http://www.independent.co.uk/biography/guy-adams-6255066.html|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The subject is understandably controversial, but the contents of the letter is consistent with Lincoln's fairly lukewarm approach to organized religion.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;

==Categorizations==
&lt;!--Where in the source does it suggest &quot;There are several ways to categorize pantheism.&quot;?--&gt;
There are multiple varieties of pantheism&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Michael|title=Pantheism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} which can either be placed along various spectra or in discrete categories.

===Degree of determinism===
American philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] used the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe the [[deterministic]] philosophies of [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[the Stoics]], and other like-minded figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophers Speak of God|year=1953|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=165–210|editor=Charles Hartshorne and William Reese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheism (All-is-God) is often associated with [[monism]] (All-is-One) and some have suggested that it logically implies determinism: in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] words,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Einstein: His Life and Universe|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=391|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA391&amp;lpg=RA1-PA391 }} p. 391 &quot;I am a determinist&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the past, present, and future are an 'illusion'&quot;.{{synthesis-inline|date=September 2012}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldsmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsmith|first=Donald|title=E = Einstein: His Life, His Thought, and His Influence on Our Culture|year=2006|publisher=Stirling Publishing|location=New York|pages=187|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zGzcV40b3IkC&amp;pg=PA187|coauthors=Marcia Bartusiak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.C.

*Creatures of Prometheus: Gender and the Politics of Technology By Timothy Vance Kaufman-Osborn, Prometheus ((Writer)) [http://books.google.com/books?id=PZiLIEQzgHcC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28] &quot;Things are in a saddle, and ride mankind.&quot;
*Emerson's position is &quot;soft determinism&quot; (a variant of determinism) [http://books.google.com/books?id=ud2ZDts0RHsC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145]
*&quot;The 'fate' Emerson identifies is an underlying determinism.&quot; (Fate is one of Emerson's essays) [http://books.google.com/books?id=E1XhhYR2W6cC&amp;pg=PA443&amp;lpg=PA443]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;*&quot;Hegel was a determinist&quot; (also called a combatibilist a.k.a. soft determinist) [http://books.google.com/books?id=7tu1ZAJzl-sC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226]
*&quot;Hegel and Marx are usually cited as the greatest proponents of historical determinism&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=OF_0c51R_VUC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238]&lt;/ref&gt;

However,  some have argued against treating every meaning of &quot;unity&quot; as an aspect of Pantheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Michael P..|title=Pantheism, substance and unity|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|year=1992|month=August|volume=32|pages=1–23|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40036697|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there exist versions of pantheism that exclude determinism. Examples include the beliefs of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;
*Theories of the will in the history of philosophy By Archibald Alexander p 307 Schelling holds &quot;that the will is not determined but self-determined.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=6cV9AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305]
*The Dynamic Individualism of William James By James O. Pawelski p 17 &quot;[His] fight against determinism&quot; &quot;My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=-21UjntpjFkC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree of theism===
It is also possible to distinguish two types of pantheism,&lt;ref name=Plumptre/&gt; one being closer to [[theism]] and the other closer to [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings ed. &quot;Encyclopaedia of Religion &amp; Ethics, {Pantheism (Introductory) by A.S. Gaden}&quot;, Vol. 9, p. 609.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Lincoln, &quot;Ecology and Utility: The Philosophical Dilemmas of Planetary Management&quot;, Associated University Press, 1991, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The Columbia Encyclopedia writes of the distinction:

:&quot;If the pantheist starts with the belief that the one great reality, eternal and infinite, is God, he sees everything finite and temporal as but some part of God. There is nothing separate or distinct from God, for God is the universe. If, on the other hand, the conception taken as the foundation of the system is that the great inclusive unity is the world itself, or the universe, God is swallowed up in that unity, which may be designated nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pantheism|work=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=13 June 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Theistically-inclined pantheisms include [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Ibn Arabi]]. More atheistically-inclined pantheisms include [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and the recent views of [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] and the [[World Pantheist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home page|url=http://www.pantheism.net/|publisher=The World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In 1896, theologian J. H. Worman identified seven categories of pantheism: Mechanical or materialistic (God the mechanical unity of existence); Ontological (abstract unity, Spinoza); Dynamic; Psychical (God is the soul of the world); Ethical (God is the universal moral order, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]); Logical ([[Hegel]]); and Pure (absorption of God into nature, which Worman equates with atheism).&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;

More recently, [[Paul D. Feinberg]], professor of biblical and systematic theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, also identified seven categories of pantheism: Hylozoistic; Immanentistic; Absolutistic monistic; Relativistic monistic; Acosmic; Identity of opposites; Neoplatonic or emanationistic.&lt;ref&gt;Evangelical Dictionary of Theology edited by Walter A. Elwell, p. 887&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantheism in Religion==

===Hinduism===
It is generally asserted that Hindu religious texts are the oldest known literature containing pantheistic ideas.&lt;ref name=Plumptre/&gt;

In Hindu Sanatana Dharma [[theology]], as per the divine revelations i.e.the Vedas, Brahm/Parabrahma is the one unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all things in this Universe. If one adds two whole parts the result is one whole and if one whole is subtracted from another whole the result is another whole - it means there is one whole universe and it is all prevaded by &quot;Him&quot;.Since the universe has come forth from the Divine, all things and beings are sacred and must be treated so in human thought and action.  The Divine sleeps in minerals, awakens in plants, walks in animals and thinks in humans.

&quot;That is an aggregate; this is an aggregate.  The aggregate come out of the aggregate. Removing the aggregate from the aggregate, the aggregate still remains&quot;.

Just as all rivers lead to the one ocean, Hindus believe that all religious pathways lead to the same eternal truth. Sanatan Dharma therefore teaches religious tolerance. Even within Hinduism, there are different approaches to reaching the Divine based on an individual’s own characteristics. This idea of pantheism is traceable from the Puranas which are the nearest allegorical representations created for the masses whereas Vedas were for the highly literate. All [[Mahāvākyas|Mahāvākyas (Great Sayings)]] of the Upanishads, in one way or another, seem to indicate the unity of the world with the Brahman. It further says, &quot;This whole universe is Brahman, from Brahman to a clod of earth.&quot; Pantheism is a key component of [[Advaita]] philosophy. Other subdivisions of Vedanta do not strictly hold this tenet.

===Taoism===
In the tradition of its leading thinkers [[Lao Tzu]] and [[Zhuangzi]], [[Taoism]] is comparable with Pantheism, as The Tao is always spoken of with profound religious reverence and respect, similar to the way that Pantheism discusses the &quot;divinity&quot; of the Universe. The [[Tao te Ching]] never speaks of a transcendent God, but of a mysterious and numinous ground of being underlying all things. Moreover Taoism stresses the importance of living in harmony with Nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Zhuangzi emphasized the pantheistic content of Taoism even more clearly: &quot;Heaven and I were created together, and all things and I are one.&quot; When Tung Kuo Tzu asked Zhuangzi where the Tao was, he replied that it was in the ant, the grass, the clay tile, even in excrement: &quot;There is nowhere where it is not… There is not a single thing without Tao.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantheism.net/paul/chuang.htm Chuang Tzu - The butterfly philosopher (pantheism.net)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions===
There are elements of pantheism in some forms of [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=The origins of Christian pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/gospel.htm|work=Pantheist history|publisher=World Pantheists Movement|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Michael W.|title=Christianity and Pantheism|url=http://www.pantheist.net/society/christianity_and_pan_fox.html|publisher=Universal Pantheist Society|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaleha|first=Bernard|title=Recovering Christian Pantheism as the Lost Gospel of Creation|url=http://www.christianecology.org/ConsiderLillies.html|publisher=Fund for Christian Ecology, Inc.|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Neopaganism]], and [[Theosophy]] as well as in several tendencies in the major theistic religions. See also the Neopagan section of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Eckankar]], and the [[Church of All Worlds]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  The Islamic religious tradition, in particular [[Sufism]] and [[Alevi]]sm has a strong belief in the [[Monism#Islam|unitary nature]] of the universe and the concept that everything in it is an aspect of God itself, although this perspective leans closer to [[panentheism]] and may also be termed [[Theopanism]]. Many traditional and folk religions including [[African traditional religions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parrinder|first=EG|title=Monotheism and Pantheism in Africa|journal=Journal of Religion in Africa|year=1970|volume=3|pages=81–88|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1594816|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Native American religions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=North American Indians: the spirituality of nature|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/native-americans.htm|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot; /&gt;{{rp|p.67}} can be seen as pantheistic, or a mixture of pantheism and other doctrines such as [[polytheism]] and [[animism]].

===Devoted Organizations===
[[File:Panthéisme.JPG|thumb| Spiral image symbols favored by the World Pantheist Movement]]
Two organizations that specify the word pantheism in their title formed in the last quarter of the 20th century.  The [[Universal Pantheist Society]], open to all varieties of pantheists and supportive of environmental causes, was founded in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home page|url=http://www.pantheist.net/|publisher=Universal Pantheist Society|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has seen decreased activity in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Green&quot;&gt;Bron Raymond Taylor, &quot;Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future&quot;, University of California Press 2010, p 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Pantheist Movement]] is headed by environmentalist and writer [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]], a former vice president of the Universal Pantheist Society, from which he resigned in 1996. The World Pantheist Movement was incorporated in 1999 to focus exclusively on promoting a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] version of pantheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Pantheist Movement|title=Naturalism and Religion: can there be a naturalistic &amp; scientific spirituality?|url=http://www.pantheism.net/natural.htm|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered by some a form of [[religious naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Jerome Arthur|title=Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative|year=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791475379|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as an example of &quot;dark green religion&quot; with a focus on environmental ethics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Green&quot; /&gt;

The term [[panentheism]] (from Greek πᾶν (pân) &quot;all&quot;; ἐν (en) &quot;in&quot;; and θεός (theós) &quot;God&quot;; &quot;all-in-God&quot;) was formally coined in Germany in the 19th century in an attempt to offer a philosophical synthesis between traditional theism and pantheism, stating that God is substantially [[omnipresent]] in the physical universe but also exists &quot;apart from&quot; or &quot;beyond&quot; it as its Creator and Sustainer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;&gt;John W. Cooper, ''The Other God of the Philosophers'', Baker Academic, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.27}} Thus panentheism separates itself from pantheism, positing the extra claim that God exists above and beyond the world as we know it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Michael Philip|title=Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity|year=1994|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HtS2TR8859sC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.11}} The line between pantheism and panentheism can be blurred depending on varying definitions of God, so there have been disagreements when assigning particular notable figures to pantheism or panentheism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt;{{rp|p.71-72, 87-88, 105}}&lt;ref&gt;Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Genealogy to Iqbal edited by Edward Craig, pg 100 [http://books.google.com/books?id=5m5z_ca-qDkC&amp;printsec=frontcover].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pandeism]] is another word derived from pantheism and is characterized as a combination of reconcilable elements of pantheism and [[deism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Science: A Beginner's Guide|pages =90|author=Sean F. Johnston|year=2009|isbn= 1-85168-681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes a Creator-deity which is at some point distinct from the universe and then merges with it, resulting in a universe similar to the pantheistic one in present essence, but differing in origin.
