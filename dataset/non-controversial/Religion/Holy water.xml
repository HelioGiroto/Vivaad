'''Holy water''' is water that, in [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and some other churches, has been sanctified by a [[priest]] for the purpose of [[baptism]]; the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects; or as a means of repelling evil.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers's encyclop√¶dia, page 394, Published by Lippincott &amp; Co (1870)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Altman, 2002 ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life'' ISBN 1-58768-013-0 pp 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The use for baptism and spiritual cleansing is common among several religions, from [[Christianity]] to [[Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. The use of holy water as a [[sacramentals|sacramental]] for protection against evil is almost exclusive to [[RCTerm|Roman Catholic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Theiler, 2003 ''Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics'' ISBN 0-7661-7553-7 pp 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==
===History===
The use of holy water in the earliest days of [[Christianity]] is attested to only in somewhat later documents. The [[Apostolic constitution]]s which go back to about the year 400, attribute to the precept of using holy water to [[Apostle Matthew]]. Hence the first historical testimony goes back to the fifth century. However, it is plausible that, in the earliest Christian times, water was used for expiatory and purificatory purposes, in a way analogous to its employment under the Jewish Law. Yet, in many cases, the water used for the Sacrament of Baptism was flowing water, sea or river water, and it could not receive the same blessing as that contained in the baptisteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07432a.htm Catholic encyclopedia on Holy water]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holy water St Teresa's church Clarendon Street Dublin 2006 Kaihsu Tai.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Take home&quot; holy water at St Teresa's church, [[Dublin]]]]

===Use and storage===

Holy water is used as a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]] in the baptismal ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Sacramentals at the Vatican website [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm ss. 1667, 1668]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Holy water is kept in the ''[[Holy water font|font]]'', which is typically located at the entrance to the church (or sometimes in a separate room or building called a [[baptistery]]); its location at the entrance serves as a reminder of the centrality of baptism as the primary rite of initiation into the Christian faith. Smaller vessels, called [[Holy water font|''stoups'']], are usually placed at the entrances of the church. In recent years, with the concerns over influenza, new holy water machines that work like an [[automatic soap dispenser]] have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hi-tech holy water calms flu fear|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8356019.stm|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages the power of holy water was considered so great fonts had locked covers to prevent the theft of holy water for unauthorized [[Magic (paranormal)|magic practices]]: the Constitutions of [[Edmund Rich|Archbishop Edmund Rich]] (1236) prescribe that ''&quot;Fonts are to be kept under lock and key, because of witchcraft (''sortilegia''). Similarly the [[chrism]] and sacred oil are kept locked up.''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Fontes sub serura clausi teneantur, propter saortilegia. Chrisma similiter et oleum sacrum sub clave custodiantur&quot; (Wilkinson, ''Consilia'', 1:636, quoted in [[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers in the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991:384 and note 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proper disposal ===
In Catholicism, holy water, as well as water used during the washing of the priest's hands at mass, is not allowed to be disposed of in regular plumbing. Roman Catholic churches will usually have a special basin (a Sacrarium) that leads directly into the ground for the purpose of proper disposal. A hinged lid is kept over the holy water basin to distinguish it from a regular sink basin, which is often just beside it. Items that contain holy water are separated, drained of the holy water, and then washed in a regular manner in the adjacent sink.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Theiler, 2003 Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics ISBN 0-7661-7553-7 p 48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hygiene ===
Holy water fonts have been identified as a potential source of bacterial and viral infection.  Bacteriologists found [[staphylococci]], [[streptococci]], [[escherichia coli|coli bacilli]], [[corynebacterium diphtheriae|Loeffler's bacillus]], and other bacteria in samples of holy water taken from a church in [[Sassari, Italy]] in the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette, Volume 14, page 578. The Gazette Publishing Company, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, in a study performed in 1995, thirteen samples were taken when a burn patient acquired a bacterial infection after exposure to holy water.  The samples were shown to have a &quot;wide range of bacterial species,&quot; some of which could cause infection in humans.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Rees and K.D. Allen, 1996 &quot;Holy water--a risk factor for hospital-acquired infection&quot;. ''Journal of Hospital Infection'' 32(1), pages 51-55.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[swine flu]] epidemic of 2009, [[John Thomas Steinbock|Bishop John Steinbock]] of [[Fresno, California]] recommended that &quot;[h]oly water should not be in the fonts&quot; due to fear of spreading infections.&lt;ref&gt;California Catholic Daily.  &quot;[http://www.calcatholic.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?id=4646a566-ae6a-456c-8f28-0d47cb14d3ac Holy water should not be in fonts during this epidemic &lt;Internet&gt;]&quot;. 4 May, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in response to the swine flu, an automatic, motion-detecting holy water dispenser was invented and installed in an Italian church.&lt;ref&gt;NPR Morning Edition. &quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120340662 In Italy, An Automatic Holy-Water Dispenser &lt;Internet&gt;]&quot;. 12 November, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian traditions===

====Catholics====
=====Sanctification=====
As a reminder of baptism, Catholics dip their fingers in the holy water and make the [[sign of the cross]] when entering the church.  The liturgy may begin on Sundays with the [[Rite]] of Blessing and Sprinkling Holy Water, in which holy water is sprinkled upon the congregation; this is called ''aspersion'', from the Latin, asperges (&quot;to sprinkle&quot;). This ceremony dates back to the ninth century.  An ''[[aspergill]]'' or ''aspergillum'' is a brush or branch used to sprinkle the water.  An ''aspersorium'' is the vessel which holds the holy water and into which the aspergillum is dipped, though elaborate [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] examples are known as ''[[Situla (vessel)|situlae]]''. [[Blessed salt in Christianity|Blessed salt]] may be added to the water &quot;where it is customary.&quot;

[[Asperges]] is the name given to the rite of sprinkling a congregation with holy water. The name comes from the first word in the 9th verse of Psalm 51 in the Latin translation, the [[Vulgate]], which is sung during the Traditional form of the rite, except during Eastertide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01793a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; 

This use of holy water and making a sign of the cross when entering a church reflects a renewal of baptism, a cleansing of [[Venial sin|venial]] sin, as well as providing protection against evil.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Bold, 2008 ''Catholic Doctorine and Discipline Simply Explained'' ISBN 1-4097-8610-2 page 283&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes accompanied by the following prayer:&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelyn Lindsey, 2001 ''Catholic Family Prayer Book'' OSV Press ISBN 0-87973-999-1 page  65&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;By this Holy water and by your Precious Blood, wash away all my sins O Lord&quot;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[RCTerm|Catholics]] believe that water from specific shrines such as the [[Lourdes]] Spring are means by which God chooses to bring healing. This water, technically, is not holy water in the same sense as traditional holy water since it has not been consecrated by a [[priest]] or [[bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Clarke, 2008 ''Lourdes, Its Inhabitants, Its Pilgrims, And Its Miracles'' ISBN 1-4086-8541-8 page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Saint Teresa of Avila]], by [[Rubens]], 1615]]

=====Protection against evil=====
[[RCTerm|Catholic]] saints have written about the power of holy water as a force that repels evil. Saint [[Teresa of Avila]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] who reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary]], was a strong believer in the power of holy water and wrote that she used it with success to repel evil and temptations.&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Bielecki, Mirabai Starr, 2008 ''Teresa of Avila: The Book of My Life'' ISBN 1-59030-573-6 pp 238-241&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I know by frequent experience that there is nothing which puts the devils to flight like Holy water.''&lt;ref&gt;Teresa of Avila, 2008 ''Life of St. Teresa of Jesus'' ISBN 1-60680-041-8 page 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
In ''Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics'' Henry Theiler states that in addition to being a strong force in repelling evil, holy water has the twofold benefit of providing grace for both body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Theiler, 2003 ''Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics'' ISBN 0-7661-7553-7 pp 24-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[Rituale Romanum]] excludes the exorcism prayer on the water. Exorcized salt used to be added to the holy Water as well. Priests can now use the older form if they wish according to [[Summorum Pontificum]], an apostolic letter by Pope Benedict the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extraordinary Form; Book of Blessings|author=Legionary of Christ Father Edward McNamara|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur336.htm|publisher=ZENIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern Christians ====
{{Main|Holy water in Eastern Christianity}}
[[File:The consecration of water on the Theophany. Kustodiev.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Great Blessing of Waters'' by [[Boris Kustodiev]]]]

Among Eastern Orthodox and [[Eastern Catholic|Eastern-Rite]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]], holy water is used frequently in rites of [[blessing]] and [[exorcism]], and the water for [[baptism]] is always sanctified with a special blessing.

There are two rites for blessing holy water: the ''Great Blessing of Waters'' which is held on the [[Great Feasts|Feast]] of [[Theophany]], and the ''Lesser Blessing of Waters'' which is conducted according to need during the rest of the year. Both forms are based upon the Rite of Baptism. Certain feast days call for the blessing of Holy Water as part of their liturgical observance.

Although Eastern Orthodox do not normally bless themselves with holy water upon entering a church like Catholics do, a quantity of holy water is typically kept in a [[baptismal font|font]] placed in the [[narthex]] (entrance) of the church, where it is available for anyone who would like to take some of it home with them. 

Often, when objects are blessed in the church (such as the palms on [[Palm Sunday]], [[Icons]] or sacred vessels) the blessing is completed by a triple sprinkling with holy water using the words, &quot;This (''name of item'') is blessed by the sprinkling of this holy water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

Throughout the centuries, there have been many springs of water that have been believed by members of the Orthodox Church to be miraculous. Some still flow to this day, such as the one at [[Pochaev Lavra]] in [[Ukraine]], and the Life-Giving Spring of the [[Theotokos]] in [[Constantinople]] (commemorated on [[Bright Friday]]).

====Anglicans====
''Holy water'' is not a term used in [[Church of England]] rites, although font water is sanctified in the [[Church of England]] Anglican [[Baptism]] Rite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/initiation/baptism.html Church of England Rite of Holy Baptism, The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England, 2000-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] does expressly mention the optional use of holy water in some recent liturgies of blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Enriching Our Worship 5: Liturgies and Prayers Related to Childbearing, Childbirth, and Loss; Church Publishing; 2009; p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the use of water within [[High Church]] Anglicanism or [[Anglo-Catholicism]] adheres closely to Roman Catholic practice.  In many High Church Anglican churches baptismal water is used for the [[asperges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Anglican_Service_Book/vidi.html Anglican Service Book]&lt;/ref&gt; Stoups with sanctified water are sometimes found near the doors of High Church Anglican churches for the faithful to use in making the [[sign of the cross]] upon entering the [[Church (building)|church]].

====Methodists and Lutherans====
The use of holy water within [[Methodism]] and [[Lutheranism]] is for the [[baptism]] of infants and new members of the church.  The water is believed to be blessed by God, as it is used in a [[sacrament]].  The water is applied to the forehead of the laity being baptised and the clergyperson performs the [[sign of the cross]]. Lutherans tend to have [[holy water font]]s at the entrance of the church.

==In non-Christian religions==
[[File:Hindu public prayer in Haridwar.jpg|thumb|350px|A [[Hindu]] public prayer in the [[River Ganges]]]]

In [[Ancient Greek religion]], a holy water called ''chernips'' was created when extinguishing in it a torch from a religious shrine. In Greek religion, purifying people and locations with water was part of the process of distinguishing the sacred from the profane.&lt;ref&gt;''Greek religion: archaic and classical'', by Walter Burkert, John Raffan 1991 ISBN 0-631-15624-0 page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish law, the [[Torah]] mentions using holy water in a test for the purity of a wife accused of marital infidelity. A ritual would be performed involving the drinking of holy water. If she participated in the ritual, and she was guilty, she is supposedly cursed to miscarry any pregnancy. If she is still able to bear children, then she is presumed innocent.&lt;ref&gt;''Numbers 5:12-31'', The Bible&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sikh]]s use the term ({{lang-pa|‡®Ö‡©∞‡®Æ‡©ç‡®∞‡®ø‡®§}}) for the holy water used in the [[baptism]] ceremony known as ''[[Amrit Sanskar]]'' or ''Amrit Chhakhna''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sikhism'', 2004, by Geoff Teece ISBN 1-58340-469-4 page 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Wicca]] and other [[ceremonial magic]] traditions, although the term ''holy water'' is not normally used, a similar substance is produced when [[salt]] is mixed with water.  It is consecrated and used in many religious ceremonies and [[rituals]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Bathing in holy water is a key element in [[Hinduism]] and the [[Ganges]] is considered the holiest Hindu river.&lt;ref&gt;''Hinduism'', 2004, by Geoff Teece ISBN 1-58340-466-X page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''holy water'' is not used, the idea of &quot;blessed water&quot; is used among Buddhists. Water is put in to a new pot and kept near a Paritrana ceremony, a blessing for protection.  Thai 'Lustral water' can be created in a ceremony in which the burning and extinction of a candle above the water represents the [[Classical element|element]]s of earth, fire, and air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thailandlife.com/lustralwater.htm|title=Buddhism in Thailand: Lustral Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This water is later given to the people to be kept in their home. Not only water but also oil and strings are blessed in this ceremony.  [[Bumpa]], a ritual object, is one of the [[Ashtamangala]], used for storing sacred water sometimes, symbolizing wisdom and long life in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brsk&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Smithsonian Institution | first = | title = Buddhist ritual sprinkler (kundika) &lt;Internet&gt; | url= http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/singleObject.cfm?ObjectId=4442 | accessdate=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;skws&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = The British Museum | first = | title = Stoneware kundika (water sprinkler) &lt;Internet&gt; | url= http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/stoneware_kundika_water_sprin.aspx | accessdate=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drinking of &quot;healing water&quot; (''ƒÅb-i shifƒÅ'') is a practice in various denominations of [[Shi‚Äôa]] [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ViraniShafique&quot;&gt; Virani, Shafique. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.107-108. &lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of the [[Ithna Ashari| Twelver Shi‚Äôa]], many dissolve the dust of sacred locations such as [[Karbala]] (''khƒÅk-i shifa'')  and [[Najaf]] and drink the water (''ƒÅb-i shifƒÅ'') as a cure for illness, both spiritual and physical.&lt;ref name=&quot;ViraniShafique&quot; /&gt; The [[Ismaili]] tradition involves the practice of drinking water blessed by the [[Imam]] of the time. This water is taken in the name of the Imam and has a deep spiritual significance. This is evident from the names used to designate the water, including light (''n≈´r'') and [[ambrosia]] (''am·πõt, amƒ´, amƒ´ras, amƒ´jal''). This practice is recorded from the 13th and 14th centuries and continues to the present day. The ceremony is known as ''ghat-pat'' in South Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ViraniShafique&quot; /&gt;

==Unofficial uses==
Holy water has also been believed to ward off or act as a weapon against mythical evil creatures, such as [[Vampire|vampires]]. In eastern Europe, one harboring this belief might sprinkle holy water onto the corpse of a suspected vampire in order to destroy it or render it inert.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnerjea, Biren. A Dictionary of Superstitions and Mythology, Folk Press Limited, 1927, p. 242. [http://www.scribd.com/doc/29531529/A-DICTIONARY-OF-SUPERSTITIONS-mythologƒ±es]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Library of universal knowledge: A reprint of the last (1880) Edinburgh and London edition of Chambers' encyclopaedia, with copious additions by American editors, Volume 14. American Book Exchange (Original from Harvard University), 1881, p. 804.
