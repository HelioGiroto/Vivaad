      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74352">{{Science}}
'''Pseudoscience''' is a claim, belief, or practice which is presented as [[science|scientific]], but does not adhere to a [[validity|valid]] [[scientific method]], lacks supporting [[scientific evidence|evidence]] or plausibility, cannot be [[Reliability (statistics)|reliably]] tested, or otherwise lacks scientific status.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot; /&gt; Pseudoscience is often characterized by the use of vague, exaggerated or [[falsifiability|unprovable claims]], an over-reliance on [[confirmation bias|confirmation]] rather than rigorous attempts at refutation, a lack of openness to evaluation by other experts, and a general absence of systematic processes to rationally develop theories.

A field, practice, or body of knowledge can reasonably be called pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cover_Curd_1998&quot;/&gt; Science is also distinguishable from [[revelation]], [[theology]], or [[spirituality]] in that it offers insight into the physical world obtained by [[empirical]] [[scientific method|research and testing]].&lt;ref name=Gould/&gt; Commonly held beliefs in [[popular science]] may not meet the criteria of science.&lt;ref name=Pendle/&gt; &quot;Pop&quot; science may blur the divide between science and pseudoscience among the general public, and may also involve [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name=Pendle/&gt; Pseudoscientific beliefs are widespread, even among public school science teachers and newspaper reporters.&lt;ref name=Art-Hobson/&gt;

The [[demarcation problem]] between science and pseudoscience has ethical [[political]] implications, as well as [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]] issues.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Differentiating science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of [[health care]], [[Expert witness|expert testimony]], [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]], and [[science education]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;/&gt; Distinguishing scientific facts and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs such as those found in [[astrology]], [[quackery|medical quackery]], and [[occult]] beliefs combined with scientific concepts, is part of [[science education]] and [[scientific literacy]].&lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt;

The term ''pseudoscience'' is often considered inherently [[pejorative]], because it suggests something is being inaccurately or even deceptively portrayed as science.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP section SciPse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#SciPse |title=Science and Pseudoscience|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2008 |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, those labeled as practicing or advocating pseudoscience normally dispute the characterization.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP section SciPse&quot;/&gt; See also [[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience]].

==Overview==
===Scientific methodology===
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|A typical 19th century [[phrenology]] chart: In the 1820s, phrenologists claimed the mind was located in areas of the brain, and were attacked for doubting that mind came from the nonmaterial soul. Their idea of reading &quot;bumps&quot; in the skull to predict personality traits was later discredited.&lt;ref name=&quot;bowler&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J. Bowler|title=Evolution: The History of an Idea|edition=3rd|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-520-23693-9|ref=harv|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phrenology was first called a pseudoscience in 1843 and continues to be considered so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magendie1843&quot;/&gt;]]

While the standards for determining whether a body of knowledge, methodology, or practice is scientific can vary from field to field, a number of basic principles are widely agreed upon by scientists. The basic notion is that all experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]], and able to be [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g. '' Gauch, Hugh G., Jr. (2003), [http://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC Scientific Method in Practice], Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-01708-4, 435 pages, 3-5 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; These principles aim to ensure [[experiment]]s can be measurably reproduced under the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is both [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]]. Standards require the [[scientific method]] to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] will be controlled for or eliminated through randomization, fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or [[falsifiability|falsify]] results. Statistical quantification of [[statistical significance|significance]], [[confidence interval|confidence]], and [[margin of error|error]]&lt;ref&gt;Gauch (2003), 191 ''ff'', especially Chapter 6, &quot;Probability&quot;, and Chapter 7, &quot;inductive Logic and Statistics&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; are also important tools for the scientific method.

===Falsifiability===
In the mid-20th century, [[Karl Popper]] put forth the criterion of [[falsifiability]] to distinguish science from nonscience.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, KR (1959) &quot;[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]&quot;. The German version is currently in print by Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3-16-148410-X), the English one by Routledge publishers (ISBN 0-415-27844-9).&lt;/ref&gt; Falsifiability means a result can be disproved. For example, a statement such as &quot;God created the universe&quot; may be true or false, but no tests can be devised that could prove it either way; it simply lies outside the reach of science. Popper used [[astrology]] and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and/or metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conjectures&quot;&gt;Karl R. Popper: [http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/popperphil1.pdf Science: Conjectures and Refutations.] ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'' (1963), p. 43–86;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merton's norms===
In 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a small set of &quot;norms&quot; which characterized what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton determined the enterprise to be nonscience. His norms were defined as:
* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.
* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.
* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.
* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based solely on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.
* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be openly published and shared with the scientific community.

===Refusal to acknowledge problems===
In 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Thagard &quot;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/192639 Why Astrology is a Pseudoscience]&quot; in PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association, Vol. 1978, Volume One: Contributed Papers (1978), pp. 223-234, The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Philosophy of Science Association 223 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of &quot;belief fields&quot; and &quot;research fields&quot; to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the first is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge M (1983) &quot;Demarcating science from pseudoscience&quot; Fundamenta Scientiae 3:369-388&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the term===
Philosophers of science, such as [[Paul Feyerabend]], argued that a distinction between science and nonscience is neither possible nor desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, P. (1975) ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' ISBN 0-86091-646-4 [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm Table of contents and final chapter].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gauch2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=H.G. |last=Gauch |year=2003 |title=Scientific Method in Practice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521017084 |lccn=2002022271 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA88 |page=88 |quote=A particularly radical reinterpretation of science comes from Paul Feyerabend, &quot;the worst eneny of science&quot;... Like Lakatos, Feyerabend was also a student under Popper. In an interview with Feyerabend in ''Science'', [he says] &quot;Equal weight... should be given to competing avenues of knowledge such as astrology, acupunture, and witchcraft...&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues which can make the distinction difficult is variable rates of evolution among the theories and methodologies of science in response to new data.&lt;ref&gt;Thagard PR (1978) &quot;Why astrology is a pseudoscience&quot; (1978) In PSA 1978, Volume 1, ed. Asquith PD and Hacking I (East Lansing: Philosophy of Science Association, 1978) 223 ff. Thagard writes, at 227, 228: &quot;We can now propose the following principle of demarcation: A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if: it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and non confirmations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, specific standards applicable to one field of science may not be applicable in other fields.

[[Larry Laudan]] has suggested pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly used to describe our emotions: &quot;If we would stand up and be counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Laudan L (1996) &quot;The demise of the demarcation problem&quot; in Ruse, Michael, ''But Is It Science?: The Philosophical Question in the Creation/Evolution Controversy '' pp. 337-350.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[The Skeptic (UK magazine)|Richard McNally]] states, &quot;The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites&quot; and &quot;When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McNally RJ (2003) [http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html Is the pseudoscience concept useful for clinical psychology?] ''The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice'', vol. 2, no. 2 (Fall/Winter 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pseudoscience&quot; is derived from the Greek root ''pseudo'' meaning false and the Latin word ''scientia'' meaning knowledge. Although the term has been in use since at least the late 18th century (used in 1796 in reference to [[alchemy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pseudoscience}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Andrews|Henry|1796|p=87}}) the concept of pseudoscience as distinct from real or proper science appears to have emerged in the mid-19th century. Among the first recorded uses of the word &quot;pseudo-science&quot; was in 1844 in the ''Northern Journal of Medicine'', I 387: &quot;That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles&quot;. An earlier recorded use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist [[François Magendie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Magendie1843&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Magendie|first= F |year=1843|title=An Elementary Treatise on Human Physiology|edition= 5th|translator= John Revere|location=New York|publisher=Harper|page=150|ref=harv}} Magendie refers to phrenology as &quot;''a pseudo-science of the present day''&quot; (note the hyphen).&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the word was used rhetorically to ascribe to an action falsely maintaining scientific status.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Still/&gt; --&gt; From time to time, though, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner around a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and cultural setting.&lt;ref name=Still&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=J Theory Soc Behav |year=2004 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=265–290 |title=The Social Psychology of &quot;Pseudoscience&quot;: A Brief History |last=Still|first= A|last2= Dryden |first2=W |doi=10.1111/j.0021-8308.2004.00248.x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of pseudoscience}}
The history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A pseudoscience is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to properly be called such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Pseudoscientific - pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific|chapter=Pseudoscientific|title=Oxford American Dictionary|publisher= [[Oxford English Dictionary]]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter=Pseudoscience|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between proper science and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One proposal for demarcation between the two is the [[Falsifiability|falsification criterion]], most notably attributed to the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In the [[history of science]] and &quot;[[history of pseudoscience]]&quot; it can be especially hard to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this is the science [[chemistry]], which traces its origins to pseudoscientific [[alchemy]].

The vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of science. Some modern pseudosciences, such as [[astrology]] and [[acupuncture]], originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. Examples are [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]], which were developed in response to the scientific [[theory of evolution]].

Despite failing to meet proper scientific standards, many pseudosciences survive. This is usually due to a persistent core of [[True-believer syndrome|devotees]] who refuse to accept scientific criticism of their beliefs, or due to popular misconceptions. Sheer popularity is also a factor, as is attested by astrology, which remains popular despite being rejected by a large majority of scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title=The Religious and Other Beliefs of Americans 2003 | author=Humphrey Taylor | url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=359 | accessdate=2007-01-05|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nsa1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title= Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding | publisher=National Science Foundation | url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l3 | accessdate=2007-01-05|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encarta|year=2008|title=Astrology|publisher=Microsoft|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552380/Astrology.html|quote=Scientists have long rejected the principles of astrology, but millions of people continue to believe in or practice it.|accessdate=2007-08-28|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwqvOMFZ|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bufe|first=Chaz| title= Astrology: Fraud or Superstition | url=http://www.seesharppress.com/astro.html | publisher= See Sharp Press|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying pseudoscience==
A field, practice, or body of knowledge might reasonably be called pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cover_Curd_1998&quot;&gt;Cover JA, Curd M (Eds, 1998) ''Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues'', 1-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from [[metaphysics]], by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the empirical method, which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;&gt;Popper, Karl (1963) ''Conjectures and Refutations''.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by [[astrology]], which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to adhere to acceptable scientific standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;/&gt; Popper proposed [[falsifiability]] as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.

To demonstrate this point, Popper&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;/&gt; gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from Freud and Adler's theories: &quot;that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;/&gt; From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;/&gt; it was that the observation always fitted or [[confirmation bias|confirmed]] the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness.

In contrast, Popper&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;/&gt; gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted &quot;light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;/&gt; Following from this, stars closer to the sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, &quot;If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper, Karl 1963&quot;/&gt; Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its [[falsifiability]], refutability, or [[testability]].

[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thagard 1978 astrology&quot;/&gt; First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can at one time be scientific and at another pseudoscientific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thagard 1978 astrology&quot;&gt;Thagard PR (1978) &quot;Why astrology is a pseudoscience&quot; (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Science is also distinguishable from [[revelation]], [[theology]], or [[spirituality]] in that it offers insight into the physical world obtained by [[empirical]] [[scientific method|research and testing]].&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html &quot;Nonoverlapping magisteria&quot;], Natural History, March, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the teaching of [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]] has been strongly condemned in position statements from scientific organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/science National Center for Science Education]. Retrieved on 21-05-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable disputes concern the [[evolution]] of living organisms, the idea of common descent, the geologic history of the Earth, the formation of the solar system, and the origin of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298 Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design].&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of belief that derive from divine or inspired knowledge are not considered pseudoscience if they do not claim either to be scientific or to overturn well-established science. Moreover, some specific religious claims, such as [[Studies on intercessory prayer|the power of intercessory prayer to heal the sick]] '''can''' be tested by the scientific method, though they may be based on untestable beliefs.

Some statements and commonly held beliefs in [[popular science]] may not meet the criteria of science. &quot;Pop&quot; science may blur the divide between science and pseudoscience among the general public, and may also involve [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name=Pendle&gt;George Pendle, [http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm Popular Science Feature - When Science Fiction is Science Fact].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, pop science is disseminated to, and can also easily emanate from, persons not accountable to [[scientific method]]ology and expert [[peer review]].

If the claims of a given field can be experimentally tested and methodological standards are upheld, it is not &quot;pseudoscience&quot;, however odd, astonishing, or counterintuitive. If claims made are inconsistent with existing experimental results or established theory, but the methodology is sound, caution should be used; science consists of testing hypotheses which may turn out to be false. In such a case, the work may be better described as ideas that are &quot;not yet generally accepted&quot;. [[Protoscience]] is a term sometimes used to describe a hypothesis that has not yet been adequately tested by the scientific method, but which is otherwise consistent with existing science or which, where inconsistent, offers reasonable account of the inconsistency. It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.&lt;ref&gt;Popper KR ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of pseudoscience concepts, proposed as scientific when they are not scientific, are [[creation science]], [[intelligent design]], [[orgone energy]], [[cold fusion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciencemag&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5418/1252.full?ijkey=b5e429d7fba1239c7510ddcb13197106c132f42a&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | title='New Physics' Finds a Haven at the Patent Office | author=Voss, David | journal=Science | year=1999 | month=May | volume=284 | issue=5418 | pages=1252–1254 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5418.1252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[N-ray|N&amp;#8209;rays]], [[ch'i]], Scientology founder [[L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard]]'s [[engram (Dianetics)|engram theory]], [[enneagram of Personality|enneagram]], [[iridology]], the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], New Age psychotherapies (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[rebirthing therapy]]), [[reflexology]], [[applied kinesiology]], [[astrology]], [[biorhythms]], [[facilitated communication]], [[plant perception (paranormal)|paranormal plant perception]], [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP), [[Velikovsky]]'s ideas, [[ancient astronauts]], [[Anthropometry#Craniometry and paleoanthropology|craniometry]], [[graphology]], [[metoposcopy]], [[personology]], [[physiognomy]], [[acupuncture]], [[alchemy]], [[Body memory|cellular memory]], [[Lysenkoism]], [[naturopathy]], [[reiki]], [[Rolfing]], [[therapeutic touch]], [[ayurvedic medicine]], and [[homeopathy]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; --&gt; [[Robert T.

Many pseudoscientists relish being able to point out the consistency of their ideas with known facts or with predicted consequences, but they do not recognize that such consistency is not proof of anything. It is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition that a good scientific theory be consistent with the facts.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |title=pseudoscience |author=Robert T.

In 2006, the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]] (NSF) issued an executive summary of a paper on science and engineering which briefly discussed the prevalence of pseudoscience in modern times.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;nsf&quot;/&gt; --&gt; It said, &quot;belief in pseudoscience is widespread&quot; and, referencing a [[Gallup Poll]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallup&quot;&gt;[http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/fig07-08.htm Gallup Poll: Belief in paranormal phenomena: 1990, 2001, and 2005]. [[Gallup Poll]]s, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/16915/three-four-americans-believe-paranormal.aspx Gallup's original report].&lt;/ref&gt; stated that belief in the 10 commonly believed examples of [[paranormal]] phenomena listed in the poll were &quot;pseudoscientific beliefs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf&quot;/&gt; The items were: &quot;[[extrasensory perception]] (ESP), that [[Haunted house|houses can be haunted]], [[ghost]]s, [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], [[astrology]], that people can [[mediumship|communicate mentally with someone who has died]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[reincarnation]], and [[Channelling (mediumistic)|channelling]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf&quot;/&gt; Such beliefs in pseudoscience reflect a lack of knowledge of how science works.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;nsf&quot;/&gt; --&gt; The [[scientific community]] may aim to communicate information about science out of concern for the public's susceptibility to unproven claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l3|title=Chapter 7: Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding|author=[[National Science Board]]|year=2006|work=Science and Engineering Indicators 2006|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|at=Belief in Pseudoscience (see Footnote 29)|accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are some of the indicators of the possible presence of pseudoscience.

===Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims===
* Assertion of scientific claims that are vague rather than precise, and that lack specific measurements&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gauch (2003) ''op cit'' at 211 ''ff'' (Probability, &quot;Common Blunders&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Failure to make use of [[operational definition]]s (i.e. publicly accessible definitions of the variables, terms, or objects of interest so that persons other than the definer can independently measure or test them)&lt;ref&gt;Paul Montgomery Churchland, ''Matter and Consciousness: A Contemporary Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind'' (1999) MIT Press. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0262530740&amp;id=_7CBvggqOE4C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22operational+definitions.%22+pseudoscience&amp;sig=hEPrs8b_et10WtXYwX2t3C2ubLg p.90]. &quot;Most terms in theoretical physics, for example, do not enjoy at least some distinct connections with observables, but not of the simple sort that would permit operational ''definitions'' in terms of these observables. [..] If a restriction in favor of operational definitions were to be followed, therefore, most of theoretical ''physics'' would have to be dismissed as meaningless pseudoscience!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Reproducibility]])
* Failure to make reasonable use of the principle of [[parsimony]], i.e. failing to seek an explanation that requires the fewest possible additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (''see'': [[Occam's razor]])&lt;ref&gt;Gauch HG Jr. (2003) ''op cit'' 269 ff, &quot;Parsimony and Efficiency&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of [[obscurantist]] language, and use of apparently technical jargon in an effort to give claims the superficial trappings of science
* Lack of boundary conditions: Most well-supported scientific theories possess well-articulated limitations under which the predicted phenomena do and do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Hines T (1988) ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence'' Buffalo NY: Prometheus Books. ISBN 0-87975-419-2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lack of effective [[Scientific control|controls]], such as [[placebo]] and [[double-blind]], in experimental design
* Lack of understanding of basic and established principles of physics and engineering&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Simanek, [http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/scipseud.htm What is science? What is pseudoscience?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation===
* Assertions that do not allow the logical possibility that they can be shown to be false by observation or physical experiment (''see also'': [[falsifiability]])&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos I (1970) &quot;Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes.&quot; in Lakatos I, Musgrave A (eds) ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'' pp 91-195; Popper KR (1959) ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims that a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gauch (2003) ''op cit'' at 178 ''ff'' (Deductive Logic, &quot;Fallacies&quot;), and at 211 ''ff'' (Probability, &quot;Common Blunders&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific claims that do not confer any predictive power are considered at best &quot;conjectures&quot;, or at worst &quot;pseudoscience&quot; (e.g. ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Macmilllan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, &quot;Fallacies&quot; 174 ''ff'', esp. section on &quot;Ignoratio elenchi&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion that claims which have not been proven false must be true, and vice versa (''see'': [[Argument from ignorance]])&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, &quot;Fallacies&quot; 174 'ff'' esp. 177-178&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over-reliance on testimonial, [[anecdotal evidence]], or [[personal experience]]: This evidence may be useful for the context of discovery (i.e. hypothesis generation), but should not be used in the context of [[Theory of justification|justification]] (e.g. [[Statistical hypothesis testing]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bunge M (1983) Demarcating science from pseudoscience ''Fundamenta Scientiae'' 3:369-388, 381&lt;/ref&gt;
* Presentation of data that seems to support its claims while suppressing or refusing to consider data that conflict with its claims&lt;ref&gt;Thagard (1978)''op cit'' at 227, 228&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [[selection bias]], a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect.
* [[Proving a negative|Reversed burden of proof]]: In science, the burden of proof rests on those making a claim, not on the critic. &quot;Pseudoscientific&quot; arguments may neglect this principle and demand that [[skeptic]]s demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a claim (e.g. an assertion regarding the efficacy of a novel therapeutic technique) is false. It is essentially impossible to prove a universal negative, so this tactic incorrectly places the burden of proof on the skeptic rather than the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld SO (2004) ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology'' Guildford Press (2004) ISBN 1-59385-070-0&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appeals to [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]]: Proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, [[alternative medicine]], naturopathy and mental health, often resort to the &quot;mantra of holism&quot; to explain negative findings.&lt;ref&gt;Ruscio J (2001) ''Clear thinking with psychology: Separating sense from nonsense'', Pacific Grove, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of openness to testing by other experts===
* Evasion of [[peer review]] before publicizing results (called &quot;[[science by press conference]]&quot;):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/peerReview.pdf Peer review and the acceptance of new scientific ideas]; Gitanjali B. Peer review -- process, perspectives and the path ahead. J Postgrad Med 2001, 47:210 {{PMID|11832629}}; Lilienfeld (2004) ''op cit'' For an opposing perspective, e.g. [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/ss/ss5.html Chapter 5 of Suppression Stories by Brian Martin (Wollongong: Fund for Intellectual Dissent, 1997), pp. 69-83.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of ideas that contradict accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting their ideas to peer review, sometimes on the grounds that peer review is biased towards established paradigms, and sometimes on the grounds that assertions cannot be evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods. By remaining insulated from the peer review process, these proponents forgo the opportunity of corrective feedback from informed colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Ruscio (2001) ''op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some agencies, institutions, and publications that fund scientific research require authors to [[Data sharing (Science)|share data]] so others can evaluate a paper independently. Failure to provide adequate information for other researchers to [[reproducibility|reproduce]] the claims contributes to a lack of openness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gauch_2003&quot;&gt;Gauch (2003) ''op cit'' 124 ff&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appealing to the need for secrecy or proprietary knowledge when an [[independent review]] of data or methodology is requested&lt;ref name=&quot;Gauch_2003&quot;/&gt;

===Absence of progress===
* Failure to progress towards additional evidence of its claims&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakatos1&quot;&gt;Lakatos I (1970) &quot;Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes.&quot; in Lakatos I, Musgrave A (eds.) ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'' 91-195; Thagard (1978) ''op cit'' writes: &quot;We can now propose the following principle of demarcation: A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if: it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Hines]] has identified astrology as a subject that has changed very little in the past two millennia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines T]], ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence'', Prometheus Books, Buffalo, NY, 1988. ISBN 0-87975-419-2. Thagard (1978) ''op cit'' 223 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[scientific progress]])
* Lack of self-correction: scientific research programmes make mistakes, but they tend to eliminate these errors over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruscio120&quot;&gt;Ruscio J (2001) ''op cit.'' p120&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ideas may be accused of being pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence. The work ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'' (1976) Cornell University, also delves into these features in some detail, as does the work of [[Thomas Kuhn]], e.g. ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1962) which also discusses some of the items on the list of characteristics of pseudoscience.
* Statistical significance of supporting experimental results does not improve over time and are usually close to the cutoff for statistical significance. Normally, experimental techniques improve or the experiments are repeated, and this gives ever stronger evidence. If statistical significance does not improve, this typically shows the experiments have just been repeated until a success occurs due to chance variations.

===Personalization of issues===
* Tight social groups and [[authoritarian personality]], [[suppression of dissent]], and [[groupthink]] can enhance the adoption of beliefs that have no rational basis. In attempting to [[confirmation bias|confirm their beliefs]], the group tends to identify their critics as enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devilly_437&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Devilly | first1 = GJ | year = 2005 | title = Power therapies and possible threats to the science of psychology and psychiatry | url = | journal = Australia and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = 6| pages = 437–445 | doi = 10.1080/j.1440-1614.2005.01601.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims of a conspiracy on the part of the scientific community to suppress the results&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://archivefreedom.org/ archivefreedom.org] which claims that &quot;The list of suppressed scientists even includes Nobel Laureates!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attacking the motives or character of anyone who questions the claims (see [[ad hominem|Ad hominem fallacy]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Devilly_2005&quot;&gt;Devilly (2005) ''op cit.'' e.g. [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic Argumentum Ad Hominem].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of misleading language===
* Creating scientific-sounding terms to add weight to claims and persuade nonexperts to believe statements that may be false or meaningless: For example, a long-standing hoax refers to water by the rarely used formal name &quot;[[dihydrogen monoxide hoax|dihydrogen monoxide]]&quot; and describes it as the main constituent in most [[poison]]ous solutions to show how easily the general public can be misled.
* Using established terms in idiosyncratic ways, thereby demonstrating unfamiliarity with mainstream work in the discipline

In the Journal of College Science Teaching, Art Hobson writes, &quot;Pseudoscientific beliefs are surprisingly widespread in our culture even among public school science teachers and newspaper editors, and are closely related to scientific illiteracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=Art-Hobson&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Art Hobson |year=2011 |title=Teaching Relevant Science for Scientific Literacy |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |url=http://physics.uark.edu/hobson/pubs/00.12.JCST.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological explanations==
Pseudoscientific thinking has been explained in terms of [[psychology]] and [[social psychology]]. The human proclivity for seeking confirmation rather than refutation ([[confirmation bias]]),&lt;ref&gt;(Devilly 2005:439)&lt;/ref&gt; the tendency to hold comforting beliefs, and the tendency to overgeneralize have been proposed as reasons for the common adherence to pseudoscientific thinking. According to Beyerstein (1991), humans are prone to associations based on resemblances only, and often prone to misattribution in cause-effect thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Beyerstein, B., and P. Hadaway. 1991. ''On avoiding folly''. Journal of Drug Issues. 20(4): 689-700.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindeman states that social motives (i.e., &quot;to comprehend self and the world, to have a sense of control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem&quot;) are often &quot;more easily&quot; fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Operating within a different set of rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if the explanation is &quot;personally functional, satisfying and sufficient&quot;, offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lindeman&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lindeman M |title=Motivation, Cognition and Pseudoscience |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Psychology |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=257–65 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9883101 |doi=10.1111/1467-9450.00085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In our culture and thinking, people appear to have trouble distinguishing science from pseuodoscience.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Shermer/&gt; --&gt; The prime reason people believe in wishful things is because they want to, it feels good and it is consoling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Shermer/&gt; --&gt; Many weird beliefs give immediate gratification. Immediate gratification of a person's belief is made a lot easier by simple explanantions for an often complicated and contingent world.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Shermer/&gt; --&gt; The scientific and secular systems of morality and meaning are generally unsatisfying to most people.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Shermer/&gt; --&gt; Humans are, by nature, a forward-minded species pursuing greater avenues of happiness and satisfaction, but we are all too frequently willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shermer M, Gould SJ |year=2002 |title=[[Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time]] |publisher=Holt Paperbacks|location=New York |isbn=0-8050-7089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology has much to discuss about pseudoscience thinking, as it is the illusory perceptions of causality and effectiveness of numerous individuals that needs to be illuminated.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Matute/&gt; --&gt; Research suggests that illusionary thinking that happens in most people when exposed to certain circumstances such as reading a book, an advertisement or the testimony of others are the basis of pseudoscience beliefs.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Matute/&gt; --&gt; It is assumed that illusions are not unusual, and given the right conditions, illusions are able to occur systematically even in normal emotional situations.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Matute/&gt; --&gt; One of the things pseudoscience believers quibble most about is that academic science usually treats them as fools.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Matute/&gt; --&gt; Minimizing these illusions in the real world is not simple.&lt;ref name=Matute/&gt; To this aim, designing evidence-based educational programs can be effective to help people identify and reduce their own illusions.&lt;ref name=Matute&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Br J Psychol |year=2011 |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=392–405 |title=Illusions of causality at the heart of pseudoscience |author= Matute H, Yarritu I, Vadillo MA |pmid=21751996 |doi=10.1348/000712610X532210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundaries between science and pseudoscience==
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
In the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and [[history of science]], [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the [[demarcation problem]], the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. His distinctive historical analysis of scientific methodology based on research programmes suggests: &quot;scientists regard the successful theoretical prediction of stunning novel facts – such as the [[Halley's comet#Computation of orbit|return of Halley's comet]] or the [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|gravitational bending of light rays]] – as what demarcates good scientific theories from pseudo-scientific and degenerate theories, and in spite of all scientific theories being forever confronted by 'an ocean of counterexamples'&quot;.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Lakatos offers a &quot;novel [[fallibilist]] analysis of the development of Newton's celestial dynamics, [his] favourite historical example of his methodology&quot; and argues in light of this historical turn, that his account answers for certain inadequacies in those of [[Sir Karl Popper]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]].&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; &quot;Nonetheless, Lakatos did recognize the force of Kuhn's historical criticism of Popper – all important theories have been surrounded by an 'ocean of anomalies', which on a falsiﬁcationist view would require the rejection of the theory outright… Lakatos sought to reconcile the [[rationalism]] of Popperian [[falsificationism]] with what seemed to be its own refutation by history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Bird |chapter=The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science |title=Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science |editor1-first=Stathis |editor1-last=Psillos |editor2-first=Martin |editor2-last=Curd |location=Abingdon |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |pages=9, 14 (pdf) |url=http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many philosophers have tried to solve the problem of demarcation in the following terms: a statement constitutes knowledge if sufficiently many people believe it sufficiently strongly. But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}

The boundary lines between the science and pseudoscience are disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of dialogue among [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] and [[scientist]]s in varied [[science|fields]], and despite some basic agreements on the fundaments of [[scientific method]]ology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cover_Curd_1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauch HG Jr (2003)''op cit'' 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that scientific methodology has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history. According to Lakatos, the typical descriptive unit of great scientific achievements is not an isolated hypothesis but &quot;a powerful problem-solving machinery, which, with the help of sophisticated mathematical techniques, digests anomalies and even turns them into positive evidence.&quot;&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;

{{quote|To [[Karl Popper|Popper]], pseudoscience uses induction to generate theories, and only performs experiments to seek to verify them. To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]] attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]] claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.&lt;ref name=Newbold&gt;{{Cite journal |journal= Int J Nurs Pract |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=324–30 |title= An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory |author= Newbold D, Roberts J |pmid=18021160 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|&quot;An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory&quot; in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} [[Larry Laudan|Laudan]] maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Laudan |first= Larry |authorlink= Larry Laudan |editor1-last= Cohen |editor1-first= R.S. |editor2-last= Laudan |editor2-first= L. |title= Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum |series= Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume= 76 |year=1983 | publisher=D.

{{quote|[Feyerabend] regards Lakatos's view as being closet anarchism disguised as methodological rationalism. It should be noted that Feyerabend's claim was not that standard methodological rules should never be obeyed, but rather that sometimes progress is made by abandoning them. In the absence of a generally accepted rule, there is a need for alternative methods of persuasion. According to Feyerabend, Galileo employed stylistic and rhetorical techniques to convince his reader, while he also wrote in Italian rather than Latin and directed his arguments to those already temperamentally inclined to accept them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird2008&quot;/&gt;|Alexander Bird|&quot;The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science&quot; in ''Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science''}}

==Politics, health, and education==
===Political implications===
The [[demarcation problem]] between science and pseudoscience brings up debate in the realms of [[science]], [[philosophy]] and [[politics]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; --&gt; [[Imre Lakatos]], for instance, points out that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] at one point declared that [[Mendelian genetics]] was pseudoscientific and had its advocates, including well-established scientists such as [[Nikolai Vavilov]], sent to a [[Gulag]] and that the &quot;liberal Establishment of the West&quot; denies freedom of speech to topics it regards as pseudoscience, particularly where they run up against social mores.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos&gt;Imre Lakatos, [http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/About/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscience.aspx Science and Pseudoscience], [http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/About/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscienceTranscript.aspx Science and Pseudoscience (transcript)], Dept of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudoscience is used recurrently in political, policy-making discourse in allegations of distortion or fabrication of scientific findings to support a political position.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; --&gt; The [[Prince of Wales]] has accused [[climate change skeptics]] of using pseudoscience and persuasion to hinder the world from adopting [[precautionary principle]]s to avert [[catastrophic global warming]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; --&gt; People have given attention to the climate skeptics and have tried to understand the kind of pseudoscience they are canvassing.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; --&gt; But he insisted the &quot;environmental collapse&quot; evidence is already here,&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; --&gt; not only in climbing temperatures but the imprint on particular species like [[honey bee]]s.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/7890783/The-Prince-of-Wales-accuses-sceptics-of-peddling-pseudo-science.html |title=The Prince of Wales accuses sceptics of peddling 'pseudo science'|first=Louise |last=Gray |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=15 July 2010 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes pseudoscientific when [[science]] cannot be separated from [[ideology]], scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite distort the facts of science for short-term political gain, when powerful individuals in the public conflate causation and cofactors (for example, in the causes of HIV/AIDS) through a mixture of clever wordplay, or when science is being used by the powerful to promote ignorance rather than tackle ignorance.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Makgoba/&gt; --&gt; These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of science in [[society]].&lt;ref name=Makgoba&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Makgoba MW |title=Politics, the media and science in HIV/AIDS: the peril of pseudoscience |journal=[[Vaccine (journal)]] |volume=20 |issue=15 |pages=1899–904 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11983241 |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00063-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large percentage of the United states population lacks [[scientific literacy]], not adequately understanding [[scientific method|scientific principles]] and [[methodology]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; --&gt; Instead of seeking scientific professionals for expert medical advise, people increasingly put their trust in pseudoscience, with its claims that are not supported and not testable.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; --&gt; Research scientists and doctors have been drowned out by [[pseudoscientists]], in topics from evolution to animal models of human biology.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; --&gt; The backlash against science threatens to halt progress in combating disease and erodes public support for [[research and development]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; --&gt; The ridicule of researchers has been a tool for political advantage, assisting to the public condemnation of science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.dailybreeze.com/opinions/ci_17244810 | archiveurl=http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/2011/02/8580-pseudoscience-plagues-health-our-nation/ |archivedate=February 4, 2011 |title=Pseudoscience plagues the health of our nation |first=David I. |last=Meyer |newspaper=Torrance Daily Breeze |date=30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and education implications===
Distinguishing science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of [[health care]], [[Expert witness|expert testimony]], [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]], and [[science education]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;/&gt; --&gt; Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive, and dangerous to patients, and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers, and the public as to what treatments are appropriate.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;/&gt; --&gt; Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making poor decisions in selecting curricula; for example, [[creation science]] may replace [[evolution]] in studies of [[biology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hansson|first=Sven Ove|title=Science and Pseudo-Science|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#PurDem|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=April 16, 2011|date=September 3, 2008|quote=From a practical point of view, the distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and public life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in a wide variety of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge from its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day society, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various claims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the demarcation issue pressing in many areas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which students acquire a range of social and [[cognitive]] thinking skills related to the proper usage of science and technology determines whether they are [[Scientific literacy|scientifically literate]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of [[science and technology]], a fast-changing culture, and a knowledge-driven era.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; A scientifically literate person is able to distinguish science from pseudoscience such as astrology, are among the attributes that enable students to adapt to the changing world.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Science literacy characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conductung investigations, or developing projects.&lt;ref name=Hurd&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hurd PD |title=Scientific literacy: New minds for a changing world |journal=Science Education |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=407–416 |year=1998 |month=June |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199806)82:3&lt;407::AID-SCE6&gt;3.0.CO;2-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists do not want to get involved to counter pseudoscience for various reasons.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Efthimiou/&gt; --&gt; For example, pseudoscientific beliefs are irrational and impossible to combat with rational arguments, and even agreeing to talk about pseudoscience indicates acceptance as a credible discipline.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Efthimiou/&gt; --&gt; Pseudoscience harbors a continuous and an increasing threat to our society.&lt;ref name=Efthimiou/&gt; It is impossible to determine the irreversible harm that will happen in the distance.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Efthimiou/&gt; --&gt; In a time when the science literacy of the public has declined and the danger of pseudoscience has increased, revising the conventional science course to current science through the prism of pseudoscience could offer a way to improve science literacy and help society to eliminate misconceptions and assault the growing trends (remote viewing, psychic readings, etc.) that may harm (financially or otherwise) trusting citizens.&lt;ref name=Efthimiou&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint=physics/0608061 |title=Is Pseudoscience the Solution to Science Literacy? |author=C.J. Efthimiou, R. Llewellyn |year=2006|class=physics.ed-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudosciences such as [[homeopathy]], even if generally benign, are magnets for charlatans.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; This poses a serious issue because incompetent practitioners should not be given the right of administering health care.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; [[True-believer syndrome|True-believing]] zealots may pose a more serious threat than typical con men because of their affection to homeopathy's ideology.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; Irrational health care is not harmless, and it is careless to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine.&lt;ref name=Haven&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.ncahf.org/pp/homeop.html#haven | author=The National Council Against Health Fraud | title=NCAHF Position Paper on Homeopathy | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:
* &quot;A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have,&quot; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.
* &quot;Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), '[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.' These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific.&quot;{{harvnb|Hansson|2008}}
* '&quot;claims presented so that they appear [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting evidence and plausibility&quot;(p. 33). In contrast, science is &quot;a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation&quot;(p. 17)'.{{harvnb|Shermer|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
