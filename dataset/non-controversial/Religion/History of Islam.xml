{{Islam}}
The '''history of Islam''' concerns the [[Islam|Islamic religion]] and its adherents, known as [[Muslim]]s. Muslims and their religion have greatly impacted the [[political history|political]], [[economic history|economic]], and [[military history]] of the [[Old World]], especially the [[Middle East]], where lies its roots. Following its origin in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the [[Islamic world]] expanded to include people of the Islamic civilization, inclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization.

Three centuries after the death of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], the [[Historical powers#Arab Caliphates|Arab Caliphates]] extended from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent empires of the [[Umayyads]], [[Abbasids]], [[Fatimid Empire|Fatimids]], [[Ajuuraan Empire|Ajuuraan]], [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]], [[Warsangali Empire|Warsangali]] in [[Somalia]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuqs]], [[Safavids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and [[Ottoman empire|Ottomans]] were among the influential and distinguished powers in the world. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] gave rise to many centers of culture and science and produced notable scientists, astronomers, mathematicians, doctors, nurses and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophers]] during the [[Golden Age of Islam]]. Technology flourished; there was investment in economic infrastructure, such as irrigation systems and canals; and the importance of reading the Qur'an produced a comparatively high level of literacy in the general populace.

In the later Middle Ages, destructive [[Mongol invasions]] from the East, and the loss of population in the [[Black Death]], greatly weakened the traditional centre of the Islamic world, stretching from Persia to Egypt, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] was able to conquer most Arabic-speaking areas, creating an Islamic [[world power]] again, although one that was unable to master the challenges of the [[Early Modern]] period.

Later, in [[modern history]] (18th and 19th centuries), many Islamic regions fell under the influence of European [[Great power]]s. After the [[First World War]], Ottoman territories (a [[Central Powers]] member) were [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioned into several nations]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]].

Modern interpretations of Islamic texts advocate the [[Criticism of Islamism#Unification of religion and state|unification of religion and state]] ruled by a [[Caliph]]. Such a polity has not existed since the early Islamic city-states and universal imperial period beginnings. The common slogan ''al-islam dinun was dawlatun''` (translation: Islam is a religion and a state) is neither a Koranic verse nor a quote from the [[hadith]], but a 19th century political [[Salafi]] slogan popularized in opposition to Western Egyptian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, Fred, 100 Myths about the Middle East, Saqi Books, 2005. p.85-6&lt;/ref&gt; Such a recent origin was a handicap for a belief system bound by the scripture revealed, and the ways of those who lived, twelve centuries earlier.

Although affected by ideologies such as [[communism]] during much of the 20th century, the [[Islamic identity]] and the dominance of [[Political aspects of Islam|Islam on political issues]] intensified during the [[contemporary history|early 21st century]]. Global interests in Islamic regions, international conflicts and [[globalization]] changed the influence of Islam on the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1212925100226&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout Milestones of Islamic History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major periods==
{{main|Historiography of early Islam}}
The [[Islamic state]] and [[Islam and secularism|Muslim's system of government]] evolved through various stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khaddūrī|2002|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise dates of various periods in history are more or less arbitrary. The ''City-state period'' lasted from 620s to 630s. The ''Imperial period'' lasted from 630s to 750s. The ''Universal period'' lasted from 750s to around 900s. These correspond to the [[Early Middle Ages|early period]] of the Middle Ages. The ''&quot;Decentralization&quot; period'' lasted from around 900s to the early 1500s. This correspond to the [[High Middle Ages|high period]] and [[Late Middle Ages|late period]] of the Middle Ages. The ''&quot;Fragmentation&quot; period'' lasted from around 1500s to the late 1910s. The [[contemporary history|contemporary period]], referred to as the ''National period'', lasted from 1910s into the twenty-first century]

==Islamic Origins==
{{Main|Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Hashim|Muhammad|Koran}}

In [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] Arab people lived in the [[Arabian Plate]]. In the south of [[Hedjaz]] (principal religious and commercial centre of Middle Ages Arabia), [[Tribes of Arabia|the Arabic tribe]] of [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] ([[Adnan|Adnani Arabs]]), to which [[Mohammed]] belonged, had been in existence. Near Mecca, the tribe was increasing in power. The Quraysh were the guardians of the [[Kaaba]] within the town of [[Mecca]] and was the dominant tribe of Mecca upon the appearance of Islam. The Kaaba was an important [[pagan]] shrine. It brought revenues to Mecca because of the multitude of pilgrims that it attracted. Muhammad was born into the [[Banu Hashim]] tribe of the Quraysh clan,&lt;ref&gt;Mecca: a literary history of the Muslim Holy Land By Francis E. Peters&lt;/ref&gt; a branch of the [[Banu Kinanah]] tribe, descended from [[Mudhar|Khuzaimah]] and derived its inheritance from the [[Banu Khuza'a|Khuza'imah]] (House of Khuza'a).

(Ed., note artists began representing the veil-covered face of Muhammad from the 16th century onwards)]]
According to the traditional Islamic view, the Qur'an (Koran) began with  [[Wahy|revelations]]  to Muhammad (when he was 40 years old) in 610. The [[history of the Qur'an]] began when its verses were revealed to the [[Sahabah]] during Muhammad's life. The rise of Islam began around the time the Muslims took flight in the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], moving to  Medina. With Islam,  [[blood feud]]s among the Arabs lessened. Compensation was paid in money rather than blood or only the culprit was executed.

In 628, the Makkah tribe of Quraish and the Muslim community in Medina signed a truce called the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyya]] beginning a ten-year period of peace. War returned when the Quraish and their allies, the tribe of 'Bakr', attacked the tribe of 'Khuza'ah', who were Muslim allies. In 630, Muslims conquered [[Mecca]]. Muhammad died in June 632. The [[Battle of Yamama]] was fought in December of the same year, between the forces of the first [[Rashidun Caliph|caliph]] [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Musailima]].

==City-states and Imperial period==
{{Main|Succession to Muhammad|Caliphate}}

After Muhammed died, a series of Caliphs governed the Islamic State: [[Abu Bakr]] (632-634), [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (Umar І, 634-644), [[Uthman ibn Affan]], (644-656), and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]  (656-661).  These leaders are known as the &quot;[[Rashidun]]&quot; or &quot;rightly guided&quot; Caliphs in [[Sunni Islam]]. They oversaw the initial phase of the [[Muslim conquests]], advancing through [[Persia]], [[Egypt]], the Middle East and North Africa. As it is well known that Arabic language is written without vowels, and when Qur'an reached the non Arabic speakers, people began having different dielects and phonics which was changing the exact meaning of verses in the Qur'an. This was brought to the notice of Uthman Ibn Affan. Begun in the time of Uthman ibn Affan, the [[History of the Qur'an|compilation of the Qur'an]] was finished sometime between 650 and 656, Uthman sent copies to the different centers of the expanding Islamic empire. From then on, thousands of Muslim scribes began copying the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie; Barbar Rivolta (Summer, 1992). &quot;Islamic Calligraphy&quot;. The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series 50 (1): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, factions arose and the last three Rashidun caliphs were murdered.  The death of Uthman was followed by a civil war known as the [[First Fitna]], and the succession to Ali ibn Abi Talib was disputed, leading to the split between the [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] sects, and later to competing caliphates when the descendants of Muhammad through his daughter [[Fatimah]] and Ali set up separate [[Fatimid]] societies.

Ziyad took the name ibn Abi Sufyan. Muawiyah arranged for his son [[Yazid I]] to be appointed caliph on his death, which came in 680. [[Husain ibn Ali]], by then Muhammad's only living grandson, refused to swear allegiance to Yazid. He was killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]] the same year, an event still mourned by Muslims on the [[Day of Ashura]]. Unrest continued in the [[Second Fitna]], but Muslim rule was extended under Muawiyah to [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], [[Kabul]], [[Bukhara]], and [[Samarkand]], and expanded in North Africa.

The ''Umayyad dynasty'' (or ''Ommiads''), whose name derives from [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams]], the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph, ruled  from 661 to 750. Although the Umayyad family came from the city of  [[Mecca]], [[Damascus]] was the capital. After the death of [[Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]] in 666,&lt;ref&gt;The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate By Wilferd Madelung. Page 340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedic ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia: A-I, Volume 1 edited by R. Khanam. Page  543&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muawiyah I]] consolidated his power. Muawiyah I moved his capital to Damascus from [[Medina]], which led to profound changes in the empire. In the same way, at a later date, the transfer of the Caliphate from Damascus to Baghdad marked the accession of a new family to power.

The Umayyads viewed Islam as a religion exclusively for Arabs. The Umayyads paid for the state by taxing the [[Dhimmis]]. A non-Arab who wanted to convert was supposed to first become a client of an Arab tribe. Even after conversion, non-Arabs ([[mawali]]) did not achieve social and economic equality.

At its largest extent, the Umayyad dynasty covered more than {{convert|5000000|sqmi}} making it one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] the world had yet seen,&lt;ref name=Blankinship&gt;{{Cite book|title=The End of the Jihad State, the Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd-al Malik and the collapse of the Umayyads|first=Khalid Yahya|last=Blankinship|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|year=1994|isbn=0-7914-1827-8|page=37|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

After the Umayyads were overthrown by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], they fled across North Africa to [[Al-Andalus]], where they established the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], which lasted until 1031 with the [[Fitna of al-Ándalus]].

Page 484.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Muawiyah's most controversial and enduring legacies was his decision to designate his son Yazid as his successor. According to Shi'a doctrine, this was a clear violation of the treaty he made with Hasan ibn Ali.

During the caliphate of [[Yazid I|Yazid]], Muslims suffered several setbacks. In 682 AD Yazid restored [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] as the governor of North Africa. Uqba won battles against the [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].&lt;ref&gt;History of the Arab by Philip K Hitti&lt;/ref&gt; From there Uqba marched thousands of miles westward towards [[Tangier]], where he reached the [[Atlantic coast]], and then marched eastwards through the [[Atlas Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Islam by prof.Masudul Hasan&lt;/ref&gt; With about 300 [[cavalry]]men, he proceeded towards Biskra where he was ambushed by a Berber force under Kaisala.

The ''Mosque of Omar'', on [[Haram Ash-Sharif|Ash-Haram Al-Sharif]] (the [[Temple Mount]]), built by Abd al-Malik; completed at the end of the [[Second Fitna]].]]
The period under [[Muawiya II]] was marked by civil wars ([[Second Fitna]]). This would ease in the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]], a well-educated and capable ruler. Despite the many political problems that impeded his rule, all important records were translated into Arabic. In his reign, a [[currency]] for the Muslim world was minted. This led to war with the Byzantine Empire under [[Justinian II]] ([[Battle of Sebastopolis]]) in 692 in [[Asia Minor]]. The Byzantines were decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of [[Slav]]s. The Islamic currency was then made the exclusive currency in the Muslim world. He reformed agriculture and commerce. Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim rule and extended it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular [[postal service]].

[[
The ''Great Mosque of Damascus'' was built by Al-Walid; completed by the time of the succession of Sulayman.]]
[[Al-Walid I]] began the next stage of Islamic conquests. Under him the early Islamic empire reached its farthest extent. He reconquered parts of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire and moved on into [[Carthage]] and across to the west of North Africa. Muslim armies under [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and began to conquer [[Spain]] using North African [[Berber people|Berber]] armies. The [[Visigoth]]s of Spain were defeated when the Umayyad conquered [[Lisbon]]. Spain was the farthest extent of Islamic control of Europe (they were stopped at the [[Battle of Tours]]). In the east, Islamic armies under [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] made it as far as the [[Indus Valley]]. Under Al-Walid, the caliphate empire stretched from Spain to India. [[Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef]] played a crucial role in the organization and selection of military commanders. Al-Walid paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the Ummayad era., This tactic was crucial for the expansion to Spain. His reign is considered to be the apex of Islamic power.

[[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] was hailed as caliph the day al-Walid died. He appointed [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]] governor of [[Mesopotamia]]. Sulayman ordered the arrest and execution of the family of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]], one of two prominent leaders (the other was [[Qutaibah bin Muslim]]) who had supported the succession of al-Walid's son Yazid, rather than Sulayman. Al-Hajjaj had predeceased al-Walid, so he posed no threat. Qutaibah renounced allegiance to Sulayman, though his troops rejected his appeal to revolt. They killed him and sent his head to Sulayman. Sulayman did not move to [[Damascus]] on becoming Caliph, remaining in [[Ramla]]. Sulayman sent [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik]] to attack the Byzantine capital ([[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|siege of Constantinople]]). The intervention of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] on the Byzantine side proved decisive. The Muslims sustained heavy losses. Sulayman died suddenly in 717.

[[Yazid II]] came to power on the death of Umar II. Yazid fought the Kharijites, with whom Umar had been negotiating, and killed the Kharijite leader Shawdhab. In Yazid's reign, civil wars began in different parts of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;In the Al Andalus (the Iberian Peninsula), North Africa and in the east populations revolted. In A.H. 102 (720-721) in Ifriqiyah, the harsh governor Yazid ibn Muslim was overthrown and Muhammad ibn Yazid, the former governor, restored to power. The caliph accepted this and confirmed Muhammad ibn Yazid as governor of Ifriqiyah.&lt;/ref&gt; Yazid expanded the Caliphate's territory into the Caucasus, before dying in 724. Inheriting the caliphate from his brother, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ruled an empire with many problems. He was effective in addressing these problems, and in allowing the Umayyad empire to continue as an entity. His long rule was an effective one, and renewed reforms introduced by Umar II. Under Hisham's rule, regular raids against the Byzantines continued. In North Africa, Kharijite teachings combined with local restlessness to produce a significant [[Berber Revolt|Berber revolt]]. He was also faced with a revolt by [[Zayd bin Ali]]. Hisham suppressed both revolts. The Abbasids continued to gain power in Khurasan and Iraq. However, they were not strong enough to make a move yet. Some were caught and punished or executed by eastern governors. The [[Battle of Akroinon]], a decisive Byzantine victory, was during the final campaign of the Umayyad dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;*Eggenberger, David (1985). ''An Encyclopedia of Battles: Accounts of Over 1,560 Battles from 1479 BC. to the Present''. Courier Dover Publications. ISBN 0-486-24913-1 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hisham died in 743.

[[Al-Walid II]] saw political intrigue during his reign. [[Yazid III]] spoke out against his cousin Walid's &quot;immorality&quot; which included discrimination on behalf of the [[Banu Qays]] Arabs against [[Yemen]]is and [[mawali|non-Arab Muslims]], and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji'iya (believers in human [[free will]]).&lt;ref&gt;von Ess, &quot;Kadar&quot;, Encyclopedia of Islam 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Walid was shortly thereafter deposed in a [[coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Theophilus. Quoted Robert Hoyland, Seeing Islam as Others Saw It (Darwin Press, 1998), 660&lt;/ref&gt; Yazid disbursed funds from the treasury and acceded to the Caliph. He explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the Book of Allah and the Sunna. Yazid reigned for only six months, while various groups refused allegiance and dissident movements arose, after which he died. [[Ibrahim ibn al-Walid]], named heir apparent by his brother Yazid III, ruled for a short time in 744, before he abdicated. [[Marwan II]] ruled from 744 until he was killed in 750. He was the last Umayyad ruler to rule from Damascus. Marwan named his two sons Ubaydallah and Abdallah heirs. He appointed governors and asserted his authority by force. Anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasids had gained much support. Marwan's reign as caliph was almost entirely devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together. His death signalled the end of Umayyad rule in the East, and was followed by the massacre of Umayyads by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the talented prince [[Abd ar-Rahman]] who escaped to Spain and founded a dynasty there.

The capital was moved from Damascus to [[Baghdad]], due to the importance placed by the Abbasids upon eastern affairs in [[Persia]] and [[Transoxania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;B.a-d&quot; /&gt; At this time the caliphate showed signs of fracture amid the rise of regional dynasties. Although the Ummayad family had been killed by the revolting Abbasids, one family member, [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], escaped to Spain and established an independent caliphate there in 756. In the [[Maghreb]], Harun al-Rashid appointed the Arab [[Aghlabid]]s as virtually autonomous rulers, although they continued to recognise central authority. Aghlabid rule was short-lived, and they were deposed by the [[Shiite]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty in 909. By around 960, the Fatimids had conquered Abbasid Egypt, building a capital there in 973 called &quot;''al-Qahirah''&quot; (meaning &quot;the planet of victory&quot;, known today as [[Cairo]]). In Persia the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Ghaznavid]]s snatched power from the Abbasids.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-I&quot;&gt;&quot;Islam&quot;, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt; Abbasid influence had been consumed by the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] (a Muslim Turkish clan which had migrated into mainland Persia) by 1055.&lt;ref name=&quot;B.a-d&quot; /&gt;

Expansion continued, sometimes by force, sometimes by peaceful [[Dawah|proselytising]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI-Islam&quot;/&gt; The first stage in the [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent|conquest of India]] began just before the year 1000. By some 200 (from 1193 — 1209) years later, the area up to the [[Ganges river]] had fallen. In sub-Saharan West Africa, Islam was established just after the year 1000. Muslim rulers were in [[Kanem Region|Kanem]] starting from sometime between 1081 to 1097, with reports of a Muslim prince at the head of [[Gao]] as early as 1009. The [[Mali Empire|Islamic kingdoms associated with Mali]] reached prominence in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI-Islam&quot;/&gt;

The Abbasids developed initiatives aimed at greater Islamic unity. Different sects of the Islamic faith and mosques, separated by doctrine, history, and practice, were pushed to cooperate. The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking the Umayyads' moral character and administration. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], &quot;The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of Marw with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the [[kinship]]-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. Islamic [[ecumenism]], promoted by the Abbasids, refers to the idea of unity of the ''[[Ummah]]'' in the literal meaning: that there was a single faith. Islamic philosophy developed as the [[Shariah]] was codified, and the four [[Madhabs]] were established. This era also saw the rise of classical [[Sufism]]. Religious achievements included completion of the canonical collections of [[Hadith]] of [[Sahih Bukhari]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam recognized to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the Qur'an identifying [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], and &quot;[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]&quot; or &quot;baptists&quot; (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandean]]s and related Mesopotamian groups) as &quot;[[people of the book]]&quot;. Toward the beginning of the high Middle Ages, the doctrines of the [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]], two major [[Islamic schools and branches|denominations of Islam]], solidified and the [[divisions of the world in Islam|divisions of the world]] theologically would form. These trends would continue into the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods.

Politically, the Abbasid Caliphate evolved into an Islamic [[monarchy]] ([[unitary state|unitary system of government]].) The regional [[Sultanate]] and [[Emirate]] governors' existence, validity, or legality were acknowledged for unity of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khaddūrī|2002|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early Islamic philosophy]] of the [[#Berbers and Iberian Umayyads|Iberian Umayyads]], [[Averroes]] presented  an argument in ''The Decisive Treatise'', providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official [[Ash'ari]] theology; thus, [[Averroism]] has been considered a precursor to modern [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Wahab El Messeri.

According to Arab sources in the year 750, [[Al-Saffah]], the founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, launched a massive rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate from the province of Khurasan near Talas. After eliminating the entire Umayyad family and achieving victory at the [[Battle of the Zab]], Al-Saffah and his forces marched into Damascus and founded a new dynasty. His forces confronted many regional powers and consolidated the realm of the Abbasid Caliphate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In [[Al-Mansur]]'s time, Persian scholarship emerged. Many non-Arabs converted to Islam. The Umayyads actively discouraged conversion in order to continue the collection of the jizya, or the tax on non-Muslims. Islam nearly doubled within its territory from 8% of residents in 750 to 15% by the end of Al-Mansur's reign. [[Al-Mahdi]], whose name means &quot;Rightly-guided&quot; or &quot;Redeemer&quot;, was proclaimed caliph when his father was on his deathbed. Baghdad blossomed during Al-Mahdi's reign, becoming the world's largest city. It attracted immigrants from Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Persia and as far away as India and Spain. Baghdad was home to Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Zoroastrians, in addition to the growing Muslim population. Like his father [[Al-Hadi]] was very open to his people and allowed citizens to address him in the palace at Baghdad. He was considered an &quot;enlightened ruler&quot;, and continued the progressive policies of his Abbasid predecessors. His short rule was plagued by military conflicts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|An Arabic manuscript written under the second half of the Abbasid Era.]]
The military conflicts subsided as [[Harun al-Rashid]] ruled. His reign was marked by scientific, cultural and religious prosperity. He established the library [[Bayt al-Hikma]] (&quot;House of Wisdom&quot;), and the arts and music flourished during his reign. The [[Barmakid]] family played a decisive role in establishing the Caliphate, but declined during his rule.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to signed pledges during a pilgrimage to Mecca, [[Al-Amin]] received the Caliphate from his father Harun Al-Rashid. Al-Amin faced internal rebellions. General [[Tahir ibn Husayn]] rebelled and [[Siege of Baghdad (812–813)|besieged Baghdad]]. Tahir led reinforcements to regain positions lost by another officer. When Tahir pushed into the city, Al-Amin sought to negotiate safe passage. Tahir agreed on the condition Al-Amin turn over his [[sceptre]], [[seal (emblem)|seal]] and other signs that he was caliph. Al-Amin tried to leave on a boat and rejected warnings that he wait. Tahir's forces attacked the boat and Al-Amin was thrown into the water. He swam to shore where he was captured and executed. His head was placed on the Al Anbar Gate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Regional powers===
The Abbasids soon became caught in a three-way rivalry among [[Copt]]ic Arabs, [[Indo-Persian]]s, and immigrant Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the cost of running a large empire became too great.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lapidus|1988|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks, Egyptians, and Arabs adhered to the Sunnite sect; the Persians,  a great portion of the Turkic groups, and several of the princes in India were Shia. The political unity of Islam began to disintegrate. Under the influence of the Abbasid caliphs, independent dynasties appeared in the Muslim world and the caliphs recognized such dynasties as legitimately Muslim. The first was the [[Tahirid dynasty]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which was founded during the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s reign. Similar dynasties included the [[Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]] and [[Seljuqs]]. During this time, advancements were made in the areas of astronomy, poetry, philosophy, science, and mathematics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Upon Al-Amin's death, [[Al-Ma'mun]] became Caliph. Al-Ma'mun extended the Abbasid empire's territory during his reign and dealt with rebellions.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu rebellions in Sindh were put down, and most of Afghanistan was absorbed with the surrender of the leader of Kabul. Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of Turkestan. There were disturbances in Iraq during the first several years of Al-Ma'mun's reign. Egypt continued to be unquiet. Sindh was rebellious, but Ghassan ibn Abbad subdued it. An ongoing problem for Al-Ma'mun was the uprising headed by Babak Khorramdin. In 214 Babak routed a Caliphate army, killing its commander Muhammad ibn Humayd.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ma'mun had been named governor of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor of his military services in order to assure his loyalty. Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became powerful, frustrating Al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the [[Tahirid dynasty]] became a threat as Al-Ma'mun's own policies alienated them and other opponents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Al-Ma'mun worked to centralize power and ensure a smooth succession. Al-Mahdi proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy. Religious scholars averred that Al-Ma'mun was overstepping his bounds in the ''[[Mihna]]'', the [[Abbasid inquisition]] which he introduced in 833 four months before he died.&lt;ref&gt;The Mihna subjected traditionalist scholars with social influence and intellectual quality to imprisonment, religious tests, and loyalty oaths. Al-Ma'mun introduced the Mihna with the intention to centralize religious power in the caliphal institution and test the loyalty of his subjects. The Mihna had to be undergone by elites, scholars, judges and other government officials, and consisted of a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The central question was about the state of the creation of the Qur'an: if the person interrogated stated he believed the Qur'an to be created, he was free to leave and continue his profession.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ulama]]'' emerged as a force in Islamic politics during Al-Ma'mun's reign for opposing the inquisitions. The ''Ulema'' and the major Islamic law schools took shape in the period of Al-Ma'mun. In parallel, Sunnism became defined as a religion of laws. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi'a Islam became more pronounced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During the Al-Ma'mun regime, [[List of border conflicts|border war]]s increased. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign, but died while leading an expedition in [[Sardis]]. Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated well and with tolerance. He sent an emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there, and had them translated into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;It is said that, had he been victorious over the Byzantine Emperor, Al-Ma'mun would have made a condition of peace be that the emperor hand over of a copy of the &quot;Almagest&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scientists originated [[alchemy]]. Shortly before his death, during a visit to Egypt in 832, the caliph ordered the breaching of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Giza]] to search for knowledge and treasure. Workers tunneled in near where tradition located the original entrance. Al-Ma'mun later died near Tarsus under questionable circumstances and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Al-Mu'tasim]], rather than his son, Al-Abbas ibn Al-Ma'mun.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As Caliph, Al-Mu'tasim promptly ordered the dismantling of al-Ma'mun's military base at Tyana. He faced Khurramite revolts. One of the most difficult problems facing this Caliph was the ongoing uprising of Babak Khorramdin. Al-Mu'tasim overcame the rebels and secured a significant victory. [[Theophilos (emperor)|Byzantine emperor Theophilus]] launched an attack against Abbasid fortresses. Al-Mu'tasim sent Al-Afshin, who met and defeated Theophilus' forces at the [[Battle of Anzen]]. On his return he became aware of a serious military conspiracy which forced him and his successors to rely upon Turkish commanders and [[ghilman]] slave-soldiers (foreshadowing the [[Mamluk]] system). The Khurramiyyah were never fully suppressed, although they slowly declined during the reigns of succeeding Caliphs. Near the end of al-Mu'tasim's life there was an uprising in Palestine, but he defeated the rebels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During Al-Mu'tasim's reign, the Tahirid dynasty continued to grow in power. The Tahirids were exempted from many tribute and oversight functions. Their independence contributed to Abbasid decline in the east. Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim followed his half-brother al-Ma'mun. He continued his predecessor's support for the Islamic Mu'tazila sect, applying brutal torture against the opposition. Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] was employed by Al-Mu'tasim and tutored the Caliph's son. Al-Kindi had served at the House of Wisdom and continued his studies in Greek geometry and algebra under the caliph's patronage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Al-Wathiq]] succeeded his father. Al-Wathiq dealt with opposition in Arabia, Syria, Palestine and in Baghdad. Using a famous sword he personally joined the execution of the Baghdad rebels. The revolts were the result of an increasingly large gap between Arab populations and the Turkish armies. The revolts were put down, but antagonism between the two groups grew, as Turkish forces gained power. He also secured a captive exchange with the Byzantines. Al-Wathiq was a patron of scholars, as well as artists. He personally had musical talent and is reputed to have composed over one hundred songs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[File:Great Mosque of Samarra.jpg|thumb|[[Malwiya|Minaret]] at the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]].]]
When Al-Wathiq died of high fever, [[Al-Mutawakkil]] succeeded him. Al-Mutawakkil's reign is remembered for many reforms and is viewed as a golden age. He was the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death the dynasty fell into decline. Al-Mutawakkil ended the Mihna. Al-Mutawakkil built the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]&lt;ref&gt;Its minarets were spiraling cones {{convert|55|m|ft}} high with a spiral ramp, and it had 17 aisles with walls paneled with mosaics of dark blue glass.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. During his reign, Al-Mutawakkil met famous Byzantine theologian [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine the Philosopher]], who was sent to strengthen diplomatic relations between the Empire and the Caliphate by [[Michael III|Emperor Michael III]]. Al-Mutawakkil involved himself in religious debates, as reflected in his actions against minorities. The Shīʻi faced repression embodied in the destruction of the [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine of Hussayn ibn ʻAlī]], an action that was ostensibly carried out to stop pilgrimages. Al-Mutawakkil continued to rely on Turkish statesmen and slave soldiers to put down rebellions and lead battles against foreign empires, notably capturing Sicily from the Byzantines. Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a Turkish soldier.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Al-Muntasir]] succeeded to the Caliphate on the same day with the support of the Turkish faction, though he was implicated in the murder. The Turkish party had al-Muntasir remove his brothers from the line of succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. Both brothers wrote statements of abdication. During his reign, Al-Muntasir removed the ban on pilgrimage to the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn and sent Wasif to raid the Byzantines. Al-Muntasir died of unknown causes. The Turkish chiefs held a council to select his successor, electing [[Al-Musta'in]]. The Arabs and western troops from Baghdad were displeased at the choice and attacked. However, the Caliphate no longer depended on Arabian choice, but depended on Turkish support. After the failed Muslim campaign against the Christians, people blamed the Turks for bringing disaster on the faith and murdering their Caliphs. After the Turks besieged Baghdad, Al-Musta'in planned to abdicate to [[Al-Mu'tazz]] but was put to death by his order. Al-Mu'tazz was enthroned by the Turks, becoming the youngest Abbasaid Caliph to assume power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Al-Mu'tazz proved too apt a pupil of his Turkish masters, but was surrounded by parties jealous of each other. At [[Samarra]], the Turks were having problems with the &quot;Westerns&quot; (Berbers and [[Moor (people)|Moor]]s), while the Arabs and Persians at Baghdad, who had supported al-Musta'in, regarded both with equal hatred. Al-Mu'tazz put his brothers Al-Mu'eiyyad and Abu Ahmed to death. The ruler spent recklessly, causing a revolt of Turks, Africans, and Persians for their pay. Al-Mu'tazz was brutally deposed shortly thereafter. [[Al-Muhtadi]] became the next Caliph. He was firm and virtuous compared to the earlier Caliphs, though the Turks held the power. The Turks killed him soon after his ascension. [[Al-Mu'tamid]] followed, holding on for 23 years, though he was largely a ruler in name only. After the [[Zanj Rebellion]], Al-Mu'tamid summoned [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|al-Muwaffak]] to help him. Thereafter, Al-Muwaffaq ruled in all but name. The [[Hamdanid dynasty]] was founded by [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]] when he was appointed governor of [[Mardin]] in Anatolia by the Caliphs in 890. Al-Mu'tamid later transferred authority to his son, [[al-Mu'tadid]], and never regained power. The [[Tulunids]] became the first independent state in Islamic Egypt, when they broke away during this time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Al-Mu'tadid ably administered the Caliphate. Egypt returned to allegiance and Mesopotamia was restored to order. He was tolerant towards Shi'i, but toward the Umayyad community he was not so just. Al-Mu'tadid was cruel in his punishments, some of which are not surpassed by those of his predecessors. For example, the Kharijite leader at Mosul was paraded about Baghdad clothed in a robe of silk, of which Kharijites denounced as sinful, and then crucified. Upon Al-Mu'tadid's death, his son by a Turkish slave-girl, [[Al-Muktafi]], succeeded to the throne.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Al-Muktafi became a favorite of the people for his generosity, and for abolishing his father's secret prisons, the terror of Baghdad. During his reign, the Caliphate overcame threats such as the [[Carmathians]]. &lt;!-- prevailed more or less with the Byzantines, who were not slow to take advantage of the Caliphate's difficulties.what does this mean? hostilities do not prevail. one or the other combatants might. &quot;War was kept up with various fortune on both sides.&quot; Did the fortunes fund the war or did both sides have success?--&gt; Upon Al-Muktafi's death, the vazir next chose [[Al-Muqtadir]]. Al-Muqtadir's reign was a constant succession of thirteen Vazirs, one rising on the fall or assassination of another. His long reign brought the Empire to its lowest ebb. Africa was lost, and Egypt nearly. Mosul threw off its dependence, and the Greeks raided across  the undefended border. The East continued to formally recognise the Caliphate, including those who virtually claimed independence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

At the end of the Early Baghdad Abbasids period, Empress [[Zoe Karbonopsina]] pressed for an armistice with Al-Muqtadir and arranged for the ransom of the Muslim prisoner&lt;ref&gt;A sum of 120,000 golden pieces was paid for the freedom of the captives.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Byzantine frontier was threatened by Bulgarians. This only added to Baghdad's disorder. Though despised by the people, Al-Muqtadir was again placed in power after upheavals. Al-Muqtadir was eventually slain outside the city gates, whereupon courtiers chose his brother [[al-Qahir]]. He was even worse. Refusing to abdicate, he was blinded and cast into prison.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

His son [[Ar-Radi]] took over only to experience a cascade of misfortune. Praised for his piety, he became the tool of the de facto ruling Minister, [[Ibn Raik]] (''[[amir al-umara]]''; 'Amir of the Amirs'). Ibn Raik held the reins of government and his name was joined with the Caliph's in public prayers. Around this period, the [[Hanbali]]s, supported by popular sentiment, set up in fact a kind of 'Sunni inquisition'. Ar-Radi is commonly regarded as the last of the real Caliphs: the last to deliver orations at the Friday service, to hold assemblies, to commune with philosophers, to discuss the questions of the day, to take counsel on the affairs of State;  to distribute [[Alms and Almsgiving|alms]], or to temper the severity of cruel officers. Thus ended the Early Baghdad Abbasids.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the late mid-930s, the [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] of Egypt carried the Arabic title &quot;Wali&quot; reflecting their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids, The first governor ([[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid]]) was installed by the Abbasid Caliph. They gave him and his descendants the Wilayah for 30 years. The last name Ikhshid is Soghdian for &quot;prince&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Also in the 930s, [['Imad al-Daula|‘Alī ibn Būyah]] and his two younger brothers, [[Rukn al-Daula|al-Hassan]] and [[Mu'izz al-Daula|Aḥmad]] founded the [[Buyid dynasty|Būyid confederation]]. Originally a soldier in the service of the [[Ziyarids|Ziyārīds]] of [[Tabaristan|Ṭabaristān]], ‘Alī was able to recruit an army to defeat a Turkish general from [[Baghdad]] named [[Yaqut|Yāqūt]] in 934. Over the next nine years the three brothers gained control of the remainder of the caliphate, while accepting the titular authority of the caliph in Baghdad. The Būyids made large territorial gains. [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Jibal]] were conquered. Central Iraq submitted in 945, before the Būyids took [[Kerman|Kermān]] (967), [[Oman]] (967), the [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazīra]] (979), Ṭabaristān (980), and [[Gorgan]] (981). After this the Būyids went into slow decline, with pieces of the confederation gradually breaking off and local dynasties under their rule becoming ''de facto'' independent.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the former include the loss of [[Mosul]] in 990, and the loss of Ṭabaristān and Gurgān in 997. An example of the latter is the [[Kakuyids|Kakūyid]] dynasty of [[Isfahan|Isfahān]], whose fortunes rose with the decline of the Būyids of northern Iran.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Caliphate had become of little importance. The ''amir al-umara'' [[Bajkam]] contented himself with dispatching his secretary to Baghdad to assemble local dignitaries to elect a successor. The choice fell on [[Al-Muttaqi]]. Bajkam was killed on a hunting party by marauding Kurds. In the ensuing anarchy in Baghdad, Ibn Raik persuaded the Caliph to flee to Mosul where he was welcomed by the Hamdanids. They assassinated Ibn Raik. Hamdanid [[Nasir al-Dawla]] advanced on Baghdad, where mercenaries and well-organised Turks repelled them. Turkish general [[Tuzun]] became ''amir al-umara''. The Turks were staunch Sunnis. A fresh conspiracy placed the Caliph in danger. Hamdanid troops helped ad-Daula escape to Mosul and then to Nasibin. Tuzun and the Hamdanid were stalemated. Al-Muttaqi was at [[Ar Raqqah]], moving to Tuzun where he was deposed. Tuzun installed the blinded Caliph's cousin as successor, with the title of [[Al-Mustakfi]]. With the new Caliph, Tuzun attacked the [[Buwayhid dynasty]] and the [[Hamdanids]]. Soon after, Tuzun died, and was succeeded by one of his generals, Abu Ja'far. The Buwayhids then attacked Baghdad, and Abu Ja'far fled into hiding with the Caliph. Buwayhid Sultan Muiz ud-Daula assumed command forcing the Caliph into abject submission to the Amir. Eventually, Al-Mustakfi was blinded and deposed. The city fell into chaos, and the Caliph's palace was looted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Once the Buwayhids controlled Baghdad, [[Al-Muti]] became caliph. The office was shorn of real power and Shi'a observances were established. The Buwayhids held on Baghdad for over a century. Throughout the Buwayhid reign the Caliphate was at its lowest ebb, but was recognized religiously, except in [[Iberia]]. Buwayhid Sultan [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] was prevented from raising a Shi'a Caliph to the throne by fear for his own safety, and fear of rebellion,  in the capital and beyond.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The next Caliph, [[Al-Ta'i]], reigned over factional strife in Syria among the Fatimids, Turks, and Carmathians. The Hideaway dynasyty also fractured. The Abbasid borders were the defended only by small border states. Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimisces]] attacked and deposed Al-Ta'i.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

By 1000 the global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 per cent of the world total compared to the Christian population of 10 per cent. [[Al-Qadir]] was recalled and appointed to the office. During his Caliphate, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] looked after the empire. The great Mahmud of Ghazni, of Eastern fame, was friendly towards the Caliphs, and his victories in the Indian Empire were accordingly announced from the pulpits of Baghdad in grateful and glowing terms. Al-Qadir fostered the Sunni struggle against Shiʿism and outlawed heresies such as the [[Baghdad Manifesto]] and the doctrine that the Qu'ran was created. He outlawed the [[Muʿtazila]], bringing an end to the development of rationalist Muslim philosophy. During this and the next  period, [[Islamic literature]], especially [[Persian literature]], flourished under the patronage of the Buwayhids.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During [[Al-Qa'im (caliph)|Al-Qa'im]]'s reign, the Buwayhid ruler often fled the capital and the Seljuq dynasty gained power. [[Toghrül]] overran Syria and Armenia. He then made his way into the Capital, where he was well-received both by chiefs and people. In [[Bahrain]], the Qarmatian state collapsed in [[Al-Hasa]]. Arabia recovered from the Fatimids and again acknowledged the spiritual jurisdiction of the Abbasids. [[Al-Muqtadi]] was honored by the Seljuq Sultan [[Malik-Shah I]], during whose reign the Caliphate was recognized throughout the extending range of Seljuq conquest. The Sultan was critical of the Caliph's interference in affairs of state, but died before deposing the last of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The Late Baghdad Abbasids reigned from the beginning of the [[Crusades]] to the [[Seventh Crusade]]. The first Caliph was [[Al-Mustazhir]]. He was politically irrelevant, despite civil strife at home and the [[First Crusade]] in Syria. [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] attempted to attack Baghdad, losing at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. The global Muslim population climbed to about 5 per cent as against the Christian population of 11 per cent by 1100. [[Jerusalem]] was captured by crusaders who massacred its inhabitants. Preachers travelled throughout the caliphate proclaiming the tragedy and rousing men to recover the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] from the ''[[Franks]]'' (European Crusaders). Crowds of exiles rallied for war against the [[infidel]]. Neither the Sultan nor the Caliph sent an army west.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Al-Mustarshid]] achieved more independence while the sultan [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq]] was engaged in war in the East. The [[Bani Assad|Banu Mazyad]] (Mazyadid State) general, Dubays ibn Sadaqa&lt;ref&gt;ʻIzz al-Dīn Ibn al-Athīr, Donald Sidney Richards, ''The chronicle of Ibn al-Athīr for the crusading period from al-Kāmil fī'l-ta'rīkh: The years 491-541/1097-1146 : the coming of the Franks and the Muslim response''.&lt;/ref&gt; (emir of [[Al-Hilla]]), plundered [[Bosra]] and attacked Baghdad together with a young brother of the sultan, [[Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud]]. Dubays was crushed by a Seljuq army under [[Zengi]], founder of the [[Zengid dynasty]]. Mahmud's death was followed by a civil war between his son Dawud, his nephew Mas'ud and the atabeg Toghrul II. Zengi was recalled to the East, stimulated by the Caliph and Dubays, where he was beaten. The Caliph then laid siege to Mosul for three months without success, resisted by Mas'ud and Zengi. It was nonetheless a milestone in the caliphate's military revival.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

After the siege of Damascus (1134),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Richard, The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem: Volume 1. 1979. Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Zengi undertook [[Military history of the Crusader states#War with the Zengids|operations in Syria]]. Al-Mustarshid attacked sultan Mas'ud of western Seljuq and was taken prisoner. He was later found murdered.&lt;ref&gt;It is supposed by an emissary of the [[Hashshashins]], who had no love for the Caliph. Modern historians have suspected that Mas'ud instigated the murder although the two most important historians of the period Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Jawzi did not speculate on this matter.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Al-Rashid (Abbasid Caliph)|Al-Rashid]] failed to gain independence from Seljuq Turks. Zengi, because of the murder of Dubays, set up a rival Sultanate. Mas'ud attacked; the Caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The Sultan regained power, a council was held, the Caliph was deposed, and his uncle, son of [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|Al-Muqtafi]], appointed as the new Caliph. Ar-Rashid fled to [[Isfahan]] and was killed by Hashshashins.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Continued disunion and contests between Seljuq Turks allowe4d al-Muqtafi to maintain control in Baghdad and to extend it throughout Iraq. In 1139, al-Muqtafi granted protection to the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] patriarch [[Abdisho III]]. While the Crusade raged, the Caliph successfully defended Baghdad against Muhammad II of Seljuq in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1157)]]. The Sultan and the Caliph dispatched men in response to Zengi's appeal, but neither the Seljuqs, nor the Caliph, nor their Amirs, dared resist the Crusaders.

The next caliph, [[Al-Mustanjid]], saw  [[Saladin]] extinguish the [[Fatimid dynasty]] after 260 years, and thus the Abbasids again prevailed. [[Al-Mustadi]] reigned when Saladin become the sultan of Egypt and declared allegiance to the Abbasids.

[[An-Nasir]], &quot;''The Victor for the Religion of God''&quot;, attempted to restore the Caliphate to its ancient dominant role. He consistently held Iraq from Tikrit to the Gulf without interruption. His forty-seven year reign was chiefly marked by ambitious and corrupt dealings with the Tartar chiefs, and by his hazardous invocation of the Mongols, which ended his  dynasty. His son, [[Az-Zahir (Abbasid caliph)|Az-Zahir]], was Caliph for a short period before his death and An-Nasir's grandson, [[Al-Mustansir (caliph)|Al-Mustansir]], was made caliph.

Al-Mustansir founded the [[Mustansiriya Madrasah]]. In 1236 [[Ögedei Khan]] commanded to raise up [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]]&lt;!-- what does &quot;to raise up&quot; mean here?--&gt; and populated [[Herat]]. The Mongol military governors mostly made their camp in [[Mughan plain]], Azerbaijan. The rulers of [[Mosul]] and [[Cilician Armenia]] surrendered. Chormaqan divided the [[Transcaucasia]] region into three districts based on military hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigor of Akanc-The history of the nation of archers, (tr. R.P.Blake) 303&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia, the population were temporarily divided into eight [[tumens]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalistriat Salia-History of the Georguan Nation, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia, excluding [[Abbasid]] Iraq and [[Ismaili]] strongholds, and all of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Allsen-Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Al-Musta'sim]] was the last Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad and is noted for his opposition to the rise of Shajar al-Durr to the Egyptian throne during the Seventh Crusade. To the east, Mongol forces under [[Hulagu Khan]] swept through the [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Baghdad was sacked]] and the caliph deposed soon afterwards. The Mamluk sultans and Syria later appointed a powerless Abbasid Caliph in Cairo.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The Abbasid &quot;shadow&quot; caliph of Cairo reigned under the tutelage of the [[Mamluk]] sultans and nominal rulers used to legitimize the actual rule of the Mamluk sultans. All the Cairene Abbasid caliphs who preceded or succeeded [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|Al-Musta'in]] were spiritual heads lacking any temporal power. Al-Musta'in was the only Cairo-based Abbasid caliph to even briefly hold political power. [[Al-Mutawakkil III]] was the last &quot;shadow&quot; caliph. In 1517, Ottoman sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluk Sultanate, and made Egypt part of the Ottoman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

&quot;Islamic Cairo&quot; building was named after [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], built by Fatimid vizier [[Gawhar Al-Siqilli]], and extended by [[Badr al-Jamali]].]]

The [[Fatimids]] originated in [[Ifriqiya]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]] and eastern [[Algeria]]). The dynasty was founded in 909 by {{unicode|[[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah|ʻAbdullāh al-Mahdī Billah]]}}, who legitimised his claim through descent from Muhammad by way of his daughter [[Fatimah|Fātima as-Zahra]] and her husband {{unicode|[[Ali ibn Abi Talib|ʻAlī ibn-Abī-Tālib]]}}, the first {{unicode|Shīʻa}} [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imām]], hence the name ''al-Fātimiyyūn'' &quot;Fatimid&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Abdullāh al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, which he ruled from [[Mahdia]], his capital in Tunisia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The Fatimids entered Egypt in the late 10th century, conquering the [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] and founding a capital at ''al-Qāhira''([[Cairo]]) in 969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm |title=Cairo, a Millennial |accessdate=2007-08-09 |first=Irene |last=Beeson |pages=24, 26–30 |month=September/October |year=1969 |journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to the planet Mars, &quot;The Subduer&quot;, which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction started. Cairo was intended as a royal enclosure for the Fatimid caliph and his army, though the actual administrative and economic capital of Egypt was in cities such as [[Fustat]] until 1169.  After Egypt, the Fatimids continued to conquer surrounding areas until they ruled from Tunisia to Syria and even crossed the Mediterranean into Sicily and southern Italy.

Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa, Sicily, [Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Yemen and the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, R. (2008). An introduction to Islam for Jews. Philadelphia: JPS/Jewish Publication Society. Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its [[Song Dynasty]], which determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]].

Unlike other governments in the area, Fatimid advancement in state offices was based more on merit than heredity. Members of other branches of Islam, including Sunnis, were just as likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance covered non-Muslims such as Christians and Jews; they took high levels in government based on ability.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, J.-E., Redissi, H., &amp; Ṣaydāwī, R. (2009). Religion and politics: Islam and Muslim civilization. Farnham, England: Ashgate Pub. Company. Page 83&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, exceptions to this general attitude of tolerance, notably [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]].

The Fatimid palace was in two parts. It was in the [[Khan el-Khalili]] area at Bin El-Quasryn street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm  Cairo_of_the_mind, oldroads.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Fatimid Caliphs claimed spiritual supremacy not only in Egypt, but also contested the religious leadership of Syria. At the beginning of the Abbasid realm in Baghdad, the Alids faced severe persecution by the ruling party as they were a direct threat to the Caliphate. Owing to the Abbasid inquisitions, the forefathers opted for concealment of the Dawa's existence. Subsequently, they traveled towards the Iranian Plateau and distanced themselves from the epicenter of the political world. Al Mahdi's father, Al Husain al Mastoor returned to control the Dawa's affairs. He sent two Dai's to Yemen and Western Africa. Al Husain died soon after the birth of his son, Al Mahdi. A system of information gatherers helped update Al Mahdi on each development which took place in North Africa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Al Mahdi established the first [[Imam]] of the Fatimid dynasty. He claimed genealogic origins dating as far back as Fatimah through Husayn and Ismail. Al Mahdi established his headquarters at Salamiyah and moved towards north-western Africa, under [[Aghlabid]] rule. His success of laying claim to being the precursor to the Mahdi was instrumental among the Berber tribes of North Africa, specifically the Kutamah tribe. Al Mahdi established himself at the former Aghlabid residence at Raqqadah, a suburb of [[Al-Qayrawan]] in Tunisia. At the time of his death he had extended his reign to Morocco of the [[Idrisids]], as well as Egypt itself. In 920, Al Mahdi took up residence at the newly established capital of the empire, [[Al-Mahdiyyah]]. After his death, Al Mahdi was succeeded by his son, Abu Al-Qasim Muhammad Al-Qaim, who continued his expansionist policy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Berbers and Iberian Umayyads ===

{{Main|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Taifa}}

The Arabs, under the command of the Berber General [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]], first began their conquest of southern Spain or al-Andalus in 711. A raiding party led by Tarik was sent to intervene in a civil war in the [[Visigothic kingdom]] in [[Hispania]]. Crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (named after the General), it won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] was defeated and killed on July 19 at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]] crossed with substantial reinforcements, and by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula. Some later Arabic and Christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain [[Ṭārif]] in 710 and also, the [[Ad Sebastianum]] recension of the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'', refers to an Arab attack incited by [[Erwig]] during the reign of [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]] (672–80). The two large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought.&lt;ref name=Collins2004139&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2004|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rulers of Al-Andalus were granted the rank of [[Emir]] by the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] in [[Damascus]]. After the [[Abbasids]] came to power, some Umayyads fled to Muslim Spain to establish themselves there. By the end of the 10th century, the ruler [[Abd al-Rahman III]] took over the title of ''[[Caliphate of Córdoba|Emir of Córdoba]]''(912-961).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hourani 1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the Umayyads went on developing a strengthened state with its capital as [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. [[Al-Hakam II]] succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Christian kingdoms of northern Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glubb |first=John Bagot|authorlink=|editor= |others= |title=The course of empire: The Arabs and their successors |origdate= |origyear=|origmonth= |url=|format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=|language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=128 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glick |first=Thomas F. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Islamic and Christian Spain in the early Middle Ages |origdate= |origyear=|origmonth= |url= |format=|accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2005|publisher=BRILL|location= |language=|isbn=90-04-14771-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=102 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economical development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets.

[[Abd al-Rahman I]] and Bedr (a former Greek slave) escaped with their lives after the popular revolt known as the [[Abbasid Revolution]]. Rahman I continued south through Palestine, the Sinai, and then into Egypt. Rahman I was one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make a perilous trek to Ifriqiya at this time. Rahman I and Bedr reached modern day Morocco near [[Ceuta]]. Next step would be to cross to sea to al-Andalus, where Rahman I could not have been sure whether he would be welcome. Following the [[Berber Revolt]] (740s), the province was in a state of confusion, with the [[Ummah]] torn by tribal dissensions among the Arabs and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers. Bedr lined up three Syrian commanders – [[Obeid Allah ibn Uthman]] and [[Abd Allah ibn Khalid]], both originally of Damascus, and Yusuf ibn Bukht of Qinnasrin and contacted al-Sumayl (then in [[Zaragoza]]) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Rahman I would try to make himself emir. After discussion with Yemenite commanders, Rahman I was told to go to al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, he  set off with Bedr and a small group of followers for Europe. Abd al-Rahman landed at [[Almuñécar]] in al-Andalus, to the east of [[Málaga]].

During his brief time in Málaga, he quickly amassed local support. News of the prince's arrival spread throughout the peninsula. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he took advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman and his followers were able to [[Zaragoza#Arab Saraqusta|control Zaragoza]]. Rahman I fought to rule al-Andalus in a battle at the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir river]], just outside of Córdoba on the plains of Musarah (Battle of Musarah). Rahman I was victorious, chasing his enemies from the field with parts of their army. Rahman I marched into the capital, Córdoba, fighting off a [[counterattack]], but negotiations ended the confrontation. After Rahman I consolidated power, he proclaimed himself the al-Andalus emir. Rahman I did not claim the Muslim caliph, though.&lt;ref&gt;This was likely because al-Andalus was a land besieged by many different loyalties, and the proclamation of caliph would have likely caused much unrest. Abd al-Rahman's progeny would, however, take up the title of caliph.&lt;/ref&gt; The last step was to have al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, garroted in Córdoba's jail. Al-Andalus was a [[wikt:safe haven|safe haven]] for the house of Umayya that managed to evade the Abbasids.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In Baghdad, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]] had planned to depose the emir. Rahman I and his army confronted the Abbasids, killing most of the Abbasid army. The main Abbasid leaders were decapitated, their heads preserved in salt, with identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at Mecca. Rahman I quelled repeated rebellions in al-Andalus. Near the end of his life, it is said that Abd al-Rahman became increasingly paranoid and sequestered himself in his palaces.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[File:Lamezquitacordoba.jpg|thumb|The exterior of the Mezquita.]]
Rahman I's successor was his son [[Hisham I]]. Born in Córdoba, he built many [[mosque]]s and completed the [[Mezquita]]. He called for a [[jihad]] that resulted in a campaign against the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and the [[County of Toulouse]]; in this second campaign he was defeated at Orange by [[William of Gellone]], first cousin to [[Charlemagne]]. His successor [[Al-Hakam I]] came to power and was challenged by his uncles, other sons of Rahman I. One, Abdallah, went to the court of Charlemagne in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] to negotiate for aid. In the mean time Córdoba was attacked, but was defended. Hakam I spent much of his reign suppressing rebellions in Toledo, Saragossa and Mérida.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Abd ar-Rahman II]] succeeded his father and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], whose southward advance he halted. Rahman III repulsed an assault by [[Vikings]] who had disembarked in [[Cadiz]], conquered [[Seville]] (with the exception of its [[citadel]]) and attacked Córdoba. Thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval [[arsenal]] at [[Seville]] to repel future raids.  He responded to [[William of Septimania]]'s requests of assistance in his struggle against [[Charles the Bald]]'s nominations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad I]]'s reign was marked by the movements of the [[Muladi]] (ethnic Iberian Muslims) and [[Mozarab]]s (Muslim-Iberia Christians). Muhammad I was succeeded by his son [[Al-Mundhir of Córdoba|Mundhir I]]. During the reign of his father, Mundhir I commanded military operations against the neighbouring Christian kingdoms and the Muladi rebellions. At his father's death, he inherited the throne. During his two year reign, Mundhir I fought against [[Umar ibn Hafsun]]. He died in 888 at Bobastro, succeeded by his brother [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi]].

Umawi showed no reluctance to dispose of those he viewed as a threat. His government was marked by continuous wars between Arabs, Berbers and Muladi. His power as emir was confined to the area of Córdoba, while the rest had been seized by rebel families. The son he had designated as successor was killed by one of Umawi's brothers. The latter was in turn executed by Umawi's father, who named as successor [[Abd ar-Rahman III]], son of the killed son of Umawi.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Beginning in the 8th century, the [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Iberian Christian kingdoms]] had begun the [[Reconquista]] aimed at retaking Al-Andalus from the Moors. In 1095, [[Pope Urban II]], inspired by the conquests in Spain by Christian forces and implored by the [[Alexios I Komnenos|eastern Roman emperor]] to help defend Christianity in the East, called for the [[First Crusade]] from Western Europe which captured Odessa, [[Antioch]], [[Tripoli]] and Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the early period of the Crusades, the Christian [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] emerged and for a time controlled Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and other smaller [[Crusader kingdoms]] over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated politics of the [[Levant]], but did not in threaten the Islamic Caliphate nor other powers in the region. After [[Shirkuh]] ended Fatimid rule in 1169, uniting it with Syria, the Crusader kingdoms were faced with a threat, and his nephew Saladin reconquered most of the area in 1187, leaving the Crusaders holding a few ports.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the [[Third Crusade]] armies from Europe failed to recapture Jerusalem, though Crusader states lingered for several decades, and other crusades followed. The Christian Reconquista continued in Al-Andalus, and was eventually completed with the [[Granada War|fall of Granada]] in 1492. During the low period of the Crusades, the [[Fourth Crusade]] was diverted from the Levant and instead took [[Constantinople]], leaving the Eastern Roman Empire (now the Byzantine Empire) further weakened in their long struggle against the [[Turkish peoples]] to the east. However, the crusaders did manage to damage  Islamic caliphates; preventing them from further expansion into [[Christendom]] and targets of the Mamluks and the Mongols.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

====Ayyubid dynasty====
{{Main|Ayyubid dynasty}}
The [[Ayyubid dynasty]] was founded by [[Saladin]] and centered in Egypt. In 1174, Saladin proclaimed himself Sultan and conquered the Near East region. The Ayyubids ruled much of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries, controlling Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia. After Saladin, his sons contested control over the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil eventually established himself in 1200. In the 1230s, Syria's Ayyubid rulers attempted to win independence from Egypt and remained divided until Egyptian Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored Ayyubid unity by taking over most of Syria, excluding [[Aleppo]], by 1247. In 1250, the dynasty in the Egyptian region was overthrown by slave regiments. A number of attempts to recover it failed, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and wrested control of what remained of the Ayyubid territories soon after.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Mongol invasions===
{{See also|Ilkhanate|Golden Horde}}

[[Image:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ruler, [[Ghazan]], studying the [[Quran]].]]

After the Crusades the [[Mongol invasions|Mongols]] invaded in the 13th century, marking the end of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. Some historians assert that the eastern Islamic world never fully recovered. Under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]], The Mongols ended to the Abbasid era. The [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] began in 1219 at a huge cost in civilian life and economic devastation. The Mongols spread throughout Central Asia and Persia: the Persian city of [[Isfahan]] had fallen to them by 1237.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

With the election of Khan [[Möngke Khan|Mongke]] in 1251, Mongol targeted the Abbasid capital, Baghdad. Mongke's brother, [[Hulegu]], was made leader of the [[Mongol Army]] assigned to the task of subduing Baghdad. The [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Bagdhad]] in 1258 destroyed what had been the largest city in Islam.  The last Abbasid caliph, [[al-Musta'sim]], was captured and killed; and Baghdad was ransacked and destroyed. The cities of Damascus and Aleppo fell in 1260. Plans for the conquest of Egypt were delayed due to the death of Mongke at around the same time. The Abbasid army lost to the superior Mongol army, but the invaders were finally stopped by Egyptian Mamluks north of Jerusalem in 1260.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Ultimately, the [[Ilkhanate]], [[Golden Horde]], and the [[Chagatai Khanate]] - three of the four principal Mongol khanates - embraced Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'', Grolier Incorporated, p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The spread of Islam: the contributing factors By Abū al-Faz̤l ʻIzzatī, A. Ezzati, pg. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Islam in Russia: the four seasons By Ravilʹ Bukharaev, pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In power in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia and further east, over the rest of the 13th century gradually all converted to Islam. Most Ilkhanid rulers were replaced by the new Mongol power founded by [[Timur]] (himself a Muslim), who conquered Persia in the 1360s, and moved against the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in India and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in [[Anatolia]]. His invasions were equally destructive, sacking Bagdhad, [[Damascus]], [[Delhi]] and many other cities, with enormous loss of life. Timur had attacked areas still recovering from the [[Black Death]], which may have killed one third of the population of the Middle East. The plague began in China, and reached [[Alexandria]] in Egypt in 1347, spreading over the following years to most Islamic areas. The combination of the plague and the wars left the Middle Eastern Islamic world in a seriously weakened position. The [[Timurid dynasty]] would found had many branches of Islam, including the [[Mughals]] of India.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===The Mamluks===
In 1250, the Ayyubid Egyptian dynasty was overthrown by slave regiments, and the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was born. In the 1260s, the Mongols sacked and control the Islamic Near East territories. The Mamluks, who were [[Turkic people|Turkic]], forced out the Mongols (see [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]) after the final destruction of the Ayyubid dynasty. Thus they united Syria and Egypt for the longest interval between the Abbasid and Ottoman empires (1250–1517).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hourani&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mamluks experienced a continual state of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and economic competition between the &quot;Muslim territory&quot; ([[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House_of_Islam)|Dar al-Islam]]) and &quot;non-Muslim territory&quot; ([[Dar al-Harb]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As part of their chosen role as defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, the Mamluks sponsored many religious buildings, including mosques, [[madrasas]] and [[khanqahs]]. Though some construction took place in the provinces, the vast bulk of these projects expanded the capital. Many Mamluk buildings in Cairo survive, particularly in Old Cairo.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A former Mamluk slave who was born a prince, [[Aybak]] (known as ''Lion of Ain Jaloot'') replaced the Mamluks in 1250. Aybak, by then a general, married [[Shajar al-Durr]], the widow of Ayyubid caliph [[al-Salih Ayyub]]. Military prestige was at the center of Mamluk society, and it played a key role in the confrontations with the Mongol forces. After Aybak's assassination and the accession of [[Qutuz]] in 1259, the Mamluks challenged and routed the Mongols at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in late 1260. The Mongols were again defeated by the Mamluks at the [[First Battle of Homs|Battle of Hims]] a few months later, and then driven out of Syria altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot; /&gt; With this, the Mamluks were able to concentrate their forces and to conquer the last of the crusader territories in the Levant.

Through extensive trade and social interactions with their converted Muslim trading partners on the other side of the [[Red Sea]], in the [[Arabian peninsula]], merchants and sailors in the Horn region gradually came under the influence of the new religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sct&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014) A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic disciples fled to the port city of [[Zeila]] in modern-day northern [[Somalia]] to seek protection from the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] at the court of the [[Aksumite Empire|Aksumite Emperor]] in present-day Somalia. Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had by then all adopted Islam, and the major trading routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the Red Sea came under the sway of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Caliphs]]. Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard. These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large parts of the Horn region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sct&quot;/&gt;

[[Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]] was the first city founded by Muslims in the [[Maghreb]]. Arab general [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] erected the city (in 670) and, in the same time, the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=1176 Kairouan Capital of Political Power and Learning in the Ifriqiya (Muslim Heritage.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; considered as the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the western Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=kairouan+mosque+most+prestigious&amp;lr=&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=kairouan%20mosque%20most%20prestigious&amp;f=false  Clifford Edmund Bosworth, ''Historic cities of the Islamic world''.

This part of Islamic territory has had independent governments during most of Islamic history. The [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisid]] were the first Arab rulers in the western [[Maghreb]] (Morocco), ruling from 788 to 985. The dynasty is named after its first [[sultan]] [[Idris I]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Almoravid dynasty]] was a Berber dynasty from the [[Sahara]] flourished over a wide area of North-Western Africa and the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the 11th century. Under this dynasty the [[Moorish]] empire was extended over present-day Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Gibraltar, [[Tlemcen]] (in Algeria) and a part of what is now [[Senegal]] and [[Mali]] in the south, and Spain and Portugal in the north.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Almohad Dynasty]] or &quot;the Unitarians&quot;, were a Berber Muslim religious power which founded the fifth [[Moorish]] dynasty in the 12th century, and conquered all Northern Africa as far as Egypt, together with Al-Andalus.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

====Great Lakes====
Islam came to the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of South Eastern Africa along existing trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P.-J. (2004). Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal cultural corridor in the western Indian Ocean, 1799-1856. Leiden: Brill. Page 35&lt;/ref&gt; They learned from them the manners of the Muslims and this led to their conversion by the Muslim Arabs.

Local Islamic governments centered in [[Islam in Tanzania|Tanzania]] (then [[Zanzibar]]). The people of ''[[Zayd]]'' were Muslims that immigrated to the Great Lakes region. In the pre-colonial period, the structure of Islamic authority here was held up through the ''[[Ulema]]'' (''wanawyuonis'', in [[Swahili language]]). These leaders had some degree of authority over most of the Muslims in South East Africa before territorial boundaries were established. The chief [[Qadi]] there was recognized for having the final religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nimtz, Jr. |first=August H.  |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Islam and Politics in East Aftrica. the Sufi Order in Tanzania |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1980|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent}}
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], Islam first appeared in the southwestern tip of the peninsula, in today's [[Kerala]] state. Arabs traded with [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] even before the birth of Muhammad. Native legends say that a group of [[Sahaba]], under [[Malik Bin Deenar|Malik Ibn Deenar]], arrived on the [[Malabar Coast]] and preached Islam. According to that legend, [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|the first mosque of India]] was built by [[Kulasekhara|Second Chera]] King [[Rama Varma Kulashekhara|Cheraman Perumal]], who accepted Islam and received the name ''Tajudheen''. He traveled to Arabia to meet Muhammad and died on the trip back, somewhere in today's [[Oman]]. Historical records suggest that the [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|Cheraman Perumal Mosque]] was built in Hijra 5 (629).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Islamic rule came to India in the 8th century, when [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered [[Sindh]]. Muslim conquests expanded under [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]] and the [[Ghaznavids]] until the late 12th century, when the [[Ghurids]] overran the Ghaznavids and extended the conquests in Northern India. [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]] conquered [[Delhi]] in 1206 and began the reign of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the 14th century, [[Alauddin Khilji]] extended Muslim rule south to [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Deccan]]. Various other Muslim dynasties also formed and ruled across India from the 13th to the 18th century such as the [[Qutb Shahi]] and the [[Bahmani]], but none rivalled the power and extensive reach of the [[Mughal Empire]] at its peak.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In China, four Sahabas (Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas, Wahb Abu Kabcha, [[Jafar ibn Abu Talib]] and [[Jahsh]]) preached in 616/17 and onwards after following the [[Chittagong]]&amp;ndash;[[Kamrup]]&amp;ndash;[[Manipur]] route after sailing from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in 615/16. After conquering Persia in 636, Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas went with [[Sa'id ibn Zaid]], [[Qais ibn Sa'd]] and [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] to China in 637 taking the complete Quran. Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas headed for China for the third time in 650-51 after Caliph Uthman asked him to lead an embassy to China, which the Chinese emperor received.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Southeast Asia===
{{See also|The spread of Islam in Indonesia (1200 to 1600)}}
Many of historian predict that Islam reached South East Asia, espescially western part of Indonesia Archipelago  on the 13th Century. But, More than Two Thousands years ago Arab traders from Yaman had been connected to other far east Asia through trading and traveling by sea. The trader from Arab is the intermediary trader between Europe to African, Indian, South East Asian, and Far East Asian, including Japan and China. They were not just sold goods from Arab, but also goods from Africa, India, and so on, such as ivory, fragrance, spice, seasoning, gold, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Le Bon. 1956. Hadarat al Arab. Translation of La Civilisation-des Arabes. 3rd Print. Cairo. P.95.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Islam first reached the islands of Southeast Asia through traders from Mecca still during the first century of the [[Islamic calendar]] (the 7th century).&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt;  

There are many strong possibility that Islam had been spread by Arab traders to South East Asia in the 1st Century of Islamic Calendar or 7th Century of Christian/Gregorian Calendar. This Fact is much stronger, according to T.W. Arnold in The Preaching of Islam - In the 2nd Century of Islamic Calendar (Hijri), Arab trader had been trade to Ceylon or Srilangka (island in southern part of India). The same argument has been told by Prof.Dr. B.H. Burger and Prof.Dr.Mr. Prajudi in ''Sedjarah Ekonomis Sosiologis Indonesia'' (History of Socio Economic of Indonesia)&lt;ref&gt;Suryanegara, Ahmad Mansyur.2009. API Sejarah. 1st Printed. Bandung. Indonesia. P. 2 - 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are more possibility that Islam was spread by Arab Traders to South East Asia. According to Al Biruni, the Muslim Scholar Geographical Experty, 973 - 1048 AD, in his World Atlas written that Indian or Indonesia Ocean used to be call as Persian Ocean. After the Western Imperialist ruled, it is replaced Persian Ocean to be Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Arnold and Alfred Guilaume, (Editor), 1965. The Legacy of Islam. Oxford University Press, New York, P.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, many [[Sufi]] missionaries translated classical [[Sufi literature]] from Arabic and Persian into [[Malay language|Malay]]. Coupled with the composing of original [[Islamic literature]] in Malay, this led the way to the transformation of Malay into an Islamic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1292, when [[Marco Polo]] visited Sumatra, most of the inhabitants had converted to Islam. The [[Sultanate of Malacca]] was founded by [[Parameswara]], a Srivijayan Prince in the Malay peninsula. Through trade and commerce, Islam spread to [[Borneo]] and [[Java, Indonesia]]. By the late 15th century, Islam had been introduced to the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=late+15th+century+islam+philippines&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=zhX0TauuBI_1sgb8sam9Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=late%2015th%20century%20islam%20philippines&amp;f=false Spencer C. Tucker, ''The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history, Volume 1'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, page 419]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Islam spread from 7th Century AD, the social changes had been developed, from the individual faith changes to society changes. Soon, after five centuries of mingled and interraced with assimilation and acculturation with the native south east Asia society, Islam was emerged as political power in the region.

So, as Islam spread, three main Muslim political powers emerged. [[Aceh]], the most important Muslim power, was based in Northern Sumatra. It controlled much of the area between Southeast Asia and India. The Sultanate also attracted [[Sufi]] poets. The second Muslim power was the Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay peninsula. The Sultanate of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the third power, appearing in [[Java (island)|Java]], where the emerging Muslim forces defeated the local [[Majapahit]] kingdom in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=226–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sultanate managed to expand its territory somewhat, its rule remained brief.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt;

[[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] forces captured Malacca in 1511 under the naval general [[Afonso de Albuquerque]]. With Malacca subdued, the [[Aceh Sultanate]] and Brunei established themselves as centers of Islam in Southeast Asia. Brunei's sultanate remains intact even to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt;

===Three Early Modern empires===
{{main|Early modern history}}
In the 15th and 16th centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Middle East, the [[Balkans]] and [[Northern Africa]]; the [[Safavid Empire]] in [[Greater Iran]]; and the [[Mughul Empire]] in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of [[gunpowder]] and more efficient administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong116&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|2000|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th century, with the Ottomans' defeat in World War I, the last Muslim empire collapsed.

[[Dar al-'Ahd]] (House of truce) began to develop in the [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire's relationship with its tributary states]]. In the contemporary ''National period'', the term referred to non-Muslim governments that had [[armistice]] or peace agreements with Muslim governments. Today, the actual status of the non-Muslim country in question may vary from acknowledged equality to tributary states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Mughal Empire===
[[File:Tomb of Humayun, Delhi.jpg|500px|thumb|right|''[[Humayun's Tomb]]'' in [[Delhi]], India.]]
{{Main|Mughal Empire}}
The Mughal Empire was a product of various [[Central Asia]]n invasions into the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It was founded by the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] prince [[Babur]] in 1526 with the destruction of the [[Delhi sultanate]], placing its capital in [[Agra]]. Babur's death some years later and the indecisive rule of his son, [[Humayun]], brought instability to Mughal rule. The resistance of the [[Afghanistan|Afghani]] [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]], who administered a string of defeats to Humayun, weakened the empire. A year before his death, however, Humayun managed to recover much of the lost territories, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, the 13 year old [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] (later known as ''Akbar the Great''), in 1556. Under Akbar, consolidation of the Mughal Empire occurred through both expansion and administrative reforms.  After Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan came to power. Subsequently, Aurangazeb ruled vast areas including Afghanisthan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;odpftr&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=211–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire ruled most of present-day India, Pakistan, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Afghanistan]] for several centuries. Its decline in the early 18th century allowed India to be divided into smaller kingdoms and states. The Mughal dynasty was dissolved by the [[British Empire]] after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;odpftr&quot;/&gt; It left a lasting legacy on Indian culture and architecture. Famous buildings built by the Mughals, include: the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Red Fort]], the [[Badshahi Mosque]], the [[Lahore Fort]], the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] and the [[Agra Fort]]. During the empire's reign, Muslim communities flourished all over India, in [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]] and [[Hyderabad district (India)|Hyderabad]]. Various Sufi orders from Afghanistan and Persia were active throughout the region. More than a quarter of the population converted to Islam.&lt;ref name = &quot;odpftr&quot;/&gt;

===Safavid Empire===
{{Main|Safavids}}
[[File:Shah soleiman safavi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Suleiman I of Persia|Shah Suleiman I]] and his courtiers, [[Isfahan]], 1670. Painter is [[Aliquli Jabbadar|Ali Qoli Jabbador]], and is kept at The [[St. Petersburg]] Institute of Oriental Studies in Russia, ever since it was acquired by [[Tsar Nicholas II]]. Note the two [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] figures with their names at the top left.]]
The [[Safavids]] dynasty from [[Azarbaijan]] ruled from 1501 to 1736, and which established [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] Islam as the region's [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|official religion]] and united its provinces under a single  sovereignty, thereby reigniting the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] identity.
&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Although claiming to be the descendants of [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]], the Safavids were [[Sunni]] (the name &quot;Safavid&quot; comes from a Sufi order called ''Safavi''). Their origins go back to [[Firuz Shah Zarrinkolah]], a local dignitary from the north. During their rule, the Safavids recognized Twelver Shi'a Islam as the State religion, thus giving the region a separate identity from its Sunni neighbours.

In 1524, [[Tahmasp I]] acceded to the throne, initiating a revival of the arts. [[Carpetmaking]] became a major industry. The tradition of [[Persian miniature]] painting in manuscripts reached its peak, until Tahmasp turned to strict religious observance in middle age, prohibiting the consumption of alcohol and  [[hashish]] and removing [[casino]]s, [[tavern]]s and [[brothel]]s.  Tahmasp's nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]] continued to patronize a last flowering of the arts until he was murdered, after which many artists were recruited by the Mughal dynasty.

Tahmasp's grandson, [[Shah Abbas I]], restored the shrine of the eighth Twelver Shi'a Imam, [[Ali al-Ridha]] at [[Mashhad]], and restored the dynastic shrine at [[Ardabil]]. Both shrines received jewelry, fine manuscripts and Chinese porcelains. Abbas moved the capital to [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], revived old ports, and established thriving trade with Europeans. Amongst Abbas's most visible cultural achievements was the construction of ''[[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]]'' (&quot;Design of the World&quot;). The plaza, located near a Friday mosque, covered {{convert|20|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=199–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Ottoman Empire}}
The Seljuq Turks declined in the second half of the 13th century, after the [[Mongol conquest of Anatolia|Mongol invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1977a|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the establishment of multiple Turkish principalities, known as [[bey]]liks. [[Osman I]], the founder of the [[Ottoman dynasty]], assumed leadership of one of these principalities ([[Söğüt]]) in 1281, succeeding his father [[Ertuğrul]]. Declaring an independent Ottoman emirate in 1299, Osman I afterwards led it in a series of battles with the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, G. C. (2006). Dictionary of wars. New York: Facts on File. Page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1331, the Ottomans had captured [[Nicaea (city)|Nicaea]], the former Byzantine capital, under the leadership of Osman's son and successor, [[Orhan I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koprulu|1992|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victory at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] against the [[Serb]]s in 1389 then facilitated their expansion into Europe. The Ottomans were established in the [[Balkans]] and Anatolia by the time [[Bayezid I]] ascended to power in the same year, now at the helm of a growing empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koprulu|1992|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth halted when Mongol warlord [[Timur]] (also known as &quot;''Tamerlane''&quot;) captured Bayezid I in the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, beginning the [[Ottoman Interregnum]]. This episode was characterized by the division of the Ottoman territory amongst Bayezid I's sons, who submitted to [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] authority. When a number of Ottoman territories  regained independent status, ruin for the Empire loomed. However, the empire recovered, as the youngest son of Bayezid I, [[Mehmed I]], waged offensive campaigns against his ruling brothers, thereby reuniting [[Asia Minor]] and declaring himself sultan in 1413.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| author=Applied History Research Group | publisher=University of Calagary | url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/index2.html | title=The Islamic World to 1600 | accessdate=2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time the Ottoman [[Navy|naval]] fleet developed, such that they were able to challenge [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], a [[naval power]]. They also attempted to reconquer the Balkans. By the time of Mehmed I's grandson, [[Mehmed II]] (ruled 1444 — 1446; 1451 — 1481), the Ottomans could lay siege to [[Constantinople]], the capital of Byzantium. A factor in this siege was the use of [[muskets]] and large [[cannon]]s introduced by the Ottomans. The Byzantine fortress [[Fall of Constantinople|succumbed]] in 1453, after 54 days of siege. Mehmed II renamed it ''[[Istanbul]]''. Without its capital the Byzantine Empire disintegrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt; The future successes of the Ottomans and later empires would depend upon the exploitation of [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong116&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Suleiman Mosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Suleiman Mosque]] (Süleymaniye Camii) in [[Istanbul]] was built on the order of sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architect [[Mimar Sinan]] in 1557]]

In the early 16th century, the Shi'ite [[Safavid dynasty]] assumed control in Persia under the leadership of [[Shah]] [[Ismail I]], defeating the ruling [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] federation [[Aq Qoyunlu]] (also called the &quot;White Sheep Turkomans&quot;) in 1501. The Ottoman sultan [[Selim I]] sought to repel Safavid expansion, challenging and defeating them at the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514. Selim I also deposed the ruling Mamluks in Egypt, absorbing their territories in 1517. [[Suleiman I]] (also known as ''Suleiman the Magnificent''), Selim I's successor, took advantage of the diversion of Safavid focus to the [[Uzbeks]] on the eastern frontier and recaptured Baghdad, which had fallen under Safavid control. Despite this, Safavid power remained substantial, rivalling the Ottomans. Suleiman I advanced deep into Hungary following the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526 — [[Siege of Vienna|reaching as far as the gates of Vienna]] thereafter, and signed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with [[Francis I of France]] against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Roman Empire]] 10 years later. Suleiman I's rule (1520 — 1566) was the apex of the Ottoman Empire. The rapid European industrialization thereafter sent it into a relative decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;www.muslimdecline.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
{{main|Modern history}}

The [[modern age]] brought technological and organizational changes to Europe while the Islamic region continued the patterns of earlier centuries. The [[Great Powers]] globalized economically and [[colonization|colonized]] much of the region.

==== Ottoman Empire partition ====
{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire}}

By the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman empire had declined. The decision to back [[Germany]] in [[World War I]] meant they shared the [[Central Powers]]' defeat in that war. The defeat led to the overthrow of the Ottomans by Turkish nationalists led by the victorious general of the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]: [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], who became known to his people as Atatürk, &quot;Father of the Turks.&quot; Atatürk was credited with renegotiating the [[treaty of Sèvres]] (1920) which ended Turkey's involvement in the war and establishing the modern [[Republic of Turkey]], which was recognized by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923). Atatürk went on to implement an ambitious program of modernization that emphasized economic development and [[secular]]ization. He transformed Turkish culture to reflect European laws, adopted [[Hindu]]-[[Arabic numerals]], the [[Latin script]], separated the religious establishment from the state, and emancipated woman—even giving them the right to vote in parallel with [[women's suffrage]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=961, 969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War I, the vast majority of former Ottoman territory outside of Asia Minor was handed over to the victorious European powers as  [[protectorate]]s. During the war the Allies had promised the subject peoples independence in exchange for their assistance fighting the Turkish powers. To their dismay, they found that this system of &quot;protectorates&quot; was a smoke-screen for their continued subjugation by the British and the French. The struggles for independence from their Turkish overlords and the cooperation of partisan forces with the British were romanticized in the stories of British secret intelligence agent [[T. E. Lawrence]]—later known as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=971–972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman successor states include today's [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Lebanon, [[Romania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Serbia]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], Turkey, Balkan states, North Africa and the north shore of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McNeill|Bentley|Christian|2005|p=1402}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslim countries sought to adopt European political organization and [[nationalism]] began to emerge in the Muslim world. Countries like Egypt, Syria and Turkey organized their governments sought to develop national pride amongst their citizens. Other places, like Iraq, were not as successful due to a lack of unity and an inability to resolve age-old prejudices between Muslim sects and against non-Muslims.

Some Muslim countries, such as Turkey and Egypt, sought to separate Islam from the secular government. In other cases, such as Saudi Arabia, the government brought out religious expression in the re-emergence of the puritanical form of Sunni Islam known to its detractors as [[Wahabism]], which found its way into the [[Saudi royal family]].

====Indian partition====
{{Main|Partition of India}}
The ''[[partition of India]]'' refers to the creation in August 1947 of the now sovereign states of India and Pakistan. The two nations were formed out of the former [[British Raj]], including treaty states, when Britain granted independence to the area (see [[Undivided India]]). In particular, the term refers to the partition of [[Bengal]] and [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], the two main provinces of what would be Pakistan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1947, after the partition of India, Pakistan became the largest Islamic country in the world (by population) and the tenth largest post-World War II state in the modern world. In 1971, after a bloody war of independence, the Bengal part of Pakistan became an independent state called [[Bangladesh]]. Pakistan in the contemporary era is the second largest Islamic country in the world, following [[Indonesia]]. Pakistan is the only nuclear power among predominantly Muslim nations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

====Post-1945 era====
Between 1953 and 1964, [[King Saud]] reorganized the government of the [[monarchy]] his father, [[Ibn Saud]], had created. Saudi Arabia's ministries included Communication (1953), Agriculture and Water (1953), Petroleum (1960), Pilgrimage and Islamic Endowments (1960), Labour and Social Affairs (1962) and Information (1963). He also put Talal, one of his many younger brothers (29 years his junior) in charge of the Ministry of Transport.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1958-59, Talal proposed the formation of a National Council. As he proposed it, it would have been a consultative body, not a legislature. Still, he thought of it as a first step toward broader popular participation in the government. Talal presented this proposal to the king when the Crown Prince was out of the country. Saud forwarded the proposal to the [[Ulema|ulama]] asking them whether a National Council was a legitimate institution in Islam. The idea then disappeared until it was revived more than three decades later. A Consultative Council came into existence in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] came into existence in 1960. For the first decade or more of its existence, it was unable to increase revenue for the member nations. Tension between [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] and Saud continued to mount until a showdown in 1964. Saud threatened to mobilize the Royal Guard against Faisal and Faisal threatened to mobilize the National Guard against Saud. Saud then abdicated and left for Cairo, then Greece, where he would die in 1969. Faisal then became King.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Six-Day War]] of June 5–10, 1967, was fought between [[Israel]] and the neighbouring states of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. It closed the [[Suez canal]], and may have contributed to the revolution in Libya that put [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] in power. It led in May 1970 to the closure of the &quot;tapline&quot; from Saudi Arabia through Syria to Lebanon. These developments had the effect of increasing the importance of [[petroleum]] in [[Libya]], which is a short (and canal-free) shipping distance from Europe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1970, [[Occidental Petroleum]] broke with other oil companies and accepted Qaddafi's demands for price increases.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In October 1973, another war between Israel and its Muslim neighbors, known as the [[Yom Kippur War]], broke out just as oil company began meeting with [[OPEC]] leaders. OPEC had been emboldened by the success of Libya's demands and the war strengthened their unity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The Arab defeats in 1967 and 1973 triggered the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In response to the emergency resupply effort by the [[West]] that enabled Israel to defeat Egyptian and Syrian forces, the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the United States and Western Europe. Faisal agreed that Saudi Arabia would use some of its oil wealth to finance the &quot;front-line states&quot;, those that bordered Israel, in their struggle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The centrality of petroleum, the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]] and political and economic instability and uncertainty remain constant features of the politics of the region.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

====Persian revolutions====
The [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] took place between 1905 and 1911. The revolution marked the beginning of the end of Iran's [[feudalistic]] society and led to the establishment of a parliament in [[Persia]] and the restriction of the power of the [[Shah]] (king). Iran approved its first constitution at this time. The modernist and conservative blocks then began to fight with each other. World War I intervened and all of the combatants invaded Iran. This weakened the government and threatened the country's independence. The [[constitutional monarchy]] created by the decree of [[Mozzafar al-Din Shah]] that was established in [[Persia]] as a result of the Revolution, was damaged in 1925 with the dissolution of the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the ascension of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] to the throne.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1979 the [[Iranian Revolution]] transformed [[Iran]] from a constitutional monarchy, under Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], to a [[Populism|populist]] [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Islamic republic]] under the rule of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], a Shi`i Muslim cleric and ''[[marja]]''. Following the Revolution, and a new constitution was approved and a  referendum established the government, electing Ruhollah Khomeini as [[Supreme Leader]]. During the following two years, liberals, leftists, and Islamic groups fought each other, and the Islamics captured power. At the same time, the U.S., the USSR, and most of the Arab governments of the Middle East feared that their dominance in the region would be challenged by the Islamic ideology, so they encouraged and supported [[Saddam Hussein]] to invade Iran, which resulted in the [[Iran-Iraq war]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

====Arab-Israeli conflict====
{{Main|Arab-Israeli conflict}}
The Arab-Israeli conflict spans about a century of political tensions and open hostilities. It involves the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] as a [[Jew]]ish [[Nation-state|nation state]], the consequent [[1948 Palestinian exodus|displacement]] of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]], as well as the adverse relationship between the [[Arab]] nations and the state of Israel (see related [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]). Despite at first involving only the Arab states bordering Israel, animosity has also developed between other [[Muslim world|Muslim nations]] and Israel. Many countries, individuals and non-governmental organizations elsewhere in the world feel involved in this conflict for reasons such as cultural and religious ties with Islam, [[Arab culture]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Jewish culture]] or for ideological, [[human rights]], or strategic reasons. While some consider the Arab-Israeli conflict a part of (or a precursor to) a wider [[clash of civilizations]] between the [[Western World]] and the Arab or [[Muslim world]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2003/issue4/jf7n4a6.html Causes of Anti-Americanism in the Arab World: A Socio-Political Perspective] by Abdel Mahdi Abdallah (MERIA Journal. Volume 7, No. 4 - December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.co.il/Arab-Israeli-conflict-2.asp#Clash Arab-Israeli Conflict: Role of religion] (Israel Science and Technology)&lt;/ref&gt; others oppose this view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=1050 Arab-American Psychiatrist Wafa Sultan: There is No Clash of Civilizations but a Clash between the Mentality of the Middle Ages and That of the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt; Animosity emanating from this conflict has caused numerous attacks on supporters (or perceived supporters) of each side by supporters of the other side in many countries around the world.

====Anatolian region====
{{Main|Islam in Turkey|Secularism in Turkey}}
Since the establishment of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, there has been a strong tradition of [[secularism in Turkey]] established and institutionalized by [[Atatürk's Reforms]]. Although the First Grand National Assembly of Turkey had rallied support from the population for the Independence War against the occupying forces on behalf of Islamic principles, Islam was omitted from the public sphere after the Independence War. The principle of secularism was thus inserted in the Turkish Constitution as late as 1937. This legal action was assisted by stringent state policies against domestic Islamist groups and establishments to neutralize the strong appeal of Islam in Turkish society. Even though an overwhelming majority of the population, at least nominally, adheres to [[Islam in Turkey]], the state, which was established with the [[Kemalist ideology]] has no [[official religion]] nor promotes any and it monitors the area between the religions using the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]]. The [[Republic Protests]] were a series of mass rallies by Turkish secular citizens that took place in Turkey in 2007. The target of the first protest was the possible presidential candidacy of the Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], afraid that if elected President of Turkey Erdoğan would alter the [[Secularism in Turkey|Turkish secularist state]].

====Arab Spring====
{{main|Arab Spring}}
In the Near East and North Africa, a series of protests and demonstrations calling for democracy and freedom across the region became known as the [[Arab Spring]]. The protests, uprisings and revolutions brought about the overthrow of the Tunisian and Egyptian governments. The period of political liberalization also affected countries that were not part of the [[Arab world]].
