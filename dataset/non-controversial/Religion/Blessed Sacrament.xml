The '''Blessed Sacrament''', or the '''Body and Blood of Christ''', is a [[Catholic devotions|devotion]]al name used in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Old Catholic]],  [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, to refer to the [[Host (Holy Communion)|Host]] after it has been consecrated in the [[sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]]. [[Christian]]s in these traditions believe in the [[Real Presence]] of [[Jesus Christ]] in the Eucharistic elements of the bread and wine and some of them, therefore, practice [[reservation of the Blessed Sacrament|Eucharistic reservation]] and [[Eucharistic adoration]]. This belief is based on interpretations of biblical scripture and tradition.  The Roman Catholic understanding is defined by numerous church councils including the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] and the [[Council of Trent]] and is quoted in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (which explains the meaning of ''[[Transubstantiation]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.shtml#1376 ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', paragraph 1376]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholicism==
[[File:Blessedsacramentjf.JPG|thumb|The Blesses Sacrament exposed at the Sta. Cruz Church, [[Manila]]]]
{{main|Eucharist (Catholic Church)}}

The Blessed Sacrament may be received by Catholics who have undergone the First Holy Communion (i.e., given by a priest or or Deacon or [[Minister (Catholic Church)|Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion]] to a Catholic, and immediately consumed by the communicant) as part of the ''Liturgy of the Eucharist'' during Mass.  The soul of the person receiving the Eucharist should be in a &quot;state of grace,&quot; i.e., have no [[mortal sin]] on their soul at the time of communion (Matt 5:23-24).

The Blessed Sacrament can also be exposed (displayed) on an [[altar]] in a [[Monstrance]]. Rites involving the exposure of the Blessed Sacrament include [[Benediction]] and [[Eucharistic adoration]]. According to Catholic [[theology]], the host, after the Rite of Consecration, is no longer bread, but the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Christ, who is [[Transubstantiation|transubstantiated]] ''in'' it.  Catholics know that Jesus is the sacrificial [[Lamb of God]] prefigured in the [[Old Testament]] [[Passover]]. Unless the flesh of that passover sacrificial lamb was consumed, the members of the household would not be saved from death. As the Passover was the [[Old Covenant]], so the Eucharist became the [[New Covenant]]. (Matt 26:26-28), (Mark 14:22-24), (Luke 22: 19-20), and (John 6:48-58)

==Anglicanism==
{{main|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}
Reception of the Blessed Sacrament in the [[Anglican Communion]] and other Anglican jurisdictions varies by province.  Formerly, [[Confirmation]] was generally required as a precondition to reception, but many provinces now allow all the baptised to partake, as long as they are in good standing with the Church and have previously received First Communion.

Devotions to the Blessed Sacrament vary.  Individuals will [[genuflection|genuflect]] or bow in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, which may be reserved in a [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] or [[aumbry]] on, behind, or near the altar.  Its presence is usually indicated by a lamp suspended over or placed near the tabernacle or aumbry.  Except among [[Anglo-Catholics]], the use of a [[monstrance]] is rare. This is in keeping with the Article XXV of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] that &quot;the Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use Them.&quot;  Nonetheless, many parishes do have services of [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|devotions to the Blessed Sacrament]], in which the [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] is removed from the tabernacle or aumbry and hymns, prayers, psalms, and sentences of devotion are sung or read.  In some parishes, when the Blessed Sacrament is moved between tabernacles (say, from the High Altar to a chapel altar), [[sanctus bell]]s are rung and all who are present kneel.

==Lutheranism==
{{main|Eucharist in the Lutheran Church}}
In most [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, a person must have had [[Luther's Small Catechism|catechetical]] training prior to a [[First Communion]] (or have received [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|Confirmation]] in the Lutheran Church) to receive the Eucharist. Recently, more liberal churches allow all who are baptized to received it. Similar to the Anglican teaching, Lutherans are also taught to [[genuflection|genuflect]] or bow in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, which is normally located on an altar. In the Lutheran churches that still celebrate the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], like the Roman Catholic Church, a [[Monstrance]] is used to display the Blessed Sacrament during the [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|Benediction]].

Lutheranism has its roots mostly in [[Germans|German]] cultural area and therefore the terminology may often historically differ slightly from general English use. Therefore traditionally the English term &quot;Blessed Sacrament&quot; has been substituted by &quot;Sacrament of the Altar&quot;, (lat. ''Sanctissimum Sacramentum Altaris'') which is used in the same meaning in [[Luther's Small Catechism]]. Later due to [[Reformed]] influence &quot;The Sacrament of the Altar&quot; has often been wrongly and misguidedly used as the term of the Eucharistic liturgy.
