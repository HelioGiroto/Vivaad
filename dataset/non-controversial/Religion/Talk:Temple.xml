==Use of the word==
&quot;a Jewish temple is called a synagogue&quot;

That's a highly offensive statement to the Orthodox and Conservative Jewish; it is written only from the Reform Jewish POV.  To the Orthodox, the Temple was ONLY the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].  Synagogues are places of worship and learning the Torah, but are not comparable to and do not replace &quot;the&quot; Temple.  If I understand correctly, only the Reform Jewish (and possibly some of the very small branches of Judaism, like Reconstructionist Judaism) would refer to a synagogue as a Temple.

&quot;a Christian temple is called a church or cathedral&quot;

That offends me (Christian, member of the [[Church of Christ]]) for a similar reason.  We do not believe there is anything holy about our church building, and that it should not be called a temple.  Most branches of Christianity do not usually equate their church buildings with temples, although a number do.

:I agree. I think it's insensitively worded. [[User:The Wednesday Island|The Wednesday Island]] 17:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC) (Anglican)
::Me too. As for the current quote &quot;In Judaism, from the Bible, the hebrew term for temple is &quot;sanctuary&quot;, &quot;palace&quot; or &quot;hall&quot;&quot;, I don't know what to do with this. Firstly, the words are not Hebrew. Secondly and possibly due to [[semantics]] I don't know what to make of the editor's use of a lowercase &quot;temple&quot; versus the universal referral to the two Temples in Jerusalem with a capital &quot;T&quot;. I'm probably going to do something to this, but I'm not quite sure how to handle it. I'll figure it out. [[User:Valley2city|Valley2city]] 22:32, 16 November 2006 (UTC) (Conservative Jew)

Orthodox churches are often referred to as &quot;temples&quot; as a matter of course, though the use of the word in this context doesn't seem to mean that there's anything special about a church. [[User:Floozybackloves|Floozybackloves]] ([[User talk:Floozybackloves|talk]]) 17:58, 6 November 2011 (UTC)

==Egyptian temple==
The [[Antares]] page refers to an [[Egyptian temple]], but as of 13 Dec 2005, there isn't an appropriate page to disambig it to. Hopefully, someone will build one. [[User:D-Rock|D-Rock]] 11:37, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

==Buddhist temples==
The [[Shaolin]] article seems to be talking about a specific subset of Buddhist temples, should that be used when disambiging them or perhaps the [[List of Buddhist temples]]? Neither solution seems pleasant to me. [[User:D-Rock|D-Rock]] 12:04, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Is this a disambig? ==

Is this a {{tl|disambig}}? Looks like an article discussing the spiritual buildings to me. If there is no objection, I'll remove the {{tl|disambig}} and create [[Temple (disambiguation)]] soon.--[[User:Commander Keane|Commander Keane]] 21:38, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
:This makes sense to me. [[User:D-Rock|D-Rock]] 01:18, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
::Done.--[[User:Commander Keane|Commander Keane]] 13:16, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== Images: Temple's architectures &amp; world regions ==

I've added the aerial view image of a Western Temple located at a high [[mesa]] in [[Oceanside, California#Mount Ecclesia|Mount Ecclesia]] (1920).
Although all images are really beautifull; the article could be restricted to a sample, one temple, per world region or type of architecture. As it its now, it has too images of Eastern/Oriental temples and a duplicated images of Greek architecture. Thanks, Regards. --[[User:GalaazV|GalaazV]] 22:17, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:: Took the initiave of editing the article with a sample of the main known [[religious]]/[[spiritual]] Temples around the [[World]], in a chronological way and representative also of different architectures and religious practices (the other erlier also beautifull images changed to &quot;See also&quot; section): hope it can be consensual, as it was brought with a [[pacific]] and [[honest]] thought. Thank you, Regards. --[[User:GalaazV|GalaazV]] 23:42, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== St Peter's basilica ==

Why is this captioned &quot;Christian temple&quot; when the text alongside it goes to great lengths to point out that Christians almost never (and Catholics certainly never) call their buildings &quot;temples&quot;? [[User:The Wednesday Island|The Wednesday Island]] 17:25, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

==Tangerines?==

This last paragraph in the intro seems badly out of place.  Shouldn't it be on the disambiguation page instead?  Surely most people who type in temple would want to get to this page.  It's just distracting.  I'll just remove it or move it to the disambiguation page.

:For reference, the text removed was 

:&quot;The word temple can also be used to refer to a cross between an orange and a tangerine. It used to be called a temple tangor but from 1919 the variety was renamed temple. Its derivatives include clementine, tangor and mandarine.&quot;

== This Article Needs Work ==

The lists and bullets in this article are embarassing. It needs a lot of work. [[User:Glenn4pr|Glenn4pr]] 04:06, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

== a bit soft ==

The discussion of the temple is a bit soft and only gets better toward the end. I seems to assume that temples existed since the beginning of time. It whould be better grounded in history. I made some small changes, but that shouuld be only the beginning. In other words the is is not accurate to say that the Hebrew word for temple is palace etc etc. The ancient Hebrew word palace was in play Long before the Roman temple came into being.[[User:Brosi|Brosi]] 22:46, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== terminological paradoxes abound ==

The problem with this section is that it can't decide if it is about religious spaces or about temples. The assumption is that ALL religious spaces are first temples and then other things. For example &quot;A Jain temple is called derasar.&quot; This is wrong or rather backwards. A derasar is Jain temple. In other words a Jain worshiper does not say My temple is called a derasar. A bit nit-picky, but 'Jain temple' is an ENGLISH (latin-based) concept that is applied TO the Jain (by English speakers). In other words, again, a derasar is, technically NOT a temple. But like a temple, it IS a religious space. But because we English speakers refuse to make the distinction and want to reduce all religious and cultures to ours, we would like to think that temple - conceptually speaking - came first. I think that this article should, therefore, be split. into 1). temple (templum) and its various uses; and 2. religious spaces and terminology.[[User:Brosi|Brosi]] 15:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== rewrite ==

I reorganized this page to focus in a more scholarly way on the word temple, its uses and history.[[User:Brosi|Brosi]] 20:20, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== moved text ==

I moved the sentences that were recently added about metaphor to a separate category, since they bring up a topic that is a sub-topic of temple and not appropriate I would think in its main definition. I think there might be better examples.[[User:Brosi|Brosi]] 01:32, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
== Eastern Orthodox ==
The portion under the heading &quot;The Christian Tradition&quot; that deals with Eastern Orthodox usage of the word temple has been very much improved. Whoever made these most recent changes has dealt with it sensitively. Thanks. [[User:MishaPan|MishaPan]] 22:22, 17 February 2007 (UTC)


==Masonic Temples==

I've removed the Masonic temples from this list.  Although they use the word &quot;Temple&quot; in their nomenclature, they are not used for religious purposes and I'm worried that their inclusion on this list would mislead people into thinking that Masonry is a religion, which it is not.

Freemasons meet as Lodges. Lodges meet in Temples, or Centers or Halls. I've updated the entry.  [[User:Jmitchell4466|Jmitchell4466]] 17:54, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

==Etymology==

Where does the word &quot;Temple&quot; come from?


==&quot;Heather&quot;==

I changed the Greek section to speak of pagans rather than heather, which plant isn't known for erecting temples.

== Merge from [[List of ancient temple structures]] ==

Very old tag on [[List of ancient temple structures]] that doesn't appear to have been tagged or discussed here. [[User:Pairadox|Pairadox]] 17:35, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

;Support


;Oppose

I cannot understand why a page on temples doesnt give importance to the oldest free standing temples in the world! The prehistoric temples of malta should be included in this article. this is an extract from one of the Maltese temple pages:

Ġgantija (also Ggantia) is a megalithic temple complex on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (part of Malta). The two temples of Ġgantija on the island of Gozo are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, which were erected during the Neolithic Age (c. 3600-2500 BC). At more than 5500 years old, the Ġgantija temples are the world's oldest free-standing structures, and the world's oldest religious structures, pre-dating the Pyramids of Egypt and Stonehenge. The temples were possibly the site of an Earth Mother Goddess Fertility Cult, with numerous figurines and statues found on site believed to be connected with that cult.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ggantija

please lets update this page!!!  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Paulattardb|Paulattardb]] ([[User talk:Paulattardb|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Paulattardb|contribs]]) 01:21, 10 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Egyptian Temples Again==
The usual term is &lt;i&gt;Hwt-nTr&lt;/i&gt;, lit. &quot;god's enclosure&quot; or &quot;enclosure of god&quot;, according to James Allen, &lt;i&gt;Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs&lt;/i&gt;, p.42.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/138.253.134.192|138.253.134.192]] ([[User talk:138.253.134.192|talk]]) 01:52, 2 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== &quot;Templum&quot; ==

In the first paragraph of the article, we have the following:

&quot;Though a templum, technically speaking, is not a “house of the gods” but a diagram by the Romans to link the geometries reflected in the sky towards Earth. It was also indicative of a dwelling place of a god or gods.&quot;

This appears to be one sentence split into two. It's also redundant and somewhat unencyclopedic. I would fix this, only I have no idea what &quot;to link the geometries reflected in the sky towards Earth&quot; is supposed to mean. If there are no objections, I'll replace this with something along the lines of &quot;The word 'templum' became associated with the dwelling place of a god or gods.&quot; [[Special:Contributions/74.178.45.239|74.178.45.239]] ([[User talk:74.178.45.239|talk]]) 20:04, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

== Odd Space ==
There's some sections that need a serious rewrite, or some kind of fix. Like the section on 9 kinds of Hindu Temples. Only 5 have information, although number one isn't even a sentence. and the orginization/capitalization! D:
: This is a very recent addition. Since there is a link to a well-written main article on Hindu Temples, I'm removing it. [[User:John of Reading|John of Reading]] ([[User talk:John of Reading|talk]]) 07:21, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

== Order ==

Is there some rational basis for the rearranging of the order? If not I'll revert --&lt;font color=&quot;#06C&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Trödel|Trödel]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:25, 21 January 2012 (UTC)
:Yes.., there is, a historical chronological one, from ancient civilization temples to more recent contemporary one. Also order based on similarity and proximity of each respective civilization, for example, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain are must cluster in order, not separated.[[User:Gunkarta|Gunkarta]] ([[User talk:Gunkarta|talk]]) 06:54, 21 January 2012 (UTC)
:: It seems that Jewish temples should preceed the pagen ones then. --&lt;font color=&quot;#06C&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Trödel|Trödel]]&lt;/font&gt; 15:01, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
::: I don't think so, it would be proper if each religious tradition remain clustered; such as Dharmic religions (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh) and Judeo-Christian (Judaism and Christianity). [[User:Gunkarta|Gunkarta]] ([[User talk:Gunkarta|talk]]) 15:13, 23 January 2012 (UTC)</text>
