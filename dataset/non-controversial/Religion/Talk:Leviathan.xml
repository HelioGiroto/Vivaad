==Demonology info==

I am still looking for actual references for the claims that &quot;In medieval demonology, a leviathan is an aquatic demon that tries to possess people, being very difficult to exorcise. Leviathan is generally considered to be the demon of envy and the who is first in punishing the corresponding sinners. She is also said to have been of the order of Seraphim. Many medieval authors considered Leviathan to be Grand Admiral of the maritime regions of Hell.&quot;

An editor wrote: 
:''&quot;Check the article here &quot;Fallen angels' angelic ranks&quot;, as for her being a she is something that is of varied opinion in demonology. You have obviously not been a demonologist long enough.&quot;'' 
But I cannot find an article by that name. The article [[Hierarchy of devils]] says Leviathan is a he, not a she, and does not support any of those except for being a member of the Seraphim, but I also note that that article cites no sources at all for any of its claims either. 

Please provide an actual verifiable reference. Thanks. [[User:DreamGuy|DreamGuy]] 00:22, July 22, 2005 (UTC)

== There, I know this, I've checked this a million times. ==

In one of the most important Hebrew scriptures, the Book of Enoch, is written;

''And that day will two monsters be parted, one monster, a female named Leviathan in order to dwell in the abyss of the ocean over the fountains of water; and (the other), a male called Behemoth, which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is Dundayin, east of the garden of Eden.''
- 1 Enoch 60:7-8

Even though she is sometimes seen as androgynous, there is more evidence that points to her being female.


Leviathan is a seraphim, which is a common view assigned by most demonologists;

The article says &quot;The Leviathan is frequently associated with Satan or the Devil.&quot; Satan and the Devil are both exactly the same thing!/?

* Satan
* Abaddon
* Asmodeus
* Astaroth
* Leviathan
* Samael
* Semyazza


* From article: fallen angel
* From part: Fallen angels by rank.

== sources! ==

''Leviathan - In the Enoch parables, Leviathan is the primitive female sea-dragon and monster of evil; in rabbinic writings, she is identified with Rahab, angel of the primordial deep, and associated with Behemoth (q.v). ''

'''In common modern Christian usage, the word demon refers to an evil spirit. In 1612 CE Father Sebastien Michaelis claimed to have communicated with a demon named Balberith during an exorcism of a nun in Aix En Provence. Balberith listed a number of demons which Michaelis published in his book Admirable History. Michaelis listed three hierarchies of demons. Since it was believed that these were fallen angels the categories within these hierarchies bore the same names as those of the angelic hosts:


Heirarchy	Order	Prince(s)	
1st	Seraphim	Beelzebub, Leviathan, Asmodeus'''


http://www.angelfire.com/realm/shades/demons/bookdevilsanddemons/fallenangels.htm

''Leviathan (once partly of the order of seraphim).''

http://www.sacred-magick.com/Evocations/High%20Ranking%20Demons.html

''Leviathan was a Prince of the order of Seraphim.''

''Other fallen angels are Lucifer, once a Light Bearer; also Beelzebub, Leviathan, Azazel, Rehab.''

'' Of the choir of Seraphim there fell at first Lucifer, Beelzebub and Leviathan''


It's common knowledge that Leviathan was a seraph, you obviously know nothing, you washup mainstream excuse for a mythologist.

There's your sources, as well as additional phrases where people know Leviathan to have been a seraph.

== What the [word censored] is verifiable then! ==

http://www.whiterosesgarden.com/Nature_of_Evil/Demons/DM_Occult_Hierarchy/DM_hells_hierarchy_Father-Michaelis_1612.htm


''Hell's Hierarchy as described by Father Sebastien Michaelis in 1612''
 

''&lt;&lt;Excerpt and explanation taken from The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft &amp; Demonology (see below).&gt;&gt;

One of the most complete lists of devils and their functions was reported by the celebrated exorcist Father Sebastien Michaelis, in his Admirable History (1612).  Balberith, a demon possessing Sister Madeleine, at Aix-en-Provence, obligingly told the priest not only the other devils possessing the nun, but added the special saints whose function was to oppose them.  Since the devils were angels who had rebelled and fallen, they maintained their rank as ex-angels.  The angelic court had been invented in the fourth century, out of the writings of Paul (Col. i. 16; Eph. i. 21), by the Pseudo-Dionysius, and consisted of nine orders of angels (three hierarchies each of three orders):

First Hierarchy:

Seraphim

Cherubim

Thrones

Second Hierarchy:

Dominions

Principalities

Powers

Third Hierarchy: 

Virtues

Archangels

Angels

Balberith gave many lesser devils occupying Sister Madeleine, but the most important listed by Michaelis were as follows:

First Hierarchy

1. Beelzebub was Prince of the Seraphim, and next unto Lucifer.  For all the princes, that is to say all the chief of the nine choirs of angels, are fallen; and of the choir of Seraphim there fell the three first, to wit, Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Leviathan, who did all revolt.  But the fourth, who was Michael, was the first that resisted Lucifer, and all the rest of the good angels followed him, so that now he is the chiefest amongst them all.  Lucifer, when Christ descended into hell, was there chained up, where he commands all . . . . Beelzebub tempts men with pride.  And as John the Baptist holds Lucifer's place in Paradise . . . by his singular humility, so Beelzebub has Francis for his adversary in heaven.

2. Leviathan is the Prince of the same order, and is the ringleader of the heretics, tempting men with sins that are directly repugnant unto faith. [Adversary: Peter the Apostle]''

Directly quoted from a demonology book by an '''expert''', which means that since the info has an origin, it's valid.


Read, ''The Book of Enoch'', see, have you heard of the book of Enoch, hmm, no, well, it's a set of texts found in the Dead Sea Scrolls which '''predate the Bible'''


''The Apocryphal Book of Enoch gives the following description of this monster's origins:

&quot;And that day will two monsters be parted, one monster, a female named Leviathan in order to dwell in the abyss of the ocean over the fountains of water; and (the other), a male called Behemoth, which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is Dundayin, east of the garden of Eden.&quot; - 1 Enoch 60:7-8''

Here's a link that proves that it's in the Book of Enoch

http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/delirium/mythology/leviathan.asp


And besides, if people use Leviathan as a former seraph in demonology, that must mean she WAs a seraph, so it's supposed to stand here no matter what you say, and this, being an online encyclopedia, is supposed to have info from all directions, no matter what your precious rules say :P

''(above unsigned, but by [[User:Satanael]])''


:OK, first and foremost, ''&quot;if people use Leviathan as a former seraph in demonology, that must mean she WAS a seraph,&quot;'' is complete nonsense. The fact that some dodgy sources claim she was a she and she was a seraph in no way shows that she was. Lots of people out there have really messed up ideas about lots of things, that doesn;t mean they are right. 

:Secondly, ''&quot;being an online encyclopedia, is supposed to have info from all directions&quot;'' is simply wrong. You need to go read [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] and also [[Wikipedia:NPOV]]. Only reliable sources are used, and for controversial claims it is absolutely vital that the text in question be labeled as the claim stated by so-and-so (with link or other info to let people have an idea of how reliable they are). 

:You seem to have completely misunderstood how the policies work here. If multiple reputable sources say something without any dispute, then we can list it unsourced. If multiple reputable sources say different things, then we report each and reference who says what. If some dodgy but fairly well known or numerous people claim something that goes against what other more reputable sources say, we can cite it but point out who said it and that it's not the accepted belief. If some totally unreliable person with no background or fame makes some claim that flies totally in the face of all known facts, then it isn't listed at all. 

:What you have above is a mixture of the last two scenarios. Some just are complete nonsense and shouldn;t be listed, others are at least cited by some sources some people have heard of and can be listed '''provided the source is clearly identified and the credential are listed.'''

:Please take the time to read those policies I mentioned above, as they are spelled out there and would have cleared up your confusion. Also, again, please also read about the [[Wikipedia:Civility]] policy, as your actions here and ways of phrasing things are completely unacceptable. Also please sign your talk comments.

== Leviathan as a Serpent ==

I am interested in what people know about Leviathan being a serpent and how that plays into serpent mythology. It seems in Judaism that there is a connection to the Leviathan at the &quot;end of the days&quot;. Therefore according to Jewish mythology history begins and ends with a serpent. Any comments on the meaning behind this?

: It is Xian mythology that history starts with a snake. Judaism does not give much values to the &quot;fall&quot; of man. Perhaps, if you want some meaning, Judaism holds that Adam had no internal inclination to do otherwise from G-d. A test was devised and somehow or another he failed (what part was the failure is a matter of debate) and then he now had an internal inclination to make bad choices (besides the already internal one to make good choices, which means internally he always had to make a choice of which to follow). This all ends when G-d slaughters the satan (capital S is Xian mythology, not Jewish) at which point noone will have any inclination other than to do what G-d wants. This makes life a test. The snake was merely the metholody for the delivery of the first test, with little significance given to it otherwise. -- [[User:Chacham|Chacham]] 1:29, 29 Sep 2005 (UTC)

Also any comments on the Talmudic piece that says that God spends three hours of his day playing with the Leviathan?

Meh, I'm sure it's a mosasaur. That's -like- a snake, unhinging jaw and all.

It's simmilar to the Kundalini. Kundalini, like Leviathan, means &quot;coiled&quot;.--[[User:N33|N33]] ([[User talk:N33|talk]]) 07:18, 21 January 2008 (UTC)

==Revelations==
Leviathan was also mentioned in the last book of the New Testament.

EDIT - It is &quot;REVELATION&quot;, not &quot;REVELATIONS&quot;.  You also misspelled &quot;Leviathan&quot;.  I fixed it.

== Other references apparently deemed unworthy of the article page ==

{{tld|spoiler}}
In the [[1975]] [[science fiction]] story ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', the Leviathan is a massive single-celled creature that lives in the ocean and has survived&amp;ndash;without offspring&amp;ndash; from time immemorial. In this account, the Leviathan is one of the two [[Origin of life|original life forms]] on Earth, the other being that from which all other life [[evolution|evolved]]. Instead of evolving multiple cells, reproduction and&amp;ndash;in some sense&amp;ndash;mortality, the Leviathan continued to grow it's single cell over billions of years, and developed an almost god-like intellect, including [[telepathy]]. One of the most striking variations from more traditional accounts of the Leviathan is that [[Robert Shea|Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson|Wilson]] describe it as [[pyramid]] shaped, explaining that the shape is neccessary to withstand the pressure exerted by the sea and [[gravity]] on the enormous body. This, however, was most likely to accommodate other aspects of the story, for instance the [[All-seeing eye|Eye in the Pyramid]] which was a symbol of the [[Illuminati]] in the story as well as in a number of real-word [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] (see [[Eye of Providence#Illuminati]]).

==the prophet Jonah==

Is it possible to discuss the Leviathan in Judaism without mentioning the prophet Jonah? I find that very strange. The only mention seems to be a passing reference when referring to Pinocchio.

[[User:212.143.147.214|212.143.147.214]] 10:56, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

I edited the title to say &quot;Jonah&quot; and not &quot;Noah&quot; as the two are not the same.  Also, take note that Jonah was in the belly of a whale, there is NO mention of him being within Leviathan. -- Dan N.

leviathan, the water demon can turn into anything it so pleases. it often turns into a beautiful if young woman to lure young men into the sea. once the man wanders into the sea in search for his false love. the beast shows it's true colors.

Pulled that one out of your butt did ya?  Likening sirens from greek mythology to the biblical leviathan, never thought I'd see it. -- Dan N.

==Alligator==
A foot note in my copy of the NIV says that &quot;Leviathan&quot; may be an ancient name for Alligators.  Has anyone else read this anywhere?[[User:Seizurebot1011|Seizurebot1011]] 23:26, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
:Alligators?  Why alligators?  The ancient Hebrews never encountered alligators.  I've only heard about biblical scholars thinking that the image of Leviathan was influenced by the Nile Crocodile.--[[User:Apokryltaros|Mr Fink]] 01:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
In my footnote it states that the leviathan is thought to be a crocodile. I greatly agree with this thought, all except for the fire-breathing portion. That is the only part that does not fit in with the alligator/crocodile explanation.

The pictures used for this article in several languages are nice, but not taken from the two editions published by Hobbes himself. I want to advice to use reproductions of these and to refer to them in the article. It will be very useful to understand his political theory...

:The reason why Hobbes' Leviathan is not discussed here is because it is discussed in its own article, &quot;[[Leviathan (book)]]&quot;--[[User:Apokryltaros|Mr Fink]] ([[User talk:Apokryltaros|talk]]) 12:48, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

::Oh, sorry! I was somehow lost between both articles... --[[User:Platonykiss|Platonykiss]] ([[User talk:Platonykiss|talk]]) 23:09, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

Still I bet Hobbes is the reason a lot of people get to this article; in my opinion it's relevant and should be dedicated a separate paragraph, even if it's an article. [[User:Hillbilly Pilgrim|Hillbilly Pilgrim]] ([[User talk:Hillbilly Pilgrim|talk]]) 10:13, 21 May 2011 (UTC)
:More English speakers are aware of the Bible than they are of Hobbes.  If Hobbes's book was more than just titled Leviathan, we could discuss &quot;Leviathan in Hobbes's Leviathan,&quot; but other than that [[WP:NOTIINFO|Wikipedia is not a random collection of indiscriminate information]].  [[Christian demons in popular culture#Leviathan|The Leviathan section of the &quot;Christian demons in popular culture&quot; article]] does mention Hobbes's book, which is where passing references go to die.  [[WP:DUE|The due weight given to the subject would be one line]], not a paragraph, unless Hobbes actually developed the myth of the Leviathan further.

== fire breathing = Gigantothermy ==

the description of leviathan as breathing fire could be alluding to steam rising from its mouth due to [[Gigantothermy]]. [[User:Lemmiwinks2|Lemmiwinks2]] ([[User talk:Lemmiwinks2|talk]]) 05:05, 15 August 2009 (UTC)

== Etymology ==

If the article includes an etymology of the name, please move it somewhere where it can be more easily found. If not, please add to the intro either the etymology or an explanation of various etymological speculations. Thanks!

== It is not the Torah, it is the Tanakh ==

The Torah are the first five books of the &quot;Old Testament&quot;, and only the first five books alone!  For some reason Christians incessantly and incorrectly call the &quot;Old Testament&quot; by the wrong name.  The Jewish bible is not called the Torah!  The proper name is &quot;TANAKH&quot;!  It would be nice if they would start getting the names of the books and the names of the characters right too.  Your translations are horrible and the lack of true context gained from proper translation has established incorrect doctrine for millinnia.  For a real straight from Hebrew and Aramaic to English translation for Christians and from Greek to English for the B'rit Hadashah (aka New Testament), get &quot;The Complete Jewish Bible&quot; by Dr. Rabbi David Stern.  Back on topic, though - how am I going to believe this guy's article if it starts with a glaring indication that he has not bothered to do any research into the religion in which this figure had it's birth?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.1.38.228|69.1.38.228]] ([[User talk:69.1.38.228|talk]]) 10:35, 26 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:New sections go at the bottom.  Welcome to Wikipedia, where YOU are the editor.  If you see that an article says &quot;Torah&quot; when it should say &quot;Tanakh,&quot; edit the article and fix it.  The article currently isn't locked down, so you should be able to do that.  As for &quot;Your translations,&quot; because you have visited this site, they're your's as well.  That's how wikipedia works. Fix the translations (bring in sources, please) instead of complaining.  That's the strength of wikipedia: if you see something wrong with this encyclopedia, YOU can fix it.  As for &quot;how am I going to believe this guy's article,&quot; who are you refering to?  No one person wrote the Leviathan article.  And again, YOU fix it (be sure to bring in sources).  That's how Wikipedia works.

== &quot;Job '''41'''&quot; ==

What wich is wrotten in the article that the quite is from Job 41 is probably a mistake wich was caused because that its source (a web) was wrong; According to my Hebrew version of the bible, is from Job unit number '''40''' in the 25th sentense (Pasuk); but perhaps an &quot;un-jew&quot; version of the bible isn't exactly like the jewish version)...  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:עברית|עברית]] ([[User talk:עברית|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/עברית|contribs]]) 09:48, 28 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Source or Remove it. ==

In the Judaism text version of this article there is a claim that Leviathan is referred to in the first book of Genesis, along with an elaborate story of God being afraid of them reproducing. I Can't find a bible that states this, and the comment has nor source. Am I missing something? If not, it seems that is should be removed.

:I finally worked out what you probably mean. You're talking about the post-Biblical rabbinic riffs on Leviathan - the article directs you to &quot;B.B.74&quot;, which means the Bhava Batra, chapter 74. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 13:23, 13 November 2011 (UTC)

== Canaanite Myth ==

According to &quot;Myth : Myth and Legends of the World Explored by Kenneth McLeish&quot;, Liviathan in Canaanite myth, was the personification of the chaos at the beginning of the universe, a seven-Headed, fire-breathing, crocodile-dragon, the power of the primordial ocean given form. She lurked in the depths of the sea which was herself, waiting for her momment to surge up and snatch her victims. ANAT fought her nd chained her, bringing order to the universe, - but, the myth ends, Liviathan is not dead but mearly sleeping, and one day will return to destroy us all. Note: Hebrew and Christian teachers fell joyfully on this myth using Laviathan as a metaphor for everything which threatened the stability of Yahweh and his worshipers, from the Babylonian and Egyptian nations which enslaved them to the Power of Satan which God's Angels will destroy on the Day of Judgement.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.202.233.174|68.202.233.174]] ([[User talk:68.202.233.174|talk]]) 23:29, 11 August 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Is Leviathon a mamal==
Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.

:New stuff goes at the bottom, and please sign your posts with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), thank you.  Lamentations 4 does not directly mention Leviathan, to conclude that that verse implies anything about Leviathan would be [[WP:NOR|original research, which this site does not use]].

==Is Leviathon a SUBMARINE VOLCANO?==

The following verses from Job 41 not only discredit any real animal origins of the Leviathan but also give credence to the theory it was a submarine volcanic eruption.

18 His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn. 19 Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out. 20 Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. 21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.

I've tried to add this to the Leviathan page but my edits keep getting reverted. Is there no option to add suggested origins for the Leviathan on the page? 

([[User:Oh My Volcano|Oh My Volcano]] ([[User talk:Oh My Volcano|talk]]) 15:47, 14 October 2012 (UTC))

:This is your interpretation, right? Read [[WP:NOR]] and [[WP:VERIFY]] - we can't use our own interpretations, you will need a source making this suggestion and the source must meet our criteria at [[WP:RS]]. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 15:53, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

Yes, and it seems I am alone in this interpretation. Drat! It's a lonely place and may stay lonely given how much people, especially the experts, hate new ideas. I have just put my theory to about sixty experts so maybe I will hear something positive soon. Watch this space. p.s. if it helps my case then Lernaean Hydra, Chimera and Typhon....all sea monsters....were of volcanic origin.([[User:Oh My Volcano|Oh My Volcano]] ([[User talk:Oh My Volcano|talk]]) 23:09, 17 October 2012 (UTC))

Ian. I didn't say I was expecting private email chats to be used as 'evidence'! Oh dear me. Maybe something will come of the chats. You never know.

Apokryltaros. Sorry, typo....I meant to say 'monsters of volcanic origin'. One word edited out but my point remains intact. Are we in agreement that Hydra, Chimera and Typhon are of volcanic origin? 'Go read your mythology again'? A bit rude isn't it? I thought Wiki had a 'be polite' rule. ([[User:Oh My Volcano|Oh My Volcano]] ([[User talk:Oh My Volcano|talk]]) 21:34, 18 October 2012 (UTC))
