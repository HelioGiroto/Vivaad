{{Books of the New Testament}}
The '''Gospel According to [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]''' ({{lang-el|κατὰ Ματθαῖον εὐαγγέλιον, ''kata Matthaion euangelion'', τὸ εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ματθαῖον}}, ''to euangelion kata Matthaion'') ('''Gospel of Matthew''' or simply '''Matthew''') is one of the four [[canonical gospels]], one of the three [[synoptic gospels]], and the first book of the [[New Testament]]. It tells of the [[New Testament view on Jesus' life|life]], [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]].

Matthew probably originated in a Jewish-Christian community in Roman Syria towards the end of the first century A.D.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duling, pp.298,302&quot;&gt;Duling, pp.298, 302&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous author drew three main sources, including the [[Gospel of Mark]], the sayings collection known as the [[Q source]], and material unique to his own community.&lt;ref&gt;Burkett, p.175–6&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative tells how Israel's Messiah, having been rejected by Israel (i.e., God's chosen people), withdrew into the circle of his disciples, passed judgment on those who had rejected him (so that &quot;Israel&quot; becomes the non-believing &quot;Jews&quot;), and finally sent the disciples instead to the gentiles&lt;ref name=&quot;Luz 1995, p.84&quot;&gt;Luz (1995), p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and setting==
[[File:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|left|thumb|''Evangelist Mathäus und der Engel'' by [[Rembrandt]]]]

===Authorship and sources===
The Gospel of Matthew does not name its author. The tradition that this was the disciple Matthew begins with the early Christian bishop [[Papias of Hierapolis]] (about 100–140 AD), who, in a passage with several ambiguous phrases, wrote: &quot;Matthew collected the oracles (''[[logia]]''—sayings of or about Jesus) in the Hebrew language (''Hebraïdi dialektōi''—perhaps alternatively &quot;Hebrew style&quot;) and each one interpreted (''hērmēneusen''—or &quot;translated&quot;) them as best he could.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner, pp.15-16&quot;&gt;Turner, pp.15–16&lt;/ref&gt; On the surface this implies that Matthew was written in Hebrew and translated into Greek, but Matthew's Greek &quot;reveals none of the telltale marks of a translation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have put forward several theories to explain Papias: perhaps Matthew wrote two gospels, one, now lost, in Hebrew, the other our Greek version; or perhaps the ''logia'' was a collection of sayings rather than the gospel; or by ''dialektōi'' Papias may have meant that Matthew wrote in the Jewish style rather than in the Hebrew language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner, pp.15-16&quot;/&gt;

Papias does not identify his Matthew, but by the end of the 2nd century the tradition of Matthew the tax-collector had become widely accepted, and the line &quot;The Gospel According to Matthew&quot; began to be added to manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Duling, pp. 301–2&lt;/ref&gt; For many reasons scholars today believe otherwise—for example, the gospel is based on Mark, and &quot;it seems unlikely that an eyewitness of Jesus's ministry, such as Matthew, would need to rely on others for information about it&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burkett, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;—and believe instead that it was written between about 80–90 AD by a highly educated Jew (an &quot;Israelite&quot;, in the language of the gospel itself), intimately familiar with the technical aspects of Jewish law, standing on the boundary between traditional and non-traditional Jewish values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duling, pp.298,302&quot;/&gt; The disciple Matthew was probably honoured within the author's circle, as the name Matthew is more prominent in this gospel than any other.&lt;ref&gt;Duling, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; 

The author drew on three primary sources, each representing a distinct community: a hypothetical collection, or several collections, of sayings  (called &quot;[[Q source|Q]]&quot;, and shared with Luke); the [[Gospel of Mark]]; and material unique to Matthew (called &quot;M&quot;, some of which may have originated with Matthew himself).&lt;ref&gt;Burkett, p.175, 177&lt;/ref&gt; 

He wrote for a Jewish audience: like &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, he stresses the continuing relevance of the Jewish law; unlike Mark he never bothers to explain Jewish customs; and unlike Luke, who traces Jesus's ancestry back to Adam, father of the human race, he traces it only to Abraham, father of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Burkett, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; The content of &quot;M&quot; suggests that this community was stricter than the others in its attitude to keeping the Jewish law, holding that they must exceed the scribes and the Pharisees in &quot;righteousness&quot; (adherence to Jewish law); and of the three only &quot;M&quot; refers to a &quot;church&quot; (''ecclesia''), an organised group with rules for keeping order.&lt;ref&gt;Burkett, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

View of an [[Aramaic primacy|Aramaic original New Testament]] is held by a minority of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Original Language of the Lukan Infancy Narrative | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | author=Jung, Chang-Wook | year=2004 | pages=13-15 |isbn=9780567082053 | url = http://books.google.nl/books?id=Gpys3LlUvUAC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting: the community of the Gospel of Matthew===
[[File:Minuscule 484 (f. 9).jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of Matthew in [[Minuscule 484]]]]
A. J. Saldarini summarises the common scholarly view on the origins of Matthew as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[T]he Gospel of Matthew addresses a deviant group within the Jewish community in greater Syria, a reformist Jewish sect seeking influence and power (relatively unsuccessfully) within the Jewish community as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Saldarini (1994), p.198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The community which gave rise to Matthew originated in Palestine, but: &quot;There the community’s mission to Israel failed, and eventually, probably in the period preceding the Jewish War of 66-70, they were forced to leave the land of Israel. They found a new home in Syria and began to missionize among the Gentiles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Luz (2005), p.244&lt;/ref&gt; Antioch, a coastal city in northern Syria and the third largest in the Roman world, is often mentioned as this later home of the Matthean community, but it could have been any large city in the eastern Mediterranean with large Jewish and Christian populations, and recent research points towards a location near Galilee or Judea.&lt;ref&gt;Saldarini (2003), pp.1000-1001&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to an influential hypothesis put forward by W.D. Davies, the gospel of Matthew was written as a direct response to developments within the Jewish community following the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD.  The Pharisees of Judea emerged as the new leaders of the Jewish community after the war, and the loss of the Temple and its priests and the ritual of sacrifice faced them with the problem of finding a new Jewish identity. Their answer was to insist on strict observance of the Law (the [[Torah]]), isolation from the gentiles, and minimalisation of the expectation of the coming of the Messiah (the expectation which had provoked the war). The Jewish Christians of Antioch responded differently: obedience to law will be done though following Jesus; Jesus was the Messiah; and Jew and gentile were to be brought into the one community.&lt;ref&gt;Senior (2001), pp.8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

If Matthew's prime concern was to preserve the Jewish character of the church, he failed: Christianity became a Gentile religion, and Christianity and Judaism came to view each other as opposites. Matthew's own Christian community may have called themselves [[Nazorean]]s, a sect mentioned by [[Jerome]] and others: like Matthew, they maintained a &quot;high [[Christology]]&quot; (i.e., they stressed Jesus' divine nature over his human-ness), and did not demand that Gentile Christians observe all the Law.&lt;ref&gt;Senior (2001), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and content==
[[File:Minuscule 447.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Beginning of the Gospel of Matthew in [[Minuscule 447]]]]
{{Content of Matthew}}

===Structure===
Most commentators seem to agree that Matthew, alone among the gospels, alternates five blocks of narrative with five of discourse, marking each off with the phrase &quot;When Jesus had finished...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Five Discourses of Matthew]]). Some scholars see in this five-part layout a deliberate plan to create a parallel to the first five books of the Old Testament; others see a three-part structure based around the idea of Jesus as [[Messiah]]; or a set of weekly readings spread out over the year; or no plan at all.&lt;ref&gt;Davies&amp;Allison, pp.59-61&lt;/ref&gt; Davies and Allison draw attention to the use of &quot;triads&quot; (the gospel groups things in threes),&lt;ref&gt;Davies&amp;Allison, pp.62 and following&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Thomas France|R. T. France]] notes the geographic movement from Galilee to Jerusalem and back (the post-resurrection appearances in Galilee are the culmination of the whole story).&lt;ref&gt;France, p.2 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue: genealogy, nativity and infancy===
{{Main|Genealogy of Jesus}}{{Main|Nativity of Jesus}}
The Gospel of Matthew begins with the words &quot;The Book of Genealogy [in Greek, &quot;Genesis&quot;] of Jesus Christ&quot;, deliberately echoing the first words of the [[Septuagint|Old Testament in Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;France, p.26 note 1, and p.28: &quot;The first two words of Matthew's gospel are literally “book of genesis”&lt;/ref&gt; The genealogy tells of Jesus' descent from [[Abraham]] and [[King David]] and the miraculous events surrounding his [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]],&lt;ref&gt;France, p.28 note 7:  &quot;All MSS and versions agree in making it explicit that Joseph was not Jesus' father, with the one exception of sys, which reads “Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, begot Jesus.”&lt;/ref&gt; and the infancy narrative tells of the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the innocents]], [[Flight into Egypt|the flight into Egypt]], and eventual journey to Nazareth.

===First narrative and discourse===
{{Main|Baptism of Jesus}}{{Main|Sermon on the Mount}}
The first narrative section begins. [[John the Baptist|John]] baptizes Jesus, and the Holy Spirit descends upon him. Jesus prays and meditates in the wilderness for forty days, and is tempted by [[Satan]]. His early ministry by word and deed in Galilee meets with much success, and leads to the Sermon on the Mount, the first of the discourses. The sermon presents the ethics of the [[kingdom of God]], and includes the [[Beatitudes]] (&quot;Blessed are...&quot;)&lt;ref name = &quot;5G&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; as its introduction. It concludes with a reminder that the response to the kingdom will have eternal consequences, and the crowd's amazed response leads into the next narrative block.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second narrative and discourse===
From the authoritative words of Jesus the gospel turns to three sets of three [[miracles of Jesus|miracles]] interwoven with two  sets of two [[disciples of Jesus|discipleship]] stories (the second narrative), followed by a discourse on mission and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus commissions the [[Twelve Disciples]] and sends them to preach to the Jews, perform miracles, and prophesy the imminent coming of the Kingdom,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; commanding them to travel lightly, without staff or sandals, and to be prepared for persecution. Scholars are divided over whether these rules originated with Jesus or with apostolic practice.&lt;ref name = &quot;5G&quot;/&gt;

===Third narrative and discourse===
Opposition to Jesus comes to a head with accusations that his deeds are done through the power of Satan; Jesus in turn accuses his opponents of blaspheming the Holy Spirit. The discourse is a set of parables emphasising the sovereignty of God, and concluding with a challenge to the disciples to understand the teachings as scribes of the kingdom of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; (Matthew avoids using the [[names of God in Judaism|holy word God]] in the expression &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;; instead he prefers the term &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, reflecting the Jewish tradition of not speaking the name of God).&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth narrative and discourse===
{{main|Confession of Peter}}
The fourth narrative section reveals that the increasing opposition to Jesus will result in his crucifixion in Jerusalem, and that his disciples must therefore prepare for his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p.356&lt;/ref&gt; The instructions for the post-crucifixion church emphasize responsibility and humility.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;&quot;Matthew, Gospel acc. to St.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; (This section contains Matthew 16:13–19, in which Simon, newly renamed Peter, (πέτρος, ''petros,'' meaning &quot;stone&quot;), calls Jesus &quot;the Christ, the son of the living God&quot;, and Jesus states that on this &quot;bedrock&quot; (πέτρα, ''petra'') he will build his church—the passage forms the foundation for the [[papacy]]'s [[Primacy_of_the_Bishop_of_Rome|claim of authority]]).

===Fifth narrative and discourse===
{{Main|Second Coming}}
Jesus travels to Jerusalem, and the opposition intensifies: he is tested by [[Pharisees]] immediately he begins to move towards the city, and when he arrives he is soon in conflict with the Temple and other religious leaders. The disciples ask about the future, and in his final discourse (the [[Olivet discourse]]) Jesus speaks of the coming end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner, p.445&quot;&gt;Turner, p.445&lt;/ref&gt; There will be false Messiahs, earthquakes, and persecutions, the sun, moon, and stars will fail, but &quot;this generation&quot; will not pass away before all the prophecies are fulfilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; The disciples must steel themselves for ministry to all the nations. At the end of the discourse Matthew notes that Jesus has finished all his words, and attention turns to the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner, p.445&quot;/&gt;

===Conclusion: Passion, Resurrection and Great Commission===
The events of Jesus' last week occupy a third of the content of all four gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p.613&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus  enters Jerusalem in triumph and drives the money changers from the temple, holds a [[last supper]], prays to be spared the coming agony, and is betrayed. He is tried by the Jewish leaders (the [[Sanhedrin]]) and before [[Pontius Pilate]], and Pilate washes his hands of his blood. Jesus is crucified as king of the Jews, mocked by all. On his death there is an earthquake, and saints rise from their tombs. The two Marys discover the empty tomb, guarded by an angel, and Jesus himself tells them to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee. 

After the resurrection the remaining disciples return to Galilee, &quot;to the mountain that Jesus had appointed,&quot; where he comes to them and tells them that he has been given &quot;all authority in heaven and on Earth.&quot; He gives the Great Commission: &quot;Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you;&quot; Jesus will be with them &quot;to the very end of the age.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp.687-688&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes in Matthew==
[[Image:Matthew Evangelist Incunabula Koberger Bible wiki.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut from [[Anton Koberger]]'s Bible (Nuremberg, 1483): The angelically inspired Saint Matthew musters the Old Testament figures, led by [[Abraham]] and [[David]]]]

Matthew's gospel tells how Israel's Messiah is rejected by Israel, withdraws into the circle of his disciples, passes judgment on those who have rejected him so that &quot;Israel&quot; becomes the non-believing &quot;Jews&quot;, and sends the disciples instead to the gentiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luz 1995, p.84&quot;/&gt; The title [[Son of David]] identifies Jesus as the healing and miracle-working Messiah of Israel (it is used exclusively in relation to miracles, and the Jewish messiah is sent to Israel alone);&lt;ref&gt;Luz (1995), pp.86 and 111&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Son of Man]] he will return to judge the world (a fact his disciples recognise but of which his enemies are unaware);&lt;ref&gt;Luz (1995), pp.91, 97&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Son of God]] he has a unique relationship with God, God revealing himself through his son, and Jesus proving his sonship through his obedience and example.&lt;ref&gt;Luz (1995), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Crucifixion]] the Jews are called [[Israelites]], the honorific title of God's chosen people; after it, they are called &quot;[[Ioudaioi]]&quot;, Jews, a sign that through their rejection of the Christ the &quot;[[Kingdom of God|kingdom of Heaven]]&quot; has been taken away from them and given instead to the church.&lt;ref&gt;Strecker p.369-370&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel has been interpreted as reflecting the struggles and conflicts between the evangelist's community and the other Jews, particularly with its sharp criticism of the scribes and Pharisees.&lt;ref&gt;Burkett, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; 

The roots of the gospel in the Matthew-community of the late 1st century give rise to another important title bestowed on Jesus by Matthew, [[Emmanuel]], &quot;God is With Us&quot;—meaning that through Jesus, God is with the ''ecclesia'' (literally &quot;assembly&quot;, but translated as &quot;[[christian church|church]]&quot;). Theologically, Matthew's prime concern was that the Jewish tradition should not be lost in a church increasingly becoming gentile.&lt;ref&gt;Davies&amp;Allison (1997), p.722&lt;/ref&gt; This concern lies behind the frequent citations of Jewish scripture, the evocation of Jesus and the new Moses along with other events from Jewish history, and the concern to present Jesus as fulfilling, not destroying, the Law.&lt;ref&gt;Senior (2001), pp.17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish theme in the Gospel of Matthew is apparent in other ways as well. First, nearly every important person in the Gospel of Matthew is Jewish. For example, Jesus, the twelve apostles, and the crowds are Jewish. They never deny their Jewish faith in the gospel. Next, Israel is a common theme in the Gospel of Matthew. For instance, in Matthew 15:31, after a story of the healings of Jesus, the text reads that the crowds ‘praised the God of Israel.’&lt;ref name=&quot;Hare 2000 264–277&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hare|first=Douglas|title=How Jewish is the Gospel of Matthew?|journal=[[Catholic Biblical Quarterly]]|year=2000|volume=62|series=2|pages=264–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Matthew may have been influenced by [[Jewish Christianity]], a movement in the first few centuries CE which saw Jesus as [[Jewish messianism|the Messiah]], but continued to practice Jewish customs and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Phenomenon of Early Jewish-Christianity: Reality or Scholarly Invention?|journal=[[Vigiliae Christianae]]|year=1990|volume=44|pages=313–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]], a Jewish Christian text, possesses similar themes to the Gospel of Matthew. These themes include many Jewish related elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hare 2000 264–277&quot;/&gt;

==Comparison with other writings==
Matthew, like Luke, incorporates nearly the whole of Mark, keeping the outline intact and adding genealogy-birth-infancy stories to the beginning and post-resurrection appearances to the end.&lt;ref&gt;Aune (1987), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have argued that Matthew is simply an expanded version of Mark, but it is also a creative reinterpretation of the source,&lt;ref&gt;Bockmuehl&amp;Hagner, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; stressing Jesus' teachings as much as his acts,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; and making subtle changes in order to stress Jesus' divine nature – Mark's &quot;young man&quot; who appears at Jesus' tomb, for example, becomes a radiant angel in Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Bockmuehl&amp;Hagner, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle stories in Mark do not demonstrate the divinity of Jesus, as this is an idea not found in that gospel, but rather confirm his status as an emissary of God (which was Mark's understanding of the Messiah).&lt;ref&gt;Aune (1987), p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a broad disagreement over chronology between Matthew, Mark and Luke on one hand and John on the other: all four agree that Jesus' public ministry began with an encounter with John the Baptist, but Matthew, Mark and Luke follow this with an account of teaching and healing in Galilee, then a trip to Jerusalem where there is an incident in the Temple, climaxing with the crucifixion on the day of the [[Passover]] holiday. [[Gospel of John|John]], by contrast, puts the Temple incident very early in Jesus' ministry, has several trips to Jerusalem, and puts the crucifixion immediately before the Passover holiday, on the day when the lambs for the Passover meal were being sacrificed in Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p.373&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew agrees with [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] that gentiles did not have to be [[circumcision|circumcised]] in order to enter the church, but unlike Paul (and like Luke) he believed that the Law was still in force, which meant that Jews within the church had to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, p.xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
[[Image:KellsFol034rChiRhoMonogram.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Chi Rho monogram]] from the [[Book of Kells]] is the most lavish such monogram]]
In [[Insular art|Insular]] [[Gospel Book]]s (copies of the Gospels produced in Ireland and Britain under [[Celtic Christianity]]), the first verse of Matthew's genealogy of Christ was often treated in a decorative manner, as it began not only a new book of the Bible, but was the first verse in the Gospels. &lt;!--Removed some sentences concerning the chi-rho, because the chi-rho does not start the book of Matthew as was stated.--&gt;
