{{JapaneseBuddhism}}
'''Vajrayana''' ([[Devanagari]]: वज्रयान; [[Oriya language|Oriya]]: ବଜ୍ରଯାନ, [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: རྡོ་རྗེ་ཐེག་པ་, rdo rje theg pa; [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: Очирт хөлгөн, ''Ochirt Hölgön'', [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 密宗, ''mì zōng'') is also known as '''Tantric Buddhism''', '''Tantrayāna''', '''Mantrayāna''', '''Secret Mantra''', '''Esoteric Buddhism''' and the '''Diamond Vehicle'''. Vajrayana is a complex and multifaceted system of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought and practice which evolved over several centuries.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875-876}} 

According to Vajrayana scriptures Vajrayana refers to one of three vehicles or [[Yana (Buddhism)|routes to enlightenment]], the other two being the [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]].

Its main scriptures are called [[Tantras]].{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875-876}} A distinctive feature of Vajrayana Buddhism is its use of [[rituals]] known as [[Upaya]] (or Skillful Means), which are used as a substitute or alternative for abstract meditations.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=466}}{{sfn|Hawkins|1999|p=24}}

== History of Vajrayana ==
Although the first tantric Buddhist texts appeared in India in the 3rd century and continued to appear until the 12th century,{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=194}} scholars such as Hirakawa Akira assert that the Vajrayana probably came into existence in the 6th or 7th century,{{sfn|Akira|1993|p=9}} while the term Vajrayana itself first appeared in the 8th century.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875-876}} The Vajrayana was preceded by the Mantrayana, and then followed by the Sahajayana and Kalachakrayana.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}

=== India ===
The period of Indian Vajrayana Buddhism has been classified as the fifth{{sfn|Akira|1993|p=9}} or final{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875-876}} period of [[Indian Buddhism]]. The literature of Vajrayana is absent from the oldest Buddhist literature of the [[Pali Canon]] and the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]].

====Mythological origins====
In the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition, it is claimed that the historical [[Gotama Buddha|Shakyamuni Buddha]] taught [[tantras|tantra]], but that since these are 'secret' teachings, confined to the [[guru]]/disciple relationship, they were generally written down long after the Buddha's other teachings, the [[Pali Canon]] and the  [[Mahayana sutras]]. The Vajrayana tradition holds that its teachings were first expounded by the Buddha sixteen years after his enlightenment. Historians have identified an early stage of Mantrayana beginning in the 4th century, and argue that assigning the teachings to the historical Buddha is &quot;patently absurd.&quot;{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}}{{Clarify|date=October 2012}}

According to some traditions, Tantric Buddhism first developed in Uddiyana, a country which was divided into the two kingdoms Sambaḷa and Lankapuri. Sambaḷa has been identified with Sambalpur and Lankapuri with Subarnapura ([[Sonepur, Orissa|Sonepur]]).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/27923300/Buddhist-Remains-in-Western-Orissa Buddhist remains in western Orissa]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indrabhuti]], the king of [[Sambalpur]] founded Vajrayana, while his sister, who was married to Prince (Yuvaraja) Jalendra of Lankapuri ([[Sonepur, Orissa|Sonepur]]), founded Sahajayana.{{sfn|Datta|2006}}

====Historical origins====
=====Mantrayana and Vajrayana=====
Although the Vajrayana claims to be as ancient and authentic as any other Buddhist school, it may have grown up gradually in an environment with previously existing texts such as the ''[[mahasannipata]]'' and the ''[[ratnaketudharani]]''.{{sfn|Warder| 1999|p=459-461}} The basic position of Vajrayana is still the same as the [[Early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] position of [[anatta|not-self]]: there is nothing which is eternal.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=477}} The changes that took place reflected the changing society of medieval India: the presentation changed, the techniques of the way to enlightenment changed, and the outward appearance of Buddhism came to be dominated by ritualism, and the array of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and gods and goddesses.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=477}}

There are differing views as to where in the Indian sub-continent that Vajrayana began. There are assumptions about the origin of Vajrayana in [[Bengal]],{{sfn|Banerjee|1977}} [[Oddiyana|Uddiyana]], located at [[Orissa]], or in the modern day [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat Valley]] in [[Pakistan]]. 

The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. [[Nalanda|Nalanda University]] in eastern India became a center for the development of Vajrayana theory, although it is likely that the university followed, rather than led, the early [[tantra|Tantric]] movement. 

Only from the 7th{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}} or the beginning of the 8th century, tantric techniques and approaches increasingly dominated Buddhist practice in India.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=194}} From the 7th century onwards many popular religious elements of a heterogeneous nature were incorporated into [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, which finally resulted in the appearance of Vajrayana, Kalachakrayana, and Sahajayana Tantric Buddhism. These new Tantric cults of Buddhism introduced [[Mantra]], [[Mudra]] and [[Mandala]], along with six tantric Abhicharas (practices) such as Marana (Death), Stambhana, Sammohana, Vidvesan, Uchchatana and Vajikarana. These cults revived primitive beliefs and practices, a simpler and less formal approach to the personal god, a liberal and respectful attitude towards women, and denial of the caste system.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.bharathtravels.com/Buddhist.asp Buddhist Heritage Travel Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://bargarh.nic.in/tourism.htm Official Website of Bargarh District]&lt;/ref&gt;

India would continue as the source of leading-edge Vajrayana practices up until the 11th century, producing many renowned [[Mahasiddha]].

(Vajrayana) Buddhism had mostly died out in [[India]] by the 13th century, and tantric versions of Buddhism and Hinduism were also experiencing pressure from invading Islamic armies. By that time, the vast majority of the practices were also manifest in Tibet, where they were preserved until recently.

In the second half of the 20th century a sizable number of Tibetan exiles fled the oppressive, anti-religious rule of the [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] to establish Tibetan Buddhist communities in northern India, particularly around [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]].

=====Sahajayana and Kalachakrayana=====
The Vajrayana established the symbolic terminology and the liturgy that would characterize all forms of the tradition.{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}}

The [[Sahaja]]yana developed in the eight century in Bengal.{{sfn|Schumann|1974|163}} It was dominated by long-haired, wandering [[siddha]]s who openly challenged and ridiculed the Buddhist establishment.{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}} Its most important text is the ''Dohakosa'', written by Sarahapada.{{sfn|Schumann|1974|p=163}}

The [[Kalachakra Tantra|Kalachakrayana]] developed in the 10th century.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} It is farthest removed from the earlier Buddhist traditions, and incorporates concepts of [[messianism]] and [[astrology]] not present elsewhere in Buddhist literature.{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}}

====Despised classes====
The Tantric [[Buddhist]] sects made efforts to raise the dignity of the lowest of the low of the society to a higher level. Many celebrated Vajrayana Acharyas like [[Saraha]], Hadipa, Dombi, [[Heruka]], Tantipa (Tantripāda) and [[Luipa|Luipāda]] came from the so-called despised classes. 

The cult exerted a tremendous influence over the tribal and despised classes of people of Sambalpur and [[Bolangir]] region. 

It was in the 9th-10th century that there appeared seven famous Tantric maidens in the Patna ([[Patnagarh]]) region, which was then called Kuānri-Pātaṇā. These maidens are popularly known as Sāta Bhauni (Seven sisters), namely, Gyanadei Maluni, Luhakuti, Luhuruṇi, Nitei Dhobani, Sukuti Chamaruṇi, Patrapindhi Sabaruṇi, Gangi Gauduṇi and sua Teluṇi. They hailed from the castes which were considered the lower castes of society, and were followers of Lakshminkara. Because of their miraculous power and feats, they were later deified and worshiped by the locals.{{sfn|Mishra|2011}}

=== China ===
{{Main|Chinese Buddhism}}
[[Image:Lingyin temple 18 armed cundi.jpeg|thumb|right|Esoteric practices related to [[Cundi (Buddhism)|Cundī]] have remained popular in [[Chinese Buddhism]] and the [[Sinosphere]].]]
Esoteric teachings followed the same route into northern [[China]] as [[Buddhism]] itself, arriving via the [[Silk Road]] sometime during the first half of the 7th century, during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Esoteric Mantrayana practices arrived from India just as Buddhism was reaching its zenith in China, and received sanction from the emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. During this time, three great masters came from India to China: [[Subhakarasimha|Śubhakarasiṃha]], [[Vajrabodhi]], and [[Amoghavajra]]. These three masters brought the esoteric teachings to their height of popularity in China.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibbhuti (2008) ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism'': p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, the two main source texts were the ''{{IAST|[[Mahavairocana Sutra|Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra]]}}'', and the ''{{IAST|[[Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra]]}}''. Traditions in the Sinosphere still exist for these teachings, and they more or less share the same doctrines as Shingon, with many of its students themselves traveling to Japan to be given transmission at [[Mount Koya]].

Esoteric methods were naturally incorporated into [[Chinese Buddhism]] during the Tang Dynasty. Śubhakarasiṃha's most eminent disciple, Master Yixing (Ch. 一行), was a member of the [[Zen]] school. In such a way, in Chinese Buddhism there was no major distinction between exoteric and esoteric practices, and the northern school of Zen Buddhism even became known for its esoteric practices of [[dharani|dhāraṇīs]] and [[mantra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, Robert (2001) ''Coming to Terms With Chinese Buddhism: A Reading of the Treasure Store Treatise'': p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faure, Bernard (1997) ''The Will to Orthodoxy: A Critical Genealogy of Northern Chan Buddhism'': p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Yuan Dynasty]], the [[Mongol]] emperors made Esoteric Buddhism the official religion of China, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nan Huaijin 1997. p. 99&quot;&gt;Nan Huaijin. ''Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen.'' York Beach: Samuel Weiser. 1997. p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; A common perception was that this patronage of lamas caused corrupt forms of tantra to become widespread.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nan Huaijin 1997. p. 99&quot;/&gt; When the Mongol Yuan Dynasty was overthrown and the [[Ming Dynasty]] was established, the Tibetan lamas were expelled from the court, and this form of Buddhism was denounced as not being an orthodox path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nan Huaijin 1997. p. 99&quot;/&gt;

In [[late imperial China]], the early traditions of Esoteric Buddhism were still thriving in Buddhist communities. Robert Gimello has also observed that in these communities, the esoteric practices associated with [[Cundi (Buddhism)|Cundī]] were extremely popular among both the populace and the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang, Wu (2008). ''Enlightenment in Dispute: The Reinvention of Chan Buddhism in Seventeenth-Century China'': p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tibet and other Himalayan kingdoms ===
{{Main|Tibetan Buddhism}}
In 747 the Indian master [[Padmasambhava]] traveled from [[Afghanistan]] to bring Vajrayana Buddhism to [[Tibet]] and [[Bhutan]], at the request of the king of Tibet. This was the original transmission which anchors the lineage of the [[Nyingma]] school.  During the 11th century and early 12th century a second important transmission occurred with the lineages of [[Atisa]], [[Marpa Lotsawa|Marpa]] and [[Brogmi]], giving rise to the other schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], namely [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]], [[Kagyu]], [[Sakya]], and [[Geluk]] (the school of the [[Dalai Lama]]).

=== Japan ===

{{Main|Japanese Buddhism}}
{{Also|Shingon}}

During the [[Tang Dynasty]] in China, when esoteric Buddhist practices reached their peak, Japan was actively importing Buddhism, its texts and teachings, by sending monks on risky missions across the sea to stay in China for two years or more. Depending on where the monk stayed and trained, they may have brought back esoteric Buddhist material and training back to Japan.

In 804, monk [[Saicho]] came back from China with teachings from the [[Tiantai]] sect, but was also trained in esoteric lineages.  When he later founded the Japanese [[Tendai]] sect, esoteric practices were integrated with the Tendai teachings, but Tendai is not an exclusively esoteric sect.  Subsequent disciples of Saicho also returned from China in later years with further esoteric training, which helped to flesh out the lineage in Japan.

On the same mission in 804, [[Emperor Kammu]] also sent monk [[Kūkai]] to the [[Tang Dynasty]] capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]).  Kūkai absorbed the Vajrayana thinking from eminent Indian and Chinese Vajrayana teachers at the time, and synthesized a version of which he took back with him to Japan, where he founded the [[Shingon]] school of Buddhism, a school which continues to this day.  Unlike Tendai, Shingon is a purely esoteric sect.

=== Indonesian Archipelago ===
The empire of [[Srivijaya]] in southeast Sumatra was already a center of Vajrayana learning when Dharma Master [[I Ching (monk)|Yijing]] (Ch. 法師義淨) resided there for six months in 671, long before [[Padmasambhava]] brought the method to Tibet. In the 11th century, [[Atisha]] studied in Srivijaya under [[Serlingpa]], an eminent Buddhist scholar and a prince of the Srivijayan ruling house.

Through early economic relationships with the Srivijaya Empire, the Philippines came under the influence of Vajrayana.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Vajrayana Buddhism also influenced the construction of [[Borobudur]], a three-dimensional [[mandala]], in central Java circa 800.

[[Image:Young Monk in Shalu Monastery Shigatse Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|left|thumb|Young Monk in Shalu Monastery, [[Shigatse]], [[Tibet]]]]

=== Mongolia ===
In the 13th century, the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teachers of the [[Sakya]] school led by [[Sakya Pandita|Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen]], took part in a religious debate with [[Christian]]s and [[Muslims]] before the [[Mongolia]]n royal court. As a result  the Mongolian [[Prince Godan]] adopted Tibetan Buddhism as his personal religion, although not requiring it of his subjects.  [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]], Sakya Pandita's nephew, eventually converted [[Kublai Khan]] to Buddhism. 

Since the Khan conquered China and established the [[Yuan Dynasty]] which lasted from 1271 to 1368, this led to the renewal in [[China]] of the Tantric practices which had died out there many years earlier. Vajrayana practice declined in China and Mongolia with the fall of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Mongolia saw another revival of Vajrayana in the 17th century, with the establishment of ties between the [[Dalai Lama]] in [[Tibet]] and the Mongolian princedoms. This revived the historic pattern of the spiritual leaders of Tibet acting as priests to the rulers of the [[Mongol empire]]. Having survived suppression by the Communists, [[Buddhism in Mongolia]] is today primarily of the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, and is being re-invigorated following the fall of the Communist government.

==Place within Buddhist tradition==
Various classifications are possible when distinguishing Vajrayana from the other Buddhist traditions.

===Third turning of the wheel===
Vajrayana can also be seen as the third of the three &quot;turnings of the wheel of dharma&quot;:{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}}
# In the first turning [[Shakyamuni]] Buddha taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] at [[Varanasi]] in the 5th century BC, which led to the founding of Buddhism and the later [[early Buddhist schools]]. Details of the first turning are described in the ''[[Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta]]''. The oldest scriptures do not mention any further turnings other than this first turning.
# The Mahayana tradition claims that there was a second turning in which the ''[[Perfection of Wisdom]] sutras'' were taught at [[Vulture's Peak]], which led to the [[Mahayana]] schools. Generally, scholars conclude that the Mahayana scriptures (including the ''Perfection of Wisdom Sutras'') were composed from the 1st century CE onwards.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''Large numbers of Mahayana sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century''.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=494}}}}
# According to the Vajrayana tradition, there was a third turning which took place at [[Dhanyakataka]] sixteen years after the Buddha's enlightenment. Some scholars have strongly denied that Vajrayana appeared at that time,{{sfn|Kitagawa|2002|p=80}} and placed it at a much later time. The first tantric (Vajrayana Buddhist) texts appeared in the 3rd century CE, and they continued to appear until the 12th century.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=194}}

===Sutrayana and Vajrayana===
Vajrayana can be distinguished from the [[Sutrayana]]. The ''Sutrayana'' is the method of perfecting good qualities, where the ''Vajrayāna'' is the method of taking the intended outcome of [[Buddhahood]] as the path.

===Paramitayana and Vajrayana===
According to this schema, Indian Mahayana revealed two vehicles (''yana'') or methods for attaining enlightenment: the method
of the perfections (''Paramitayana'') and the method of mantra (''Mantrayana'').{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} 

The ''Paramitayana'' consists of the six or ten ''[[paramita]]s'', of which the scriptures say that it takes three incalculable [[aeon]]s to lead one to Buddhahood. The tantra literature, however, claims that the ''Mantrayana'' leads one to Buddhahood in a single lifetime.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} According to the literature, the mantra is an easy path without the difficulties innate to the ''Paramitanaya''.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} ''Mantrayana'' is sometimes portrayed as a method for those of inferior abilities.{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}} However the practitioner of the mantra still has to adhere to the vows of the [[Bodhisattva]].{{sfn|Macmillan Publishing|2004|p=875}}

==Philosophical background==
Vajrayana is firmly grounded in Mahayana-philosophy, especially [[Madhyamaka]].

=== Two Truths Doctrine ===
Vajrayana subscribes to the [[two truths doctrine]] of conventional and ultimate truths, which is present in all Buddhist tenet systems.&lt;ref name=Williams315&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies'', p. 315. Routledge, 2006. ISBN 0-415-33226-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (2007). ''The Two Truths in Vaibhashika and Sautrantika.''
March 2001; revised September 2002 and July 2006. Source: [http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/sutra/level5_analysis_mind_reality/truths/2_truths_vaibhashika_sautrantika.html Berzin Archives: Two Truths] (accessed: January 2, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The two truths doctrine is a central concept in the Vajrayana path of practice and is the philosophical basis for its methods. The two truths identifies conventional a.k.a. relative, and absolute a.k.a. nirvana. Conventional truth is the truth of [[consensus reality]], [[common sense|common-sense]] notions of what does and does not exist. Ultimate truth is reality as viewed by an awakened, or [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] mind.

==Characteristics of Vajrayana==
[[Image:Ladakhceremony.jpg|thumb|A Buddhist ceremony in [[Ladakh]].]]

===Goal===
The goal of spiritual practice within the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions is to become a [[Bodhisattva]] (i.e. attainment of a state in which one will subsequently become a [[Buddha]]--after some further reincarnation), whereas the goal for [[Theravada]] practice is specific to become an [[arahant]] (i.e. attain enlightenment with no intention of returning, not even as a Buddha). 

In the Sutrayana practice, a path of [[Mahayana]], the &quot;path of the cause&quot; is taken, whereby a practitioner starts with his or her potential [[Buddha-nature]] and nurtures it to produce the fruit of [[Buddhahood]]. In the Vajrayana the &quot;path of the fruit&quot; is taken whereby the practitioner takes his or her innate Buddha-nature as the means of practice. The premise is that since we innately have an enlightened mind, practicing seeing the world in terms of ultimate truth can help us to attain our full Buddha-nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmo|first=Tenzin|title=''Reflections on a Mountain Lake:Teachings on Practical Buddhism''|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=2002|pages=224–5|isbn=1-55939-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiencing ultimate truth is said to be the purpose of all the various [[Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric techniques]] practiced in the Vajrayana. Apart from the advanced meditation practices such as [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]], which aim to experience the [[voidness|empty]] nature of the enlightened mind that can see ultimate truth, all practices are aimed in some way at purifying the impure perception of the practitioner to allow ultimate truth to be seen. These may be ''[[ngondro]]'', or preliminary practices, or the more advanced techniques of the [[tantra|tantric]] ''[[sadhana]]''.

===Motivation===
As with the Mahayana, motivation is a vital component of Vajrayana practice. The [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva-path]] is an integral part of the Vajrayana, which teaches that all practices are to be undertaken with the motivation to achieve [[Buddhahood]] for the benefit of all sentient beings.

=== Ritual ===
The distinctive feature of Vajrayana Buddhism is [[ritual]], which is used as a substitute or alternative for the earlier abstract meditations.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=466}}{{sfn|Hawkins|1999|p=24}} For Vajrayana Tibetan death rituals, see ''[[phowa]]''.

=== Upaya ===
The Vajrayana is based on the concept of &quot;skilful means&quot; (Sanskrit: ''[[upaya]]'') as formulated in Mahayana Buddhism. It is a system of [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineages]], whereby those who successfully receive an [[Empowerment (Tibetan Buddhism)]] or sometimes called initiation (permission to practice) are seen to share in the [[mindstream]] of the realisation of a particular skillful means of the ''vajra'' Master. In the Vajrayana these skilful means mainly relate to [[Tantra|tantric]], [[Mahamudra]] or [[Dzogchen]] practices. Vajrayana teaches that the Vajrayana techniques provide an accelerated path to [[bodhi|enlightenment]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

=== Esoteric transmission ===
[[Image:Vajra aksamala ghantha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three ritual implements: vajra, bell, and counting beads.]]
{{main|Esoteric transmission|}}

Vajrayana Buddhism is [[esoteric]], in the sense that the transmission of certain teachings only occurs directly from teacher to student during an [[initiation]] or [[Empowerment (Tibetan Buddhism)|empowerment]] and cannot be simply learned from a book.  Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that secrecy itself is not important and only a side-effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Dhammasaavaka. ''The Buddhism Primer: An Introduction to Buddhism'', p. 79. ISBN 1-4116-6334-9&lt;/ref&gt; In order to engage in Vajrayana practice, a student should have received such an initiation or permission:
{{quote|If these techniques are not practiced properly, practitioners may harm themselves physically and mentally. In order to avoid these dangers, the practice is kept &quot;secret&quot; outside the teacher/student relationship. Secrecy and the commitment of the student to the vajra guru are aspects of the ''[[samaya]]'' (Tib. ''damtsig''), or &quot;sacred bond&quot;, that protects both the practitioner and the integrity of the teachings.&quot;{{sfn|Ray|2001}}}}

The teachings may also be considered &quot;self-secret&quot;, meaning that even if they were to be told directly to a person, that person would not necessarily understand the teachings without proper context. In this way the teachings are &quot;secret&quot; to the minds of those who are not following the path with more than a simple sense of curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;Morreale, Don (1998) ''The Complete Guide to Buddhist America'' ISBN 1-57062-270-1 p.215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam and Chödzin, Sherab (1992) ''The Lion's Roar: An Introduction to Tantra'' ISBN 0-87773-654-5 p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The esoteric transmission framework can take varying forms. The [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses a method called [[Dzogchen]]. The Tibetan [[Kagyu]] school and the [[Shingon]] school{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} in Japan use an alternative method called [[Mahamudra]].

=== Vows and behaviour ===
{{main|Samaya}}
Practitioners of the Vajrayana need to abide by various tantric vows or ''[[samaya]]'' of behaviour. These are extensions of the rules of the [[Pratimoksha]] vows and [[Bodhisattva vows]] for the lower levels of tantra, and are taken during initiations into the [[Empowerment (Tibetan Buddhism)|empowerment]] for a particular [[Anuttarayoga tantra]]. The special tantric vows vary depending on the specific [[mandala]] practice for which the initiation is received, and also depending on the level of initiation.

The [[Ngagpa|Ngagpa/Ngakmo]] [[Yogis]] from the [[Nyingma]] school keep a special non-celibate ordination, they are practitioners and are considered neither lay nor monk or nun.

A tantric [[guru]], or teacher, is expected to keep his or her ''samaya'' vows in the same way as his students.  Proper conduct is considered especially necessary for a qualified Vajrayana guru. For example, the ''Ornament for the Essence'' of Manjushrikirti states:&lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa , ''Tantric Ethics: An Explanation of the Precepts for Buddhist Vajrayana Practice'' ISBN 0-86171-290-0, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Distance yourself from Vajra Masters who are not keeping the three vows&lt;br /&gt;
who keep on with a root downfall, who are miserly with the Dharma,&lt;br /&gt;
and who engage in actions that should be forsaken.&lt;br /&gt;
Those who worship them go to hell and so on as a result.}}

=== Classifications of tantra ===
The various Tantra-texts can be classified in various ways.

====Fourfold division====
The best-known classification is by the [[Gelug]], [[Sakya]], and [[Kagyu]] schools, the so-called [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] or New Translation schools of Tibetan Buddhism. They divide the Tantras into four hierarchical categories:
* [[Kriyayoga]], action tantra, which emphasizes ritual;
* [[Charyayoga]], performance tantra, which emphasizes meditation;
* [[Yogatantra]], yoga tantra;
* [[Anuttarayogatantra]], highest yoga tantra, which is further divided into &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;father&quot; and &quot;non-dual&quot; tantras.

====Outer and Inner Tantras====
A different division is used by the [[Nyingma]] or Ancient Translation school. Kriyayoga, Charyayoga and Yogatantra are called the [[Outer Tantras]], while Anuttarayogatantra is divided into  [[Inner Tantras|Three Inner Tantras]], which correspond to the 
* [[Mahayoga]]
* [[Anuyoga]]
* [[Atiyoga]], or [[Dzogchen]]. The practice of Atiyoga is further divided into three classes: Mental [[Semde|SemDe]], Spatial [[Longde (Dzogchen)|LongDe]], and Esoteric Instructional [[MenNgagDe]].

=== Annuttara-yoga tantras ===
In the highest class of tantra, two stages of practice are distinguished. Details of these practices are normally only explained to practitioners by their teachers after receiving an initiation or 'permission to practice'.

In some Buddhist tantras, both stages can be practiced simultaneously, whereas in others, one first actualizes the generation stage before continuing with the completion stage practices.

====Generation stage====
{{main|Generation stage}}
In the first stage of generation, one engages in deity yoga. One practices oneself in the identification with the meditational Buddha or deity (''[[yidam]]'') by visualisations, until one can meditate single-pointedly on 'being' the deity.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A comparison may be made with the &quot;Role theory&quot; of [[Hjalmar Sundén]], which describes how identification with a religious figure can lead to conversion. See (in Dutch) N. Hijweege (1994, ''Bekering in de gereformeerde gezindte'', which describes how the story of Paulus conversion on the road to Damascus serves as an example of the &quot;ideal-conversion&quot; in orthodox Protestant churches.}}

==== Four purities ====
In the ''generation stage'' of Deity Yoga, the practitioner visualizes the &quot;Four Purities&quot; (Tibetan: ''yongs su dag pa bzhi''; ''yongs dag bzhi'')&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Tibetan+%2528Transliterated%2529/yongs+dag+bzhi yongs su dag pa bzhi] (accessed: January 3, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; which define the principal Tantric methodology of Deity Yoga that distinguishes it from the rest of Buddhism:&lt;ref&gt;Yuthok, Choedak (1997) p.27.

# Seeing one's body as the body of the deity
# Seeing one's environment as the [[pure land]] or [[mandala]] of the deity
# Perceiving one's enjoyments as bliss of the deity, free from attachment
# Performing one's actions only for the benefit of others (bodhichitta motivation, altruism)&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/tantra_practice.html Kalachakranet (2006), ''Tantric Practice''] (Source: January 3, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Completion stage====
{{main|Completion stage}}
In the next stage of completion, the practitioner can use either the ''path of method (thabs lam)'' or the ''path of liberation ('grol lam)''.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=19}}

At the path of method the practitioner engages in [[Kundalini yoga|Kundalini yoga practices]]. These involve the subtle energy system of the body of the [[chakra]]s and the energy channels. The &quot;wind energy&quot; is directed and dissolved into the heart chakra, where-after the [[Mahamudra]] remains{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=116}}, and the practitioner is physically and mentally transformed.

At the path of liberation the practitioner applies [[mindfulness]]{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=17}}, a preparatory practice for [[Mahamudra]] or [[Dzogchen]], to realize the inherent [[sunyata|emptiness]] of every-'thing' that exists.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=16-20}}

=== Deity yoga ===
[[Image:Hevajra.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Hevajra and Nairātmyā, surrounded by a retinue of eight ḍākinīs. Marpa transmission.]]
{{main|Iṣṭa-devatā}}
Deity yoga (Tibetan: ''lha'i rnal 'byor''; Sanskrit: ''[[Ishta-devata|Devata]]'') is the fundamental Vajrayana practice. It is a ''[[sadhana]]'' in which practitioners visualize themselves as a deity or ''[[yidam]]''. Deity Yoga brings the meditator to the experience of being one with the deity: 
{{quote|Deity Yoga employs highly refined techniques of creative imagination, visualisation, and photism in order to self-identify with the divine form and qualities of a particular deity as the union of method or skilful means and wisdom. As His Holiness the Dalai Lama says, &quot;In brief, the body of a Buddha is attained through meditating on it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2004). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs''. Serindia Publications, Inc. ISBN 1-932476-10-5.  p.142. Source: [http://books.google.com/books?id=XlqeS3WjSWIC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=death+yoga+vajrayana+tibet&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iGZAiL-ZBP&amp;sig=KFghYWnRnJHmCxwnUKpwmYoF1_Y] (accessed: January 9, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By visualizing oneself and one's environment entirely as a projection of mind, it helps the practitioner to become familiar with the mind's ability and habit of projecting conceptual layers over all experience. This experience undermines a habitual belief that views of reality and self are solid and fixed. Deity yoga enables the practitioner to release, or 'purify' him or herself from spiritual obscurations (Sanskrit: ''[[Kleshas (Hinduism)|klesha]]'') and to practice compassion and wisdom simultaneously.

Recent studies indicate that Deity yoga yields quantifiable improvements in the practitioner's ability to process visuospatial information, specifically those involved in working visuospatial memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. Kozhevnikov, O. Louchakova, Z. Josipovic, and M.A.  Motes | title=The Enhancement of Visuospatial Processing Efficiency Through Buddhist Deity Meditation | journal=Psychological Science | year=2009 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02345.x | pmid=19476594 | volume=20 | issue=5 | pages=645–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guru yoga ===
Guru yoga (or teacher practice) (Tibetan: ''bla ma'i rnal 'byor''){{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|1994|p=416}} is a tantric devotional process whereby the practitioners unite their [[mindstream]] with the mindstream of the [[guru]]. 

The guru is engaged as ''[[yidam]]'', as a ''[[nirmanakaya]]'' manifestation of a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]].  The process of guru yoga might entail visualization of an entire lineage of masters ([[refuge tree]]) as an invocation of the lineage. It usually involves visualization of the guru above or in front of the practitioner.  Guru yoga may entail a [[liturgy]] or mantra such as the ''Prayer in Seven Lines.'' (Tibetan: ''tshig bdun gsol 'debs''){{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|1994|p=442}}

The Guru or spiritual teacher is essential as a guide during tantric practice, as without their example, blessings and grace, genuine progress is held to be impossible for all but the most keen and gifted. Many tantric texts qualify the [[Triratna|Three Jewels]] of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha thus: &quot;The Guru is Buddha, the Guru is Dharma, the Guru is also Sangha&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen]], ''Offering to the Spiritual Guide'' (Tib. Lama Chopa), Tharpa Publications, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect their importance for the disciple. The guru is considered even more compassionate and more potent than the Buddha because we can have a direct relationship with the guru. The guru therefore appears with the ''[[yidam]]'' and ''[[dakini]]'' in the [[Three Roots]] refuge formulation of the three factors essential for tantric attainments.

=== Death yoga ===
{{main|Bardo}}
According to the Vajrayana tradition,&lt;ref&gt;''Luminous Emptiness.'' 2001. [[Francesca Fremantle]]. Boston: Shambala Publications. ISBN 1-57062-450-X&lt;/ref&gt; at certain times the [[Bodymind (in meditation traditions)|bodymind]]&lt;ref&gt;Arpaia, Joseph &amp; D. Lobsang Rapgay (2004).  ''Tibetan Wisdom for Modern Life''. Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass.  ISBN 81-208-1955-1.&lt;/ref&gt; is in a very subtle state which can be used by advanced practitioners to transform the [[mindstream]]. Such [[liminal]] times are known in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as [[Bardo]] states and include such transitional states as during meditation, dreaming, sex and death.

Death yoga, or &quot;bringing the three bodies into the path of death, intermediate state (''bardo'') and rebirth&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to Dakini Land'', pages 109-119, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1996) ISBN 978-0-948006-39-5&lt;/ref&gt; helps to prepare the practitioner for what they need to do at the time of death. Although it is sometimes called &quot;death yoga,&quot; it is mainly practiced during life, in meditation. It can be practiced first according to [[generation stage]], and then according to [[completion stage]]. The accumulation of meditative practice helps to prepare the practitioner for what they need to do at the time of death. 

At the time of death the mind is in a subtle state (clear light) that can open the mind to enlightenment if it is skilfully used to meditate on emptiness (''[[shunyata]]''). During completion stage meditation it is possible to manifest a similar clear light mind and to use it to meditate on emptiness. This meditation causes dualistic appearances to subside into emptiness and enables the practitioner to destroy their ignorance and the imprints of ignorance that are the obstructions to omniscience. It is said that masters like Lama [[Tsong Khapa]] used these techniques to achieve enlightenment during the death process.
Actually, there are three stages at which it is possible to do this: at the end of the death process, during the ''[[bardo]]'' (or 'in between period') and during the process of rebirth. During these stages, the mind is in a very subtle state, and an advanced practitioner can use these natural states to make significant progress on the spiritual path. The [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] is an important commentary for this kind of traditional practice.

This death yoga should not be confused with the non-Tantric meditation on impermanence and death, which is a common practice within Buddhist traditions used to overcome desirous attachment.

Another Tibetan ritual practice related to death is ''[[phowa]]'' (transference of one's consciousness), which can be done by oneself at the moment of death or by ritual specialists, ''phowa-lamas'', on behalf of the dead. For the ''Anuttarayoga Tantras'' (Tib. ''rnal-’byor bla-med-kyi-rgyud''), transferring one’s consciousness constitutes one of the two ways to separate the coarse and subtle bodies through meditation. Daniel Cozort explains that ''’pho-ba'' (''phowa'') merely separates the coarse and subtle bodies without leading to the attainment of an “illusory body” (Tib. ''sgyu-lus''). On the other hand, during the perfection type meditation, known as the “final mental isolation” (Tibetan: ''sems-dben'') because it necessitates the presence of an “actual consort” (Tib. ''las-rgya''), “the winds are totally dissolved in the indestructible drop”, and “the fundamental wind naturally rises into an illusory body”.&lt;ref&gt;''Highest Yoga Tantra: An Introduction to the Esoteric Buddhism of Tibet''.  Ithaca: Snow Lion, 1986: p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols and imagery==
The Vajrayana uses a rich variety of symbols and images.

===The Vajra===
The [[Sanskrit]] term &quot;[[vajra]]&quot; denoted the [[thunderbolt]], a legendary weapon and divine attribute that was made from an [[adamant]]ine, or indestructible, substance and which could therefore pierce and penetrate any obstacle or [[obfuscation]]. It is the weapon of choice of [[Indra]], the King of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] in [[Hinduism]]. As a secondary meaning, &quot;vajra&quot; refers to this indestructible substance, and so is sometimes translated as &quot;adamantine&quot; or &quot;diamond&quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}. So the Vajrayana is sometimes rendered in English as &quot;The Adamantine Vehicle&quot; or &quot;The Diamond Vehicle&quot;.

A vajra is also a scepter-like ritual object ({{lang-bo|རྡོ་རྗེ་}} ''dorje''), which has a sphere (and sometimes a [[gankyil]]) at its centre, and a variable number of spokes, 3, 5 or 9 at each end (depending on the [[sadhana]]), enfolding either end of the rod. The vajra is often traditionally employed in tantric rituals in combination with the [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] or [[ghanta]]; symbolically, the vajra may represent [[upaya|method]] as well as great bliss and the bell stands for [[prajna|wisdom]], specifically the [[Śūnyatā|wisdom realizing emptiness]].

===Imagery and ritual in deity yoga===
[[File:Kalachakra.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Kalachakra, [[sand mandala]].]]

Representations of the deity, such as a statues (''[[murti]]''), paintings (''[[thangka]]''), or [[mandala]], are often employed as an aid to [[Mental image|visualization]], in Deity yoga. Mandalas are sacred enclosures, [[sacred architecture]] that house and contain the uncontainable essence of a ''yidam''. In the book ''The World of Tibetan Buddhism'', the Dalai Lama describes mandalas thus: &quot;This is the celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity.&quot;

All ritual in Vajrayana practice can be seen as aiding in this process of visualization and identification. The practitioner can use various hand implements such as a ''vajra'', bell, hand-drum (''[[damaru]]'') or a ritual dagger (''[[phurba]]''), but also ritual hand gestures (''[[mudra]]s'') can be made, special chanting techniques can be used, and in elaborate offering rituals or initiations, many more ritual implements and tools are used, each with an elaborate symbolic meaning to create a special environment for practice. Vajrayana has thus become a major inspiration in traditional [[Tibetan art]].

==Vajrayana textual tradition==
The Vajrayana tradition has dedeveloped an extended body of texts:
{{quote|Though we do not know precisely at present just how many Indian tantric Buddhist texts survive today in the language in which they were written, their number is certainly over one thousand five hundred; I suspect indeed over two thousand. A large part of this body of texts has also been translated into Tibetan, and a smaller part into Chinese. Aside from these, there are perhaps another two thousand or more works that are known today only from such translations. We can be certain as well that many others are lost to us forever, in whatever form. Of the texts that survive a very small proportion has been published; an almost insignificant percentage has been edited or translated reliably.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tantric Buddhism in India (from c. 800 to c. 1200). In: Buddhismus in Geschichte und Gegenwart. Band II. Hamburg. pp.23–49. (Internal publication of Hamburg University.) pg 3 [http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/digitale_texte/Bd2-K02Isaacson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Schools of Vajrayana==
Although there is historical evidence for [[Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia]] and elsewhere (see [[Vajrayana#History of Vajrayana|History of Vajrayana]] below), today the Vajrayana exists primarily in the form of the two major sub-schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Esoteric Buddhism]] in [[Japan]] known as [[Shingon]], with a handful of minor subschools utilising lesser amounts of esoteric or tantric materials.

The distinction between traditions is not always rigid. For example, the [[tantra]] sections of the [[Kangyur|Tibetan Buddhist canon of texts]] sometimes include material not usually thought of as tantric outside the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition, such as the ''[[Heart Sutra]]''&lt;ref&gt;Conze, ''The Prajnaparamita Literature''&lt;/ref&gt; and even versions of some material found in the ''[[Pali Canon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Skilling, ''Mahasutras'', volume I, 1994, [[Pali Text Society]][http://www.palitext.com], Lancaster, page xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Skilling, ''Mahasutras'', volume I, parts I &amp; II, 1997, Pali Text Society, page 78, speaks of the tantra divisions of some editions of the [[Kangyur]] as including Sravakayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana texts}}

=== Tibetan Buddhism ===
{{main|Tibetan Buddhism}}
The Tibetan Buddhist schools, based on the lineages and textual traditions of the [[Kangyur]] and [[Tengyur]] of [[Tibet]], are found in Tibet, [[Buddhism in Bhutan|Bhutan]], northern [[Buddhism in India|India]], [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]], southwestern and northern [[Buddhism in China|China]], [[Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolia]] and various constituent [[republics]] of [[Buddhism in Russia|Russia]] that are adjacent to the area, such as [[Amur Oblast]], [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]], [[Chita Oblast]], the [[Tuva Republic]] and [[Khabarovsk Krai]]. Tibetan Buddhism is also the main religion in [[Kalmykia]].

Vajrayana Buddhism was established in Tibet in the 8th century when [[Śāntarakṣita]] was brought to [[Tibet]] from [[India]] at the instigation of the Dharma King [[Trisong Detsen]], some time before 767. He established the basis of what later came to be known as the [[Nyingma]] school. As a [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Mahasiddha]] Padmasambhava's contribution ensured that Tibetan Buddhism became part of the Vajrayana tradition.  While Vajrayana Buddhism is a part of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] in that it forms a core part of every major Tibetan Buddhist school, it is not identical with it. Buddhist scholar [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] refers to &quot;the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions of Tibetan Buddhism&quot;.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web | title = Berzin Archives  | url = http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/index.html | accessdate = 2008-06-22  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Training in the &quot;common paths&quot; of [[Sutra]] (including [[Lamrim]]) are said to be the foundation for the &quot;uncommon path&quot; of Vajrayana.&lt;ref&gt;''Tantric Grounds and Paths: How to Enter, Progress on, and Complete the Vajrayana Path'', page 1, [[Tharpa Publications]] (1994) ISBN 978-0-948006-33-3&lt;/ref&gt; The Vajrayana techniques add 'skillful means' to the general [[Mahayana]] teachings for advanced students. The 'skillful means' of the Vajrayana in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] refers to [[Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantra techniques]], [[Dzogchen]] (Tibetan; Sanskrit:''maha-ati'') and [[Mahamudra]] (Tibetan:''Chagchen'').

[[Image:Pratisara Mantra1.png|thumb|right|200px|Chinese use of the [[Siddhaṃ script]] for the Pratisara Mantra. 927 CE.]]

===Nepalese Newar Buddhism===
{{main|Newar Buddhism}}
Newar Buddhism is practiced by Newars in Nepal. This is the only form of Vajrayana Buddhism in which the scriptures are written in Sanskrit. Its priests do not follow celibacy and are called [[Vajracharya]]s.

=== Chinese Esoteric Buddhism ===
Esoteric traditions in China are similar in teachings to the Japanese Shingon school, though the number of practitioners was greatly reduced, due in part of the persecution of Buddhists under [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]], nearly wiping out most of the Chinese Esoteric Buddhist lineage. In China and countries with large Chinese populations such as [[Taiwan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], Chinese Esoteric Buddhism is commonly referred as Tángmì (唐密) &quot;[[Tang Dynasty]] Secret Buddhism,&quot; or Hànchuánmìzōng (漢傳密宗) &quot;Secret Buddhism of the Han Transmission&quot; (Hànmì 漢密 for short), or Dōngmì (東密) &quot;Eastern Secret Buddhism.&quot; In a more general sense, the Chinese term Mìzōng (密宗) &quot;The Secret Way&quot;, is the most popular term used when referring to any form of Esoteric Buddhism. These traditions more or less share the same doctrines as the Shingon school, with many of its students themselves traveling to Japan to be given transmission at Mount Koya.

According to Master [[Hsuan Hua]], the most popular example of esoteric teachings still practiced in many Zen monasteries of East Asia, is the ''{{IAST|[[Shurangama Sutra|Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]}}'' and its dhāraṇī ({{IAST|Sitātapatroṣṇīṣa Dhāraṇī}}), along with the [[Great Compassion Mantra|Great Compassion Dharani]] ({{IAST|Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāranī}}), with its 42 Hands and Eyes Mantras.{{sfn|Hua|2003|p=68-71}}

[[Image:Altar-shingon.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Shingon shrine with Mahavairocana at the center of the shrine, and the [[Womb Realm]] and [[Diamond Realm]] mandalas.]]

===Japan===
====Shingon Buddhism====
{{main|Shingon Buddhism}}
The Shingon school is found in [[Japan]] and includes practices, known in Japan as ''[[Mikkyō]]'', which are similar in concept to those in Vajrayana Buddhism. The lineage for Shingon Buddhism differs from that of Tibetan Vajrayana, having emerged from [[India]] during the 9th-11th centuries in the [[Pala Dynasty]] and [[Central Asia]] (via [[China]]) and is based on earlier versions of the Indian texts than the Tibetan lineage. Shingon shares material with [[Tibetan Buddhism]]–-such as the esoteric sutras (called [[Tantras]] in Tibetan Buddhism) and [[mandala]]s – but the actual practices are not related.  The primary texts of Shingon Buddhism are the ''[[Mahavairocana Sutra]]'' and ''[[Vajrasekhara Sutra]]''.  The founder of Shingon Buddhism was [[Kukai]], a Japanese monk who studied in China in the 9th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and brought back Vajrayana scriptures, techniques and mandalas then popular in China. The school mostly died out or was merged into other schools in China towards the end of the [[Tang Dynasty]] but flourished in Japan. Shingon is one of the few remaining branches of Buddhism in the world that continues to use the ''[[siddham]]'' script of the [[Sanskrit]] language.

====Tendai Buddhism====
{{Main|Tendai}}
Although the Tendai school in China and Japan does employ some esoteric practices, these rituals came to be considered of equal importance with the exoteric teachings of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''.  By chanting [[mantras]], maintaining [[mudras]], or practicing certain forms of meditation, [[Tendai]] maintains that one is able to understand sense experiences as taught by the Buddha, have faith that one is innately an enlightened being, and that one can attain enlightenment within the current lifetime.

[[Image:立石光正DSCF0451.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Shugendō practitioners in the mountains of [[Kumano, Mie]].]]

====Shugendō====
{{Main|Shugendō}}
Shugendō was founded in 7th century Japan by the ascetic [[En no Gyōja]], based on the ''Queen's Peacocks Sutra''. With its origins in the solitary ''hijiri'' back in the 7th century, Shugendō evolved as a sort of amalgamation between Esoteric Buddhism, Shinto and several other religious influences including [[Taoism]]. Buddhism and Shinto were amalgamated in the ''shinbutsu shūgō'', and Kūkai's syncretic view held wide sway up until the end of the [[Edo period]], coexisting with Shinto elements within Shugendō&lt;ref&gt;Miyake, Hitoshi. ''Shugendo in History''. pp45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1613 during the [[Edo period]], the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] issued a regulation obliging Shugendō temples to belong to either Shingon or Tendai temples. During the [[Meiji Restoration]], when Shinto was declared an independent state religion separate from Buddhism, Shugendō was banned as a superstition not fit for a new, enlightened Japan. Some Shugendō temples converted themselves into various officially approved Shintō denominations. In modern times, Shugendō is practiced mainly by Tendai and Shingon sects, retaining an influence on modern [[Japanese religion]] and [[Culture of Japan|culture]].

===Literary characteristics===
Vajrayana texts exhibit a wide range of literary characteristics—usually a mix of verse and prose, almost always in a Sanskrit that &quot;transgresses frequently against classical norms of grammar and usage,&quot; although also occasionally in various Middle Indic dialects or elegant classical Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dunhuang manuscripts===
The [[Dunhuang]] also contains Tibetan Tantric manuscripts. Dalton and Schaik (2007, revised) provide an excellent online catalogue listing 350 Tibetan Tantric Manuscripts] from [[Dunhuang]] in the Stein Collection of the [[British Library]] which is currently fully accessible online in discrete digitized manuscripts.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_cat.a4d?shortref=Dalton_vanSchaik_2005 Catalogue of the Tibetan Tantric Manuscripts from Dunhuang in the Stein Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; With the Wylie transcription of the manuscripts they are to be made discoverable online in future.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Jacob &amp; [[Sam van Schaik|van Schaik, Sam]] (2007). Catalogue of the Tibetan Tantric Manuscripts from Dunhuang in the Stein Collection [Online]. Second electronic edition. International Dunhuang Project. Source: [http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_cat.a4d?shortref=Dalton_vanSchaik_2005] (accessed: Tuesday February 2, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The 350 texts is just a small number compared to the vast cache of the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]].

==Academic study difficulties==
Serious Vajrayana academic study in the Western world is in early stages due to the following obstacles:{{sfn|Akira|1993|p=9}}
# Although a large number of Tantric scriptures are extant, they have not been formally ordered or systematized.
# Because [[Hinduism]] influenced Vajrayana{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{fact|date=October 2012}}, further research into Hinduism is necessary.
# Ritual as well as doctrine need to be investigated.

Buddhist tantric practice are categorized as secret practice; this is to avoid misinformed people from harmfully misusing the practices. A method to keep this secrecy is that tantric initiation is required from a Master before any instructions can be received about the actual practice. During the initiation procedure in the highest class of tantra (such as the Kalachakra), students must take the tantric vows which commit them to such secrecy.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://kalachakranet.org/kalachakra_tantra_taking_initiation.html Kalachakra Tantra taking initiation (accessed June 26, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Explaining general tantra theory in a scholarly manner, not sufficient for practice, is likewise not a root downfall. Nevertheless, it weakens the effectiveness of our tantric practice.&quot; &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/practice_material/vows/general_tantra/common_root_tantric_pledges.html Dr Alex Berzin on Tantric Vows accessed June 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology ===
The terminology associated with Vajrayana Buddhism can be confusing. Most of the terms originated in the [[Sanskrit]] language of tantric [[Indian Buddhism]] and may have passed through other cultures, notably those of Japan and Tibet, before translation for the modern reader. Further complications arise as seemingly equivalent terms can have subtle variations in use and meaning according to context, the time and place of use. A third problem is that the Vajrayana texts employ the tantric tradition of [[the twilight language]], a means of instruction that is deliberately coded. These obscure teaching methods relying on [[religious symbolism|symbolism]] as well as [[synonym]], [[metaphor]] and [[word association]] add to the difficulties faced by those attempting to understand Vajrayana Buddhism:
{{quote|In the Vajrayana tradition, now preserved mainly in Tibetan lineages, it has long been recognized that certain important teachings are expressed in a form of secret symbolic language known as {{IAST|saṃdhyā-bhāṣā}}, 'Twilight Language'. ''[[Mudrā]]s'' and ''[[mantra]]s'', {{IAST|[[maṇḍala]]s}} and ''[[cakra]]s'', those mysterious devices and diagrams that were so much in vogue in the pseudo-Buddhist [[hippie]] culture of the 1960s, were all examples of Twilight Language [...] &lt;ref&gt;Bucknell, Roderick &amp; Stuart-Fox, Martin (1986). ''The Twilight Language: Explorations in Buddhist Meditation and Symbolism''. Curzon Press: London. ISBN 0-312-82540-4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term Tantric Buddhism was not one originally used by those who practiced it. As scholar Isabelle Onians explains:

{{quote|&quot;Tantric Buddhism&quot; [...] is not the transcription of a native term, but a rather modern coinage, if not totally occidental. For the equivalent Sanskrit ''tāntrika'' is found, but not in Buddhist texts. ''Tāntrika'' is a term denoting someone who follows the teachings of scriptures known as Tantras, but only in Saivism, not Buddhism [...] Tantric Buddhism is a name for a phenomenon which calls itself, in Sanskrit, Mantranaya, Vajrayāna, Mantrayāna or Mantramahāyāna (and apparently never Tantrayāna). Its practitioners are known as ''mantrins'', ''yogis'', or ''sādhakas''. Thus, our use of the anglicised adjective “Tantric” for the Buddhist religion taught in Tantras is not native to the tradition, but is a borrowed term which serves its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Onians, &quot;Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm,&quot; D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001 pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}
