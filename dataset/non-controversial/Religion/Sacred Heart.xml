The '''Sacred Heart''' (also known as '''Most Sacred Heart of Jesus''') is one of the most widely practiced and well-known [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotions]], taking [[Jesus]]' physical heart as the representation of his divine love for humanity.

This devotion is predominantly used in the [[Catholic Church]] and among some [[high church|high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Lutherans]]. The devotion especially emphasizes the unmitigated love, compassion, and long-suffering of the heart of Christ towards humanity. The origin of this devotion in its modern form is derived from a French Roman Catholic [[nun]], [[Marguerite Marie Alacoque]], who said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a [[Vision (religion)|mystical experience]]. Predecessors to the modern devotion arose unmistakably in the [[Middle Ages]] in various facets of [[Christian mysticism|Catholic mysticism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mystics&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07163a.htm | title = Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus II. Historical Ideas on the Development of the Devotion, para (3-4) | work = Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = New Advent | accessdate = 11 July 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Catholic devotions|Roman Catholic tradition]], the Sacred Heart has been closely associated with [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]. In his [[encyclical]] ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]]'', [[Pope Pius XI]] stated: &quot;''the spirit of expiation or reparation has always had the first and foremost place in the worship given to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican.va&quot;&gt;[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]] Encyclical of [[Pope Pius XI]] http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer)|Golden Arrow Prayer]]'' directly refers to the Sacred Heart.

Devotion to the Sacred Heart is sometimes seen in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], where it remains a point of controversy and is seen as an example of [[Liturgical Latinisation]].

The Sacred Heart is often depicted in [[Christian art]] as a flaming heart shining with divine light, pierced by the lance-wound, encircled by the [[crown of thorns]], surmounted by a cross and bleeding. Sometimes the image shown shining within the bosom of Christ with his wounded hands pointing at the heart. The wounds and crown of thorns allude to the manner of [[Passion (Christianity)|Jesus' death]], while the fire represents the transformative power of divine love.

The [[Feast of the Sacred Heart]] has been in the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar since 1856, and is celebrated 19 days after [[Pentecost]]. As Pentecost is always celebrated on Sunday, the Feast of the Sacred Heart always falls on a Friday.

==History of Devotion==
===Early devotion===
[[File:Sacred-heart-of-jesus-ibarraran.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Sacred Heart of Jesus by José María Ibarrarán y Ponce, 1896]]
From the time of [[John the Evangelist]] and [[Paul of Tarsus]] there has always been in the Church something like devotion to the love of God, but there is nothing to indicate that, during the first ten centuries of Christianity, any worship was rendered to the wounded Heart of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;histdec&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07163a.htm | title = Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus II. Historical Ideas on the Development of the Devotion, para (1) | work = Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = New Advent | accessdate = 11 July 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the eleventh and twelfth centuries that the first indications of devotion to the Sacred Heart are found. It was in the fervent atmosphere of the [[Benedictine]] or [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[monastery|monasteries]], in the world of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselmian]] or [[Bernard of Cluny|Bernardine]] thought, that the devotion arose, although it is impossible to say positively what were its first texts or who were its first devotees. It was already well known to [[Gertrude the Great|St. Gertrude]], [[St. Mechtilde]], and the author of the ''Vitis mystica'' (previously ascribed to [[Bernard of Cluny|St. Bernard]], now attributed to [[Bonaventure|St. Bonaventure]]).

From the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, the devotion was propagated but it did not seem to have developed in itself. It was everywhere practised by individuals and by different religious congregations, such as the [[Franciscan]]s, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s, [[Carthusian]]s, etc. It was, nevertheless, a private, individual devotion of the mystical order. Nothing of a general movement had been inaugurated, except for similarities found in the devotion to the [[Holy Wounds|Five Wounds]] by the Franciscans, in which the wound in Jesus's heart figured most prominently.

In the sixteenth century, the devotion passed from the domain of [[Christian mysticism|mysticism]] into that of Christian [[asceticism]]. It was established as a devotion with prayers already formulated and special exercises, found in the writings of Lanspergius (d. 1539) of the [[Carthusian]]s of Cologne, the Louis of [[Blois]] (Blosius; 1566), a [[Benedictine]] and [[Abbot]] of [[Liessies]] in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[John of Avila]] (d. 1569) and [[Francis de Sales|St. Francis de Sales]], the latter belonging to the seventeenth century.

The historical record from that time shows an early bringing to light of the devotion. Ascetic writers spoke of it, especially those of the [[Society of Jesus]]. The image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was everywhere in evidence, largely due to the Franciscan devotion to the [[Five Wounds]] and to the habit formed by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] of placing the image on their title-page of their books and the walls of their churches.

Nevertheless, the devotion remained an individual, or at least a private, devotion. [[Jean Eudes]] (1602–1680) made it public, gave it an Office, and established a feast for it. Père Eudes was the apostle of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Heart of Mary]]; but in his devotion to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]] there was a share for the Heart of Jesus. Little by little, the devotion to the Sacred Heart became a separate one, and on August 31, 1670, the first feast of the Sacred Heart was celebrated in the Grand Seminary of [[Rennes]]. [[Coutances]] followed suit on October 20, a day with which the [[Eudists|Eudist]] feast was from then on to be connected. The feast soon spread to other dioceses, and the devotion was likewise adopted in various religious communities. It gradually came into contact with the devotion begun at [[Paray-le-Monial|Paray]], and resulting in a fusion of the two.

===Visions of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque===
[[File:San Michele Santa Margherita Maria Alacoque2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Painting representing the famous apparition of the Sacred Heart of Jesus to [[Marguerite Marie Alacoque|Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque]].]]
The most significant source for the devotion to the Sacred Heart in the form it is known today was [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitandine]] [[Saint]] [[Marguerite Marie Alacoque|Margaret Mary Alacoque]]  (1647–1690), who claimed to have received [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus Christ]]. There is nothing to indicate that she had known the devotion prior to the revelations, or at least that she had paid any attention to it. The revelations were numerous, and the following apparitions are especially remarkable:
* On December 27, probably 1673, the feast of [[John the Evangelist|St. John]], Margaret Mary reported that Jesus permitted her, as he had formerly allowed [[Gertrude the Great|St. Gertrude]], to rest her head upon his heart, and then disclosed to her the wonders of his love, telling her that he desired to make them known to all mankind and to diffuse the treasures of his goodness, and that he had chosen her for this work.
* In probably June or July, 1674, Margaret Mary claimed that Jesus requested to be honored under the figure of his heart, also claiming that, when he appeared radiant with love, he asked for a devotion of expiatory love: frequent reception of [[Eucharist|Communion]], especially Communion on the First Friday of the month, and the observance of the [[Holy hour|Holy Hour]].
* During the [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], 1675, probably on June 16, the vision known as the &quot;great apparition&quot; reportedly took place, where Jesus said, &quot;Behold the Heart that has so loved men ... instead of gratitude I receive from the greater part (of mankind) only ingratitude ...&quot;, and asked Margaret Mary for a feast of [[Reparation (Catholic Church)|reparation]] of the Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi, bidding her consult her confessor Father [[Claude de la Colombière]], then superior of the small Jesuit house at Paray. Solemn homage was asked on the part of the king, and the mission of propagating the new devotion was especially confided to the religious of the Visitation and to the priests of the [[Society of Jesus]].

A few days after the &quot;great apparition&quot;, Margaret Mary reported everything she saw to Father de la Colombière, and he, acknowledging the vision as an action of the Spirit of God, consecrated himself to the Sacred Heart and directed her to write an account of the apparition. He also made use of every available opportunity to circulate this account, discreetly, through France and England. Upon his death on February 15, 1682, there was found in his journal of spiritual retreats a copy in his own handwriting of the account that he had requested of Margaret Mary, together with a few reflections on the usefulness of the devotion. This journal, including the account and an &quot;offering&quot; to the Sacred Heart, in which the devotion was well explained, was published at Lyons in 1684. The little book was widely read, especially at Paray. Margaret Mary reported feeling &quot;dreadful confusion&quot; over the book's contents, but resolved to make the best of it, approving of the book for the spreading of her cherished devotion. Outside of the Visitandines, priests, religious, and laymen espoused the devotion, particularly the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], Margaret Mary's two brothers, and some Jesuits. The Jesuit Father Croiset wrote a book called [[s:Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus|''The Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus'']], a book which Jesus is said to have told Margaret to tell Fr. Croiset to write, and Fr. [[Joseph de Gallifet]], also a Jesuit, promoted the devotion.

===Papal Approvals===
[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from [[Good Shepherd Sisters|Sisters of the Good Shepherd Congregation]] who requested, in the name of Christ Himself, to [[Pope Leo XIII]] that he consecrate the entire World to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;CHASLE, Louis; ''Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863-1899''. Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The death of Margaret Mary Alacoque on October 17, 1690, did not dampen the zeal of those interested; on the contrary, a short account of her life published by Father Croiset in 1691, as an appendix to his book &quot;De la Dévotion au Sacré Cœur&quot;, served only to increase it. In spite of all sorts of obstacles, and of the slowness of the [[Holy See]], which in 1693 imparted [[indulgences]] to the Confraternities of the Sacred Heart and, in 1697, granted the feast to the Visitandines with the Mass of the Five Wounds, but refused a feast common to all, with special Mass and Office. The devotion spread, particularly in religious communities. The [[Great Plague of Marseille|Marseilles plague]], 1720, furnished perhaps the first occasion for a solemn consecration and public worship outside of religious communities. Other cities of the South followed the example of Marseilles, and thus the devotion became a popular one. In 1726 it was deemed advisable once more to importune Rome for a feast with a Mass and Office of its own, but, in 1729, Rome again refused. However, in 1765, it finally yielded and that same year, at the request of the queen, the feast was received quasi-officially by the [[Episcopal polity|episcopate]] of France. On all sides it was asked for and obtained, and finally, in 1856, at the urgent entreaties of the French bishops, [[Pope Pius IX]] extended the feast to the Roman Catholic Church under the rite of double major. In 1889 it was raised by the Roman Catholic Church to the double rite of first class.

After the letters of Mother [[Mary of the Divine Heart]] (1863–1899) requesting, in the name of Christ Himself, to [[Pope Leo XIII]] consecrate the entire World to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Father commissions a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. This investigation was positive. And so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum Sacrum]]'' (on May 25, 1899) this same pope decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on June 11, 1899. In this encyclical letter the Pope attached Later Pope Leo XIII encouraged the entire Roman Catholic episcopate to promote the devotion of the Nine First Fridays and he established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart. Leo XIII also composed the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]] and included it in [[Annum Sacrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' ISBN 0-87973-910-X page 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius X]] decreed that the consecration of the human race, performed by Pope Leo XIII be renewed each year. [[Pope Pius XI]] in his encyclical letter ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]]'' (on May 8, 1928) affirmed the Church's position with respect to Saint Margaret Mary's [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus Christ]] by stating that Jesus had &quot;''manifested Himself''&quot; to Saint Margaret and had &quot;''promised her that all those who rendered this honor to His Heart would be endowed with an abundance of heavenly graces''.&quot; The encyclical refers to the conversation between Jesus and Saint Margaret several times&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican.va&quot;/&gt; and reaffirmed the importance of consecration and reparation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

Finally, [[Venerable]] [[Pope Pius XII]], on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Pope Pius IX's institution of the Feast, instructed the entire Roman Catholic Church at length on the devotion to the Sacred Heart in his encyclical letter ''[[Haurietis aquas]]'' (on May 15, 1956). On May 15, 2006, also [[Pope Benedict XVI]] sent a letter to Father [[Peter Hans Kolvenbach]], the [[Superior General]] of the [[Society of Jesus]], on the 50th Anniversary of the encyclical ''[[Haurietis Aquas]]'', about the Sacred Heart, by [[Pope Pius XII]]. In his letter to Father Kolvenbach, Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed the importance of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

===Worship and devotion===
[[File:Fronhofen Pfarrkirche Fenster Herz Jesu.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Stained glass]] depiction of Jesus and His Most Sacred Heart, in Germany.]]
The Roman Catholic acts of [[consecration]], [[Reparation (Catholic Church)|reparation]] and [[worship|devotion]] were introduced when the feast of the Sacred Heart was declared. In his [[Papal Bull]] ''Auctorem Fidei'', [[Pope]] [[Pius VI]] praised devotion to the Sacred Heart. Finally, by order of [[Leo XIII]], in his [[encyclical]] ''Annum Sacrum'' (May 25, 1899), as well as on June 11, he consecrated every human to the Sacred Heart. The idea of this act, which Leo XIII called &quot;the great act&quot; of his pontificate, had been proposed to him by a religious woman of the Good Shepherd from [[Porto|Oporto]] (Portugal) who said that she had supernaturally received it from Jesus. Since ''c.'' 1850, groups, congregations, and States have consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart. In 1873, by petition of president [[Gabriel García Moreno]], [[Ecuador]] was the first country in the world to be consecrated to the Sacred Heart, fulfilling God's petition to Saint Margaret Mary over two hundred years later.

[[Peter Coudrin]] of France founded the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]] on December 24, 1800. A [[religious order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the order is best known for its [[missionary]] work in [[Hawaii]].

Mother [[Clelia Merloni]] from [[Forlì]] (Italy) founded the [[Apostles of the Sacred Heart of Jesus|Congregation of the Apostles of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]] in [[Viareggio]], Italy, May 30, 1894.

Worship of the Sacred Heart mainly consists of several [[hymns]], the Salutation of the Sacred Heart, and the [[Litany]] of the Sacred Heart. It is common in Roman Catholic services and occasionally is to be found in [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] services.

The [[Feast of the Sacred Heart]] is a solemnity in the Roman Catholic [[liturgical calendar]], and is celebrated 19 days after [[Pentecost]]. As Pentecost is always celebrated on Sunday, the Feast of the Sacred Heart always falls on a Friday.

The [[Enthronement]] of the Sacred Heart is a Roman Catholic ceremony in which a priest or head of a household consecrates the members of the household to the Sacred Heart. A blessed [[Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart imagery|image]] of the Sacred Heart, either a statue or a picture, is then &quot;enthroned&quot; in the home to serve as a constant reminder to those who dwell in the house of their consecration to the Sacred Heart. The practice of the Enthronement is based upon [[Pius XII|Pope Pius XII]]'s declaration that devotion to the Sacred of Jesus is &quot;the foundation on which to build the kingdom of God in the hearts of individuals, families, and nations...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =Pope Pius XII | url =http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_15051956_haurietis-aquas_en.html | title =Haurietis Aquas | publisher =Vatican Archives| accessdate =November 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliance with the Immaculate Heart==

{{Main|Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary}}
The [[Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary]] is based on the historical, theological and spiritual links in [[Catholic devotions]] to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mary's Immaculate Heart'' by John F. Murphy 2007 ISBN 1-4067-3409-8 pages 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Heart of the Redeemer'' by Timothy Terrance O'Donnell, 1992 ISBN 0-89870-396-4 page 272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Calkins, ''The Theology of the Alliance of the Two Hearts'', [[Missio Immaculatae]] (English Edition) Year III, N° 4 (May to December 2007). http://www.piercedhearts.org/hearts_jesus_mary/theology_alliance_hearts_calkins.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The joint devotion to the hearts was first formalized in the 17th century by [[Saint Jean Eudes]] who organized the scriptural, theological and liturgical sources relating to the devotions and obtained the approbation of the Church, prior to the visions of Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Catholic worship: Trent to today'' by James F. White 2003 ISBN 0-8146-6194-7 page 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''From Trent to Vatican II: historical and theological investigations by Raymond F. Bulman, Frederick J. Parrella 2006 ISBN 0-19-517807-6 page 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Praying with the saints'' by Woodeene Koenig-Bricker 2001 ISBN 0-8294-1755-9 page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries the devotions grew, both jointly and individually through the efforts of figures such as Saint [[Louis de Montfort]] who promoted [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Catholic Mariology]] and Saint [[Catherine Labouré]]'s [[Miraculous Medal]] depicting the Heart of Jesus thorn-crowned and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword.&lt;ref&gt;''In Prayer With Mary the Mother of Jesus'' by Jean Lafrance 1988 ISBN 2-89039-183-3 page 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Companion to the Calendar: A Guide to the Saints and Mysteries'' by Mary Ellen Hynes 2007 ISBN 1-56854-011-6 page 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Butler's lives of the saints'', Volume 12 by Alban Butler, Kathleen Jones, 2000 ISBN 0-86012-261-1 page 245&lt;/ref&gt; The devotions, and the associated prayers, continued into the 20th century, e.g. in the [[Immaculata prayer]] of Saint [[Maximillian Kolbe]] and in the reported messages of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] which stated that the Heart of Jesus wishes to be honored together with the Heart of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;''Youngest Prophet'' by Christopher Rengers 1998 ISBN 0-85342-815-8 page 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The children of Fatima: Blessed Francisco &amp; Blessed Jacinta Marto'' by Leo Madigan 2003 OSV Press ISBN 1-931709-57-2 page 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Popes supported the individual and joint devotions to the hearts through the centuries. In the 1956 encyclical [[Haurietis Aquas]], Pope [[Pius XII]] encouraged the joint devotion to the hearts. In the 1979 encyclical [[Redemptor Hominis]] Pope [[John Paul II]] explained the theme of unity of Mary's Immaculate Heart with the Sacred Heart.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stravinskas, 2002, Catholic Dictionary, OSV Press ISBN 978-0-87973-390-2 page 485&lt;/ref&gt; In his Angelus address on September 15, 1985 Pope [[John Paul II]] coined the term ''The Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary'', and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at [[Fátima, Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1986/september/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19860922_simposio-maria-gesu_en.html Pope John Paul II 1986 Speech at the Vatican Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Calkins, ''The Alliance of the Two Hearts and Consecration'', [[Miles Immaculatae]] XXXI (July/December 1995) 389-407. http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/calkins/2hearts&amp;consec.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the International Theological Symposium on the Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary'', September 1986, Fátima, Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/angelus/1985/documents/hf_jp-ii_ang_19850915_it.html Vatican website: Pope [[John Paul II]] Angelus address of September 15, 1985 (Spanish and Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institution Names==
:''For a list of institutions named Sacred Heart, see [[Sacred Heart (disambiguation)]]''

''Sacred Heart'' is a widely used name for many Roman Catholic institutions, including schools, colleges, and hospitals in many countries around the world. It is also the name of many Roman Catholic parishes, [[religious order]]s, and stores selling Roman Catholic goods.

==Sacred Heart imagery==
[[File:Miraculous medal.jpg|thumb|225px|The Sacred Heart crowned with thorns, appearing on the [[Miraculous Medal]].]]
The Sacred Heart has also been involved in (and been depicted) in saintly [[Marian apparition|apparitions]] such as those to Saint [[Catherine Labouré]] in 1830 and appears on the [[Miraculous Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10115a.htm Catholic encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Miraculous Medal]], the Sacred Heart is crowned with thorns. The [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] also appears on the medal, next to the Sacred Heart, but is pierced by a sword, rather than being crowned with thorns. The M on the medal signifies the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin]] at the foot of the Cross when Jesus was being crucified.

Religious imagery depicting the Sacred Heart is frequently featured in Roman Catholic, and sometimes Anglican and Lutheran homes. Sometimes images display beneath them a list of family members, indicating that the entire family is entrusted to the protection of Jesus in the Sacred Heart, from whom blessings on the home and the family members are sought. The prayer ''&quot;O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all my trust in Thee&quot;'' is often used. One particular image has been used as part of a set, along with an image of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. In that image, Mary too was shown pointing to her ''[[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]]'', expressing her love for the human race and for her Son, Jesus Christ. The mirror images reflect an eternal binding of the two hearts.

The [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]] are worn by [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13508b.htm Catholic encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003, ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' ISBN 0-87973-910-X page 517&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Eastern Catholicism===
Devotion to the Sacred Heart may be found in some [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but is a contentious issue. Those who favour purity of rite are opposed to the devotion, while those who are in favour of the devotion cite it as a point of commonality with their [[Latin Catholic]] brethren.

Jesus Christ, in his appearances to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, promised these blessings to those who practice devotion to his Sacred Heart. This tabular form of promises was not made by Saint Margaret Mary or her contemporaries. It first appeared at 1863.
In 1882, an American businessman spread the tabular form of the promises profusely throughout the world, the twelve promises appearing in 238 languages. In 1890, Cardinal Adolph Perraud deplored this circulation of the promises in the tabular form which were different from the words and even from the meaning of the expressions used by St. Margaret Mary, and wanted the promises to be published in the full, authentic texts as found in the writings of St. Margaret Mary.&lt;ref&gt;The Fr. Paul Wenisch. ''Promises of Our Lord to Saint Margaret'' (1920) pg. 3 http://search.msn.com/books#q=devotion%20sacred%20heart%20croiset&amp;filter=all&amp;page=1&amp;t=WAHoaQiCLurFchPo5Nkzgg&amp;sq=devotion%20sacred%20heart%20croiset&lt;/ref&gt;

# I will give them all the graces necessary for their state of life.
# I will give peace in their families.
# I will console them in all their troubles.
# I will be their refuge in life and especially in death.
# I will abundantly bless all their undertakings.
# Sinners shall find in my Heart the source and infinite ocean of mercy.
# Tepid souls shall become fervent.
# Fervent souls shall rise speedily to great perfection.
# I will bless those places wherein the image of My Sacred Heart shall be exposed and venerated.
# I will give to priests the power to touch the most hardened hearts.
# Persons who propagate this devotion shall have their names eternally written in my Heart.
# In the excess of the mercy of my Heart, I promise you that my all powerful love will grant to all those who will receive Communion on the First Fridays, for nine consecutive months, the grace of final repentance: they will not die in my displeasure, nor without receiving the sacraments; and my Heart will be their secure refuge in that last hour.

The last promise has given rise to the pious Roman Catholic practice of making an effort to attend Mass and receive Communion on the first Friday of each month.

Great efficacy of converting people has been attached to the use of the image of the Sacred Heart.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Even at the hour of death, incredulous, indifferent,
hardened souls have been converted by simply
showing them a picture of the Sacred Heart, which
sufficed to restore these sinners to the life of hope
and love, in a word, to touch the most hardened.
It would, indeed, be a great misfortune to any
apostolic man to neglect so powerful a means of
conversion, and in proof of this I will mention a
single fact which will need no comment. A religious
of the Company of Jesus had been requested
by the Blessed Margaret Mary to make a careful
engraving of the Sacred Heart. Being often hindered
by other occupations, there was much delay
in preparing this plate. ' This good father,'
writes the saint, 'is so much occupied by Mon-
signor d'Autun in the conversion of heretics, that
he has neither time nor leisure to give to the work
so ardently desired by the Heart of our Divine
Master. You cannot imagine, my much-loved
mother, how greatly this delay afflicts and pains
me. I must avow confidently to you my belief
that it is the cause of his converting so few infidels
in this town. I seem constantly to hear these
words : ' That if this good father had acquitted
himself at once of his promise to the Sacred Heart,
Jesus would have changed and converted the
hearts of these infidels, on account of the joy He
would have felt at seeing Himself honoured in the
picture He so much wishes for. As, however, he
prefers other work, even though to the glory of
God, to that of giving Him this satisfaction, He
will harden the hearts of these infidels, and the
labours of this mission will not be crowned with
much fruit.' &lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=9dwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq&amp;ei=8lnxR_K1C83KiwGEt6jhBw#PPA157,M1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Scapular of the Sacred Heart==
The devotions to the Sacred Heart of Jesus also involve the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]]. It is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[devotional scapular]] that can be traced back to Saint [[Margaret Marie Alacoque]] who herself made and distributed ''badges'' similar to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13508b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 [[Pope Pius IX]] granted an indulgence for the badge and the actual scapular was approved by the Congregation of Rites in 1900. It bears the representation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on one side, and that of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] under the title of Mother of Mercy on the other side.
