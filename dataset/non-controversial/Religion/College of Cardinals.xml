The '''College of Cardinals''' is the body of all [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P19.HTM 1983 CIC, Bk. II, Pt. II, Sec. I, Chap. III ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A function of the college is to advise the [[pope]] about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary [[consistory]].&lt;ref&gt;CIC 1983, can. 349&lt;/ref&gt; It also convenes on the death or resignation of a [[pope]] as a [[papal conclave]] to elect a successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;universi&quot;&gt;John Paul II, Ap. Const. ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' in ''AAS'' 88 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The college has no ruling power except during the ''[[sede vacante]]'' (papal vacancy) period, and even then its powers are extremely limited by the terms of the current law, which is laid down in the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' and the [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]].

Historically, cardinals were the [[clergy]] of the city of [[Rome]], serving the [[Bishop of Rome]] as the [[Pope]], who had clerical duties in [[parish]]es of the city. The College has its origins in the events surrounding the crowning of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] as [[King of Germany]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the age of six, after the unexpected death of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] in 1056. Up until this point secular authorities had significant influence over who was to be appointed Pope, and the Holy Roman Emperor in particular had the special ability to appoint him. This was significant as the aims and views of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Church did not always coincide. Members of what was to become known as the [[Gregorian Reform]] took advantage of the new King and his lack of power, and in 1059 declared that the election of the Pope was an affair only for the Church. This was part of a larger power struggle, named the [[Investiture Controversy]], as the Church attempted to gain more control over their clergy, and in doing so gain more influence in the lands and governments they were appointed to. Theological implications aside, its creation represented a significant shift in the balance of power in the Early Medieval world. From the beginning of the 12th century, the College of Cardinals started to meet as a college, when the cardinal bishops, cardinal priests, and cardinal deacons ceased acting as separate groups.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, J.F. 1987. &quot;The Sacred College of Cardinals: Size and Geographical Composition (1099-1986).&quot; ''Archivum historiae Pontificiae'', '''25''': 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] and the Sub-Dean are the [[president]] and [[vice-president]] of the college. Both are elected by and from the cardinals holding [[suburbicarian diocese]]s, but the election requires Papal confirmation. Except for presiding, the dean has no power of governance over the cardinals, instead acting as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (first among equals).

The [[Cardinal Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the prefects of the [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Congregations]] of the [[Roman Curia]], the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], the [[Vicar General of Rome]], and the [[Patriarch of Venice|Patriarchs of Venice]] and [[Patriarch of Lisbon|Lisbon]], are usually Cardinals, with few, generally temporary, exceptions. The [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]] requires that appointees to the state's [[legislative body]], the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], be cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2522/FundamentalLaw1.pdf | title=Fundamental Law of Vatican City State | author=[[Pope John Paul II]] | date=2000-11-26 | accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choosing the Pope ==
{{Politics of the Holy See}}

Under the terms of [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[motu proprio]] ''Ingravescentem Aetatem'', cardinals who had reached the age of 80 before the conclave opened had no vote in papal elections. The current rules for the election of the Roman Pontiff, those in [[Pope John Paul II]]'s ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' of 22 February 1996, state that cardinals who have reached the age of 80 before the day the [[episcopal see|see]] becomes vacant do not have a vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;universi&quot; /&gt;

Although the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] qualifications required of candidates for episcopacy, indicated in [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1D.HTM canon 378] of the Code of Canon Law, leave a broad field open to the cardinals, they have in fact for over six centuries consistently elected one of their own number to be Bishop of Rome. The last time they chose someone who was not a cardinal was at the 1378 election of [[Pope Urban VI]]. However, the conclave rules specify the procedures to be followed, should someone residing outside Vatican City or not yet a bishop be elected.&lt;ref&gt;''Universi Dominici gregis'', 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members of the College of Cardinals ==
The following is the list of all living Cardinals as of 25 September 2012. Cardinals are shown in order of precedence, based on seniority by date of appointment. [[Paulo Evaristo Arns]] is the most senior member of the College by length of service (the Protopriest); he is the last surviving from the 1973 consistory. [[Angelo Sodano]], however, has the highest precedence as a Cardinal Bishop as Dean of the College of Cardinals.

Cardinals who have reached the age of 80 are indicated with an asterisk (*). [[Renato Martino]] will be the next Cardinal to lose his right to participate in the conclave on 23 November 2012. The oldest living Cardinal is currently [[Ersilio Tonini]]. There are now a total of 205 Cardinals, of whom 115 are aged under 80. Of the voting-age cardinals, 54 were appointed by Pope [[John Paul II]], and 61 by Pope [[Benedict XVI]].

All but thirteen of the Cardinals alive at the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] were appointed by him. Three of those thirteen were under 80 years old as of the day of John Paul II's death. One of those three, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]], was elected Pope in the resulting conclave and took the name [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], another one ([[Jaime Sin]]) did not attend that conclave for health reasons and died shortly afterwards, and the third, [[William Wakefield Baum]], turned 80 on 21 November 2006.

Most of the Cardinals are from the [[Latin Church]], those who are from the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] have their church explicitly indicated.

Within the College of Cardinals, there are three categories, ranked [[Cardinal Bishop]]s, then [[Cardinal Priest]]s, and finally [[Cardinal Deacon]]s, within each category the Cardinals are ranked by seniority of appointment. 

Despite these titles, in fact since the pontificate of Pope [[John XXIII]] almost all Cardinals who were not already [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] at the time their appointment was announced have been ordained bishops prior to the conclusion of the formal installation, though in the last years the Jesuit priests made cardinals when they are already over 80 have generally petitioned not to become bishops and have received permission in this sense.

==Size of the College of Cardinals==
{{main|Size of the College of Cardinals}}

The size of the College of Cardinals at any given moment has historically been limited by [[pope]]s, [[ecumenical council]]s, and even the College itself. Over the period from 1099 to 1986, the total number of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s appointed was approximately 2900 (excluding possible undocumented 12th century cardinals, cardinals appointed during the [[Western Schism]] by pontiffs now considered to be [[antipopes]], and subject to some other sources of uncertainty), nearly half of whom were created after 1655.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, 1987, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
