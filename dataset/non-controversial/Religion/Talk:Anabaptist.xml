==Illustration==
The thumbnail image http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Baptism_by_immersion.jpg could be improved/replaced. It shows baptism by immersion in a river, but don't most Anabaptists practice baptist by pouring, not immersion? It looks Baptist, not Anabaptist.

== Bibliography ==
This is not how you write a bibliography. Sort it out.

== Unfair Representation/POV representation ==
From a glance at the article and the discussions below this article seems to being written mainly by Anabaptists for Anabaptists.  It seems full of positive POV.  Secular and critical studies on Anabaptists seem to be missing.  Could historians or other scholars with ''no attachment to'' Anabaptists balance this article with other POV's about Anabaptists so we see a representative article here? [[User:Anacapa|Anacapa]] 05:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

The POV appears to be written by anabaptists because it is written (by anabaptist, probably progressive anabaptist) and the discussion pages are guarded by anabaptists up north. It is highly unlikely that you will find anabaptist articles at wikipedia that have been written by those without some form of bias/POV. Academic anabaptists in the North seem to have a problem with other people's POV, as can be seen by the way they delete any editing by others, this shows their arrogance and consequently how they are not a good role model to others who also work for peace and reconciliation.This is probably why their power struggles within their denominations continue to destroy their crediblity. The editors of this article, (and other anabaptist articles), display a self righteous attitude which is not consistant with the teachings of Christ. In fact these editors seem to have the same self righteous attitude as the Pharasees of New Testament times.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:122.108.196.146|122.108.196.146]] ([[User talk:122.108.196.146|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/122.108.196.146|contribs]]) 10:59, 19 July 2008  (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:I glanced at Britannica to see how they studied Anabaptists.  Their article is much more readable and much more secular in tone with a much clearer flow of the history and of the distinctions between various Anabaptist groups.  They also emphasis the vehemence, intransigence, and end of time beliefs of Anabaptists.  They state that:&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;The Anabaptists did not aim to reform the midieval church.  They were determined instead to restore the institutions and spirit of the primitive church and were quite confident ''that they were living at the end of all ages'' (emphasis mine).  They readily recognised in their leaders divinely summoned prophets and apostles, and all converts stood ready to give a full account of their faith before the magistrates.  They often identified their suffering with that of the early Christian martyrs.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  They also state that &quot;Thomas Muntzer was among those (sometimes called 'spirituals') who emphasized that Anabaptists were living at the end of all ages&quot;. Clearly Anapbapists were radical ''revolutionaries'' rather than mere radical ''reformers'', a distinction that needs to be made here.

It seems from reading the Wiki article that much real representation of Anapbaptism is missing here.  It also seems relevant to study the doomsday or end of time aspects of Anabaptists since these beliefs are often found in [[Mind control]] groups and since some doomsday group researchers use early Anabaptists as examples.  Finally, it would be useful to see Anabaptists studied from a secular perspectives as we do other groups so NPOV balance is possible here.
[[User:Anacapa|Anacapa]] 03:53, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

Feel free to add more stuff about Anabaptists. However I would ask you to remember that Wikipedia is dedicated to the ''neutral'' point of view not the ''secular'' point of view. Also because a group felt it was 'living in the end times' does not mean they employed mind control techniques. Nor does being a revolutionary necessarily mean you are controlling people's minds.

Incidentally it's also a good idea to add new comments at the end of a talk page. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 04:19, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
::DJ, I added this stuff here because it seems to fit the section title best.  I will use end of page discussions for the ongoing/new stuff I do elsewhere.  I wanted some of those 1.1 billion (see [[religion]]) irreligious people out there to see this before wading down through all the other religious content in these pages. [[User:Anacapa|Anacapa]] 07:52, 1 March 2006 (UTC) 

::DJ, No offense but I feel just as free to add stuff here as all the other (Anabaptists?) here do.  I do not expect to give or take permission from you to edit as you see fit, either, but I hope we do discuss rather than war.  As for neutral NPOV versus secular POV you are right.  However when I see articles packed with religious POV (in a ''general'' readership encyclopedia) I have a right to balance that POV with secular sources to arrive at some NPOV balance.  (I will also note this is not a religious encyclopedia for religious references yet these Anabaptist articles sometimes ''read'' that way). I suggest you glance at [[religion]] to see what others did with highly controversial and opposing POV's.  In terms of mind control, please read what I said again.  I made no ''blanket'' judgements about Anabaptists and mind control nor did I imply that 'revolutionary' has a connection to mind control.  I do connect 'revolution' with 'extreme' however because revolutionaries intend to turn over the existing order rather just reform it.  Early Anapbaptists seem to have been (from the Britannica quotes) similar to modern day Muslim primitive revolutionaries (eg Talibans) minus all the violence.  I will do what I can so you don't get blindsided here but please don't make molehills into mountains with what I offer by assuming the worst without distinctions.  [[User:Anacapa|Anacapa]] 07:48, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

The current article does not give a fair view of the Anabaptists -- way too much is dwelt on the Zwickau Prophets, who are more of an anomaly in the Anabaptist movement, and hardly anything on the more &quot;mainstream&quot; Anabaptists. I will be doing some editing when I have the time to correct this, if it isn't done by then. --[[User:Colemanyee|Colemanyee]] 06:40, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Agreed! There is a definite need to rewrite this article in order to achieve a proper perspective of the Anabaptists. It reflects ideas commonly held in 1911, and fails to reflect a more balanced approach that almost 100 more years of study of the groups should yield. I had some ideas, but found it to be a headache to try and fix the article without almost totally rewriting it, so I haven't done anything. Any work you do will be needed and appreciated. - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 04:26, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Thanks for the support. It is true that a rewrite may be inevitable, reluctant though we are. Perhaps we could start with a general outline and move on from there? --[[User:Colemanyee|Colemanyee]] 05:54, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I developed a rough outline with the intent of first rearranging the existing material within it, and then add new material. I don't mind adding, but really hate to do too much of a rewrite of an existing article. But the existing material is so different from the way I would approach the subject, I became discouraged and decided to put the idea of hold for awhile. Here is the working outline I developed:
:*Introductory paragraph
:*The Name &quot;Anabaptist&quot; (perhaps could be combined above, according to length)
:*Views of the origins of Anabaptists
:*Types of Anabaptists
:*Theology of the Anabaptists
:*Christology (since this is an area in which several leading Anabaptists differed)
:*Persecutions
:*Migrations
:*Anabaptists Today
:*The Anabaptist Heritage (or legacy; doctrines now held by many &quot;non-Anabaptist&quot; Christians)
:This is just my idea; if you can use it in any way, feel free. I also think Wesley's ideas, below, would fit well into this kind of format. - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 00:26, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)


I'll help! I'm Jewish, but I have a Masters of Divinity. I honestly have no vested interest in the article whatsoever. I'm just interested in history. [[User:Narnibird|Narnibird]] 01:13, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

Here is one more writer concurring with the criticism about the precursors, and the unbalanced view here.  The Brethren of the Common Life fed into all of of humanistic reformational movements, not the Anabaptists in any special way.  The Waldensians, for some of their tacit similarities, came to have closer affiliation with the Reformed reformation.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.220.219.131|24.220.219.131]] ([[User talk:24.220.219.131|talk]]) 13:25, 14 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Ideas for expanding this article: ==

It would be good to list the families of denominations that descend from the Anabaptists. I think these are the Mennonites, the Amish, and possibly the Hutterites? Possibly compare with [[:Baptists|Baptists]], who were influenced by but not directly descended from the Anabaptists. 

It would also be good to mention the ''Martyr's Mirror'', as that has been a very influential publication. It says their persecution continued up until sometime in the late 1570's, I forget the date. Persecution caused migration to Russia and other parts of Europe, and of course they came to the United States as well. They're generally known as one (or two if you count Amish separately) of the &quot;peace churches&quot;, along with the Quakers, and have generally been [[conscientious objector]]s in the United States.  --[[User:Wesley|Wesley]]

*The [[Hutterites]] are definitely descendents of the Anabaptist movement. [[User:Pdfox|Athanasius]] 22:14, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Ideas for ''sectionalizing'' this article ==
Now that the Anabaptist article has been expanded, I have received this warning:

WARNING: This page is 32 kilobytes long; some browsers may have problems editing pages approaching or longer than 32kb. Please consider breaking the page into smaller sections.

Ideas on which sections to break out into separate articles will be appreciated (I still have a few sections I am planning to add: Types of Anabaptists and Anabaptists Today) - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 19:09, 14 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I broke [[Theology of Anabaptism]] out into a separate article (see Wetman comments below) to reduce the length (based on the 32kb warning), but have now added information on ''Types of Anabaptists'' and ''Anabaptists Today'', which has brought it back to about 31kb. So I'm still looking for suggestions on which parts will best &quot;stand alone&quot; as separate articles (I felt Theology could certainly do that). - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 02:44, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I think it would be good to include at least a summary of the theology, with details in its own article. The first items I would put into separate articles would be the ''Zwickau prophets and the Peasants' War'' and the ''Münster Rebellion'' -- a summary would suffice. If that's not enough, I would move the ''Origins'' next. I feel that the ''Forerunners'' section may be too detailed for the current article. Hope this helps. --[[User:Colemanyee|Colemanyee]] 08:18, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I moved most of the Zwickau prophets material to [[Peasants' War]] (which article already existed), and created an article on the [[Münster Rebellion]] with material moved from the article. Also added back a small general paragraph on theology. This should give enough space for a while. - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 16:53, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)

----
Removing the &quot;theology&quot; section from the entry [[Anabaptist]] is rather like removing the &quot;article of clothing&quot; section from [[Hat]]. What happened to the material? The link doesn't work? [[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 01:42, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)

The link works now. If you have a better suggestion, I'm certainly willing to listen to it. - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 03:33, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I have removed my name from this section.  I consider its use in this regard to be libelous, as the statements made were patently untrue.

I'd like to see a kind of a &quot;nutshell&quot; paragraph for people who aren't familiar with the details and implications of the Reformation. [[User:Manys|Manys]] 04:24, 29 August 2007 (UTC)

== Congregational Authority ==

I wonder whether it deserves a mention that the Anabaptist movement has been historically fragmented in part due to the lack of a central church authority.  By rejecting the authority of the Pope and embracing the priesthood of believers, the floodgates opened for each congregation to interpret the Bible differently, and for a congregation to split in two whenever its members had a theological dispute.  At least, that is my general impression of how Anabaptists have behaved.  Is this accurate and/or important?  Peace, --[[User:Fritzlein|Fritzlein]] 07:09, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:I think this definitely deserves mention in the article. Among Mennonites and Amish there are possible hundreds of different small conferences that have broken away over issues as small as whether to use hooks and eyes or buttons for clothing. The low level of hierarchy that Mennonites do have - bishops, has probably exacerbated this divide. Bishops traditionally oversee a number of churches and when they disagree with each other, they may very well split off from each other and take the congregations in their charge with them. Indeed, this is essentially how the Amish church started, breaking away from the Mennonites (see [[Amish#history]]). The [[Nebraska Amish]], [[Swartzendruber Amish]], [[Old Order Amish]] and  [[Beachy Amish]] are examples of this tradition continuing within the Amish church. Among Mennonite the number of differenc groups is probably even higher. The largest two being Mennonite Church USA[http://www.mennoniteusa.org/] and Mennonite Church Canada[http://www.mennonitechurch.ca/], the result of a recent reunification between the General Conference Mennonite Church and the Mennonite Church.

::I don't think something along those lines is entirely out of line, but I would urge caution because it could run into adding a lot of &quot;point of view&quot; as opposed to simple fact. - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 23:11, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== &quot;Men&quot; vs &quot;People&quot; ==

Under the heading &quot;Anabaptists Today&quot;, I returned the wording in this sentence - &quot;The Anabaptist doctrine - that men must personally, volitionally, and consciously relate to God - is the doctrine of Evangelical Protestantism...&quot; - from &quot;people&quot; to &quot;men&quot;. I did it for the following reasons: (1) &quot;Men&quot; in the English language (regardless of what some people may wish) still, in the right context, has the meaning of &quot;the human race&quot;; (2) &quot;Men&quot; is in line with the wording of historic Anabaptist statements of faith; and (3) &quot;People&quot; is somewhat ambiguous, usually having the connotation more of human beings in general rather than the entire human race. If &quot;men&quot; just cannot be tolerated by some, perhaps we should insert &quot;human race&quot; or something like that. - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 23:11, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Unclear sentence ==

I'm confused by this sentence:

:They seem to have preserved among them the primitive manual called [[the Teaching of the Apostles]], for Bishop Longland in [[England]] condemned an Anabaptist for repeating one of its maxims &quot;that alms should not be given before they did sweat in a man's hand.&quot; This was between 1518 and 1521.

Did they preserve the manuals betwen 1518 to 1521, or were they condemned between this date? - [[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 13:38, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::That was part of the original article. I left it intact, but don't really know about it. I would suppose that is when they were condemned. I think Longland was bishop around that time. - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 22:33, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== This is not a clear article ==

While I realise that a lot of time and effort has gone into this article, many parts are unclear. It seems that people are tossing around references to people's opinions, and expect others to know why the opinions of the writers are significant. Please: less citing and more explaining! Anyway, this is just my $0.02. - [[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 14:34, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Removing ''Anabaptists and Their Stepchildren'' ==

The material associated with ''Anabaptists and Their Stepchildren'' (http://reformed.org/sacramentology/lee/index.html), by Francis Nigel Lee has been removed twice now. I think that articles pro and con need to be in the references, and that removing it smacks of fearing letting anyone read anything negative about Anabaptism. I don't agree with Lee, but think his writing is very representative of the kind of polemic against Anabaptists going all the way back to the Reformation, and therefore interesting and valuable. Any thoughts? - [[User:Rlvaughn|Rlvaughn]] 12:16, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Dukabours ==

Are the Dukabours regarded as Anabaptists?  I'd be interested in some info on that group - either under Anabaptists, or separately.

==[[Radical Reformation]]==
There is a new page for this topic which could use expansion by someone with expertise in that area. [[User:KHM03|KHM03]] 11:42, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

This article falsely claims that Anabaptists were part of the radical reformation, however the reformists themselves even claim that Anabaptists had no part in it. '''&quot;All Anabaptists and rebaptized persons, male or female, of mature age, shall be judged and brought from natural life to death, by fire, sword or otherwise, as may befit the persons, without preceeding trial by spiritual judges.&quot;''' See how they explicitly specify that the Anabaptists were totally independent of the reformation. For the source click here [http://www.biblebaptistchurchgermany.org/BaptNotProt_eng.html].
[[User:Pasajero|Pasajero]] 10:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:You are making a lot of false assumptions.  The Radical Reformation was not a controlled movement with a defined leader, as was the case with the Lutheran or Reformed movements, nor was the reformation as a whole controlled and defined.  The Anabaptists were also not a cohesive movement, ranging from [[Münster Rebellion|Munsterites]] and [[Batenburgers]] to what eventually became [[Mennonites]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Amish]].  Secondly, pointing out that other branches of the reformation did not consider the Anabaptists part of theirs does not mean that the Anabaptists were not a reformation movement.  You are confusing the categories we use now to help explain things with the way things were then.

:[[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not a soapbox.]] [[User:Sxeptomaniac|Sxeptomaniac]] 06:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

The Anabaptists were clearly part of the Radical Reformation: the very term was invented by Williams his ''The Radical Reformation'', his book which covered the histories of Anabaptism, Unitarianism, and Spiritualism.

== Münster and Anabaptism ==

Insufficient attention is given to the Münster event which had profound repercussions on the contemporary views of the sect. A link to another article and a few brief words are an entirely inadequate way to deal with the subject matter.
:I agree completely. Why don't you go ahead and add a few paragraphs on Münster and it's influence? [[User:Mennonot|mennonot]] 18:42, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

== Reword? ==

&lt;i&gt;The term was coined by critics, who objected to the practice of performing baptism for adults whose previous baptism, as infants, the Anabaptists claimed was not valid.&lt;/i&gt;  So, I had to read this sentence 5 times before I understood that Anabaptists were not the critics.  For those of us unfamiliar with the term, it's really important to clarify well that they were the ones baptising adults, not the critics of it.  Perhaps &quot;their critics&quot; or &quot;the Anabaptist practice of&quot; would be two options.  Thanks!  [[User:Schwael|Schwael]] 16:00, 30 September 2005 (UTC)


== Muzer? ==

I'm pretty sure he wasn't an anabaptist at all. Rather he was a radical reformer and millenialist who existed around the same time.

== Removing parts questioned inline ==

There are a two selections that have produced inline comments questioning their validity in the article. I will remove them and place them here for comment. Perhaps someone can confirm their validity for this article if they are important enough.

The first is from the '''Miscellany''' section. The complainant is correct: the first sentence of the quote is from Paul (I Cor. 13b), but the rest is from elsewhere. This is the quote in question plus context I have removed:
 
{| style=&quot;border: 1px solid; background: beige; margin-left: 50px&quot;
|
It was easier to burn Anabaptists than to refute their arguments, and contemporary writers were struck with the intrepidity and number of their [[martyrs]]. Thus [[Stanislaus Hosius]] (1504-1579), a Polish cardinal and bishop of Warmie, wrote (''Opera,'' Venice, 1573, p. 202):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They are far readier than followers of Luther and Zwingli to meet death, and bear the harshest tortures for their faith. For they run to suffer punishments, no matter how horrible, as if to a banquet; so that if you take that as a test either of the truth of doctrine or of their certitude of grace, you would easily conclude that in no other sect is to be found a faith so true or grace so certain. But as Paul wrote:&quot;Even if I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it avails me naught.&quot; [This next quote must be from a previous editor; it's not from the NT.] But he has not charity who divides the unity&amp;hellip; He cannot be a martyr who is not in the Church&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second is from the '''External links''' section:

* {{cite web | title=Anabaptists and Their Stepchildren | work=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics | url=http://reformed.org/sacramentology/lee/index.html | accessdate=December 15, 2005}} by Francis Nigel Lee
::Lee's work is a response to Verduin's ''The Reformers and their Stepchildren'', and is representative of a Reformed view against Anabaptism. But its polemical nature leaves some question as to its objectivity. Quotes are often shortened for effect rather than concision (e.g., writing of the London Confession: &quot;''it was subtitled: Confession of Faith of those churches which are commonly...called 'Anabaptist'.''&quot; instead of, &quot;''Confession of Faith of those churches which are commonly, though falsely, called 'Anabaptist'.''&quot;), he renders highly suspect interpretations as connecting single immersion with unitarianism (&quot;Such Anabaptists as were trinitarian, generally did so by pouring. Unitarian Anabaptists, however, did so largely by a novel single submersion.&quot;), and resorts to the old method of using the excesses of a minority to denigrate the entire movement (e.g., polygamy).

In my opinion, the article is not hurt by dropping both of these passages. [[User:JonHarder|JonHarder]] 02:59, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

: &quot;He cannot be a martyr who is not in the Church;&quot; appears to come from [[Cyprian]], one of th early church fathers: see [http://www.studylight.org/his/ad/ecf/ant/cyprian/view.cgi?file=anf05-111.htm&amp;number=2 Treatise I. On the Unity of the Church, Paragraph 14, Sentence 2]. He also goes directly on to quote Paul (I Cor. 13b), so perhaps Stanislaus Hosius was plagiarising Cyprian and crediting Paul. But of course, it'd be best to find where the original source for the quote from Hosius. The closest I could get was [http://www.opentheory.org/encycl_exam1xml/text.phtml?par=28&amp;lang=it this mention], but it doesn't have any source either.

==Mind Control==
I added a 'See also' link to the Mind control article because Anabaptist faith confessions are full of what some see as Mind control statements.  Researcher Caldiani in his social science text ''Influence'' mentions early Anabaptists as a spectactularly effective doomsday group/cult using false reasoning with what he calls 'social proof' to gain converts against all evidence.  The &quot;One true&quot; church links on the Mind Control article also use Anabaptists examples from orthodox Old Order Mennonites.  As this ostensibly Mind Control theology forms the very basis of Anabaptist faith confessions and as early Anabapists have been used as examples of mind control groups, I insist on its inclusion here.  It is clear that one need not burn anyone to refute these arguments.  Please discuss this with NPOV balance or I will call a POV check on the entire article. [[User:Anacapa|Anacapa]] 02:03, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

:Anacapa, what you wrote above is extreme to say the least. Firstly mind control is a process, not a statement. I don't see how a statement of principle can be an example of mind control, any more than a soldier taking an oath of allegience to his country is. I may be wrong; if so you shoudl explan how. You wrote that 'some see' the faith confessions as mind control statements; maybe you should explain what statements these are and who sees them.

:::You are wrong - read the article on mind control before demonstrating your ignorance.

::Those who face Mennonite/Amish/Hutterite shunning know how extreme this is in reality.  Mind control is a process, with content, and with a context.  Hitler used false statements along with a process and a context to control the minds of a whole nation.  I suggest you compare the Shliethiem confession text with Chapter Six of Rape of the Mind (link in Mind Control) to gain an understanding of how Anabaptist ONE (pure, true or whatever) statements match those used by totalitarian states.  I also suggest you review Lifton's criteria for mind control  I know from personal experience that ''orthodox'' Mennonites meet most of those criteria.  Another good source is Children Held Hostage by Rivlin to see how orthodox Mennonite/Amish mind control is used in shunning to alienate children against parents and other relatives.  Most secular historians I read who reference Anabaptists call them ''radical'' reformers and often mention extremes in ideology or conduct.  Hope that helps.  [[User:Anacapa|Anacapa]] 05:11, 27 February 2006 (UTC) 

:Secondly by creating these links you look as if you are trying to nake some sort of statements about all Anabaptists. Even if you could show that some early Anabaptists practiced 'mind control', making such a link is obviously prejudicial unless you can show that it applies to Anabaptists in general. I'm pretty certain it doesn't. Anabaptists include a huge range of beliefs, and I would be exceptionally surprised if more than a tiny minority could be accused of any form of mind control. The onus is, I belive, on you to show that this link is a valid and neutral one. 

::Please check the content I added in a ''non-general'' section MISC.  For now, I can live with Mind Control Links  in ''specific'' sourced content to meet your concerns.  I imagine others will fill in whole picture as time goes on but I do not plan to do intense research on early Anabaptists now.  My focus is on those Anabaptists in the present who continue to cause extreme pain and suffering in the name of a god, in the name of love and in the name of peace (See Mennonite Miriam Toews comments on Shunning link: A Complicated Kind of Author).

This gentleman is given an extensive quote regarding the history of Anabaptists, and described as a 'social scientist'.

== Word root of anabaptist ==

An anonymous editor apparently knows just enough of Greek word roots to get confused on the root form of anabaptist.  They see &quot;an&quot; and assume it's &quot;without&quot; or &quot;not&quot; like &quot;anaerobic&quot; (an + aero).  Unfortunately, this is wrong.  The root is &quot;ana&quot; meaning &quot;again&quot;  I added a link to that section, so hopefully that will clear things up.

== Antibaptist vs. Anabaptist ==

Do these terms refer to the same group? I have a friend that constantly uses them interchangeably, but I only use the term anabaptist because that's always (and only) how I've heard them refered to as. I guess they could be ''anti''baptist in the sense that they were/are against infant baptism. [[User:Eleazar|Eleazar]] 11:56, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
:These two words '''cannot''' be used interchageably.  The prefix &quot;anti&quot; means ''to be against something'', whereas the prefix &quot;ana&quot; means ''to do something again''.  Literally, &quot;antibaptist&quot; means either to be against [[Baptists]] or against [[baptism]], depending upon the context, while &quot;anabaptist&quot; means ''re-baptizer''.  The title &quot;Anabaptist&quot; was originally meant to be a criticsm of those churches who were [[baptism|re-baptizing]] people, mainly because they were baptizing former [[Catholics]] and/or [[Anglicans]] who had been [[Infant_baptism|sprinkled]] as infants.
:--[[User:Beleg Strongbow|Beleg Strongbow]] ([[User talk:Beleg Strongbow|talk]]) 19:20, 26 March 2008 (UTC)


The term &quot;anti-baptists&quot; is a translation of &quot;katabaptists,&quot; an appellation given these groups by the Roman Church.  Hence, one could say they refer to the same group, but from different POVs. [[User:Dr. Davidson|Dr. Davidson]] ([[User talk:Dr. Davidson|talk]]) 21:35, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

== Freedom of Religion vs. Separation of Church and State ==

I take exception to the following quote: 

''All those who hold the idea of a free church and freedom of religion (sometimes called separation of church and state)....''

I don't wish in full to invoke debate on the difference, but suffice it to say these two terms are ''not'' synonymous. Please see the article on [[Freedom of Religion]] in which this is specifically stated. I'm not 100% sure of whether the Anabaptists support both concepts, but please don't use them as though they are the same concept.

== Oscar Wilde ==

[[Oscar Wilde]] referred to the anabaptists in the third act of his play, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'':
:'''Chasuble.'''  &quot;I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.  They savour of the heretical views of the '''Anabaptists''', views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.  However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the church at once.  Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry.&quot; [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/tiobe10h.htm]

:Too much detail about fringe groups can become an [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]] issue.  If their beliefs aren't representative of the more numerous Anabaptists, but they are still notable, it might be better to develop a separate article on them and just reference and link them in this one.

==One must accept all personal moral and spiritual liability ... ==
It seems that [[ethical consumerism]] has its roots in Anabaptism, at least according to [[Ethical_consumerism#Global_morality.3F|this section]], which claims that it is based on the Anabaptist principle &quot;that one must accept all personal moral and spiritual liability of all harms done at any distance in space or time to anyone by one's own choices&quot;. Unfortunately, it is a bit vague as to the nature of this principle and doesn't provide a reference. Could someone in the know please clarify this there? [[User:Common Man|Common Man]] 21:18, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

== Quakers &amp; Anabaptists ==

Perhaps someone should clarify that while Quakers are an Historic Peace Church, they do not descend from the same line of historical Christianity as the Anabaptists, and should not be considered Anabaptists.  Theologically and historically, Quakers descend from English Puritanism, not from Anabaptism.  The Historic Peace Churches are not necessarily Anabptist in origin.

== Baptists &amp; Anabaptists ==

It seems rather &quot;iffy&quot; to include Baptists in the list of modern Anabaptist denominations.  Baptists, as known to-day in the US, are spiritual descendants of the English Baptsists of the 17th Century.  While some English Baptists spent time in the Netherlands, coming under the influence of some Anabaptist/Mennonite ideas, they (like the Quakers) didn't descend from the same line of historical Christianity as the Anabaptists.  Moreover, most Baptists in the US have a very strong Calvinist influence (for a variety of reasons at different times in their history).  Like the Quakers, Baptists descend from English Puritanism.  See the Wiki article about the Baptists.

I agree with you. -- [[User:Freeradster|freeradster]] 02:20, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

== Genealogists ==
&lt;&lt;Genealogists are also indebted to the Anabaptists, because Anabaptism was part of the cause for Protestant churches adopting the confirmation service, and baptismal registers came into being.&gt;&gt;
I dispute this. In fact the opposite is true. In England baptismal registers were made compulsory by Henry VIII when he founded the Church of England.  It made general a practice already started by many Catholic monasteries.  Early anabaptists did not generally record their baptisms and therefore genealogists find that anabaptists are particulary difficult areas of research.  Therefore to say that &quot;Genealogists are also indebted to the Anabaptists&quot; is very misleading indeed.  I have therefore removed this sentence.

== Anabaptist heritage is unclear ==

Some things (presumably essential to an Anabaptist heritage) are listed. Here are 4 of them.
* Freedom of religion
* Priesthood of all believers
* Bible as the sole rule of faith and practice
* Pacifism
The fifth was:
* Ordinances (instead of Sacraments)
I removed the fifth, as it was a result of modernistic reductionist thinking, and had little or nothing to do with historical Anabaptism. My question is, are the other four even valid? They may be true for the Anabaptist's descendants (i.e. Mennonites, Amish), but the historical Anabaptists did not neccessarily agree on those four points. 
Here's a suggested list:
* Restoring primitive Christianity
* A society reformation by [[God's Kingdom]]
* A rejection of [[infant baptism]] and justification by faith alone
* Dependence and faith in the Word of God, whether the [[cannonical Bible]] or private inspiration

-- [[User:Freeradster|freeradster]] 21:06, 11 January 2007 (UTC)


:* [[User:Freeradster|freeradster]] Makes a good point. I second his proposition of removing the fifth supposed 'essential unifying tenets' of the Anabaptists. After all, the Anabaptists '''did''' have differences. Also, I would agree with [[User:Freeradster|freeradster]]'s new suggested list, with the exception of keeping the 'Priesthood of all believers' item, or at least clarifying the point to his liking. Also, with such a proposal, some references, citations, etc, will be desirable. -- [[User:Loaves|Loaves]] 23:39, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:* The reason I would not suggest the priesthood of all believers is that it was not unique to the Anabaptists...Luther also strongly argued for it. -- [[User:Freeradster|freeradster]] 00:23, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

== Cut-and-paste similarity between &quot;Early Charismatic History&quot; section of [[Charismatic movement]] and &quot;Miscellany&quot; section of [[Anabaptist]] ==
I noticed in a passing &quot;read&quot; that someone has duplicated major portions of these two sections, apparently with the purpose of showing that anabaptists were predecesors of the charismatic movement.  The material seems somewhat forced and out of context in both locations.  Perhaps someone with an interest in maintaining these articles can edit these sections to make them more focused on the major points of the topics.
[[User:Baskaufs|Steve Baskauf]] 04:55, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
:I see.  I had initially removed that insertion in Miscellany as a duplication of information found elsewhere in the article (and somewhat non-NPOV), but it was promptly re-inserted.  Not wanting to edit-war, I let it sit to see what other editors might decide, and it has remained until now.  It really doesn't belong, and appears to be way too POV anyway, so I'm now removing it again. 

:I'm less knowledgeable regarding Charismatics, but it appears to be a POV insertion as part of an attempt to prove the [[Apostolic succession]] of the Charismatic movement.

:This section (and in fact the whole page) leaves me feeling queasy: The introductory paragraph states:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;The word anabaptism is used in this article to describe any of the 16th century &quot;radical&quot; dissenters. Today the descendants of the 16th century European movement (particularly the Amish, Hutterites, Mennonites, Church of the Brethren, and Brethren in Christ) are the most common bodies referred to as Anabaptist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:In the end, I get the sense of being taken on a joy ride with stops at little tidbits of information that are actually minor details, but skipping over the framework.  Maybe it is just me??  I am of the opinion that this article could use a serious rework.  For example, there is some historical overview for the 15th century, then it jumps to &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Neo-anabaptistism&quot;.

I have a problem with the final paragraph in the section entitled &quot;Persecutions and migrations&quot;.  It seems as though someone is simply trying to push the agenda of allowing women into the position of [[Pastor|Pastor/Bishop/Elder]].  I have replaced that paragraph with the following text:
:Anabaptist women have also faced martyrdom.  An estimated 525 Anabaptist women were martyred, among whom was [[Maey ken Wens]]: with her tongue screwed to the inside of her mouth, she was burned at the stake for proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ. &lt;ref&gt;[http://homecomers.org/mirror/martyrs143.htm Maeyken Wens, And Some Of Her Fellow-believers, Burnt For The Testimony Of Jesus Christ At.

I quote, 'Most Beachy Amish churches have become more and more like conservative Mennonites and have identified less and less with Amish', 'An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups'. by Stephen Scott page 196  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/122.108.196.146|122.108.196.146]] ([[User talk:122.108.196.146|talk]]) 07:04, 10 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
Not all anabaptist/Mennonite groups regard infant baptism as invalid. In the Mennonite magazine, 'The Mennonite' and its article &quot;Mennonite but not anabaptist', it is stated in black and white for all to read that infant baptism is accepted by some Mennonite congregations. If you will put aside your pride and read the article you will see that for some anabaptists infant baptism is no longer an issue. I do not accept infant baptism as valid but that is just my viewpoint but the fact is some anabaptist/Mennonite groups accept infant baptism as being valid and I will keep editing the article to reflect these facts for as long as you wish to engage in this sort of vandalism.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/122.108.196.146|122.108.196.146]] ([[User talk:122.108.196.146|talk]]) 07:22, 10 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Denominations are classified by heritage.  There is a range of practices among the various Amish groups, same as with Mennonites, but it doesn't change the fact that Beachy Amish or &quot;Amish Mennonites&quot; are still Amish.  As a result, they do not need to be specifically named in this article.
:As far as your article on baptism, it's not clear enough to establish [[WP:UNDUE|what weight]] to give the claim, as it's an opinion essay, not a scholarly work.  As I've told you in other contexts, find [[WP:RS|a better source]].  Clinging to one essay as if it were gospel is [[WP:TE|tendentious]], and will not help you at all.
:You have yet to convince even one editor to support your edits.  The burden of proof is on you to make a good case for your additions.  Perhaps you should reconsider your commitment to [[WP:EW|a course of action that will get you absolutely nowhere]].  Your behavior is increasingly [[WP:TE|tendentious]] and [[WP:DE|disruptive]].

::To quite honest I believe that the anabaptist articles at wikipedia are poorly written and ignorant and reflect the 'gang of four' atitudes of the so called mainline Mennonites and are no longer worth my time, effort and education. I can fully understand now why the anabaptist membership is so low, fractured, and fragmented. And that is the way it will always be because there are people like you who have no insight into their behaviour and self delusion.

==Anabaptist Spirituality POV==
This section needs some cleanup. For example, &quot;It was not unusual for them to dance, fall under the power of the Holy Spirit and speak in tongues.&quot;  While the Swiss Brethren and Dutch Mennonites did not totally deny supernatural gifts or miracles, they were by no means 16th-century equivalents of modern Charismatics.  While miraculous events did occur, the spirit of the movement as a whole was not that of emphasizing or seeking gifts or miracles.  The relationship between the French Prophets and the Anabaptist movement is a strained connection, from the historical evidence I have seen.  Anyways, this whole section needs deleted or at least seriously rewritten to reflect a NPOV.  As time permits, I may work on it myself, unless further proof is given that the POV given in this section was indeed the POV that the Anabaptist movement had as a whole.  One or two sentences out of a whole volume of writings, viz. Menno Simons, does not make Menno a 16th-century counterpart of modern American Pentecostals or Charismatics.

== Why is anabaptism heresy? ==

I didn't see this addressed in the article. There is mention that opponents consider re-baptism to be heresy, but not why, and I don't know where to go to learn that. -- [[User:SpareSimian|SpareSimian]] ([[User talk:SpareSimian|talk]]) 02:44, 19 April 2009 (UTC)

I don't know why they would say that (that is to say, I can't give my thoughts on why they say that without offending someone), but I can tell you why they are wrong. Acts 19:1-5 says, &quot;1And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, 2He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. 3And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. 4Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 5When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; [[User:Joshuaingram|Joshua Ingram]] ([[User talk:Joshuaingram|talk]]) 06:18, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

== Anabaptist template ==

I am in the process of trying to create navigation templates for each of the core articles of the Christianity WikiProject. One such template has recently been created for this topic at [[Template:Anabaptist]]. If anyone has any suggestions for how to change the template, they are more than welcome. I personally think they would most easily be seen if added below the link to the template at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Christianity/Core topics work group/Templates]], and would request that the comments be made on that page below the template. Thank you. [[User:John Carter|John Carter]] ([[User talk:John Carter|talk]]) 17:55, 19 April 2009 (UTC)

:Depends on how it is intended to be used. I think the template is too quadratic. If it's intended to be used like [[:Template:Calvinism]] and [[:Template:Lutheranism]] floating right, a pattern like those templates are to be preferred because they're not too wide. On the other hand if it is going to be a bottom template, it should be shorter. The image to the very right occupies one column that is otherwise empty. In the float-right case it should come first. In the bottom case it should preferably be floating inside the template. ... said: [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|bork²]]) 10:31, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

== Revise spirituality section ==

I revised this section, as per my desire from some time ago.  (See above- Anabaptist spirituality POV)
I made the following amendments:
1.Removed the uncited information, viz. Menno Simons supporting speaking in tongues, etc.  The quote pulled from Menno had nothing to do with whether he or his congregation spoke in tongues.
2. Removed some repetitious material that belonged in another section.
3. Removed reference to [[Bucer]]- He was not an Anabaptist, at least according to the Wikepedia article.  His point of view is worthless in an article on Anabaptism.
4. Divided the Spirituality section into two points and tried to put the right material in the right place.
5. Last but not least, I tried to word the material in a way that more correctly represents the early anabaptist movement, viz. the manifestations were not uniformly experienced across the movement in the same proportions.
I hope this is a suitable start to getting this article in better shape.  [[User:Mikeatnip|Mikeatnip]] ([[User talk:Mikeatnip|talk]]) 02:58, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
I should add that I really dont like the title &quot;Spirituality&quot; for this section.  I guess if miracles are seen as &quot;spirituality&quot; then it fits and so the Inspirationist wing would have probably preferred that.  I would say the wing that developed into the Mennonite and Hutterite churches would probably call &quot;spirituality&quot;, &quot;taking up the cross and obeying the Jesus.&quot;  [[User:Mikeatnip|Mikeatnip]] ([[User talk:Mikeatnip|talk]]) 03:03, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

== Origins ==

Is it possible to verify the claim of origins in the Brethren of the Common Life, please, as there is an apparent anachronism here. If they were direct descendants of the Hussites, then they were born in the first quarter of the fifteenth Century at the earliest, Jan Huss' death having been a collateral effect of the Council of Constance. However, the Brethren of the Common Life were founded approximately simultaneously, and it therefore becomes hard to see how the Anabaptists descended from them, as stated: the heyday of the Brethren was in the tail end of the century.
On the other hand, their doctrines were also not dissimilar to the more radical doctrines of the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]], a considerably older Beghard sect of much more radical ideation more immediately identifiable in theological and geographical terms. Is it possible the existing editor made a nomenclative mistake?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/217.136.14.146|217.136.14.146]] ([[User talk:217.136.14.146|talk]]) 19:09, 7 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Section: Forerunners==
The section '''Forerunners''' is rotten, stinking and attracts pov-flies. I think it should be almost trashed, replacing the contents with:
:''suddenly they could read the [[Bible]] in their own [[Klingon language]], and then all [[Hell]] broke lose.''
Or not. Better just trashing it.

I would rather like a section &quot;Definitions&quot;, since it is obvious some wish to put extreme reformers such as Munsterites and  Melchiorites outside and others inside, depending on POV. I believe there was different &quot;historical layers&quot; of radical reformers, one first violent and now extinct layer, afterwards a moderated layer instead trying non-violence, ensuring their survival. The relations between those layers seems to be a matter of speculation and/or research. Wikipedia should not claim anything, as usual, but could well present various well-sourced theories, as it already does in the sections '''Views''', '''Monogenesis''', '''Polygenesis''', and the weird church perpetuity section misleadingly called '''Apostolic succession'''. In the last section, that should rather be named '''Church perpetuity''', the unlikely theories from the killable section '''Forerunners''', could be reviewed as proponed explanations.

The section '''Later influences''' seems to be more refined crap than the section '''Forerunners'''. Some of it belongs to a hypothetical missing section '''Theology''', the rest to the null device (aka trash-can).

The rest of the article have some justification, but doesn't distinguish the subtypes good enough, and sometimes confuses (anachronisms with roman emperors and stuff) and blabbs irrelevant nonsense such as
:''There is no known account in history of persecution of other Christians by Anabaptists as a group.''
That is: if the early violent Munsterites killed people, it was not an expression of a systematic persecution of any specific group, it was just against any opposition. So, we already know there were never a centralized organization of anabaptists that could perform such a feat, but that's not relevant. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit.

Then probably another section dealing with the history of the movement from 1550 to 1850, which will deal primarily with the 3 main groups and their subsequent migrations and spread.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mikeatnip|Mikeatnip]] ([[User talk:Mikeatnip|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mikeatnip|contribs]]) 16:05, 9 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== RFC on Spirituality section ==

First of all, I dont know how to do an official RFC, and I am not sure the issue is large enough to make some official request. I have been moving down the article slowing the last months, trying to improve both content and grammar. I am now approaching the [[Anabaptist#Spirituality|Spirituality]] section. I see this section as an [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]] issue. The charismatic manifestations are not what Anabaptism is usually noted for, in fact, in my dozens of books on Anabaptism I cannot think of one of them that even addresses these manifestations. The Holy Spirit Leadership would have a little more weight to it, but again it was not one of the core issues on which Anabaptism was founded upon. I therefore propose removing these two points and replacing them with other points (Gelassenheit would definitely be one, as well as nachfolge), or at least make only a passing mention at best. Before doing this, I would like comments from other editors. Thanks! [[User:Mikeatnip|Mikeatnip]] ([[User talk:Mikeatnip|talk]]) 02:46, 2 September 2012 (UTC)</text>
