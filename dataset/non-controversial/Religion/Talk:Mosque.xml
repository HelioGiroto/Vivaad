:''Actually, the word &quot;surau&quot; comes from a Malay word, which means a smaller mosque that can be used for five daily prayers, but cannot used for Friday congregation sermons as well as i'tikaf, a period of retreat usually practiced in larger mosques.''--[[User:Muhammad Mukhriz|Muhammad Mukhriz]] ([[User talk:Muhammad Mukhriz|talk]]) 08:18, 27 January 2011 (UTC)


== &quot;according to the Hadith Muslims must destroy all polytheist buildings of worship&quot; ==

I could not find any reference for the statement: &quot;according to the Hadith Muslims must destroy all polytheist buildings of worship.&quot;

Please forgive my ignorance but it would be nice to have some authentic reference.

[[User:Faisalnd|Faisal]] ([[User talk:Faisalnd|talk]]) 11:51, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

To be honest, due to the dubious authenticity of the Hadiths (I mean, they were written long after Muhammad’s death!) it may be untrue. I don’t know if it’s possible to get the Hadiths online like you can so easily with the Qur’an.--[[User:Misortie|Frank Fontaine]] ([[User talk:Misortie|talk]]) 18:31, 13 September 2009 (UTC)


== Masjid ==

I just found that googling a [[WP:SET]] for mosque only had 2,470,000 hits whereas the same [[WP:SET]] for masjid had surprisingly more at 3,380,000 hits. I was looking at [[Mosque]] to see how it included the term, masjid , so that I could follow it. To make sure I was following previous [[WP:CONSENSUS]], I checked the [[Talk:Mosque]] too but it was rather short, so I scanned the archives and found [[Talk:Mosque/Archive 1#Proposal to move]] and [[Talk:Mosque/Archive 2#Change (Mosque in to Masjid)because we are muslims that's why we only call t Majid.]] . They made sense to me even though I remembered an embryonic US and [[Australia|AU]] trend from mosque to masjid in the 1990's. I just wanted to do the SET to set it in the talk before making the changes I was planning. I know I should not have been surprised that masjid had already surpassed mosque in English since I knew that the top five [[List of countries by English-speaking population#List in order of total speakers]] contained [[OIC]] member, [[Nigeria|NG]], and the two countries with [[OIC#Membership attempts]], [[India|IN]] and [[Philippines|PH]] but I still was nevertheless. That said, perhaps it is time to start using the more popular term, masjid , on English Wikipedia. As this has been contentious before, I invite consensus before planning action. Please articulate your POV.

== Quba Mosque ==

It is known that the oldest mosque in the North Africa is at Khairouan, Tunisia. However, it is come to my opinion that the '''Quba Mosque''' should be included in the earliest History of Mosques (this article), because Masjid Al-Quba (or The Quba Mosque) has an imporant significance to the history of the construction of mosques since the Early Islamic Period in Mecca.

== non-muslim in Moroccan mosque ==

Im not sure the guidebook referenced in this text is correct as I have just been welcomed into the mosque in Fnidaq (town near to Ceuta in north Morocco). I am female and look caucasian and clearly had issues arranging a headscaff, but none of these things seemed to bother the other women. They smiled and generally seemed not to mind my being there or getting the prayer movements wrong occationally. (the lady next to me showed me after prayer that my head should have touched the ground). However we could not speak a word of each others language so it is hard to know for sure if it is the norm for English girls who dont look muslim to be allowed in. Perhaps I ignorantly impossed myself and they were just too polite to throw me out? Its very untouristy here so I cant imagine its a common problem for this particular mosque. They certainly seemed to relish the opotunity to show me the ropes, for which I am most greatful.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/41.140.88.83|41.140.88.83]] ([[User talk:41.140.88.83|talk]]) 18:48, 15 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Title change to Masjid ==

Google indicates that masjid is used more than mosque. A google search on English sources shows more instances of masjid than mosque (79 million to 75.4 million). [[User:Modeltookmodeltook|Modeltookmodeltook]] ([[User talk:Modeltookmodeltook|talk]]) 15:58, 29 August 2012 (UTC)

: Doesn't sound plausible to me, but I'll let others who know more discuss it properly (but your [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mosque etymology] is junk, which doesn't fill me with confidence. Ah, but you had the sense to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mosque&amp;diff=509790868&amp;oldid=509789241 rewrite it]). In the meantime I've reverted your change to [[Template:Islam]] - get agreemetn (or not) here first [[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] ([[User talk:William M.

:::''Masjid'', of course, is the proper title in Arabic, but not in English. English Wikipedia article titles use the appropriate English name, and since few English speakers would know that ''masjid'' is the Arabic word for mosque, it would be a poor choice of a search term target.  See [[WP:COMMONNAME]] and [[WP:UE]] for the policy.  By the way, there is no link between &quot;mosque&quot; and &quot;mosquito.&quot; The former probably has its origins in an English pronunciation of ''masjid'', and the latter is derived from Spanish and Portuguese, and ultimately from Latin (''musca''), which obviously predates Islam, so there is no derogatory implication. This has been discussed before; look farther up the page.

Note that Modeltookmodeltook has now moved a large number of &quot;X mosque&quot; pages to &quot;X masjid&quot;.

&lt;s&gt;'''Agree''' - It should be moved to masjid.
