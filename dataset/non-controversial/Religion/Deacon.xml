[[File:StStephen GiacomoCavedone.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Stephen]], one of the first seven deacons in the Christian Church,  holding a [[Gospel Book]]. Painting by [[Giacomo Cavedone]] 1601]]
'''Deacon''' is a ministry in the [[Christianity|Christian Church]] that is generally associated with service of some kind, but which varies among theological and denominational traditions. In many traditions the &quot;diaconate&quot;, the term for a deacon's office, is a [[Clergy|clerical]] office; in others it is for [[laity]].

The word &quot;deacon&quot; is derived from the Greek word ''diakonos'' (διάκονος),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=deacon|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/11/D0051100.html|publisher=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition|year=2000|accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a standard [[ancient Greek]] word meaning &quot;servant&quot;, &quot;waiting-man&quot;, &quot;minister&quot; or &quot;messenger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D%237832 |title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon |author=Liddell, Henry George |coauthor=[[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]] |authorlink=Henry Liddell |year=1889 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |accessdate=2007-10-18 |isbn=0-19-910206-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commonly promulgated speculation as to its etymology is that it literally means 'through the dust', referring to the dust raised by the busy servant or messenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric|last=Partridge|title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English|publisher=Greenwich House|location=New York|year=1983|isbn=0-517-41425-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally believed that the office of deacon originated in the selection of seven men, among them [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], to assist with the charitable work of the early church as recorded in {{bibleverse||Acts|6|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy |id=04647c |title=Deacons |first=Herbert |last=Thurston |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hopko |first=Thomas |title=Holy Orders |url=http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&amp;ID=57 |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female deacons are mentioned by [[Pliny the Younger]] in a letter to [[Trajan]] dated ''c''. 112. The exact relationship between male and female Deacons varies. In some traditions a female deacon is simply a member of the order of deacons; in others, deaconesses constitute a separate order; in others, the title &quot;deaconess&quot; is given to the wife of a deacon.

A biblical description of the qualities required of a deacon, and of their household, can be found in {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|3:1-13|KJV}}.

Among the more prominent deacons in history are Phoebe, the only person actually called &quot;deacon&quot; in Scripture; [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], the first Christian martyr (the &quot;protomartyr&quot;); [[Philip the Evangelist|Philip]], whose baptism of the [[Ethiopian eunuch]] is recounted in {{bibleverse||Acts|8:26-40|KJV}}; [[Saint Lawrence]], an early Roman martyr; [[Saint Vincent of Saragossa]], protomartyr of Spain; [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], founder of the mendicant [[Franciscans]]; Saint [[Ephrem the Syrian]] and Saint [[Romanus the Singer|Romanos]] the Melodist, a prominent early hymnographer. Prominent historical figures who played major roles as deacons and went on to higher office include Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[Thomas Becket]] and [[Reginald Pole]].

The title is also used for the president, chairperson, or head of a trades [[guild]] in [[Scotland]]; and likewise to two officers of a [[Masonic Lodge]].

==Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Anglicanism==
The diaconate is one of the [[Holy Orders|major orders]] in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches. The other major orders are those of [[bishop]] and [[presbyter]] ([[priest]]).

While the diaconate as a permanent order was maintained from earliest Apostolic times to the present in the Eastern churches (Orthodox and Catholic), it mostly disappeared in the Western church (with a few notable exceptions such as St Francis of Assisi) during the first millennium, with Western churches retaining deacons attached to diocesan cathedrals. The diaconate continued in a vestigial form as a temporary, final step along the course to ordination to the Roman Catholic priesthood. In the 20th century, the diaconate was restored as a permanent order in many Western churches, most notably in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and [[The United Methodist Church]].

In Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches, deacons assist priests in their pastoral and administrative duties, but often report directly to the bishop. They have a distinctive role in the [[liturgy]], their main tasks being to proclaim the [[Gospel]], preach, assist in the administration of the [[Eucharist]] and to serve the poor and outcast.

===Roman Catholicism===
[[Image:DeaconsingingExsultet2007.jpg|thumb|right|In Poland, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] deacon chants the ''[[Exsultet]]'' at the [[Easter Vigil]].]]
In the years just prior to the [[Second Vatican Council]], the only men ordained as deacons were seminarians who were completing the last year or so of graduate theological training, who received the order several months before priestly ordination.

Following the recommendations of the council (in ''[[Lumen Gentium]]'' 29), in 1967 [[Pope Paul VI]] issued the [[motu proprio]] ''Sacrum Diaconatus Ordinem'', restoring the ancient practice of ordaining to the diaconate men who were not candidates for priestly ordination. These men are known as ''permanent deacons'' in contrast to those completing their training, who were then called ''transitional deacons''. There is no sacramental difference between the two, however, as there is only one order of deacons.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Wilson, ''A few additional observations'' url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CANONLAW/WOMENDEA.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dalmatiek.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Ornately embroidered dalmatic, the proper vestment of the deacon (shown from the back with an appareled [[amice]])]]
The permanent diaconate formation period in the Roman Catholic Church entails a year of prayerful preparation, a four- or five-year training period that resembles a collegiate course of study, and a year of post-ordination formation as well as the need for lifelong continuing education credits. Diaconal candidates receive instruction in [[philosophy]], [[theology]], study of the Holy Scriptures (the Bible), [[homiletics]], sacramental studies, [[evangelization]], [[ecclesiology]], counseling, and pastoral care and ministry before ordination.  Although they are assigned to work in a parish by the diocesan bishop, once assigned, deacons are under the supervision of the parish pastor.&lt;ref&gt;USCCB Diaconate FAQ - Section 5 &quot;Is a Deacon ordained for the Parish or the Diocese?&quot; http://www.usccb.org/deacon/faqs.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike most clerics, permanent deacons who also have a secular profession have no right to receive a salary for their ministry,&lt;ref&gt;Canon 281 § 3.&lt;/ref&gt; but many dioceses opt to remunerate them anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Details about the permanent diaconate in the United States are outlined in a 2005 document of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], ''National Directory for the Formation, Ministry and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States''. url=http://nccbuscc.org/deacon/DeaconDirectory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry of the deacon in the Roman Catholic Church is described as one of service in three areas: the Word, the Liturgy and Charity. The deacon's ministry of the Word includes proclaiming the Gospel during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], preaching and teaching. The deacon's liturgical ministry includes various parts of the Mass proper to the deacon, including being an ordinary minister of Holy Communion and the proper minister of the chalice when Holy Communion is administered under both kinds. The ministry of charity involves service to the poor and marginalized and working with parishioners to help them become more involved in such ministry. As clerics, deacons are required to recite the [[Liturgy of the Hours]].  Deacons, like priests and bishops, are ordinary ministers of the sacrament of [[Baptism]] and can serve as the church's witness at the sacrament of Holy Matrimony, which the bride and groom administer to each other (though if the exchange of vows takes place in a wedding Mass, or Nuptial Mass, the Mass is celebrated by the priest and the deacon acts as another witness). Deacons may preside at funeral rites not involving a Mass (e.g., the final commendation at the gravesite or the reception of the body at a service in the funeral home), and may assist the priest at the Requiem Mass. They can preside over various services such as [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]], and they may give certain blessings. They cannot hear confession and give absolution, anoint the sick, or celebrate Mass.

At Mass, the deacon is the ordinary minister of the proclamation of the Gospel (in fact, a priest, bishop, or even the Pope should not proclaim the Gospel if a deacon is present)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/current/chapter4.shtml USCCB - Committee on the Liturgy - Chapter IV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and of Holy Communion (primarily, of the Precious Blood). As ordained clerics, and if granted faculties by their bishops, deacons may preach the homily at a public Mass, unless the priest celebrant retains that ministry to himself at a given Mass.

[[Image:Dalmatic.jpg|thumb|left|[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] deacon wearing a [[dalmatic]].]]
The [[vestments]] most particularly associated with the Western Rite Catholic deacon are the [[alb]], [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and [[dalmatic]]. Deacons, like priests and bishops, must wear their albs and [[stole (vestment)|stole]]s; deacons place the stole over their left shoulder and it hangs across to their right side, while priests and bishops wear it around their necks. The dalmatic, a vestment especially associated with the deacon, is worn during the celebration of the [[Mass]] and other liturgical functions; its use is more liberally applied than the corresponding vestment of the priest, the [[chasuble]]. At certain major celebrations, such as ordinations, the diocesan bishop wears a dalmatic under his chasuble.

Permanent deacons often serve in parish or other ministry as their time permits, since they typically have other full-time employment. They may also act as parish administrators (C. 217 of the Code of Canon Law). With the passage of time, more and more deacons are serving in full-time ministries in parishes, hospitals, prisons, and in diocesan positions. Deacons often work directly in ministry to the marginalized inside and outside the church: the poor, the sick, the hungry, the imprisoned.

The permanent diaconate can be conferred on single men 25 or older, and on married men 35 or older, but an older age can be required by the episcopal conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19670618_sacrum-diaconatus_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; If a married deacon is widowed, he must maintain the celibate state.  Under some very rare circumstances, however, deacons who have been widowed can receive permission to remarry. This is most commonly done when the deacon is left as a single father. In some cases, a widowed deacon will seek priestly ordination, especially if his children are grown.&lt;ref&gt;(National Directory for the Formation, Ministry and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States, 2005, pg. 36)&lt;/ref&gt; (''See also [[clerical celibacy]].'') The wife of a permanent deacon may be sometimes considered a partner in his ordained ministry. In many dioceses, the wife of the diaconal candidate undertakes the same education and training her husband does.

A permanent deacon is not [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] &quot;Father&quot; as a priest would be, but as &quot;Deacon&quot;, abbreviated variously as &quot;Dn.&quot; or &quot;Dcn.&quot; This preferred method of address is stated in the 2005 document of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory for the Formation, Ministry and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States. The proper address in written correspondence for all Deacons of the Latin (Roman Rite) Catholic Church is &quot;Rev. Mr.&quot;. &quot;Rev. Mr.&quot;, however, is more often used to indicate a [[transitional deacon]] (i.e., preparing for ordination to the priesthood) or one who belongs to a [[religious institute]], while &quot;Deacon&quot; is used as the honorific for permanent deacons (e.g. Deacon John Smith, or Deacon Smith). The decision as to whether deacons wear the Roman collar as street attire is left to the discretion of each bishop for his own diocese. Where clerical garb is approved by the bishop, the deacon can choose to wear or not wear the &quot;collar&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Where it is not permitted, the deacon must wear secular clothing. It is becoming more common to see deacons wearing a clerical suit.

Deacons, like seminarians, religious, and the two other orders, Bishops and priests, recite the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]; however, deacons, if they are obliged to do so, are usually only required to participate in Morning and Evening Prayer.

In solemn Masses today and moreso in older Rites of the Mass, one deacon will serve as the [[Deacon of the Word]] (proclaiming the Gospel and the Kyrie, and some other parts such as the Invitation to the Sign of Peace), and the [[Deacon of the Eucharist]], who assists the priest during the Liturgy of the Eucharist.

===Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism===
[[Image:Orthodox Deacon.jpg|thumb|[[Greek Orthodox]] deacon in the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]], wearing an [[orarion]] over his [[sticharion]]. On his head he wears the clerical [[kamilavka]].]]

In addition to reading the [[Gospel]] and assisting in the administration of [[Holy Communion]], the deacon [[thurible|censes]] the [[icon]]s and people, calls the people to prayer, leads the [[ektenia|litanies]], and has a role in the dialogue of the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]]. In keeping with Eastern tradition he is not permitted to perform any [[Sacred Mysteries]] (sacraments) on his own, except for Baptism ''[[List of Latin phrases (F–O)#I|in extremis]]'' (in danger of death), conditions under which anyone, including the laity, may baptize. When assisting at a normal baptism, it is often the deacon who goes down into the water with the one being baptized ({{bibleverse||Acts|8:38|KJV}}). In contrast to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], deacons in the Eastern Churches may not preside at the celebration of marriages, as in Eastern theology the sacrament is conferred by the nuptial blessing of a priest.

Diaconal [[vestment]]s are the [[sticharion]] (dalmatic), the [[orarion]] (deacon's stole), and the [[epimanikia]] (cuffs). The last are worn under his sticharion, not over it as does a priest or bishop.  The deacon usually wears a simple orarion which is only draped over the left shoulder but, if elevated to the rank or archdeacon, he wears the &quot;doubled-orarion&quot;, meaning it is passed over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and then crossed over the left shoulder (see photograph, right).  In modern Greek practice, a deacon wears this doubled orarion from the time of his ordination.  Also, in the Greek practice, he wears the clerical [[kamilavka]] (cylindrical head covering) with a rim at the top. In Slavic practice, a [[hierodeacon]] (monastic deacon) wears the simple black kamilavka of a monk (without the rim), but he removes the monastic veil (see [[klobuk]]) when he is vested; a married deacon would not wear a kamilavka unless it is given to him by the bishop as an [[ecclesiastical award]]; the honorary kamilavka is purple in colour, and may be awarded to either married or monastic clergy.

As far as street clothing is concerned, immediately following his ordination the deacon receives a blessing to wear the ''[[Exorasson]]'' ([[Arabic]]: ''Jib'be'', [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]]: ''Riassa''), an outer cassock with wide sleeves, in addition to the ''[[Anteri]]on'' (Slavonic: ''Podraznik''), the inner cassock worn by all orders of clergy. In the Slavic practice, married clergy may wear any of a number of colours, but most often grey, while monastic clergy always wear black. In certain jurisdtictions in North America and Western Europe, a [[Roman collar]] is often worn, although this is not a traditional or widespread practice.

A ''[[protodeacon]]'' (Greek: πρωτοδιάκονος: ''protodiakonos'', &quot;first deacon&quot;) is a distinction of honor awarded to senior deacons, usually serving on the staff of the diocesan bishop. An ''[[archdeacon]]'' is similar, but is among the monastic clergy. Protodeacons and archdeacons use a double-length orarion even if it is not the local tradition for all deacons to use it. In the Slavic tradition a deacon may be awarded the doubled-orarion even if he is not a protodeacon or archdeacon.

[[File:Диакон.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of a [[Russian Orthodox]] deacon leading an [[ektenia]] (litany).]]

According to the practice of the Greek Orthodox Church of America, in keeping with the tradition of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the most common way to address a deacon is &quot;Father&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/resources/etiquette|title=Etiquette and Protocol|publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on local tradition, deacons are addressed as either &quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Father Deacon&quot;, &quot;Deacon Father&quot;, or, if addressed by a Bishop, simply as &quot;Deacon&quot;.

The tradition of kissing the hands of ordained clergymen extends to the diaconate as well.  This practice is rooted in the Holy Eucharist and is in acknowledgement and respect of the Eucharistic role members of the clergy play in preparing, handling and disbursing the divine and lifegiving body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ during the Divine Liturgy, and in building and serving the Body of Christ, His Church.

Anciently, the Eastern Churches consecrated [[deaconess]]es. This practice fell into desuetude in the second millennium, but has been revived in some churches. [[Nectarios|Saint Nectarios of Pentapolis]] consecrated a number of nuns as deaconesses in convents. Deaconesses would assist in anointing and baptising women, and in ministering to the spiritual needs of the women of the community, but would not serve within the Holy Altar. As churches discontinued consecrating women as deaconesses, these duties largely fell to the [[nuns]] and to the priests' wives.

===Anglicanism===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Richard Turnbull]] --&gt;
[[Image:Stoledeacon.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest vested as a deacon with an alb and a purple [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] over his left shoulder.]]

In Anglican churches, deacons often work directly in ministry to the marginalized inside and outside the church: the poor, the sick, the hungry, the imprisoned. Unlike Orthodox and Catholic deacons who may be married only before ordination, Anglican deacons are permitted to marry freely both before and after ordination, as are Anglican priests. Most deacons are preparing for priesthood and are usually ordained as priests about a year after their diaconal ordination. However, there are some deacons who do not go on to receive priestly ordination. Many provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]] ordain both women and men as deacons. Many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate. The effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time, as most men proceeded to be ordained priests after a short time as a deacon.

[[File:Church of England Ordination 1790.jpg|thumb|right|Certificate of Ordination as a Deacon in the Church of England given by [[Richard Terrick]], the Bishop of London, to Gideon Bostwick. February 24, 1770]]Anglican deacons may [[baptism|baptize]] and in some dioceses are granted licences to [[wedding|solemnize matrimony]], usually under the instruction of their parish priest and [[bishop]]. They commonly officiate at [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]]. Deacons are not able to preside at the [[eucharist]] (but can lead worship with the distribution of already-consecrated communion elements where this is permitted), nor can they pronounce God's absolution of sin or pronounce the Trinitiarian blessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katapi.org.uk/ChristianFaith/LXIII.htm#IV The Christian Faith: Ch 63- Ordination- (2) As a Sacrament]&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, deacons minister alongside other clergy.

An Anglican deacon wears an identical [[choir dress]] to an Anglican priest: [[cassock]], [[surplice]], [[tippet]] and [[academic regalia|academic hood]]. However, liturgically, deacons usually wear a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] over their left shoulder and fastened on the right side of their waist. This is worn both over the surplice and the [[alb]]. A deacon might also wear a [[dalmatic]].

==Deaconesses==
{{Main|Deaconess}}
The title &quot;women deacon&quot; or &quot;deaconess&quot; appears in many documents from the early Church period, particularly in the East.  Their duties were often different from that of male deacons; women deacons prepared adult women for baptism and they had a general Apostolate to female Christians and catechumens.&lt;ref&gt;John Wijngaards, ''The Tasks of Women Deacons'' url=http://www.womendeacons.org/intro/deac_tas.shtml and Duane L.C.M. Galles, ''Women Deacons - Are they Possible?'' url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CANONLAW/WOMENDEA.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Women appear to have been ordained as deacons to serve the larger community until about the 6th century in the West &lt;ref&gt;Matthew Smythe, ''Deaconesses in Late Antique Gaul'' url=http://www.womendeacons.org/history/deac_smy.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and in the East until modern times.

Liturgies for the ordination of women deacons are quite similar to those for male Deacons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last= Thurston| first= Herbert | title =Deaconesses| encyclopedia =The Catholic Encyclopedia| volume =IV| pages =| publisher =Robert Appleton Company| year =1908| location=New York| id =| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04651a.htm | accessdate =2007-06-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ancient ordination rites have been noted by groups like Womenpriests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenpriests.org/deacons/default.asp and http://www.womendeacons.org/rite/hobart.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is sometimes argued that women deacons of history were sacramentally not &quot;ordained&quot; in the full sense used in the present day in Canons 1008 and 1009 of the Code of Canon Law,&lt;ref&gt;Aimé Georges Martimort, ''Deaconesses: An Historical Study'' (Ignatius Press, 1986, ISBN 0-89870-114-7)&lt;/ref&gt; some modern scholars argue that the ordination of women deacons might have been equally sacramental to that of male deacons.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gryson, ''The Ministry of Women in the Early Church'' (Collegeville 1976, p. 120); C.Vagaggini ‘L'Ordinazione delle diaconesse nella tradizione greca e bizantina’, (''Orientalia Christiana Periodica'' 40 (1974) 145-189; here p. 188); P.

Currently, the Catholic Church has not restored women to the diaconate, although Vatican statements have declined to state that this is not possible, as they have in the case of priestly ordination. The Russian Orthodox Church had a female diaconate into the 20th century. The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece restored a monastic female &quot;diaconate&quot; in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;url=http://westernorthodoxy.org/pdf/restored.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian Church has a long history of women deacons, to the present.

== Lutheran churches ==

=== Missouri Synod (USA)===

The [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] (LC-MS) in the United States has special training and certification programs for deaconesses.  LC-MS deaconesses are trained at [[Concordia University Chicago|Concordia University - Chicago]] or one of their two seminaries ([[Concordia Seminary|St. Louis, MO]] or [[Concordia Theological Seminary|Fort Wayne, IN]]).  Internet based classes are also available through the Mission Training Center (MTC).

Deaconesses assist pastors in human care ministry and other roles with the goals of caring for those in need and freeing pastors to focus on word and sacrament ministry.  Acts chapter 6, verse 2 describes the function of deacons (servants) then and now, &quot;So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, 'It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.'&quot;

Deaconesses are installed, not ordained, and remain lay persons. The word &quot;ordain&quot; is to be reserved for the pastoral office.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Ministry: Offices, Procedures, and Nomenclature&quot; A Report of the Commission on Theology and Church Relations of The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod, September 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional Deaconess (trained at the seminaries or Concordia University-Chicago) does not ordinarily preach and only ordained pastors may administer the sacraments; although she may perform baptism in cases of emergency.

The Atlantic District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod has a Deacon Training program that prepares men and women for ministries of Word and Service in the local congregation. Students take the following courses of study at the Large Catechism level over the course of two years: Christian Doctrine Summary; Interpreting the Bible in Translation; Lutheran Worship I; OT Bible; Fundamental Pastoral Care; Basic Preaching; NT Bible; Teaching the Faith; Mission Outreach in Context; and Church History I (Christ to 1500 A.D.).

Atlantic District deacon students (male and female) who wish to seek commissioning as a Deacon in a local congregation must complete a pre-internship interview, 200 intern hours and their status as Deacon is under the authority of the local Pastoral Office.  and a post-internship interview. Students are commissioned for the local congregation According to guidelines, Deacons shall be reviewed tri-annually by the Pastoral Office and the congregational President of the local congregation where the Deacon serves. Other Districts also train laymen and laywomen for service but the nomenclature varies by District.

Deacons, both the professional Deaconesses and the congregational and District trained Deacons (male and female) are considered to hold ministries of Word and Service (as opposed to Word and Sacrament).

Some with the nomenclature of &quot;Deacon&quot; are those training for ordination, although the terms &quot;seminarian&quot; or &quot;vicar&quot; are preferred. Special exceptions may be made for these Deacons who are vicars (training to become pastors) but must be given by the appropriate District president in writing. (A vicar in the LC-MS is a third year seminarian who is doing an internship under a pastor. It should not be confused with the same term in Anglican and other church traditions.)

=== Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ===

==== Deaconess Community (ELCA/ELCIC) ====
The Deaconess Community, a community of women serving in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC) was formed in 1884.  These women, who bear the title of 'Sister', proclaim the gospel through ministries of mercy and servant leadership on behalf of both churches for the sake of the world. Since the 1970s the sisters have been allowed to marry.

==== Diaconal Ministers/Associates in Ministry (ELCA/ELCIC) ====
The diaconate was recognized and rostered by the ELCA in 1993, creating a fourth 'roster' of recognized ministers (the other three being ordained, associates in ministry, and deaconess) in the churchwide body.  The community is still young and as such is still being formed as to what styles and forms of ministry a diaconal minister pursues, as well as practices and traditions of the same.

As in the Anglican Communion, Lutheran diaconal ministers are allowed to wear a stole draped sideways from one shoulder and tied off at the waist, usually with some material left hanging below.  Diaconal ministers (the term &quot;deacon&quot; is used occasionally but not officially) are involved in preaching, assisting in worship, leading worship in lieu of an ordained pastor and other congregational duties; they are, however, primarily called to service outside the church, in fields such as campus ministry, chaplaincy, congregational ministry, counseling, social service agency work, spiritual direction, parish and community nursing and a range of other avenues. A diaconal minister is &quot;consecrated&quot;, rather than &quot;ordained&quot;. This ceremony is usually presided over by a bishop.

Also of note are the 'associates in ministry (AIM), a rostered position within the ELCA consisting of laypersons commissioned into positions of service within the church, most often as educators, musicians, and worship leaders.  While there is a trend towards combining the diaconal and associate ministries, the 'AIM' program continues in its own right, and associates are spread across the entirety of the churchwide body. AIMs are &quot;commissioned&quot; in the church and the hierarchy for service.

=== ''Porvoo'' Lutheran churches ===
The ''[[Porvoo Communion]]'' is a formally constituted union between the Anglican churches of Ireland and Great Britain and the Lutheran churches of most of the Scandinavian and Baltic states.  These Lutheran churches administer holy orders in the same threefold ministry as the Anglican Communion, with deacons ordained to their ministry.  As a result the Porvoo agreement allows for a complete freedom of exchange of ministries (of bishops and priests as well as deacons) between the Anglican and Lutheran churches who are signatories.

==Methodist churches==

=== Methodist Church of Great Britain ===
[[Methodist Church of Great Britain]] has a Permanent Diaconate, based on an understanding of the [[New Testament]] that Deacons have an equal, but distinct ministry from [[Presbyters]].&lt;ref&gt;Methodist Church web-site Deacons page http://www.methodist.org.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=churchlife.content&amp;cmid=1574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Methodist Diaconal Order web-site Two Orders of Ministry page http://www.methodistdiaconalorder.org.uk/default.asp?page=7&lt;/ref&gt; The original Wesleyan Deaconess Order was founded by Rev Thomas Bowman Stephenson in 1890, following observation of new ministries in urban areas in the previous years.&lt;ref&gt;Methodist Diaconal Order web-site history page http://www.methodistdiaconalorder.org.uk/default.asp?page=32&lt;/ref&gt; The order continued as the Wesley Deaconess Order following Methodist Union in 1932, but, following the admission of women to &quot;The Ministry&quot; (as presbyteral ministry is commonly termed in the Methodist Church), a number of Deaconesses transferred and recruitment for the WDO ceased from 1978. The 1986 Methodist Conference &lt;ref&gt;The Methodist Conference web-site http://www.methodistconference.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; re-opened The Order to both men and women and the first Ordinations to the renewed order occurred during the 1990 Conference in Cardiff, which coincided with celebrations of 100 years of diaconal service in British Methodism; deaconesses had previously been ordained at their annual [[convocation]].

===The United Methodist Church===
In U.S. Methodism, the deacon began as a transitional order before a clergy person was ordained elder. In 1996, The [[United Methodist Church]] ended the transitional deacon and established a new Order of Deacons to be equal in status with the Order of Elders. Both men and women may be ordained as deacons. Deacons serve in a variety of specialized ministries including, but not limited to, Christian education, music, communications and ministries of justice and advocacy. Unlike United Methodist elders, deacons must find their own place of service. Nevertheless, the bishop does officially approve and appoint deacons to their selected ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Deacons &amp; Diaconal Ministers, General Board of Higher Education and Ministry http://www.gbhem.org/site/c.lsKSL3POLvF/b.3589309/k.86F7/Deacons__Diaconal_Ministers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Deacons may assist the elder in the administration of Sacraments, but must receive special approval from a bishop before presiding over Baptism and Holy Communion.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church, 2008, para. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other traditions ==
Deacons are also appointed or elected in other [[Protestant]] denominations, though this is less commonly seen as a step towards the clerical ministry.  The role of deacon in these denominations varies greatly from denomination to denomination; often, there will be more emphasis on administrative duties than on pastoral or liturgical duties. In some denominations, deacons' duties are only financial management and practical aid and relief. [[Elder (religious)|Elders]] handle pastoral and other administrative duties.

=== Amish ===
The [[Amish]] have deacons, but they are elected by a council and receive no formal training.

=== Baptists ===
[[Baptists]] have traditionally followed the principle of the autonomy of the local church congregation, giving each church the ability to discern for themselves the interpretation of scripture.  Thus, the views among Baptist churches as to who becomes a deacon and when, as well as what they do and how they go about doing it, vary greatly. Baptists recognize two ordained positions in the church as Elders (Pastors) and Deacons, as per 1 Timothy, third chapter.

There are Baptist churches where the deacons decide many of the church affairs.  There are churches where deacons serve in a family ministry only.  There are Baptist churches (especially in the [[United Kingdom]], but also in the U.S. and elsewhere) where women are allowed to be deacons; while many Baptist churches would never consider allowing a woman to serve as a deacon.

One example would be the [[General Association of Regular Baptist Churches]], where deacons can be any adult male member of the congregation that is in good standing. Many African American Missionary or [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]] affiliated churches have male and female deacons serving as one board and others have two separate boards of deacons and deaconesses.  Most often the deacon or deacon candidate is a long-standing member of the church, being middle aged, but younger deacons are often members of a family that has had several generations in the same church.  They are elected by quorum vote annually. Their roles are semi-pastoral in that they fill in for the pastor on occasion, or lead a prayer service. Their main roles are to accompany the pastor during [[Eucharist|Communion]] to hand out the  remembrances of bread and wine (or grape juice) and to set a good example for others to follow.  Administrative duties sometimes include oversight of the treasury, Sunday school curriculum, transportation, and various outreach ministries.
See [[Baptist Distinctives]] for a more accurate treatment of Deacons in churches in other Associations, particularly the UK.

===Church of Scotland===
There are two distinct offices of Deacon in the [[Church of Scotland]]. The best known form of diaconate are trained, paid pastoral workers, often working in parishes with considerable social and economic deprivation. The permanent diaconate was formerly exclusively female, and it was in the centenary year of the Diaconate (1988) that men were admitted to the office of Deacon. [[Ordination of women in the Church of Scotland|Women could not be ordained as Ministers until 1968]]. The offices of Deacon and Minister are now both open to both women and men; Deacons are now ordained (they were previously &quot;commissioned&quot;).

The other office of Deacon can be found in congregations formerly belonging to the pre-1900 [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], with a &quot;Deacons' Court&quot; having responsibility for financial and administrative oversight of congregations. Only a few congregations still retain this constitutional model, with most having since adopted the Church of Scotland's &quot;Model Constitution&quot; (with a Kirk Session and Congregational Board) or &quot;Unitary Congregation&quot; (with just a Kirk Session). Most of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] congregations united with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in 1900 creating the [[United Free Church of Scotland]], which itself united with the Church of Scotland in 1929.

The congregations of the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)]] which did not join the UF Church in 1900 continue to have Deacons.

===Uniting Church in Australia===

In the [[Uniting Church in Australia]], the diaconate is one of two offices of ordained ministry. The other is Minister of the Word.

Deacons in the Uniting Church are called to minister to those on the fringes of the church and be involved in ministry in the community. A deacon is a pathfinder. They go where others have not gone before and light the way for the church to respond to where people in the community are hurting, disadvantaged and oppressed. A deacon is a community builder. Not always having congregation, they begin with scattered people and shape them into a community. A deacon is an evangelist. They share the good news of the gospel with people in the community.

Due to shortages in diaconal placements in the Uniting Church, deacons are often serving in similar or exact placements to ministers of the Word.

It is also acknowledged that both the &quot;Ministry of the Word&quot; and the &quot;Ministry of Deacon&quot; have a number of overlaps and not one particular ministry is restricted to any particular ordination.

In the Uniting Church both ministers of the word and deacons are styled ''The Reverend''.

=== Presbyterian Church (USA) ===
Individual congregations of this church denomination also ordain deacons, along with [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]s. However, in many churches the property-functions of the diaconate and session of elders is commended to an independent board of [[trustee]]s.  [[John Calvin]]'s legacy of restoring a servant-ministry diaconate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenth.org/fileadmin/files_for_download/ACTS_articles/Role_of_the_Deacon.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; lives on in the Presbyterian churches. Deacons are specially charged with ministries of mercy, especially toward the sick and the poor.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
{{main|Deacon (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
The office of Deacon is generally open to all 12- and 13-year-old male members of the church; all are encouraged to become Deacons. Duties include:
# Gather fast offerings.
# Pass the sacrament.
# Serve as the bishop’s messenger.
# Care for the grounds and physical facilities of the church.
# Assist in service projects or welfare assignments as assigned by the bishop.
# Watch over the Church and act as standing ministers (see D&amp;C 84:111).
# Be involved in missionary and reactivation efforts (see D&amp;C 20:58–59).
# Assist teachers in all their duties as needed (see D&amp;C 20:53, 57).
# Give talks in Church meetings.

=== Church of Christ ===
The role of deacons in this church is also widely varied. Generally they are put in control of various programs of a congregation.  They are servants, as the etymology indicates, of the church.  They are under the subjection of the elders, as is the rest of the congregation. Their qualifications are found in the New Testament, in 1 Timothy 3:8-13 (Waddey, John; et al. 1981).

=== New Apostolic Church ===
In the [[New Apostolic Church]], the deacon ministry is a local ministry.  A deacon mostly works in his home congregation to support the priests.  If a priest is unavailable, a deacon will hold a divine service, without the act of communion (Only Priests and up can consecrate Holy Communion).

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===
Deacons among [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are referred to as [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Ministerial servants|ministerial servants]], claiming it preferable to translate the descriptive Greek term used in the Bible rather than merely transliterate it as though it were a title.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Questions From Readers&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1962, page 383-384, &quot;The religious words or titles 'bishop' and 'deacon' are simply words that have been more or less closely transliterated into the English language; that is, they are carried over much like the way they appear in the Greek instead of being translated. These two words are ''epískopos'' and ''diákonos''. ...However, at an early time the apostate church made titles out of these designations and applied them to men who held positions...known as 'bishops' and 'deacons'. ...New World Translation as well as certain others, such as An American Translation, do not render ''epískopos'' and ''diákonos'' as titles but according to the meaning of the words, as 'overseers' or 'superintendents' and as 'assistants' or 'ministerial servants'.&quot; [emhasis retained from original]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed ministerial servants aid [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] in congregational duties. Like the elders, they are adult baptized males&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Those 'Acquiring a Fine Standing'&quot;, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1978, page 1, &quot;The Bible sets high standards for a ministerial servant. (1 Tim. 3:8-10, 12) Brothers recommended should clearly be meeting these. Becoming a ministerial servant is no routine thing; it is not as if almost every adult, baptized male should have the position as a sort of titleholder. Ministerial servants should be exemplary, spiritual men.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and serve voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Congregations for Building Up in Love and Unity&quot;, ''Doing God’s Will '', ©1986 Watch Tower, page 12, &quot;As in the first century, so today, qualified, mature, and experienced Christian men are designated as elders, or overseers [among Jehovah's Witnesses]. These supervise the congregation and look after its spiritual needs. They are assisted by other faithful men known as ministerial servants. These men receive no salary or other financial benefit but serve voluntarily, meeting their own expenses&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognates ==
The Greek word ''diakonos'' (διάκονος) gave rise to the following terms from the history of [[Russia]], not to be confused with each other: ''&quot;[[dyak (clerk)|dyak]]&quot;'', ''&quot;[[podyachy]]&quot;'', ''&quot;[[dyachok]]&quot;'', in addition to &quot;deacon&quot; and &quot;[[protodeacon]]&quot;.

==Scots usage==
In [[Scots language]], the title ''deacon'' is used for a head-workman, a master or chairman of a trade [[guild]], or one who is adept, expert and proficient. The term ''deaconry'' refers to the office of a ''deacon'' or the trade guild under a ''deacon.

The most famous holder of this title was [[William Brodie|Deacon Brodie]] who was a cabinet-maker and president of the Incorporation of Wrights and Masons as well as being a [[Burgh]] councillor of [[Edinburgh]], but at night led a double life as a [[burglar]]. He is thought to have inspired the story of ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''.
