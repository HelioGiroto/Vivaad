== Catholic Church name ==

This article should be rename Roman Catholic Church as to comply with the need to show that the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] (and others) also teaches [[Four_Marks_of_the_Church#Catholic|Catholicism]] even if churches seem to diverge in the meaning of Catholic, see [[History of the term Catholic]].

I've been writing a Wikibook covering history and this seems a disservice to historic facts and bring unnecessary confusion.  [[Special:Contributions/79.168.0.22|79.168.0.22]] ([[User talk:79.168.0.22|talk]]) 02:57, 10 September 2012 (UTC)
:See previous discussions.  This issue has been talked about extensively in the past.  The fact that the eastern Churches also teach the four marks of the church is really just plain irrelevant.  &quot;Catholic Church&quot; is the most common name used to refer to this entity.  It is also their official name.  There's really nothing more to it.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 03:34, 10 September 2012 (UTC)
::The only thing that might revive this within-Wikipedia issue from the coma it is in and in which it is better to leave it is the posting of statements on the lines of &quot;It is also their (the Church's) official name&quot;, which sounds somewhat like a claim that it is the Church's ''only'' official name.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 06:47, 10 September 2012 (UTC)
:::There is no clear evidence I know of which supports the claim that &quot;Catholic Church&quot; or any other name is somehow the only &quot;official&quot; name.  It is certainly the usual name by which the church now refers to itself but that is not the same thing.  If there is such a thing as an &quot;official name&quot; it is probably something such as &quot;Holy Catholic and Roman Church&quot;. We really don't need to open this issue again in any case. [[User:Anglicanus|Anglicanus]] ([[User talk:Anglicanus|talk]]) 08:48, 10 September 2012 (UTC)
::::The Roman Catholic Church is similar but different that the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] or the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church.  The primary differences if that the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church does not recognize the Pope as the leader of their Church.  To the Eastern Church he is one of many bishops.  This is what caused the great [[Schism (religion)|Schism]]  The word Catholic in both religions is confusing but they are similar but different religions altogether.  Please see detailed explanation at [[Talk:Sacraments of the Catholic Church]] Section: Two similar but different Religions.

== Sexuality and Gender Issues Rewrite ==

I propose editing the language on Humanae Vitae to read:&lt;br /&gt;
{{quote |The Church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a married man and woman, and should be without the use artificial birth control or contraception.  In his encyclical Humanae Vitae[174] (1968), Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all artificial contraception as contrary to both the procreative purpose and total self gift of sexual intercourse. Instead, he encouraged the regulation of births by means of natural family planning, which remains open to procreation through periodic abstinence, limiting intercourse to naturally infertile times.  This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a &quot;culture of death&quot; and calling instead for a &quot;culture of life&quot;.[175]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
Immediately following the promulgation of Humanae Vitae, dissenting theologians vociferously argued that the birth control pill, prohibited by Pope Paul VII, should be considered a morally justifiable method of contraception. }}

I would like to hear how other editors feel about such an edit and would love to hear any improvements that are suggested. I think the text that I am proposing has the advantages of being more clear and more specific. [[User:wikiCatholicIndiana|wikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:wikiCatholicIndiana|talk]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 22:10, 12 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Since there appear to be no objections, I will go ahead and make the edit. I'm still open to discussing this edit with anyone who is interested, though[[User:wikiCatholicIndiana|wikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:wikiCatholicIndiana|talk]])

:The text you are proposing does not seem neutral to me and the additional paragraph is not supported ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 18:18, 13 September 2012 (UTC)
::I agree that the second paragraph is badly done. I was trying to find a way to include some information from the existing text without creating pronoun confusion, since there is a sentance that reads &quot;This teaching was continued especially by Pope John Paul II.&quot; The word &quot;this&quot; could mean the Pope's teaching, or the dissent, depending on how it was read. I figured it was easier to move it to another paragraph. But I agree it was tacky. I'll oblige and simply drop the language. Are there other non-neutral wordings in here? I don't see how that could be.  [[User:wikiCatholicIndiana|wikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:wikiCatholicIndiana|talk]])
:::The current wording is fine. ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 18:36, 13 September 2012 (UTC)
::::Two problems with the proposed paragraphs. First, it needs to be folded up in terms of &quot;the Church teaches...&quot; or &quot;Catholics believe...&quot; rather than stating it as fact in Wikipedia's voice. This is to comply with [[WP:NPOV]]. Also an NPOV concern is wording such as &quot;dissenting theologians&quot; and &quot;vociferously argued&quot;. If it is not reported that way in [[WP:RS|reliable secondary sources]] then we can't insert an intense term like vociferous. [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 21:30, 21 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::How does this look then:&lt;br /&gt;{{quote |The Church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a married man and woman, and should be without the use artificial birth control or contraception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae[174] (1968), Pope Paul VI taught that artificial contraception is contrary to both the procreative purpose and total self gift of sexual intercourse.

::::::That looks good. Are critical responses to the Churches teachings found in an adjacent paragraph? [[User:Majoreditor|Majoreditor]] ([[User talk:Majoreditor|talk]]) 19:40, 22 September 2012 (UTC)
::::::::Its an improvement, but it doesn't reflect the controversy.  As far as I am aware its not been declared by the Pope &quot;de fide&quot; and teaching varies in practice on birth control.  Confusing the issue of birth control with issues of homosexuality  also seems wrong.  Not that both don't need to be handled, but they should be separate.  The birth control issue was and is a major one.  Its various controversies are at least in part reflected in the present wording.  ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 04:56, 23 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::The controversy? You are confusing what individual Catholics believe vs. what the Church actually teaches. There is no controversy whatsoever within the actual magisterium of the church over the birth control issue, and never has been. There should be no controversy implied in the wording of the birth control section, because the teaching of the church on this matter is definitive, consistent, and final. While there has not been any Extraordinary Magisterium teaching on the birth control issue, in the form of an ex-cathedra statement, there is an overwhelming amount of Ordinary Magisterium supporting this teaching. To see the constancy of the Church's stance, look no further than Humanae Vitae, Evangelium Vitae, and The Catechism of the Catholic Church, particularly CCC 2370. I challenge you to find any Church document that in any way contradicts these statements or in any way backs up your assertion that there is a controversy within the Church over this teaching.  The controversy that does exist is between individual Catholics as to whether they think the church teaching should be followed, but not in regards to what the church teaching actually is. A paragraph discussing the reaction of dissenting theologians or commissions or individual bishops, none of which have any authority over what the church teaches, and is clear in that regard, would be fine.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:WikiCatholicIndiana|WikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:WikiCatholicIndiana|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/WikiCatholicIndiana|contribs]]) 19:06, 24 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::::::::::Correct - the controversy is ''outside'' the Church, not within it. And the Pope doesn't have to declare everything to make it doctrine requiring assent of faith and submission of intellect. See [[Magisterium]]. [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 19:17, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
{{od}}At the time it came out it was controversial and remained so with individual teaching allowing birth control.  From the statements above WikiCatholicIndian is taking a somewhat doctrinaire (sic) and highly centralised view of the teaching of the Church.  Apologia is not the function of Wikipedia ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 08:41, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
:Well, if you disagree with '''WikiCatholicIndian''', I invite you '''Snowded''' to find sources stating a different teaching for the Church. Remember that WP is all about sources. '''WikiCatholicIndian''' has his, where are yours stating that there is actually internal controversy due to conflicting opinions within the Church as to its teachings? If you can't find them, then the controversy is external to the Church, and has no place in this article.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 09:11, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
::Well even in 1965 over 50% of Catholics did not following the teaching, and it is not a matter pertaining to the faith.  But that is not the point really.  I am not wanting to insert text,  I am happy with the existing wording and I don't see WikiCatholicIndian making a good case for change.  ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 09:58, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
:::The problem is that &quot;thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception&quot; is an opinion. There are no sources that there are dissenting voices in the magisterium of the Church. The Church is pretty clear in what it teaches. I agree with the new wording, since WikiCatholicIndian is removing unsourced opinions. If not, we can put a tag asking for sources and delete the sentence later when none appears, following WP criteria. This might not be a matter of faith, but it is of moral, which are also part of the Official Magisterium, even if Catholics in the West (yes, in the West, since in the rest of the World they are followed, or if not, those who don't are aware they are going against Magisterium) does not agree with them.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 13:26, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
::::The Church's teaching is the Church's teaching whether or not it is followed by people inside or outside the Church, whether or not it is agreed with by people inside or outside the Church.  The Church's teaching is the Church's teaching also regardless of the manner in which it has been expressed.  Opinions may differ about what is the teaching of ''Christianity'', but the teaching of ''the Catholic Church'' is unequivocal.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 13:41, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::Well the original encyclical arose as a result of dissent and disagreement. Remember the article is reporting the history.   People argued that the pill was a form of regulation not birth control, hence the commission and then the Pope made a call.  A simple web search will get that but I would be surprised if anyone questioned it anyway. Esoglou, I think you have a very narrow definition of the Church's teaching.  To confine that the Magisterium is bad doctrine  ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 13:46, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
::::::1. As per most official positions in the Church (i.e. Creed (belief), Mass (practice), Abortion (moral)), there were several positions within the Church (not for abortion, but then again ask Biden and Kerry (just as an example, not to be political) that are Catholic that disagree with the Church on this) and the Magisterium (today or the Councils when in function) determines what is the correct belief or practice, as in this matter.
::::::2. This is not &quot;History&quot; but &quot;Contemporary issues.&quot; The official position of the Church is stated, and then well-sourced disagreements with the official position of the Church are stated, again, disagreements with the teachings or practices of the Church, since those are clearly stated.
::::::3. There is within the Church's body a large diversity of matters of theology and practice, where several, sometimes contradictory, positions are held, none being condemned or supported officially by Church. In these cases, a Catholic person can hold the position that finds most convincing or coherent with Christ's teachings. There are other matters, such as the one in question, where the Church's Magisterium has been determined. That's the Church's official teaching until the time comes when it changes, officially. Snowded, your critic of Esoglou is unfounded.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 14:44, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
::::::::I'm really not sure what this has to do with the question to be honest.  The article makes a historical reference and is as far as I am concerned uses a better form of words than the new one proposed.  Humanae Vitae took place in a specific historical context (the 1965 book ''The Time has Come'' for example) and that cannot be ignored.  Your statement that &quot;thus contradicting ...&quot; is an opinion is simply not true.  The question was controversial per my comments above.   While I am happy to discuss issues of Church Authority (and my criticism of Esoglou is not unfounded by the way) its not especially significant.  As to asking Binden and Kerry I think you illustrate the problem here.  Tthe debate seems to be is coming from the manachian culture that goes with any discussion of religion in the US, along with some ideas of authority which are strange to say the least.   ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 14:56, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::&quot;The original encyclical arose as a result of dissent and disagreement.&quot;  So what?  The proposed text begins: &quot;The Church teaches that ...&quot;  Do you think the Church teaches the opposite?!  Or do you think that whatever idea, agreeing or disagreeing, assenting or dissenting, sensible or crazy, some member of the Church ever expressed or now expresses can be called what the Church itself teaches?!!!  Surely not.  You speak of &quot;dissent&quot;: dissent from what, if not from the Church's teaching?  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 15:34, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
::::::::::Exactly, instead of writing an encyclopaedic piece about the development of the subject, setting the historical context, the proposed text jumps straight into &quot;the Church teaches ...&quot;.  Its an unnecessary change.

:::::::::::It should not be hard at all to source statements about the vast majority of rank-and-file Catholics disagreeing with teaching on artificial birth control. It is certainly an oft-quoted statistic today, in light of the [[Contraceptive mandate|HHS Mandate]], that &quot;98% of married Catholics are using ABC.&quot; This sad and sorry situation comes about from over forty years of inaction on the part of the Church hierarchy after the advent of ''Humanae Vitae'', because it was seen as an unpopular and rather inconvenient teaching. The Church and her teaching authority are united and unequivocal in the facts: ABC is grave matter and an intrinsic evil. The Catholic people are divided and muddled in their reply: we will use it anyway if we feel like it. Again, sources should definitely not be hard to come by to document these assertions, but it must be clear that while the Church has heretofore been relatively silent, she has not reversed or quashed her teaching, which has been the same all along.

::::::::::::Not really, it was genuinely open which way the Church would fall after it commissioned that enquiry which lead to Humanaw Vitae, neither is opposition confined to rank and file not was it.  The point is that Church Doctrine and teaching has adapted to events in the world, Catholicism unlike Protestantism is not solely dependent on a single point or revelation, justification by works etc. etc. etc.   In writing the article we need to set the context which the current text does.  We should not just be repeating what the Church through the Magisterium promulgates. ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 17:43, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::::::The existing wording impies, as Snowded himself suggested, that there is a controversy within the Magisterium of the church regarding the stance on birth control, and that its morality is an open question within Catholic theology. That is not true. The current wording is misleading and should be changed to my text, or another text that is unambiguous on the Church's constant moral teaching. Another issue I will bring up is that the current text makes it sound like outlawing ABC was a &quot;big idea&quot; of Pope Paul VI. The reality is that the Church has not permitted birth control at any point in her 2,000 year history, and even opposed primitive forms of birth control back during Roman times. It is important that we replace the current text with an unambiguous text that is clear on the Catholic Church's unchanging and final teaching on the issue. The current text sounds like it was intentionally obscured by a Catholic who didn't want to have to deal with following the Church's teachings.[[User:wikiCatholicIndiana|wikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:wikiCatholicIndiana|talk]])
{{od}}No it doesn't imply that it simply states what the position was at the time.  You are sounding more and more like you want to write this article from a rather narrow and polemical perspective.

:[http://www.catholic.com/tracts/birth-control Here is a tract from Catholic Answers] explaining the Church's historical teaching on ABC. I would argue for its validity as [[WP:RS|a reliable secondary source]]. Catholic Answers is well-known and respected for its editorial oversight and fact-checking. It seems to me that the facts are clear: the Christian Church, from its roots in Old Testament times, through the Apostolic and Patristic Ages, through the Protestant Reformation, has always condemned ABC. It was not until 1930 when the Anglican Communion started a break in the dam. I do not see evidence here of an &quot;open question&quot;, I do not see evidence of &quot;controversy&quot; within the Church or even ecclesial communities; while there may have been much push-back from the faithful of all kinds throughout history, what sin or heresy can you say has not enjoyed its supporters? Again, if there has been historical rebellion from people in the pews, then that should be easy to document. But I contend that this has been a settled question in the Catholic Church since ancient times. Ecumenical councils and papal encyclicals are often used just as much to reiterate an orthodox teaching and quash stirring heresies as they are to develop doctrine. I contend that ''Humanae Vitae'' was issued merely to repeat the same old, same old teaching that the Church has held for thousands of years, in the face of new questions such as the hormonal pill and the latex condom.

:::No, but it is a place for neutrally reporting the facts, which I have given you, backed up by a reliable source; I have nowhere suggested that we use my own verbiage for wording in the article. I am merely requiring that all factual assertions in the article be accompanied by a source. You want to include &quot;controversy&quot; and &quot;dissent&quot; as part of the context - that is fine, please provide your reliable sources to document such, and I will welcome that point of view. What me and WCI are contending against you is that there is some sort of disagreement among bishops or popes in the hierarchy of the Magisterium; you may possibly find scattered voices of dissent among the liberal episcopate, but you will not find valid dissent in Church teaching; the Magisterium does not dissent with itself. You seem to be taking the position or point of view that the Church is some kind of democracy, but that is not the Catholic Church. The Church interprets faith and morals for the people, who listen and obey because of her authority. The primary objective of this article is to document Catholic belief. There are separate articles to document controversy and criticism; although notable controversy would not be unwelcome to this article due to the principle of [[WP:NPOV]]. But if we are to document Catholic belief, we must say that ABC is considered grave sin. To believe otherwise is not Catholic belief, it is dissent. There has never been a doubt or controversy by the teaching authority of the Church. The dissent is wholly in the minds of the faithful. Many teenage boys believe masturbation is OK, that doesn't affect Catholic belief in the matter. [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 19:25, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
::::And if we were agreed that the paragraph in question should start off with &quot;The Church teaches ....&quot; then you would have a point.   However the position of the church in this respect takes place in a historical context.  Humanae Vitae made a statement in a context where people with the Church were advocating that the Pill was a method of regulation not birth control (i have give you a reference for that).  The article reflects that, your proposed amendment would switch the tone to one of advocacy.  At no stage have I taken the position that the Church is a democracy, I have argued that you can't confine the position of the Church to that of the Magisterial and your continued use of phrases like &quot;considered grave sin&quot; and &quot;listen and obey because of her authority&quot; further confirms me in my view that you are trying to shift the article to one of advocacy of a rather conservative perspective.   ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:36, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::Then for Heaven's sake just add the source! I am trying to effect no such shift. The current wording is perfectly fine with me. There is just no source for the assertion about &quot;dissenters&quot;. That's my only problem with it. Contentious information likely to be challenged requires a reliable secondary source.

::::::If you had made that clear life would have been easier.  There are a range of sources.  Remember that the Pontifical Study Commission on Family, Population and Birth Problems, set up by John XXIII had a majority that was pro pill and a minority was against (it was leaked). It said for example &quot;it is impossible to determine exhaustively by a general judgement and ahead of time for each individual case what these objective criteria will demand in the concrete situation of a couple&quot;.  The world expected teaching to change, but after three years Paul VI supported the minority.   Rock's book ''The Time has Come'' advocated the control position.  von Hildebrand said procreation might be the purpose of sex. but love was its meaning.  The Dutch Hierarchy wanted the use of the pill to be considered in a broader context.  Pyle's ''The Pill and Birth Regulation'' and ''The Pope and the Pill'' have examples as I remember it.  I don't really see the need for citation here as there is little doubt about the controversy, but that might be my age showing.  If you really want a reference the Pyle book would probably do it. ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 20:05, 25 September 2012 (UTC)
::::::: I am guilty of not being clear enough also. I see no problem documenting the oposition of the faithful. My concern is that the existing text is ambiguous. The phrase &quot;Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all artificial contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning&quot; seems to put the Pope and the unnamed dissenters on equal ground as to who is in charge of church teaching, and the section on natural family planning starting with &quot;though he permitted&quot; makes it sound like the nfp issue was a compromise between him and the dissenters. Using the sources suggested by Elizium23 and Snowded, I propose giving complete context and removing all ambiguity. A rough draft would look like: {{quote | The Church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a married man and woman, and should be without the use artificial birth control or contraception. Soon after the close of the Second Vatican Council, Church teachings about sexuality became an issue of increasing controversy due to changing cultural attitudes in the [[Western world]] (see the [[Sexual Revolution]]).]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Catholic Church has always taught that any form of artificial birth control is contrary to what it considers to be the divinely created purpose of sexual intercourse, and is thus a grave sin. During Roman times, the Catholic Church opposed the primitive forms of birth control that existed then. As Chritian Churches boke away from the Catholic Church, all continued to hold to the position of the Catholic Church on this issue. During the 20th Century, attitudes on birth control began to change, and in the 1930s the Anglican Church became the first Christian denomination to allow the use of it. As more Christian denominations began to change thier teaching on the issue, pressure grew on the Catholic Church to consider altering its teaching as well. Catholic theologians began considering if the newly invented [[birth control pill]] could be morally justified. The Pontifical Study Commission on Family, Population and Birth Problems recommended to the Pope that Catholics be allowed to use the pill, and a Dutch Synod of Bishops suggested that the issue be studied.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his encyclical Humanae Vitae[174] (1968), Pope Paul VI upheld the Catholic teaching that artificial contraception is contrary to both the procreative purpose and total self gift of sexual intercourse. Instead, he encouraged the regulation of births by means of natural family planning, which remains open to procreation through periodic abstinence, limiting intercourse to naturally infertile times. Pope John Paul II expanded on these teachings in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a &quot;culture of death&quot; and calling instead for a &quot;culture of life&quot;.[175]}}[[User:wikiCatholicIndiana|wikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:wikiCatholicIndiana|talk]])

::::::::Given that the current wording says that Paul VI ''rejected'' and ''contradicted'' I don't see how you can say it implies ''equal ground''.  Providing a richer context would be better, but you seem intent on arguing for the article to adopt a particular conservative position.  Uses of phrases like ''Western World'' for example ignore the influence of Aggiornamento on and by Latin America where change was more all encompassing in its vision before the suppression of the Mendellin Conference, there were also movements in African and the Philippines.

{{od}}I agree with the last wording offered. Snowded, when will you be happy? The new wording has the historical perspective (giving context as you requested) and it mentions the controversy (as you requested). Your words &quot;the article to adopt a particular conservative position&quot; is your opinion. The Catholic Church position is what is. The Church is not concerned that its sexual morality position aligns with conservatism, nor it is concerned that its social morality position aligns with liberalism. Your comments show your disagreement with the Church's &quot;conservative&quot; position, but if the wording seems absolutist, it is because the Church's teaching are absolute, and by that, I mean unambiguous. The Church can either teach that contraception is allow, or it can teach it isn't. NEWS FLASH, it isn't. That's it. Now, WCI seems to be doing your job on this. It wasn't up to him to offered wording to reflect your view. If you disagree so much with the last wording, please, let's end this, offer your own wording, and let us agree on it.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 07:16, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
It is pretty clear that the current wording is not acceptable for lack of sources and for its ambiguity in its reflecting the Church's position. So, let's work on it.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 07:17, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
:I will not be happy as long as editors attempt to make this section of the article reflect a conservative position (which includes your 'absolute' statement by the way) within the Church.  Its needs to properly set the historical context and not have all the apologia of WCI's last draft.  If you want an illustration of the problem look at what s/he is trying to say, the narrative thread tells a story of unchanging views over different historical contexts.  I know that is the conservative position within the Church (as are your statements on absolutism), but its not NPOV.   As to wording, I think the current wording is fine, its the two of you who want to change it, and for the worse as far as I can see.  I'm happy to insert a reference for the contradictory aspect if anyone really thinks that is an issue. 

:I also note that this is an important section of the article.  Paul VI in effect turned his back on ''Aggiornamento'' with the encyclical, and that combined with the suppression of the Mendelin conference by the last two Popes (the latest in a former role) produced the focus on sexual practice which characterises much of the debate even since.  So the way it is portrayed, as a key turning point in the history of the Church, is critical.  ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 07:33, 26 September 2012 (UTC)
::There is no conservative position. The Church teaches ABC are not allow. You don't agree. Many don't agree. Fine! Nevertheless, there is only one position in the teachings of the Church. As for the current wording, let's see it.
::''Pope [[Paul VI]] firmly rejected all artificial contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the [[birth control pill]] as an ethically justifiable method of contraception...'' Excuse me, but the Pope doesn't contradicts dissenters. The Pope states the position of the Church. Dissenters disagree with the Pope. This first sentenced is ambiguous. Dissenters believe ABC are ethically justifiable method of contraception? Well, the Pope said they are not. Dissenters are free to dissent, are free to disagree, but they disagree with the position of the Church, which hasn't changed in 2000 years. This first sentence is ambiguous and needs new wording.
::''... though he permitted the regulation of births by means of [[natural family planning]].'' &quot;Though?&quot; This sentence weighs the Pope statements against the dissenters. It should be the opposite, it should weigh the dissenter's position against the Church.
::''This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a &quot;culture of death&quot; and calling instead for a &quot;culture of life.'' Yes, first Paul VI, then JP II and then Benedict XVI. All three Popes have stated the official teaching of the Church. Is this conservatism? That's your opinion.

::You say &quot;''its needs to properly set the historical context and not have all the apologia of WCI's last draft... the narrative thread tells a story of unchanging views over different historical contexts''&quot; Yes, can you find a source that cites the Church's teachings as being different? I am not speaking about a theologian or priest. I am talking about somewhere or sometime in history where the Church has approved of ABC. The position of the Church has never changed and there is plenty of sourcing in that regard.
::You say &quot;''I know that is the conservative position within the Church (as are your statements on absolutism), but its not NPOV.''&quot; &quot;Conservative position?&quot; Again, history and the documents of the Church are against you in this one. You claim NPOV. What would be NPOV in this regard? Misrepresenting the teachings of the Church? Giving undue weight to the opinion of dissenters? WP is an encyclopedia and should state the position of the Church. This is what all of this is about. Here are three WP editors, two with plenty of history in WP, telling you that the current wording is NOT fine, it isn't.
::You say the Pope turned his back on &quot;aggiornamento.&quot; That is also an opinion, so I won't comment.
::You mentioned several times the Medellín Sinod. Have you read its documents? I have and you shouldn't be using it in your arguments since it took place after &quot;Humanae Vitae&quot; and it supports its opinion &quot;''La enseñanza del Magisterio en la Encíclica es clara e inequívoca sobre la exclusión de los medios artificiales para hacer voluntariamente infecundo el acto conyugal''&quot; (Medellín, 11a). [In English: The teaching of the Magisterium in the encyclical is clear and unambiguous about the exclusion of artificial means to make the marriage act infecund.] Moreover, Medellín was a Latin American council, and its decisions were never uninversal. BTW, in 1989 CELAM said: &quot;''El liberalismo sexual va ganando foros de legitimidad. Ya nadie parece sentirse preocupado por los problemas que hasta pocas décadas tenían un tratamiento privileagiado: masturbación, relaciones pre-matrimoniales y promiscuas, contraceptivos de todo tipo, aborto, homosexualismo, divorcio, agrupamientos conyugales sin ningún vínculo, familias simultáneas, etc.''&quot; In good Spanish, it critizices all types of contraception. So, I ask again. Where is the dissenting voice in the teachings of the Church?
::You say &quot;''... produced the focus on sexual practice which characterises much of the debate even since.  So the way it is portrayed, as a key turning point in the history of the Church, is critical''.&quot; If for you, a turning point in the History of the Church is its position on sexual morality, let's agree to disagree on this.

::So, we have wording that needs to be changed and we have you to make sure the new wording doesn't portray a &quot;conservative&quot; view. Please, I ask again, help us find a better wording.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 08:44, 26 September 2012 (UTC)

:::I really don't think you are reading what is being said here.  The current wording does not need to be changed in my view.  One other editor is happy with it if a reference is added and two of you want to change it.

Oh and I'm an experienced editor as well, and seem to have more knowledge/experience of the period in question than you do.

::::This is your response? Coquidragon raises serious issues with the text, and your response is that you are also an experienced editor? We understand completely that you want the wording kept the same. We disagree. Significant issues have been raised with the text, which you have either not addressed or not addressed adequately to convince the other editors that the existing text is ideal. Let's review some of the problems that I see with the existing text:
:::::1. The article implies that Pope Paul VI was the first Catholic ever to teach that ABC was immoral. The reality is that this has always been the official position of the Catholic Church. The text should read &quot;Pope Paul VI upheld the Catholic teaching that artificial contraception is contrary...&quot; rather than &quot;Pope Paul VI rejected...&quot; because although both are accurate, the first avoids any implication that the Pope invented this teaching in the 1960s. When you talk about the fact that historical perspective is missing, I find it strange that you only want to include the historical perspective of individual Catholics opposing Church teaching, leaving out the historical perspective of the actual church teaching. 
:::::2. &quot;though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning&quot; could be understood as pejorative. It makes it sound like the Pope doesn't really like nfp much either, but he is willing to look the other way. Perhaps I am he only person that reads it this way, but don't you think using positive language such as is done in my proposed text is clearer and free of ambiguity? &quot;Instead, he encouraged the regulation of births by means of natural family planning.&quot; Isn't that better?
:::::3. If you want historical context, it's impossible to do that in a sentence fragment that is sandwiched between two other sentence fragments discussing actual Church teaching. Let's examine just how badly this sentence is constructed, and how it confuses the pronouns in the following sentence: &quot;Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all artificial contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning. This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II.&quot; We have the first phrase representing Church teaching, then the second phrase documenting the opposition to that teaching, and then the third phrase goes back to talking about the Church teaching. To properly provide context and remove ambiguity, we should cut up this run on sentence and make the parts that go together stay together, and make the parts that don't go together into their own sentence. I've actually expanded the context in my proposed wording, giving several sentences to documenting the opposition. What more do you want?  As far as I can tell, you want to keep the Church teaching on birth control ambiguous. To add insult to injury, the exiting text begins the following sentence with the words &quot;This teaching.&quot; It is unclear what the word &quot;this&quot; refers to-the teaching of the Pope, the teaching of the dissenters, or just the teaching about nfp.
:::::4. This one can't be said better than it's been said already: &quot;the Pope doesn't contradicts dissenters. The Pope states the position of the Church. Dissenters disagree with the Pope. This first sentence is ambiguous. Dissenters believe ABC is ethically justifiable method of contraception? Well, the Pope said they are not. Dissenters are free to dissent, are free to disagree, but they disagree with the position of the Church, which hasn't changed in 2000 years. This first sentence is ambiguous and needs new wording.&quot;
::::If you have a better idea for how to rectify the ambiguity, I would love to hear it. Although the existing text could be better than my text, let's not settle for good enough. Let's create a text that removes that ambiguity and is unbiased. I suggest that my proposed text does exactlty that, and if you can do better, I would love to see you do so.

===Arbitrary break===
OK lets go through your points.
#I am not sure I agree with your interpretation of the article, but we can insert something to say that he (contrary to expectations) asserted the position of Pius xii over the recommendations of the Commission set up by John.  Your wider assertion is more questionable, you are asserting a historical perspective which is not referenced and anyway doesn't handle the context of the pill.  It only needs a couple of sentences and that can be referenced.
#I don't see how its pejorative to clearly state his position, it was after all important that he did not forbid regulation of birth.  Some might argue it makes his position a little silly, but that is a matter of opinion, we need to report what he said.
# See my suggestion on 1, lets make it simple
#The Pope can contradict people as well as any other person and here he contradicted a commission set up by his predecessor (who would have almost certainly followed its recommendations).  The Pope has to declare he is speaking de fide for it to bind the faithful.  Historically the role of the pope has flluctuated, as has the authority of the teaching orders, the magisterial etc. etc.  Its not the simplistic dictatorship you imply.
So, my suggestion is a simple amendment to reference his asserting the position of Pius and some possible stylistic changes.  Keep it simple, keep it factual, let people form their own conclusions----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 09:46, 29 September 2012 (UTC)
:What commission did John XXIII set up?  Excuse my ignorance.  As far as I can tell without having researched the matter, Paul VI himself, not John XXIII, set up an advisory study commission, without power of decision, whose majority opinion he did not accept (there was a majority and a minority report).  Is this the commission you mean?  And on what grounds do you say that the faithful are in no way bound by what is called the ordinary magisterium?  Can you cite any teaching ''of the church'' (not merely of individuals within the church, before or after Paul VI's encyclical) that contradicts that encyclical?  I'm sorry I don't understand you.

:::The commission was established by John XXIII and then enlarged by Paul VI.

::People should not be left to draw their own conclusions over what church teaching is. The article should be unambiguous in regards to what the Church teaches, be it considered liberal, conservative, or something else. The article should provide historical context so that readers can see that this teaching has been consistent throughout the Church's 2000 year history, not an invention from the 1960s. Before you point out commissions and synods of bishops to prove that the teaching has not been consistent, let me mention that such opinions mean absolutely nothing in regards to Church teaching unless they are promulgated in a document from the Magesterium of the Catholic Church. This is an article about the Catholic Church, not about Catholics. The primary purpose of this article should be to plainly state facts about the Church. While occasional editorial remarks about people's opinions in regard to the Catholic Church are appropriate, particularly in the Contemporary Issues section, the article should not be unduly obscured by them. There is no controversy in the Church Magesterium over this teaching, and never has been, and the article should be clear on that matter. I again propose my own text as a replacement for what currently stands. I would be interested in hearing the specific criticisms of other editors in addition to Snowded on it. Snowded, if you feel that I have left out too much context, there is a clearly written context section starting with &quot;During the 20th Century...&quot;. Simply propose a revision to add the context you feel has been left out.[[User:wikiCatholicIndiana|wikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:wikiCatholicIndiana|talk]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 01:50, 30 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

{{quote | The Church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a married man and woman, and should be without the use artificial birth control or contraception. Soon after the close of the Second Vatican Council, Church teachings about sexuality became an issue of increasing controversy due to changing cultural attitudes during the [[Sexual Revolution]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Catholic Church has always taught that any form of artificial birth control is contrary to what it considers to be the divinely created purpose of sexual intercourse, and is thus a grave sin. During Roman times, the Catholic Church opposed the primitive forms of birth control that existed then. As Chritian Churches boke away from the Catholic Church, all continued to hold to the position of the Catholic Church on this issue. During the 20th Century, attitudes on birth control began to change, and in the 1930s the Anglican Church became the first Christian denomination to allow the use of it. As more Christian denominations began to change thier teaching on the issue, pressure grew on the Catholic Church to consider altering its teaching as well. Catholic theologians began considering if the newly invented [[birth control pill]] could be morally justified. The Pontifical Study Commission on Family, Population and Birth Problems recommended to the Pope that Catholics be allowed to use the pill, and a Dutch Synod of Bishops suggested that the issue be studied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his encyclical Humanae Vitae[174] (1968), Pope Paul VI upheld the Catholic teaching that artificial contraception is contrary to both the procreative purpose and total self gift of sexual intercourse. Instead, he encouraged the regulation of births by means of natural family planning, which remains open to procreation through periodic abstinence, limiting intercourse to naturally infertile times. Pope John Paul II expanded on these teachings in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a &quot;culture of death&quot; and calling instead for a &quot;culture of life&quot;.[175]}}[[User:wikiCatholicIndiana|wikiCatholicIndiana]] ([[User talk:wikiCatholicIndiana|talk]])

:I'm sorry, but a lot of this reeks of aplogetics, and was undoubtedly drawn from apologetic sources that would fail [[WP:RS]].  The idea that the church always believed artificial birth control is wrong is suspect. For very practical reasons, it was a non-issue until the mid-20th century, and not settled until Humanae vitae. You're going to need top-notch academic sources for any history prior to that time. Not mentioning that the decision is wildly unpopular among Catholics and very widely rejected by the faithful is a major omission. Sorry, but you've taken a fundamentally flawed approach to writing the section by basing it on the apologetic literature you have read, rather than on what reliable independent scholarly sources say. My best advice is to limit your reading to high-quality scholarly sources, and base your proposed changes on them. You have to accept the fact that apologetic sources (whether for Catholicism or for any other religious movement) are held in extremely high disregard in the real world because of their inherently self-serving nature, and cannot pass muster as reliable sources here on WP. You also seem to have lost sight of the fact that we describe the church and its teachings not on how the church and it's apologists describe it, but on how reliable independent (and in this case, scholarly) secondary sources describe it.

::If, as Dominus Vobisdu says, the question was a non-issue before the mid-20th century, there seems to no point in saying anything whatever about the Church's teaching before that time, and it is enough to state what the Church's position actually is.  Apart from the clear statements by the Church itself, the attacks on the Church's teaching make clear what ''the Church's teaching'' actually is.

Here are some quotes on the non-issue of birth control before the 20th century.
* &quot;If anyone in sound health has castrated himself, it behooves that such a one, if enrolled among the clergy, should cease [from his ministry], and that from henceforth no such person should be promoted. But, as it is evident that this is said of those who willfully do the thing and presume to castrate themselves, so if any have been made eunuchs by barbarians, or by their masters, and should otherwise be found worthy, such men this canon admits to the clergy&quot; (Canon 1). The First Council of Nicaea which defined Christ’s divinity, A.D. 325
* &quot;Because of its divine institution for the propagation of man, the seed is not to be damaged, nor is it to be wasted&quot; (The Instructor of Children 2:10:91:2). Clement of Alexandria, A.D. 195
* &quot;I am supposing, then, although you are not lying [with your wife] for the sake of procreating offspring, you are not for the sake of lust obstructing their procreation by an evil prayer or an evil deed. Those who do this, although they are called husband and wife, are not; nor do they retain any reality of marriage, but with a respectable name cover a shame. Sometimes this lustful cruelty, or cruel lust, comes to this, that they even procure poisons of sterility [oral contraceptives]&quot; (Marriage and Concupiscence  1:15:17). Augustine, A.D. 419
* &quot;You [Manicheans] make your auditors adulterers of their wives when they take care lest the women with whom they copulate conceive. They are unwilling to have children, on whose account alone marriages are made. How is it, then, that you are not those prohibiting marriage, as the apostle predicted of you so long ago [1 Tim. 4:1-4], when you try to take from marriage what marriage is? When this is taken away, husbands are shameful lovers, wives are harlots, bridal chambers are brothels, fathers-in-law are pimps.” Augustine, Against Faustus, 15:7, A.D. 400
* &quot;Why do you sow where the field is eager to destroy the fruit, where there are medicines of sterility [oral contraceptives], where there is murder before birth? What then?  Do you condemn the gift of God and fight with His laws?  Yet such turpitude.  The matter still seems indifferent to many men—even to many men having wives. In this indifference of the married men there is greater evil filth; for then poisons are prepared, not against the womb of a prostitute, but against your injured wife. Against her are these innumerable tricks.&quot; John Chrysostom, Homilies on Romans 24, A.D. 391
* &quot;In truth, all men know that they who are under the power of this disease [the sin of covetousness] are wearied even of their father's old age [wishing him to die so they can inherit]; and that which is sweet, and universally desirable, the having of children, they esteem grievous and unwelcome. Many at least with this view have even paid money to be childless, and have mutilated nature, not only killing the newborn, but even acting to prevent their beginning to live [sterilization].&quot; John Chrysostom, Homilies on Matthew 28:5, A.D. 391

The position on this has never changed. In the 20th century, with the sexual revolution in the West, many Catholics disagreed with the position of the Church, but they never claimed theirs was the Chuch's position. As to the statement from Dominus: &quot;Not mentioning that the decision is wildly unpopular among Catholics and very widely rejected by the faithful,&quot; this only, or mainly, true in the West. This is a non issue on many other countries. This is not to say that nobody uses birth control, but that those who use it are aware they are going against the teachings of the Church. The Church's official teaching is only one, and it is in no way apologetics to make sure that is clearly understood. You can state the disagreements, but to state that the Church is not clear on this would be untrue.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 17:19, 30 September 2012 (UTC)

We are not here to be a mouth piece for US conservative catholics, we are here to reflect the facts.  To that end I think there is a case to make it clearer that Pope Paul overruled the recommendations of a pontifical commission established by his predecessor, the the simple fact that the policy does not have the practical consent of a large number of catholics.  ----[[User:Snowded|&lt;font color=&quot;#801818&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'''Snowded'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Snowded#top|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot; face=&quot;Baskerville&quot;&gt;TALK&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:35, 30 September 2012 (UTC)
:::You dare accusing me of original research? Where are the citations that time and time again have been asked of you? This is not the article, this is the discussion page. My quotes are not supposed to be included in the article. I put them here, in the Discussion Page, to show the inaccuracy of the statement that ABC was a non-issue before the 20th Century or that the Church's teaching have changed over time. BTW, that suggestion that you are giving me, why don't you apply it to yourself and show the sources that we so much want to read where the Church's teaching are ambiguous, reliable third party sources stating that the Church's position on ABC is not clear. Nobody here doubt you and many other people disagree with the Church's teaching. That's not the question. The question is What is the Church's teaching? I am still waiting for your sources stating that it is different to what here is being said. The papal commission made a recommendation. Fine! The Pope didn't approve. That makes the Pope's statement unofficial? Where is your source? Where is your source stating that the commission's recommendation is the official Church teaching?
:::And before I forget, &quot;the practical consent of a large number of catholics&quot; is not criteria for the Church's teaching. If it were, taking into account that by the time of the Nicaea Council &quot;Arians outnumbered the trinitarians,&quot; (not my quote, I'll give you my source if you give me yours), then a heresy won over Orthodoxy and we are all heretics, followers of a corrupted Christianity.
:::Finally, &quot;We are not here to be a mouth piece for US conservative catholics,&quot; really? Is this what this is all about?  I am Puerto Rican. I have lived in Latin America, in Europe, and now I'm living in Asia. What you call US conservatism, I call Catholicism, of which it is obvious, according to your opinions, there exist two, one in the US where the use of ABC falls within the Church's teaching (liberal teaching), and the rest of the world, where it doesn't.--[[User:Coquidragon|Coquidragon]] ([[User talk:Coquidragon|talk]]) 07:05, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

:::::[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2H.HTM#BD Catholic canon law states:] &quot;Although not an assent of faith, a religious submission of the intellect and will must be given to a doctrine which the Supreme Pontiff or the college of bishops declares concerning faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim it by definitive act; therefore, the Christian faithful are to take care to avoid those things which do not agree with it.&quot;  Paul VI was the Supreme Pontiff when he issued the encyclical.  The teaching he gave was a doctrine concerning morals, even if he did not intend to proclaim it by definitive act.  According to their religion, Catholics are not free to ignore that teaching, but are obliged to give it a religious submission of the intellect and will.

The problem with the BBC link is that it is itself a tertiary source, a reference section equivalent to Wikipedia or any other encyclopedia.

== Wording of lede sentence ==

I think it is a trivial matter and bears some discussion as there has been edit warring over this point. While I will accept either wording, I feel that if it is felt necessary to say &quot;sometimes called the Roman Catholic Church&quot; rather than &quot;also known as the Roman Catholic Church&quot; then we should just use that. It is true and correct. For more background information about the name, see [[Roman Catholic (term)]]. This is a trivial issue in the context of a greater, more controversial argument about the article name. See the archives for more discussion. It is very hard to reach a consensus on this.

== Title should be changed to Roman Catholic Church - All others like Eastern Orthodox Catholic are similar but different Religions ==

I hope we are not once again hopelessly trying to say that the Roman Catholic Church is the same as the Orthodox Catholic Church. See: Talk:Sacraments of the Catholic Church See: Two similar but different Religions. I will copy and paste my answer for your convenience and then there should be a vote for consensus.

'''Two similar but different Religions'''

There are many titles to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. One is Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church. Similar in custom but not the same as the Roman Catholic Church. The Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church does not recognize the Pope as the Leader of their Church. See the articles I referenced here. They state the primary difference:

The Pope of Rome would still have honorary primacy before Constantinople if the East-West Schism had not occurred. Because of that schism the Orthodox no longer recognize the legitimacy of the pope. The Patriarch therefore, like the Pope before him now enjoys the title of “first among equals”. This is not, however, meant to imply that he is the leader of the Orthodox Church. Also, this is not an official title of any sort, just a way of describing the seniority of the &quot;imperial&quot; bishops with respect to all other bishops. Also look at their official website, http://www.easterncatholicchurch.org/ and here: http://rbsocc.org/history.html You see no mention of the Pope there. The Pope is not, to them, as it is to Roman Catholics the representative of Christ on earth, not Infallible in matters of faith and doctrine. I repeat, a very similar but different religion.

Because the Eastern church also has (Catholic) in its title does NOT make it the same as the Roman Catholic Church. The fundamental difference is as stated above. To be more specific: They do NOT recognize the Pope as the Vicar of the church and as Infallible when speaking of faith or doctrine. Research, if you will the Infallibility Doctrine. The Eastern Orthodox Church or Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church as sometimes called, regarded the Pope as &quot;first among equals&quot; equal to any other bishop. That was and is the cause of the Schism and the reason that, although they are a very similar religions they are nonetheless different religions. See here: Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion Published by: Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of Society for the Scientific Study of Religion Vol. 49, No. 1, MARCH 2010.  It states:  ''The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches share a similar theology and a hierarchical church administration. Local parish communities are organized in similar ways. However, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian churches occupy different places in the context of American culture, and they have developed distinct notions of priesthood''.  Also see the Official Eastern Orthodox Catholic websites: here: http://www.easterncatholicchurch.org/ and here: http://rbsocc.org/history.html You see no mention of the Pope there. http://www.easterncatholicchurch.org/ and here: http://rbsocc.org/history.html . You will see no mention of the Pope there.  Two similar but different religions. [[User:Mugginsx|Mugginsx]] ([[User talk:Mugginsx|talk]]) 15:58, 5 November 2012 (UTC)

The Roman Catholic Church in fact emcompasses all those '''countries''' but the names remains Roman Catholic. The other churches I mentioned are offshots of the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church and the Eastern Rite Churches and are NOT part of the Roman Catholic Church.  We are talking about two very large organizations, if you will - The eastern Churches and the Roman Catholic Church.  They are different and distinct though they share many customs.  There should be not be an article that just states:  Catholic Church - it is too vague, misleading, and has proven to be misleading in at least one article already.

Geez, again?  Why am I not surprised?  This is a perennial topic/proposal that comes up at least once a year so I guess Mugginsx is rushing to make sure we've covered it at least once in 2012.  I haven't the time right now to go back through the archives of this Talk Page to find all the many times this has come up before.  The title of this article has been established through much heated and contentious debate and is the result of a consensus of many editors.  If you bring the debate up again, it will involve the opinions of many editors and you will likely not accomplish anything.  My advice to you, Mugginsx, is to let it go until you have read all the discussion in the archives.

A few points should be made about the dialogue that has gone before...  

The Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church(es) and the Anglican Communion are all parts of the same church although these parts have differing opinions on both ecclesiology (how the church is governed) and theology (what the church believes).  All of these churches claim to be &quot;catholic&quot;.  (note the lower case &quot;c&quot; in &quot;catholic&quot;)  So, they are all parts of the &quot;catholic&quot; church in perhaps the way that the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] are parts of the same China with different claims to sovereignty.  Both sides agree that there is only one China, not two Chinas.  They only disagree as to what the legitimate government of that China is.  (OK, the analogy is not an exact parallel but perhaps it is useful.)  

The [[Polish Catholic Church]] and the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] are not in communion with the Bishop of Rome.  However, the  [[Greek Catholic Church]] and the [[Ukrainian Catholic Church]] are as are all the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].  

As for the name(s) of the Catholic Church, you may find it instructive to read this userpage in my userspace: [[User:Pseudo-Richard/Names of the Catholic Church]].  This page was created as part of a very long and heated debate as to whether the official name of the church in communion with the Bishop of Rome was &quot;Catholic Church&quot; or whether &quot;Roman Catholic Church&quot; was also an official name of the church.

If, after you've digested all that, you still feel like talking, come back and we'll discuss it some more.

:&quot;Catholic Church&quot; is the church's usual or common name. There is no compelling evidence that it is the only &quot;official&quot; name ~ and whether the church even has an &quot;official name&quot; as such is open to dispute.  The best historical evidence appears to suggest that names such as &quot;Holy Roman and Catholic Church&quot; were more &quot;official&quot; than &quot;Catholic Church&quot;. [[User:Afterwriting|Afterwriting]] ([[User talk:Afterwriting|talk]]) 08:19, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

::Pseudo-Richard - Your statement, ''The Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church(es) and the Anglican Communion are all parts of the same church'' is incorrect and almost outrageous.  The Orthodox Church, nor any other Church other than the Roman Catholic Church - no matter if it has Catholic in its title or not)  '''does NOT believe in the Pope''' as the Leader of the Church.  As for the Orthodox Church mistatement, I have shown the reference where their official sites shown NO mention of the pope.  Here is another site: http://www.antiochian.org/node/17076  It is here where they specifically say: ''The Orthodox Church cannot accept the papal or institutional concept of the Church, for many reasons. Orthodoxy strives to remain faithful to the beliefs and practices of the ancient undivided Church.'' I have provided other links to churches of the Orthodox faith above and none of them mention the Pope.  They had a great Schism with the Church of Rome (called at that time) and this was and is  the very reason they split.  I ask this in good faith, do you have one citation that shows that the Orthodox Catholics believe in the Pope?  If you do I would sincerely like to see it.  Please see my links above to the official Orthodox fatih sites.  Thanks. [[User:Mugginsx|Mugginsx]] ([[User talk:Mugginsx|talk]]) 15:14, 6 November 2012 (UTC)
