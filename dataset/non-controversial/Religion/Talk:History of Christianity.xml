==Use periods?==
:Most books on Christian history will use periods like these below (thou many of these are offten split in two as well.)
:*[[Early Christianity|Ante-Nicene Church]], 1–313
:*Christian Empire, 313–590
:*Middle Ages, 590–1517
:*The Reformation, 1517–1648
:*Reason &amp; Revivalism 1648–1789
:*Modern Age, 1789–present
:While every system of [[periodization]] has problems, these longer periods above have the difficulty of not leaving room to cover much depth. The only one written is the one on [[Early Christianity]] and it is ''also'' already over [[Wikipedia:Article size|100 KB]] (it is 144 KB and thus even longer than the [[History of the Roman Catholic Church]]).
:These articles would have other problems too-- like the fact that their start and end points will not be understud the same by different editors. and that some events will always over lap time periods. None the less these would be good articles to create in due time. That said, I also think it would be easier and better to make them ''from'' the Christianity by centuries articles than making them ''into'' Christianity by centuries articles.

:Of course most of the longer term events-- e.g. the [[Crusades]]-- already have their own articles, but feel free to create suitable articles as you see fit by the larger [[periodization|time periods]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;[[User:Carlaude|Carlaude]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 02:32, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

::Hmmm... well, if it were up to me, I'd delete the Christianity by centuries articles but nobody else seems to care at the moment so I won't push my position further.  Wikipedia is not paper so there's no real harm in having the Christianity by centuries articles even though I think they are ill-advised.  I personally think we should work with the periods you mentioned above and create those articles first.  --[[User:Richardshusr|Richard]] ([[User talk:Richardshusr|talk]]) 16:12, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Opinions? [[User:Reddi|J. D. Redding]] 01:13, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:Well for one, to make &quot;Early Christianity&quot; and &quot;History of Early Christianity&quot; cover different periods is confusing, and for no reason I can see-- and of course they cover the same time period now. I have also never seen anyone group the ''Reformation'' period with ''up to 1944''. A break at mid 3rd-century also make very little sense. ''Every'' author sees Constantine as a major turning point.  What do you think, Reddi, of the periods I wrote above.&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:22, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:: The Contemporary, modern (early and late), &quot;Classical&quot; [aka., medieval], and Early [aka., ancient] are conventional historical timeframes overlaps.
:: I just mention the 3rd century break to be used ''if'' needed [depending on the amount of information]. The break at 1945 is at the WWII end and Cold War begin [borrowed from general history, not specifically from &quot;'christian' history&quot;; this is a general turning point] ... again all this is suggested as a ''convenience'' ... if a division isn't necessary, then don't use a division; also, if there is a better break point, use that ...
:: The Reformation ends the early modern period in general history; but specifically for &quot;'christian' history&quot; i would suggest that the &quot;Reason &amp; Revivalism&quot; period would end 'early modern period'. Though a division of early and late in a 'modern period' may not be necessary at this time ... it is only a suggestion if needed ...
:: Ultimately, the main timeframes are 'Contemporary', 'modern', 'Classical', and 'Early' would allow editors to {{tl|split section}}s. The secondary timeframe subdivisions can be ignored. Now as to how I would map these unto your cited ones is:
::*Ante-Nicene Church, 1–313 &gt;&gt; Early history
::*Christian Empire, 313–590 &gt;&gt; early classical history
::*Middle Ages, 590–1517 &gt;&gt; late classical history
::*The Reformation, 1517–1648 &gt;&gt; early modern history
::*Reason &amp; Revivalism 1648–1789 &gt;&gt; late modern history
::*Modern Age, 1789–present &gt;&gt; Contemporary history
:: But these don't fall within more general historical timeframes ... Again, the Reformation ends the early modern period in general history. Marking 'post 1789' as 'contemporary' would be a stretch to me; [[Wiktionary:contemporary|Contemporary]] should mean more within 50 to 75 years (around the Fourth Great Awakening), not 200 to 250 years ago (around the First Great Awakening) ... [[User:Reddi|J. D. Redding]] 05:16, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:::General opinion: 1. in the choice between a uniq subdivision and a conventional subdivision, we should most usually prefer the conventional one to unrisk doing [[WP:OR]]; 2. when a scheme is shallow and have too long time span, nothing forbid us from doing own subdivisions, uniq or conventional. A mature article prob converge towards conventional because of adaption to other articles that are already conventional, so a temporary uniq scheme should be considered a transitional state. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit. ([[User talk:Rursus|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; background: #FFFF80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;bork&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]!) 08:12, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

=={{tl|split section}}s==
{{tl|split section}}s anyone?

Splits could be: [[Early history of Christianity]] (1 Life of Jesus (6–4 BC to AD 29–36) to 3.8 Monasticism); [[Classical history of Christianity]] (4 Growing tensions between East and West to 12 Church and the Italian Renaissance (1399–1599)); [[Modern history of Christianity]] (13 Protestant Reformation (1521–1579) to 17.2 Restorationism); [[Contemporary history of Christianity]] (18 Contemporary history (1848-present) to 20.4.2 Ecumenism within Protestantism).

Any opinions?

:But note well that [[Early Christianity]] and [[History of Early Christianity]] both exsist-- and era-based subsets there of.

===[[Apostolic Age]] and [[Ante-Nicene Period]]===
:Certainly :) There already seems to be some copying of bits. [[Apostolic Age]] and [[Ante-Nicene Period]] are the shortest and have the most specialized titles. The list can be left i think. The &quot;History of&quot; and [[Early Christianity]] take rather different subjects. I think the 1st century deserves its own article, so merging the two first mentioned where appropriate seems the way. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 18:52, 24 September 2009 (UTC)
::Okay... if we did merge [[Apostolic Age]] and [[Ante-Nicene Period]] together, it will cover 30 to 325. How will it not become a fork (or mostly a fork) for [[Early Christianity]], etc. &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:26, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
:::That's not what I'm suggesting. They should be merged into the other articles where appropriate, piece by piece. Not all will be needed. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 21:25, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

:[[Apostolic Age]] should stay, that's a standard topic. [[Early Christianity]] should also stay, that's also a standard topic (Christianity before Nicaea). [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]] should stay, that's another standard topic. I think the [[List of events in early Christianity]] (probably not an accurate name, read the article contents) was originally spun out of Early Christianity because that article is so large, so it probably should stay, it would get lost if merged into [[Timeline of Christianity]] which also is already large. The rest of the stuff is optional, though there already is a huge series of &quot;Christianity in the xth century&quot;, most recently created, what do you propose to do with them? [[Christianity in the 1st century]] could easily be a redirect to [[Chronology of Jesus]] and [[Apostolic Age]], but the rest are not so simple. [[Special:Contributions/75.15.201.136|75.15.201.136]] ([[User talk:75.15.201.136|talk]]) 21:00, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

::The series of &quot;Christianity in the xth century&quot;, needs to stay ''because'' '''all''' the other history articles are so over large. The best way to cut down the size of these large time-period articles is to be sure martial is in the short time perions articles before it is removed.
::I fail to see how &quot;Christianity before Nicaea&quot; is any standard topic... ''unless'' it is the [[History of Early Christianity|'''history of''' that time]] and covers ''between'' the Apostolic Age and Nicaea.
::I fail to see any need for a [[List of events in early Christianity]]-- even it could get lost. Let it get lost. It sure is not a &quot;standard topic&quot;.&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:34, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

[[Early Christianity]] was the parent article. [[History of early Christianity]] was spun-out due to length, according to standard practice and the topic's ability to support a distinct article. [[Apostolic Age]] and [[Ante-Nicene Period]] were spun out from &quot;history of Early Christianity&quot; for the same reasons. So long as the cited material justifies the increasing length and expansion, I do not see what concerns there should be. [[User:Vassyana|Vassyana]] ([[User talk:Vassyana|talk]]) 20:53, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

:Maybe [[Early Christianity]] and [[History of early Christianity]] just need to be cut down to size better with directs to the sub articles. The child articles should be more detailed than the parent articles but did not seem to be last time I looked. &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:37, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

::Breaking ''Early Christianity'' into periods of centuries is artificial. Some items will get lost or duplicated across the century barrier, the dating of some items are vague and could be in either century, etc. The crucifixion is one hard point (c.33), the Nicene council is the other (325), in between there are no hard points, only a varying continuity. Even the transition from [[Apostolic Age]] to age of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] is vague.

:While your concerns about periods of centuries are unfounded-- I primarly ment that material from the articles on [[Early Christianity]] and/or [[History of early Christianity]] be moved into the articles on the [[Apostolic Age]] and [[Ante-Nicene Period]]-- whereever this is sutable. If they are real sub-articles they should cover some things in greater detail than are covered in the parent article. &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:31, 28 September 2009 (UTC)

===[[List of events in early Christianity]]===
::Also since we also have the events of early Christianity listed as part of [[Timeline of Christianity]], I think [[List of events in early Christianity]] needs something done with it. Unless someone wants to make it into a (non-list) article on the split between Christianity and Judaism, it should be just merged into [[Timeline of Christianity]]. Even if we kept it, the the years 1-200 only is a strange time-frame to cover.--&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:25, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

::I am sure it is over large.
::Just because it ''was'' there in [[Early Christianity]] doesn't show any benifit to returning it there. Again, I can see the the benifit of splitting out text on the &quot;split between Christianity and Judaism&quot; and making ''that'' a separate article.

==Moved 'Christianity in India' to Apostolic Period==
===Moved 'Christianity in India' to Apostolic Period ===
[[Thomas the Apostle]] arrived along the southern Indian Malabar Coast in 52 AD and from this came [[Saint Thomas Christian tradition|Thomasine Christianity]]. It is incorrect to place 'India' under Post-Apostolic Church. [[User:Rahuljohnson4u]] ([[User talk:Rahuljohnson4u|talk]]) 09:00, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

:*That Thomas himself came to southern Indian himself is clearly disputed by some. There is not even any evidence here that it (Thomas coming to southern Indian himself) is a majoity view-- but even if it is the majoity view, it is not necessary or desirable to put this under the &quot;apostolic period,&quot; because the text certainly discusses events after Thomas. Indian Christianity is more than Thomas Christianity, and Thomas Christianity developed its distinctions ''after'' Thomas.
:*I do not know what you ment by &quot;This is not an article in favour of them.&quot;
:*Also-- stop reverting even if you disagree. Following [[WP:BRD]] means leaving the text as it was while we discuss.&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:42, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

*The main reason you give is that 'it is disputed by some'. So what?? Why should you give so much importance to those 'some'. Don't you know the fact that there are lots of historians who confirm the fact that St.Thomas landed in South India. Moreover the Saint Thomas Christians belong to various denominations and all of them share the same opinion that Thomas landed in South India. Also several Popes have asserted the origin of south Indian Christianity from the Apostle Thomas.

OK let me make a suggestion. Move the text to 'Apostolic Church' with minor edits. Instead of saying &quot;Christianity arrived.......&quot; change it to &quot; ''It is believed that'' Christianity arrived along the southern Indian Malabar Coast by Thomas the Apostle in 52 AD and from this came Thomasine Christianity.

*Moreover the text was originally under 'Apostolic Church'. Somebody changed it without any discussion. So there is nothing wrong in reverting it and keeping it back under the 'Apostolic Church'. Please do not revert it just because you are not in favor of it. And please do not give silly reasons like 'it is disputed by some'. I am only moving it to its original position.

:*Rahuljohnson4u-- There two was to stay NPOV (at least two). One is give statement to both/many/all sides to whatever degree. The 2nd is to just limit statements to thing all sides agree on... a much better way (unless the issue is a major part of the subject of the article, and thus there is room left ''within the size limit'' that is not better spent on other facts of the subject.
:*There is also no NPOV gained in stating &quot;''It is believed'' that Christianity arrived... via Thomas the Apostle...&quot; because that is not a statment that he came all the way to Indian Malabar Coast in person. It leaves open the view that he may have came East and diciples of his came the Indian Malabar Coast in his name.
:*But if it seem to clarify something to you, we can also look at adding in a explainitory footnote on the differening views.
:*This is a neutral point of view as it is, because
::*the text itself is limited to statements that all sides agree on,
::*and while even if you and I agree that Thomas came to southern India himself, the placement of the text here only indicates that ''some'' of the events are postapostolic, short of spliting the text into two bits in two part of the article.
:*You have claimed &quot;majority does accept that Thomas brought Christianity to India&quot; but I see no reason for this claim. You just seem to &quot;know&quot; it to be the case.
:*Richard-- I do not think we have (or need) information of which is the mainstream view and which is the minority view. Such a thing can be hard to measure, but Rahuljohnson4u may be more mainstream, or they may both be about the same. Details on this should be in [[Saint Thomas Christian tradition]] but not this article nor in other Christianity in genral articles-- except some detail could work in the new [[Early centers of Christianity]] article I made.

:::*Carlaude, you may be right about your edits not being a 3RR issue, but an edit war is still an edit war even if it spans several days.  In truth, it gives me pause to make edits which I know to be edit warring even if the edits span several weeks or several months.  You know when you are reverting somebody else's edits and you should try to engage that other editor in discussion rather than just revert them.

:::*That said, I disagree with you about sticking with mutually agreed on assertions.  It seems obvious that we should mention the existence Thomasine Christians and their spiritual heritage via Thomas.  At the same time, if some people doubt the tradition of Thomas going to India, we should indicate that as well.  If there is not an easily ascertainable &quot;mainstream&quot; position, then why can't we say something &quot;According to the tradition of the Saint Thomas Christians, Christianity came to India via Saint Thomas.  Some historians dispute the historicity of this tradition.&quot;  This makes no assertion as to whether the historicity of the tradition is mainstream or not.  It simply states indisputable facts: (1) the Saint Thomas Christians believe Christianity came to India via Thomas.  (2) Some historians dispute that.

:::Please see the link. It says that St. Thomas died in Madras (near Mylapore) in the South. It is a continuation of the Malabar Coast and there are lots of Saint Thomas Christians and Syrian Churches there. And please understand that a very large majority does believe in the fact that St.Thomas is the founder of the Syrian Churches in India. Almost all the prominant denominations including the Roman Catholic and the Oriental Orthodox Churches accept this. In the period of time we are talking about most of religious history, across most religions, is certainly based on tradition. The foundations of most beliefs in general tend to be tradition. Unfortunately CNN wasn't around back then to chronicle the happenings of the day. There are some people who are skeptical about this. Typically, such arguments are due to a combination of ignorance of history plus post colonial mentality that can creep in. We are talking about a community that existed in Southern India who kept their records in palm leaves. If you look at the evidences there are plenty but u wont get anything similar as you can find in Rome or West. That’s simply because people are different and their culture for maintaining records are different. [[User:Rahuljohnson4u]] ([[User talk:Rahuljohnson4u|talk]]) 07:40, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

===Just too long===
::*Ugh.  I was really going to argue that those two little sentences would provide a good NPOV summary of the controversy.  However, if you are going to argue from an &quot;article is too long&quot; position, then, yes, it is arguable that we could drop all mention of Thomasine Christianity from this article.  I checked to see if we mention the introduction and later suppression of Catholicism in Japan and I see that we do not.  I would think that both stories (Japanese Kirishitans and Thomasine Christianity) would be important to include in this article but I can see arguments for omitting them as well.  However, if we do omit them, then there are almost certainly other topics to remove from this article.  One that just crossed my radar screen just now is [[Devshirmeh]] which I copied here from [[History of the Orthodox Church]] some time ago.  That is almost certainly less important than Thomasine Christianity and so, if we don't mention Thomasine Christianity, we should not mention &quot;Devshirmeh&quot; either.  So, my question to you now is: How do we go about shortening this article?  Surely, we will slaughter some &quot;sacred cows&quot; in the process of doing so.  Should we just pull out our knives and start hacking away at it, debating specific issues if and when other editors squawk? --[[User:Richardshusr|Richard S]] ([[User talk:Richardshusr|talk]]) 02:37, 13 January 2010 (UTC)
:*Here is my take on it.
:*A. When and if you have a time, look at the whole article and use some consitencey to delete spam, moved what is best moved, and split into new article whatever section(s) are suitable (but spiting also requires replacing it with a short summary there-of). It seems best to me to &quot;scrape the surface&quot; of many topics (so they are links) than to cover a few things well, but that is sort of a judgment call. But it takes time and drive to do this...
:*B. In the mean time, don't add things to long article without some clear need (and there is rarely a clear need).
:*C. Also in the mean time, delete/move/split whatever you run across that seems good to do so. Then [[WP:BRD]] as need or want too. This sort of depends on how well you know the subject, how clear the benifit/need of the edit is, and of course how over long the article is, but it is easier to talk about your edit after I have seen it.
:*Keep in mind, everyone has more fun ''adding'' to articles than ''removing'' from them, but we should still edit the long ones down. &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Carl;color:red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Carl&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:aude:;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;aude:&lt;/span&gt;}}]][[User talk:Carlaude|{{#if:|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:Talk;color:purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;}}]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:08, 13 January 2010 (UTC)

==Christianity and Worldly Governments==
From my general reading of the history Christianity in Rome, the combination of religious and political powers that had been invested in the person of the emperor, under Christianity was separated into two realms. The worldly power, held by the secular apparatus, and the spiritual power held by the ecclesiastical apparatus.

Under the new arrangement, which had fully matured by medieval times, the spiritual powers gave their sanction to the worldly powers. And in turn the worldly powers protected and favored the spiritual powers. It appears to me to be an arrangement that began to develop around the time of Constantine, and didn't start to unravel until the Reformation and the Enlightenment. But it came completely undone in the United States by the disestablishmentarianism in the first clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

In general, the relationship of the Christian Church in its various iterations to contemporaneous political sovereignties seems to be little explored, to date, in any of the articles that cover the religion. I'll see what I can reference adequately to be able to contribute along these lines, but thought I'd bring up the subject here in case others want to break open their books. --[[User:Jstanley01|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ô&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;¿&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font   color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ô&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:23, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

==Why the title &quot;Trinitarian Christianity made the state religion of Rome&quot;==
At the time that this decree was promulgated, there was indeed a long simmering dispute within the Church between Arians and Trinitarians.  This decree settled that dispute.

==Christian History==
The one thing I noticed in the first paragraph was the statement of Christian History starting at the time of Jesus Birth to present day.....I hope there can be someone who can fill in the gaps pre-Jesus because Christian History predates even the Old Testament and to really comprehensively write about Christian History, these truths about the origins of Christianity and the cultural realities surrounding the time just before the Old Testament are crusial in compiling the complete Christian History.....so if anyone can put in reference material realted to pre-New Testament Christian History that would be great.....

High Hopes!!!

==Spawning idea...==
I think that the article, which by far is technically too large (133 kb), should be spawned thusly: from the fall of the West Roman Empire, the Rome Catholic Church becomes organisationally independent from the Head of the Church which is the East Roman emperor, and the Constantinople Catholic Church under the emperor. Therefore the histories of the
* West Catholics (today the Roman Catholic Church) and the
* East Catholics (today the Greek Orthodox Church)
are essentially separate and follow different time schemes. As it is now, the article needs both expansion and shrinking, which must mean something like spawning subarticles. I propose splitting the article into [[History of the East Orthodox Christianity]] and [[History of the Western Christianity]], after some preparative edits to make the sections to-be-spawned-off coherent.

The statement &quot;and in that century, and this structure was supported by teaching on apostolic succession  where, a bishop becomes the spiritual successor of the previous bishop in a line tracing back to the apostles themselves&quot; appears to have be carelessly tacked on.

==Imperial bias==
Observation: The section titled ''Church of the Roman Empire'' is, by its name alone, very biased. First, it implies that the Christian community was almost entirely ruled by the Romans which is patently false. There was an extremely large Christian communion centered in Persia that stretched into India and other parts of Asia. Additionally the Germanic Churches were independent of the Roman Empire and its churches as well. Even apart from all of that, though, the Roman Imperial Church never even represented all of the Roman Christians. A very large portion of the Roman Christians (perhaps the majority?) belonged to the Oriental Orthodox communion.

I would recommend:
* Retitle the section. Perhaps ''Christianity in late antiquity''.
* Broaden the focus to be more balanced based on the sizes of the Christian communities at that time and their significance during that period.

==James the &quot;successor&quot; of Jesus?==
Although he was clearly a leader among the early Christians, I've never heard of such a concept that he was the &quot;successor of Jesus&quot; and I'm sure that certainly among Christians at least, most would object to such a description. In Christianity, Christ has such a central and unique place (being the only begotten Son of God, the unique Redeemer and Savior, even the incarnated God Himself, etc.) that it would be ridiculous to claim any one individual as a &quot;successor.&quot;  

Unless it can be backed up with some evidence via citations, I say that that phrase should be removed.  [[User:The Cabbage|The Cabbage]] ([[User talk:The Cabbage|talk]]) 05:59, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

== Isn’t it all about Politics and power? - The concept of Jeremiah - more about it and a side article about it? ==
I think the political thread is not obvious enough in this article. 

Who really cares about the state of the Holy Ghost? I really don’t think common people did in the past as well. So how come so much blood is spent over it? Such questions  needs to be explained?! 

We can read about &quot;Western Schism (1378–1416)&quot;: &quot;The conflict was political, rather than doctrinal, in nature.&quot; Isn’t it the general aspect of the topic of the entire article, a lot of politics? Was the politics before or after religion, is also a general question? 

Any history of Christianity, Islam and Judaism without a thread of basic political religious concept, are odd random tails of stupid people, quarrelling and killing each other for no obvious reasons. That religion makes people stupid is another odd conclusion that is not right. We can’t understand large portions about today’s events without understanding the political layer of religion. How understand Al-Qaida without a political thread? We can’t see that the Templars were seen as Al-Qaida today when dissolved, a political and military power that must be exterminated or incorporated in the regular society of them own, of political reasons. The Templars were exterminated by King Philip IV of France. It has nothing to do with faith, only politics, power and money. 

History is always written by them in power afterwards, history has since dawn of civilisation been a mean of political propaganda often in a sense that would make Goebbels look pale? If history ever should have any scientifically credits it can't be described without a political layer that follows the entire topic, else we are talking about tails and not history in a scientifically sentence? 

In fact there is religion in the earliest archaeological civilisation findings, and not just a detail but a main feature. One of the interesting questions is, if a city is there for the fun, for the religion or to organise a political society that is based on political power? As soon as there is money there is politics and power. So the general question is, Is politics a part of religion or religion a part of politics? 

For certain if not earlier, religion became a part of politics from Jeremiah, actually forming Judaism and in fact the Jewish nation on a firm distinctive political ground. If you did not believe in Jeremiahs statements you ceased to be a Jew, and are still the basis of Judaism, and in practice the state of Israel. If Jeremiah wouldn't have been there, or actually nobody would have stated the statements, there would not be a Jewish people today. They rather would be regular Iraqis or Palestinians (or whatever would have happened without Jeremiah (long time long history in another dimension)? 

On the other hand the political layer of religious history is not the entire history of a religion or religions. People like Jesus, Paulus, Muhammad or Luther were not most likely on a mission from somebody else (but God). But even in their lifetimes what they did became immediately politics. And it was politics when created. And the reason is the concept of Jeremiah, those who are not accepting the Creed, are not among us. And the importance of the Creed is pure politics, not mainly faith in a scientifically historical point of view. But in an individual perspective certainly the Creed is pure faith. 

The concept of Jeremiah is what made Christianity interesting for Roman emperors like Constantine and Theodosius as a tool to govern the empire and glue it together as a unity not disintegrate into nations and tribes. Before the army and the lute made everything go around and politically the Roman Empire looked like Bolivia in the 70ies, one military take over after another. The basic idea was that nations, tribes or other identities in the multiethnic empire did not matter, the identity was the faith and the creed. It meant that everyone that did not just accept the creed but also the entire theological package, was condemned and normally sentenced to horrible convictions. Horrible not because they were evil bastards but for the cause of the empire. The faith identified the Byzantine Empire as it. And so did Zoroastrianism the Roman/Byzantine arch enemy the Persian identity. 

The other aspect of the Jeremiahan concept, at least in Constantine/Theodosius version, it became impossible to make the creed to the official Christianity not admitting the rights of the Patriarch and the Byzantine Emperor. It meant two things, you have to deny the official creed to not be a belonging to the Patriarch and the Emperor and the empire must demand absolute acceptance of the creed. The totalitarian state of the empire became extreme in Constantinople and is also a direct result of this concept. It also explains the ruthlessness in the relations to Arians and others. And that is why Nestorians were accepted in Persia, they did not have a creed of faith to the Emperor and patriarch in Constantinople. The Persians were not Christians, and they accepted them as refugees being only a threat to their arch enemy Byzantium. Without it the empire would soon look like Yugoslavia during the 1990ies or Britain during the 400ds after the Romans left. Christianity was to the Roman empire like if the Serbs would have invented a new political tool to reunify Yugoslavia (that they obviously didn’t) or like the Saxons came and took it all over (the real occupiers of Britain?) and introduced an entirely new concept.

Without understanding this, the entire history of Jews after Jeremiah, the Western world and Middle East after 323 AD is impossible to understand. 

It also explains why some neighbouring empires became Arian and not Orthodox to Constantinople, it was a way of politically using Jeremiahs concept, what Constantine did in a version without the Byzantine emperor or the Patriarch in Constantinople, where the local king was free to govern his own way, without need to be a part of the empire. 

From this perspective the main events of history after 323 AD makes a lot of sense. The Islam is created after a number of test probes the centuries before of theological debate in Byzantium of for instance Jesus appearance as a God of human etc. It was then obvious an enough radical different version of the religious faith had to be created. Denying so much it was not a bargainable anymore, but also such a complete political package to attract local force withstanding a (weakened from Persian war) Byzantine army assault, to politically get free from the Patriarch and the Emperor in Constantinople, by a million of good reasons. Note what Machiavelli wrote about Byzantium in the Prince? But also note the free will conversion demand of Islam is a direct reaction to the political Byzantine demand of the Creed. Islam in ex Byzantine areas was sold as a revolution of political end economical freedom, not mainly a matter of faith. Because of the Byzantine demand of the Creed the matter of faith of Islam was included in the freedom package, must change or be a Byzantine subject. 

An interesting aspect is that so large portions of Islam are directly related to Byzantine politics that Sunni was not that fitting and understood in Persia, so they needed something slightly else. 

So later the Persians needed to free themselves from the Caliphate, continue the Persian identity in a new dress and the Shiite Islam became the tool. Developed to a large extent from the basic Persian dualistic basic concept, us against the world (where not necessarily in that perspective the world need to be seen larger than Persia), to the Persian Shiite form we know today. Also a perspective if not understood, it is impossible to understand Iran and Iranian politics today. 

Much lesser was needed for the Pope (and the Frankish emperor) to get politically free from the Patriarch and the Emperor in Constantinople. It was a small to us completely stupid question of the exact words of the basic creed. But the difference was the Carolingian army. The Southeast did not have such an army but the opportunity came after a bitter and devastating war to the last resources, between Persia and Byzantium. Else there wouldn't have been any Islam, the Persians and the Byzantines would have let their armies have quickly finished Islam off else. There was in fact even lesser war in the West, because the Byzantine army had no chance getting the Pope or the Carolingians. Else the Pope would never have done it. 

The same scenario happens by reformation after a few centuries of political power competition between kings and popes. The kings became strong enough, to deny Rome. A lot of people agreed with Luther, but the main thing was that Luther suited the king’s needs. Luther was protected by princes and most likely shared perspectives and made Luther the choice of kings rather than Zwingli or others. And describing is the case of Henry VIII (that has nothing to do with divorces). That he first criticised Luther, and hoping for support from the Pope against the Spanish political ambitions. Writing (or in any way let publishing in his name) a book denying Luther. After failing getting the support of the Pope he had to cut with Rome of the same political reasons other kings and nations became Lutheran. He couldn’t then become Lutheran, so Henry had to invent his own protestant church of England, the Anglican church. Without the book England would have become full proof Lutheran because it was a full working royal package. And so to a large extent the Anglican Church was created as a political necessity to relate to Spanish foreign politics, and to get free from the obvious papal political chains. The pope made Charlemagne emperor and the conflict has been ongoing until then, since they payment for that imperial service made the Pope impossible for kings. 

Bishops were very rich and political powerful people in the past and non-Episcopal movement must also be seen as a political movement. The Presbyterianism dominance in Scotland and strong growth in England must be seen in the light of the struggle between king and parliament and the English power over Scotland. And the Reformed churches in Germany because to govern the bishops there must be a strong king, most principalities in Germany could not perform that. After Prussia took over many of the principalities in the 1800ds the Episcopal matter did not stayed as a main issue. And the tries of making a unified protestant church of Prussia, was made in streamline with the new strong central power and government in Berlin. Unification has always been a hard issue to complete because faith is not just a political issue, and the church had less political importance in the 1800ds. 

The issue is how strong violence that were politically justifiable. After 1600 in Sweden it was justifiable to send all Catholics abroad and execute a hand full of them after the battle with Sigismund. In the 1800ds being a catholic in Sweden was no more an issue. In Byzantium the imperial political issue of Creed was worth blinding and disable people (when theologically hindered to execute them), it was in fact not mainly a matter of faith.

In the aftermath of the reformation the counterreformation became a political mean to keep national identities in some neighbouring countries like Poland, and later even stronger against the triple occupation in the 1800ds and the Soviet powered communist regime. Faith is of much lesser importance in Poland today because the only remains are the backside of the catholic faith like of rigid family politics that are not smooth in a country with great past liberties, make Catholic politicians quick loose later elections. 

It can seem to be a dry tail to describe Christian history as mainly politics, but it is impossible to understand else? Who really cares about the state of the Holy Ghost? I really don’t think common people did in the past too. So how come so much blood is spent over it? 

I think this article must have a general political comment and there should be an article like, Christianity (political) or something. Ok, I have no references here, I have no time to get them, but I hope someone share my view and get them and write something good. 

We can’t go on telling tails because most of the explanations are politics and even politicians today hate people talking about the political layer explanation of history or present events, counter saying do you think the world is so conspiratorial? Well the flaw to most conspiratorial theories is the stupid factor and the randomness/opportunities in the reality. The presence and the history is woven by many threads, where many of them are hard to control and each are driven by so many individual perspectives, that conspiratorial theories normally are impossible to have been performed. But the political thread is in many cases very strong and influential and explains many contradictions in tails that are set up to replace history. 

I think the political thread is not obvious enough in this article.

== The perspective of time, past life conditions and identity, independence, who developed and who is orthodox ==
There is another perspective that this article I would say completely fail in, getting perspectives in time, way of life and identity of churches. But also understanding the rules of life in past societies. Especially countries with long religious freedom, like in the USA have hard to get. 

There is a lot we have hard to get, for instance that 70% of Stockholm apartments lacked shower or bath 1970 and all built before 1930 was with dry loo in the yard. Not very far ago. Also Christianity was very different only 50 or 100 years ago in Western Europe. We all, including the church, has to adapt to new political demands. Today the church has to accept same sex marriage, or soon cease as church, being abandoned by the society. And queer marriages were unthinkable 25 years ago. These are very strong shoifts in doctrine only the last years in the church historical perspective? And they certainly do not origin from a theological debate. They origin from a view oof the church as an institution of service to their members, but put old theological truths aside very rapidly. And it is not for the first time in Church history. Since the French revolution many local catholic parishes had to compromise between the society and the papal line, in order to survive. Last years harder attitude from the Vatican, and some highlighted special issues looks also lead to problems for the view of the catholic church in many countries, and is an issue of the future of its services. Adoptability is a genuine matter to consider and has always been. 

Times have been very different. For instance in Scandinavia there was 100% Lutheran protestants between the late 1500ds and the 1800rds. And 100% meant 100% not more or less. In Sweden it was illegal to be non-Lutheran in the country without a special invitation from the king (that diplomats and special skilled people on jobs got). It meant especially Catholics were not allowed. The Jewish community was established 1772 by a special permission of the king, same rules as for the Lutheran church. The Lutheran church was owned by state, nationalised. And so all the clergy was governmental employees, like the military, the police and the postal service. In fact normally the only intellectual (educated at the state universities) representative in the local villages. There was even law to participate in church on Sundays and even to be able to read the bible, the clergy came to the farms and checked the readability (of the bible). Certainly in wealthier and more intellectual homes in cities it was slightly smoother. 

In today’s standards it may sound very odd un-free society but for most people then it was an issue as if there should be one or many postal services or police forces in a country? The reason for this attitude was that the absolute unity. Paradoxingly made the question what religion a non-question. Who would be interested to talk to about it, when there was one choice and all were Ok, what was delivered served the present societies needs? What difference would the state of the Holy Ghost make? I was once in Eilat and the Palestinian receptionist asked two teenage Swedish girls on of the most normal questions in Middle east, “What religion do you belong to?” and they thought he was nuts, replied “No religion own us!”. 

A very different situation from where religion still was a political struggle. Charles I drove towards Catholicism and the parliament drove it towards non-Episcopal Presbyterianism. It really matter what your opinion was, and what religion you belonged to. And to get free from the political fuzz people started go to America. 

Certainly in Sweden after 200 years of wars abroad the political propaganda made Catholics among the lowest creeps ever exists, had still some effects. But not even being catholic was from the 1700rds any issue to talk about, it really had no political importance anymore so it faded. Rather home comers from the wars with Russia in the early 1700rds were seen as a problem. Being practicing Lutheranism as amateurs being without priests in Siberia for decades, having a lot of odd religious ideas of running it themselves, free religiously. 

Certainly the life everywhere in the Catholic world before the reformation was about the same as in Protestant Scandinavia, go to church was natural as going to the loo or eat. And there was one church and nothing to talk about. People might have private opinions but not being organised by anyone but the pope or the king. 

The same situation was certainly the case in Byzantium and there was one emperor and one church, that’s it. 

This means there was no Coptic church of Egypt and so on before Islam because every church within the empire was Orthodox and that’s it. Outside the empires borders the churches could not be orthodox because then the members would be arrested for treason, because it would mean they made a Creed to the Emperor of Constantinople, that was not sovereign there. In Western Europe there were countries outside the immediate control of the Emperor, but they did not officially deny him and the Orthodox Church before 1054. But in practice they were under the pope that until 1054 was a by name subject of the Patriarch and the Emperor. This means that any church outside Byzantium must be independent, and inside orthodox. 

And so we can’t talk about other ancient churches from ancient times, there were none and not accepted. Them all created slowly after the empire lost area and area, and had to get organised independently or people with other faith became refugees abroad like the Nestorians. Only a few parts like the Coptic church of Ethiopia was independent all the time. 

However the main churches were developing their ways, theology and organisation to meet the society’s demand of new (political) times, like for instance the matter of same sex marriages in churches today and female clergy in the late 1900ds, certainly issues pushed hard from the outside society to be made reforms. Often the independent churches of formal imperial areas were far more conservative, because their issue is to withstand an identity in an often-hostile world. 

From this perspective many Westerners find eastern churches very odd and strange, not realising that it is the West that has changed and the East that stayed the old way. The secular drive for development of society and business was not the case in Islam. And large parts of Islam have been proven extremely efficient measures of staying conservative and no change. This as a political part of woven into Islam selling it local power structures wanting to be freed from Constantinople but self stay in power, forever. A world where there was a conservative competition rather than a liberal, like in the west. 

Some people are claiming they are fundamental Christians and the development of Christianity makes it quite clear that the most accurate question is fundamental of what? Somebody might say the bible, the holy book. The next question is what version of the translation to what? Even the Jesus denied the fundamental Jews in Jerusalem of his time, why are we celebrating Sundays??

Not understanding what drove the changes and the conservatism in various parts of the church makes it impossible to understand why the changes happened. 

The history of Christianity might not just be the history of isms and them flying independent of themselves as ideas? 

Or should this article be titled History of Christian doctrines, and this article History of Christianity have a new text?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/37.247.9.228|37.247.9.228]] ([[User talk:37.247.9.228|talk]]) 01:01, 8 October 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
