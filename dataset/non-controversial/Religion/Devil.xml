&lt;!--
NOTE TO EDITORS. This is a *general overview*. There's no need to emphasize that the lead section is incorrect for some cases, because that's stated outright.
--&gt;
The '''Devil''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: [[wikt:διάβολος|διάβολος]] or ''diábolos'' = '[[defamation|slanderer]]' or 'accuser')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=devil |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |year= 2007 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=June 29, 2007 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9030155}}&lt;/ref&gt; is believed in many [[religion]]s, myths and [[culture]]s to be a [[supernatural]] entity that is the [[personification]] of [[evil]] and the enemy of [[God]] and humankind. The nature of the role varies greatly. It ranges from being an effective opposite force to the creator god at one extreme, where both are locked in an eons long holy war for human souls on what may seem even terms (to the point of [[dualism|dualistic]] [[ditheism]]/[[bitheism]]), to being just a comical figure of fun or even an abstract aspect of the individual human condition at the other.

Whilst mainstream [[Judaism]] contains no overt concept of a devil, [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] have variously regarded the Devil as a rebellious [[fallen angel]] or [[demon]] that tempts humans to [[sin]], if not commit [[evil]] deeds himself. In these religions – particularly during periods of division or external threat – the Devil has assumed more of a dualistic status commonly associated with [[Heresy|heretics]], [[infidel]]s, and other unbelievers. As such, the Devil is seen as an [[allegory]] that represents a [[crisis of faith]], [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and enlightenment.

In mainstream [[Christianity]], God and the Devil are usually portrayed as fighting over the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of humans, with the Devil seeking to lure people away from [[God]] and into [[Hell]]. The Devil commands a force of evil spirits, commonly known as [[demons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Revelation|12:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew Bible]] (or Old Testament) describes the Adversary (Ha-[[satan]]) as an angel who instigates tests upon humankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibleref|1Chronicles|21:1&quot;&gt;{{Bibleref|1Chronicles|21:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibleref|Job|1:11&quot;&gt;{{Bibleref|Job|1:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other religions have a trickster or tempter figure that is similar to the Devil. Modern conceptions of the Devil include the concept that it symbolizes humans' own lower nature or [[sin]]fulness.

People often put the concept of the Devil to use in social and political conflicts, claiming that their opponents are influenced by the Devil or even willingly supporting the Devil. In addition, the Devil has also been used to explain why others hold beliefs that are considered to be false and ungodly.

== Etymology ==
Devil is a synonym for Satan / Ha-Satan, which descends from the Middle English [[wikt:devel|devel]], from Old English [[wikt:deofol|dēofol]], that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of Latin diabolus (also the source of &quot;diabolical&quot;). This in turn was borrowed from Ancient Greek diábolos (διάβολος), &quot;slanderer&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddia%2Fbolos διάβολος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from diaballein &quot;to slander&quot;: dia- &quot;across, through&quot; + ballein &quot;to hurl&quot;. In the New Testament, &quot;Satan&quot; occurs more than 30 times in passages alongside diábolos (Ancient Greek for &quot;the devil&quot;), referring to the same person or thing as Satan.

== Accounts in the Abrahamitic religions ==
=== Judaism ===
In mainstream [[Judaism]] there is no concept of a devil like in mainstream Christianity or Islam. Texts make no direct link between the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] that tempts [[Eve]] in [[the Garden of Eden]] from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and references to a [[Satan]] in [[1Chronicles|the first book of Chronicles]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibleref|1Chronicles|21:1&quot;/&gt; and in [[Book of Job|Job]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibleref|Job|1:11&quot;/&gt; In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the biblical word ''ha-satan'' (השָׂטָן) means &quot;the adversary&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For example in {{bibleverse||Numbers|22:22|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Samuel|29:4|HE}} and other places, the word &quot;adversary&quot; appears in the translation, which in the original Hebrew is &quot;ha-satan&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''the obstacle'', or even &quot;the [[prosecutor]]&quot; (recognizing that God is viewed as the ultimate [[Judge]]). As much as the Devil exists in any form of Judaism, his role is as an adversary and an accuser which is assigned rather than assumed.

=== Hebrew Apocrypha ===
[[The Apocrypha]] are religious writings which are not generally accepted as scripture by [[Judaism]] and many modern-day Protestant sects of [[Christianity]]. In the [[Book of Wisdom]], the devil is represented as the one who brought death into the world.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world&quot; - Book of Wisdom II. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Book of Enoch, also called the [[2 Enoch|Slavonic Book of Enoch]], contains references to a Watcher [[Grigori]] called Satanael.&lt;ref&gt;[[2 Enoch]] 18:3&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[pseudepigraphic]] text of an uncertain date and unknown authorship. The text describes Satanael as being the prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And I threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless&quot; - [[2 Enoch]] 29:4&lt;/ref&gt; and an evil spirit who knew the difference between what was &quot;righteous&quot; and &quot;sinful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The devil is the evil spirit of the lower places, as a fugitive he made Sotona from the heavens as his name was Satanail, thus he became different from the angels, but his nature did not change his intelligence as far as his understanding of righteous and sinful things&quot; - [[2 Enoch]] 31:4&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story is found in the book of [[1 Enoch]]; however, in that book, the leader of the Grigori is called [[Samyaza|Semjâzâ]].

In the apocryphal literature, Satan rules over a host of angels.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Martyrdom of Isaiah]]'', 2:2; ''[[Vita Adæ et Evæ]]'', 16)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mastema]], who induced God to test Abraham through the sacrifice of Isaac, is identical with Satan in both name and nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Jubilees]], xvii. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Hasidic Judaism|Chasidic Jews]] of the eighteenth century, Ha-satan was ''Baal Davar''.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Angels&quot; by Gustav Davidson, © 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Enoch]] contains references to [[Satariel]], thought also to be [[Sataniel]] and [[Satanel|Satan'el]] (etymology dating back to [[Babylonian]] origins). The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]], [[Uriel]] and [[Gabriel]], previous to his expulsion from Heaven.

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Devil depicted in the ''[[Temptation of Christ]]'', by [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]

In mainstream [[Christianity]] the Devil is known as [[Satan]] and sometimes as [[Lucifer]], although it has been noted that the reference in Isaiah 14:12 to Lucifer, or the Son of the Morning, is a reference to the Babylonian king.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the entries in [http://studylight.org/con/ntb/view.cgi?number=T3103 Nave's Topical Bible], the [http://studylight.org/dic/hbd/view.cgi?number=T3937 Holman Bible Dictionary] and the [http://studylight.org/com/acc/view.cgi?book=isa&amp;chapter=14&amp;verse=12#Isa14_12 Adam Clarke Commentary].&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern Christians consider the Devil to be an [[angel]] who, along with one-third of the angelic host (the demons) rebelled against [[God]] and has consequently been condemned to the [[Lake of Fire]]. He is described as hating all humanity, or more accurately creation, opposing God, spreading lies and wreaking havoc on the souls of mankind. Other Christians consider the devil in the Bible to refer figuratively to human sin and temptation and to any human system in opposition to God.

[[File:Backer Judgment (detail).JPG|thumb|Horns of a [[goat]] and a [[Sheep|ram]], goat's fur and ears, nose and canines of a [[pig]], a typical depiction of the Devil in [[christian art]]. The goat, ram and pig are consistently associated with the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Fritscher |title=Popular Witchcraft: Straight from the Witch's Mouth |year=2004 |editor= |page=23|chapter= |chapterurl= |publisher=Popular Press |isbn=02-99203-04-2 |url= |quote=The pig, goat, ram — all of these creatures are consistently associated with the Devil.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detail of a 16th century painting by [[Jacob de Backer]] in the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]].]]

Satan is often identified as the [[serpent (Bible)|serpent]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the forbidden fruit; thus, Satan has often been depicted as a serpent. Though this identification is not present in the [[Adam and Eve]] narrative, this interpretation goes back at least as far as the time of the writing of the [[book of Revelation]], which specifically identifies Satan as being the serpent (Rev. 20:2).

In the [[Bible]], the devil is identified with &quot;The dragon&quot; and &quot;the old serpent&quot; in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:9, 20:2 have also been identified with Satan, as have &quot;the prince of this world&quot; in the [[Book of John]] 12:31, 14:30; &quot;the prince of the power of the air&quot; also called Meririm, and &quot;the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience&quot; in the [[Book of Ephesians]] 2:2; and &quot;the god of this world&quot; in [[2 Corinthians]] 4:4.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|2:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also identified as the dragon in the [[Book of Revelation]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#Chapter 12|Rev. 12:9]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the tempter of the [[Gospels]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#Chapter 4|Mat. 4:1]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Beelzebub]] is originally the name of a [[Philistine]] god (more specifically a certain type of [[Baal]], from ''Ba‘al Zebûb'', lit. &quot;Lord of Flies&quot;) but is also used in the New Testament as a synonym for Satan. A corrupted version, &quot;Belzeboub,&quot; appears in [[The Divine Comedy]].

In other, non-mainstream, Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the [[Devil in Christianity#Unitarians and Christadelphians|Christadelphians]]) the word &quot;satan&quot; in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any 'adversary' and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/devil.htm |title=Do you Believe in a Devil? Bible Teaching on Temptation. |accessdate=2007-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Devil (Islam)}}
In Islam the Devil is referred to as [[Iblis]] or sometimes [[Shaitan]] (Arabic: in some cases ''[[Shaitan]]'' is a word referring to evil devil-like beings). According to the [[Qur'an]], God created Iblis out of &quot;smokeless fire&quot; (along with all of the other [[Genie#Jinn in Islam|jinn]]) and created man out of clay. The primary characteristic of the Devil, besides [[hubris]], is that he has no power other than the power to cast evil suggestions into the heart of men and women.

According to [[Muslim theology]], Iblis was expelled from the grace of God when he disobeyed God by choosing not to pay homage to Adam, the father of all mankind. He claimed to be superior to Adam, on the grounds that man was created of earth unlike himself. As for the angels, they prostrated before Adam to show their homage and obedience to God. However, Iblis, adamant in his view that man is inferior, and unlike angels was given the ability to choose, made a choice of not obeying God. This caused him to be expelled by God, a fact that Iblis blamed on humanity. Initially, the Devil was successful in deceiving Adam, but once his intentions became clear, [[Adam and Eve]] repented to God and were freed from their misdeeds and forgiven. God gave them a strong warning about Iblis and the fires of Hell and asked them and their children (humankind) to stay away from the deceptions of their senses caused by the Devil.

According to the verses of the [[Qur’an]], the Devil's mission until the [[Qiyamah]] or Resurrection Day (''yaum-ul-qiyama'') is to deceive Adam's children (mankind). After that, he will be put into the fires of Hell along with those whom he has deceived. The Devil is also referred to as one of the [[genie|jinns]], as they are all created from the smokeless fire. The Qur'an does not depict Iblis as the enemy of God, as God is supreme over all his creations and Iblis is just one of his creations. Iblis's single enemy is humanity. He intends to discourage humans from obeying God. Thus, humankind is warned to struggle (''[[jihad]]'') against the mischiefs of the Satan and temptations he puts them in. The ones who succeed in this are rewarded with Paradise (''jannath ul firdaus''), attainable only by righteous conduct.

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], a malevolent, superhuman entity such as a ''devil'' or ''satan'' is not believed to exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= satan |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms do, however, appear in the Bahá'í writings, where they are used as metaphors for the base nature of man. Human beings are seen to have [[free will]], and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bahá'í writings with the word ''satanic''.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;/&gt; The Bahá'í writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the &quot;insistent self&quot; or &quot;lower self&quot; which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of &quot;the Evil One&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html#pg87 |chapter = Tablet of the World | page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi quoted in {{cite book |author = Compilations |editor = Hornby, Helen (Ed.) |year = 1983 |title = Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India |isbn = 81-85091-46-3 |url = http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=4#n1738| page = 513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yazidism ===
An alternate name for the main deity in the tentatively Indo-European pantheon of the [[Yazidi]], Malek Taus, is Shaitan.&lt;ref&gt;Drower, E.S. [http://www.avesta.org/yezidi/peacock.htm The Peacock Angel]. Being Some Account of Votaries of a Secret Cult and their Sanctuaries. London: John Murray, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than Satanic, however, Yazidism is better understood as a remnant of a pre-Islamic Middle Eastern religion, and/or a [[ghulat]] [[Sufi]] movement founded by Shaykh Adi. The connection with Satan, originally made by Muslim outsiders, attracted the interest of 19th-century European travelers and esoteric writers.

== Other religions ==
=== Neopaganism ===
Christian tradition has frequently identified [[paganism|pagan]] religions and [[witchcraft]] with the influence of Satan. In the [[Early Modern Period]], the Church accused alleged witches of consorting and conspiring with Satan. Several modern conservative Christian writers, such as [[Jack Chick]] and [[James Dobson]], have depicted today's [[neopagan]] and witchcraft religions as explicitly Satanic.

Few neopagan reconstructionist traditions recognize Satan or the Devil outright. However, many neopagan groups worship some sort of [[Horned God]], for example as a consort of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Great Goddess]] in [[Wicca]]. These gods usually reflect [[mythology|mythological]] figures such as [[Cernunnos]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], and any similarity they may have to the Christian Devil seems to date back only to the 19th century, when a Christian reaction to Pan's growing importance in literature and art resulted in his image being translated to that of the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=Triumph of the Moon |page=46 |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford UniverUniversity Press |location=Oxford |id=ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Age movement ===
Participants in the [[New Age]] movement have widely varied views about Satan, the Devil, and so forth. In some forms of [[Esoteric Christianity]] Satan remains as a being of evil, or at least a metaphor for sin and materialism, but the most widespread tendency is to deny his existence altogether. [[Lucifer]], on the other hand, in the original [[Roman mythology|Roman]] sense of &quot;light-bringer&quot;, occasionally appears in the literature of certain groups as a metaphorical figure quite distinct from Satan, and without any implications of evil. For example, [[Theosophy]] founder [[Madame Blavatsky]] named her journal ''Lucifer'' since she intended it to be a &quot;bringer of light&quot;. Many New Age schools of thought follow a [[Nondualism|nondualistic]] philosophy that does not recognize a primal force for evil.[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|upright|The [[Baphomet]], adopted symbol of some [[Left-Hand Path]] systems, including [[Theistic Satanism]].]] Even when a dualistic model is followed, this is more often akin to the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese]] system of [[yin and yang]], in which good and evil are explicitly not a complementary duality. Schools of thought that do stress a spiritual war between good and evil or light and darkness include the philosophy of [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Agni Yoga]], and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]].

=== Satanism ===
{{Main|Satanism|LaVeyan Satanism|Setianism|Theistic Satanism}}
Some religions worship the Devil. This can be in a polytheistic sense where &quot;God&quot;, Satan, and others are all deities with Satan as the preferred patron; or it can be from a more monotheistic viewpoint, where God is regarded as a true god, but is nevertheless defied.

Some variants deny the existence of God and the Devil altogether, but still call themselves [[Satanism|Satanists]], such as [[Anton LaVey|Anton LaVey's]] [[Church Of Satan]] which sees Satan as a representation of the primal and natural state of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/home.html |title=Church of Satan official statement of beliefs |publisher=Churchofsatan.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much &quot;Satanic&quot; lore does not originate from actual Satanists, but from Christians. Best-known would be the [[medieval]] [[folklore]] and [[theology]] surrounding [[demons]] and [[witches]]. A more recent example is the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] scare of the 1980s – beginning with the memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]''&amp;nbsp;– which depicts Satanism as a vast (and unsubstantiated) conspiracy of elites with a predilection for [[child abuse]] and [[human sacrifice]]. This genre regularly describes Satan as actually appearing in person in order to receive worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm |title=SATANISM: Real &amp; imaginary |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar concepts in other religions ==
=== Zoroastrianism ===
{{Main|Angra Mainyu}}

In the [[Gathas]], the oldest texts of the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]], believed to have been composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself, the poet does not mention a manifest adversary. [[Ahura Mazda]]'s Creation is &quot;truth&quot;, ''[[asha]]''. The &quot;lie&quot; (''druj'') is manifest only as decay or chaos, not an entity.

Later, in [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), Ahura Mazda and the principle of evil, [[Angra Mainyu]], are the &quot;twin&quot; offspring of Zurvan, 'Time'. No trace of Zurvanism exists after the 10th century.

Today, the [[Parsis]] of India largely accept the 19th century interpretation that Angra Mainyu is the 'Destructive Emanation' of [[Ahura Mazda]]. Instead of struggling against Mazda himself, Angra Mainyu battles Spenta Mainyu, Mazda's 'Creative Emanation.'

=== Hinduism ===
In contrast to Christianity and Islam, [[Hinduism]] does not recognize any central evil force or entity such as the Devil opposing God and man. Hinduism does recognize that different beings (e.g., [[asuras]]) and entities can perform evil acts, under the temporary dominance of the [[guna]] of ''[[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'', and cause worldly sufferings. The Rajasic and Tamasic Gunas of Maya are considered especially close to the Abrahamic concept, the hellish parts of the Ultimate Delusion called &quot;Prakriti&quot;. An embodiment of this is the concept of Advaita (non-dualism) where there is no good or evil but simply different levels of realization.

On the other hand in Hinduism, which provides plenty of room for counterpoint, there is also the notion of dvaita (dualism) where there is interplay between good and evil tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaivam.org/hipgodco.htm |title=Hindu Concept of God |publisher=Shaivam.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent asura is [[Rahu]] whose characteristics are similar to those of the Devil. However, Hindus, and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] in particular, believe that an avatar of [[Vishnu]] incarnates to defeat evil when evil reaches its greatest strength. The concept of [[Guna]] and [[Karma in Hinduism|Karma]] also explain evil to a degree, rather than the influence of a devil.

To be more specific, Hindu philosophy defines that the only existing thing (Truth) is the Almighty God. So, all the [[asura|asuric]] tendencies are inferior and mostly exist as illusions in the mind. Asuras are also different people in whom bad motivations and intentions ([[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]) have temporarily outweighed the good ones ([[Sattva]]). Different beings like ''siddha'', ''[[gandharva]]'', ''[[yaksha]]'' etc. are considered beings unlike mankind, and in some ways superior to men.

In [[Ayyavazhi]], officially an offshoot of Hinduism prominent in [[Tamil Nadu]] (a southern state in India with [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] heritage), followers, unlike most other branches of Hinduism, believes in a [[Satan]]-like figure, [[Kroni]]. Kroni, according to Ayyavazhi is the primordial manifestation of evil and manifests in various forms of evil, i.e., [[Ravana]], [[Duryodhana]], etc., in different ages or [[yuga]]s. In response to such manifestation of evil, believers, in Ayya-Vazhi religion believe that God, as [[Vishnu]] manifests in His [[Avatar]]s such as [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] to defeat evil. Eventually, the [[Ekam]] with the spirit (the spirit taken by Narayana only for incarnating in the world) of [[Narayana]] incarnates in the world as [[Ayya Vaikundar]] to destroy the final manifestaion of Kroni, [[Kaliyan]].

Kroni, the spirit of [[Kali Yuga]] is said to be omnipresent in this age and that is one reason followers of Ayya Vazhi, like most Hindus, believe that the current yuga, Kali Yuga is so degraded.

Devil is equated to Kali Purusha in Bhavishya Purana along with Adam(Adama) and Eve(Havyavati).--&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Mara (demon)}}
A devil-like figure in Buddhism is [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]. He is a tempter, who also tempted [[Gautama Buddha]] by trying to seduce him with the vision of [[beauty|beautiful]] women who, in various legends, are often said to be Mara's daughters. Mara personifies unskillfulness, the &quot;death&quot; of the spiritual life. He tries to distract humans from practicing the spiritual life by making the mundane alluring or the negative seem positive. Another interpretation of Mara is that he is the desires that are present in ones own mind preventing the person from seeing the truth. So in a sense Mara is not an independent being but a part of one's own being that has to be defeated.
In daily life of the Buddha the role of devil has been given to [[Devadatta]].

=== Ancient Egypt ===
{{Main|Set (mythology)|Apep}}
In the Ausarian drama we find that Ausar (Greek: Osiris) is chopped into 13 pieces by Set. Auset (Isis) collects all of his pieces save his phallus. Horus, son of Ausar and Auset sets out to avenge the death and dismemberment of his father by confronting Set. Horus is victorious over Set and Ausar, being brought back from the dead becomes lord of the underworld. It is this drama that gives us the cosmic conflict between good and evil, evil being embodied by Set. This is not to say that Set was always seen as an evil character in Ancient Egyptian theology. There are many times in Ancient Egyptian history where conflicts between different &quot;houses&quot; lead to the depreciation of one god relative to another.

As in most [[polytheistic]] faiths, the characters involved differentiate themselves from the Western tradition of a devil in that all the gods are closely related. In this case, numerous historic texts suggest that Set is the Uncle or Brother of Horus and in the &quot;defeat&quot; of Set, we see another separation from the norm in the devouring/assimilation of Set into Horus with the result of Horus having depictions of both the falcon head and the (unknown animal) head of Set. This (like Buddhism) represents a dissolution of dichotomy.

In the Western Christian tradition, the Devil has entered popular [[folklore]], particularly in his role as a [[trickster]] figure. As such, he is found as a character in a wide number of traditional folktales and [[legend]]s from [[Ireland]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where he often attempts to trick or outwit other characters. In some of these tales, the Devil is portrayed as more of a folk villain than as the [[personification]] of evil. The Devil also features prominently in a number of [[hagiography|hagiographical]] tales, or tales of the saints such as the popular tale of St. [[Dunstan]], many of which may fall outside the authorized religious canon. The Devil is also a recurring feature in tales explaining the [[etymology]] of [[toponymy|geographical names]], lending his name to natural formations such as [[The Devil's Chimney]].

[[David Ferriero]], [[Archivist of the United States]], claims to have only one piece of correspondence with the Devil in the nation's vast and varied collections. A letter sent from [[Baltimore]] at the end of the [[American Civil War]] to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] leader [[Jefferson Davis]] bemoans the rebellion against the United States and is signed by &quot;the Devil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.c-span.org/Events/American-Artifacts-Inside-the-Archivists-Office/10737423396/|title=American Artifacts: Inside the Archivist’s Office|work=American History TV|publisher=National Cable Satellite Corporation (C-SPAN)|date=December 26, 2011|time=15:40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== God as the Devil ==
{{unsourced section|date=August 2012}}
{{Main|God as the Devil}}

Several religious authors{{who?|date=August 2012}} throughout history have advanced the notion that the god of the Abrahamic ''Bible'' and its sequels is consistent in character with the Devil. They make the case that the Biblical God is a divine force that wreaks suffering, death, and destruction and that tempts or commands humanity into committing mayhem and genocide.

These writings refer to the Biblical God variously as &quot;a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]]&quot;, &quot;an evil angel&quot;, &quot;the devil god&quot;, &quot;the Prince of Darkness&quot;, &quot;the source of all evil&quot;, &quot;a demon&quot;, &quot;a cruel, wrathful, warlike tyrant&quot;, &quot;Satan&quot;, &quot;the devil&quot;, and &quot;the first beast of the book of Revelation&quot;.

Many of the authors criticize only Jehovah, the God of the Abrahamic scriptures (''Tanakh''), in contrast with the &quot;true god&quot; of the New Testament. However, other authors apply their condemnation to the entire godhead of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

The authors assert their claims by reference to a number of passages in Biblical scripture describing actions of God that they say are evil or Devil-like. Many of the authors have been severely chastised for their writings, and their followers killed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

{{Refbegin}}
* ''The Origin of Satan'', by [[Elaine Pagels]] (Vintage Books, New York 1995) explores the development, the &quot;demonization&quot; of the character of Satan against the background of the bitter struggle between the early [[Christian Church|Church]] and the [[Synagogue]] to be the legitimate heir of ancient [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] religious tradition. She discusses how Satan becomes a figure that reflects our own hatreds and prejudices, and the struggle between our loving selves and our fearful, combative selves.
* ''The Old Enemy: Satan &amp; the Combat Myth'', by Neil Forsyth ([[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]], 1987) seeks to show how Satan emerged from ancient mythological traditions and is best understood not as a principle of evil, but as a narrative character in the context of &quot;the Combat Myth&quot;. Forsyth tells the Devil's story from the Epic of [[Gilgamesh]] through to the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].
* ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'', by Jeffrey Burton Russell ([[Meridian (publishers)|Meridian]], New York 1977) is &quot;a history of the personification of evil&quot; which, to make things clear, he calls &quot;the Devil&quot;. Accessible and engaging, full of photographs illustrating the text, this is the first of a four volume series on the history of the concept of the Devil. The following volumes are, Satan: The Early Christian Tradition, Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages, and Mephistopheles: The Devil in the Modern World.
* ''The Devil in Legend and Literature'', by Maximilian Rudwin ([[Open Court Publishing Company|Open Court]], [[La Salle, Illinois]], 1931, 1959) is a compendium of &quot;the secular and sacred adventures of Satan.&quot;&lt;!-- Engaging, wide-ranging and good-humored (and out-of-print for thirty years), this &quot;classic&quot; was re-printed in 1989. --&gt;
