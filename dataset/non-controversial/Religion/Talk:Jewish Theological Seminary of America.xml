==Side Box==
The side box on Judaism is poorly placed and dominates the article. Can somebody please move this to the bottom? I would if my web editing skills were better... [[User:Columbiabotany|Columbiabotany]] ([[User talk:Columbiabotany|talk]]) 16:12, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

==Eternal Light Broadcasts==
Forgive me for being a relative outsider editing this page on the JTS... but I've recently learned about the Eternal Light broadcasts and think they certainly deserve a home on Wikipedia. Since I don't have enough resources to devote a whole entry to its description, I'm hoping you'll be okay with its inclusion here. However, if anyone has more information about it, perhaps it could go in its own page and leave just a link here in this paragraph's place. [[User:Jimmithy|james waters]]

==Foundations==
I think that the history as presented here is unclear and misleading. Firstly - to categorize Morais as a moderate reformer is a little strong being that he was one of the main opponents of the Reform movement in America. Secondly, Morais had created a Jewish Seminary in Philadelphia well before the founding of JTS. Also - I am not so sure that the school was founded on the principles of the &quot;Positive-Historical&quot; approach as much as it was meant to be a rabbinical school to counteract the Reform movement. It wasn't until Shechter arrived that the school's approach began to take form. This initial ambiguity of mission comes out in the entry on the Seminary and Conservative Judaism in the Encyclopdeia Judaica. As such i think that this section requires some work. Any comments?

== &quot;Notable Faculty&quot; section ==
This section is growing and becoming a quasi-useful long list of folks' names.

I would suggest that these apparently notable people receive an inline reference, ideally citing an external source that passes [[WP:RS]], and again ideally with a quotation (see {{Tl|Cite web}} and {{TL|Cite book}} for examples of suitable formatting). We can thus make a judgment without turning the page about whether we want to follow the link. By doing this that article gets better.

An interested ad hoc group of editors did this to the Alumni section of [[Epsom College]] (unrelated to JTS in any way) and achieved a much enhanced article this way.

As it stands currently the list is just getting bigger. Is it getting better? [[User:Timtrent|Fiddle Faddle]] ([[User talk:Timtrent|talk]]) 21:19, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

:As a side note, the Notable Alumni section is better than the NF one, but could still do with some inline citation attention. [[User:Timtrent|Fiddle Faddle]] ([[User talk:Timtrent|talk]]) 21:21, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

:It looks like the changes that I just made to the page could help with this goal. I've divided up the history into different periods, so there's now space to list notable faculty for each period and give references and have more discussion of why they're notable. Once this has been accomplished, the &quot;notable faculty&quot; section can be removed. [[User:Hznhr|Hznhr]] ([[User talk:Hznhr|talk]]) 05:14, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

::OK, I think I've succeeded in discussing all of the notable faculty in the course of the article, and so I've removed the notable faculty list. To make sure that I didn't miss anyone, I'm posting the list that I worked from here.

==Prominence of GLBT text==
The GLBT text has its own main section and occupies a significant portion of the text. Without downplaying the events noted and their description, doesn't it unbalance the article? It should be a subhead within the history, or an item within current activities (a heading which does not exist). Further, given the rich history of the school, the size of the GLBT section demands the more space be given to other important events in JTS history, or that the size of this section be reduced so it does not overwhelm other parts of the article. [[User:Dovid|Dovid]] ([[User talk:Dovid|talk]]) 05:39, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

:I agree with you. I have '''been bold''' and made it a subheading so folk can see the difference and form a conclusion. I see this as a way to build consensus, and will not revert if it is re-promoted, even without consensus, to the top level. I support expansion of the other sections rather than diminution of the GLBT section. It was momentous, after all.
