==syria==
there is a lot going on in syria now. all proven and documented. shouldnt we include that in this article?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.197.162.114|108.197.162.114]] ([[User talk:108.197.162.114|talk]]) 04:13, 28 June 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The ''Syrian rebels'' certainly have been involved in massacres and violence against Christians. You should certainly add something about that with a valid source. [[User:The Mummy|The Mummy]] ([[User talk:The Mummy|talk]]) 13:14, 17 August 2012 (UTC)

==Splitting==
=== Article is too long? ===

Please consider splitting content into sub-articles and using this article for a summary of the key points of the subject.

I would agree that there should be a separate article for the historical context and one for the 20th Century contemporary era. 
This would make navigating the article more user friendly. 

[[User:Nemogbr|Nemogbr]] ([[User talk:Nemogbr|talk]]) 16:14, 25 January 2010 (UTC)
--[[User:Nemogbr|Nemogbr]] ([[User talk:Nemogbr|talk]]) 16:14, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

I am not sure if a separate article solely for contemporary examples is necessarily appropriate because the article as it is already places too much undue weight on single incidents whose newsworthiness past a single day is questionable. If these were trimmed down, the article length might possibly decrease to a reasonable length without a split being required. [[User:Munci|Munci]] ([[User talk:Munci|talk]]) 20:10, 25 January 2010 (UTC)


I have noticed that the individual incidents are included, but there are advantages to having a contemporary article, as opposed to lumping it together with the whole history of the religion. 
I do not think the Roman era and the European Middle-ages are valid alongside the last couple of centuries.

It becomes too bulky. [[User:Nemogbr|Nemogbr]] ([[User talk:Nemogbr|talk]]) 22:07, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

===Please split the article===
Some time ago the article was tagged as being too long, and a year ago the proposition was made to split off the section on &quot;Current situation (1989 to present)&quot;. Can we please proceed with this and convert the &quot;Current situation..&quot; section into &quot;Contemporay persecution of Christians&quot; or equivalent? [[User:Ekem|Ekem]] ([[User talk:Ekem|talk]]) 14:59, 6 January 2011 (UTC)

:&quot;Present&quot; needs a definition. If that is &quot;2010&quot; fine. But precision is necessary. &quot;Current&quot; is too vague and changes with time. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 20:00, 8 January 2011 (UTC)

::Splitting off is a good idea. But the title is important. I find that using the words &quot;Current&quot; or &quot;Contemporary&quot; are just an excuse to delete less modern history (and these are abused). The title of the new article should be &quot;[[Persecution of Christians by Country]]&quot; which should be a list. Countries should have their own articles and linked back to the list according to the following examples: &quot;[[Persecution of Christians in Egypt]]&quot; and &quot;[[Persecution of Christians in Turkey]]&quot;. These can be linked back to the list article which in turn is linked back to the [[Persecution of Christians]] article. In summary they could be nested like this:
::[[Persecution of Christians]]
:::[[Persecution of Christians by Country]]
::::[[Persecution of Christians in Eqypt]]
::::[[Persecution of Christians in Pakistan]]
::::[[Persecution of Christians in Turkey]] &lt;small&gt;[[User:Nipsonanomhmata|&lt;span style=&quot;color:white;background:#007&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background:#00c&quot;&gt;Nipson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background:#00e&quot;&gt;anomhmata&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Nipsonanomhmata|(Talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 13:55, 8 May 2011 (UTC)

::I thought about using [[Freedom of Religion in SpecificCountry]] instead of [[Persecution of Christians in SpecificCountry]], however, that excludes persecution that is not inclusive to [[Freedom of Religion]] (notably, discrimination is generally excluded, as is [[Freedom of Movement]], and many other freedoms and rights. &lt;small&gt;[[User:Nipsonanomhmata|&lt;span style=&quot;color:white;background:#007&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background:#00c&quot;&gt;Nipson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background:#00e&quot;&gt;anomhmata&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Nipsonanomhmata|(Talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 14:05, 8 May 2011 (UTC)

:::I don't think we want an &quot;outline&quot; per se.
:::We need to split it off by section IMO. If editors are not happy with the current subsections, I think they should reorganize them here to their satisfaction. Then move them. In either event, this will still be the main article and a summary, however short, will remain along with a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{main|Persecution of Christians in X}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 19:39, 10 May 2011 (UTC)

===Clarity on split===
I am removing the existing tags as stale as they are over a year old. It's not clear from the Split request tag, nor from the above discussions, what form of split is being proposed, nor if there is a clear consensus. The article is 78 kB readable prose size, which is at the recommended size for splitting, per [[WP:SIZESPLIT]], though, by the nature of the topic, a large article size might be appropriate, so size alone may not be a justification. I note as I glance down the article, that there are already many sub-articles - [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]], [[Persecution of Christians in the New Testament]], [[Diocletianic Persecution]], [[Anti-Catholicism]], [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union]], etc, etc, so again, it is not clear what extra form of splitting might be required. There has been a call for splitting off the modern section from the rest of the article, and if that is the consensus, then either that should be actioned, or a specific Split request tag placed on the article in the appropriate place, and a rationale given here for what is proposed. '''[[User:SilkTork|&lt;font color=&quot;#8D38C9&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;SilkTork&lt;/font&gt;]]''' '''[[User talk:SilkTork|&lt;font color=&quot;#347C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;✔Tea time&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 02:07, 1 December 2011 (UTC)

==Reliable source?==
Is [http://aua.net/assyrians/genocide/genocide_presentation.htm this source] really reliable? It is written by the deputy secretary general of [http://aua.net/aua.htm this organization]. I'm sure the base material of its assertion is true, but I think the source has added a lot of POV and likely some exagerration as well.[[User:Bless sins|Bless sins]] ([[User talk:Bless sins|talk]]) 23:14, 4 January 2012 (UTC)

== Christians and persecution ==

I believe the article could also do with a link about Christians persecuting non-Christians.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.174.247.16|110.174.247.16]] ([[User talk:110.174.247.16|talk]]) 11:58, 12 June 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Wikipedia is, if anything, and equal opportunity reporter. See template at the end of the article &quot;Religious persecution and religious discrimination.&quot; This covers everybody persecuting every other religion. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 18:59, 17 June 2012 (UTC)

::Also, [[Christianity and violence]]. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 14:31, 18 June 2012 (UTC)

== Boundaries. ==

Persecution of people who just happen to be Christian doesn't count, particularly if they were clearly persecuted for an unrelated reason, such as race. I'm not sure that we should count persecution of Christians by Christians over internecine issues, either. That's more like '''Infighting among Christians'''. [[User:Still-24-45-42-125|Still-24-45-42-125]] ([[User talk:Still-24-45-42-125|talk]]) 01:54, 11 August 2012 (UTC)

== Does Israel persecute Christians? Or significantly discriminate against them? ==

A Christian friend recently returned from Israel and told me that Israel persecutes Christians by severe discrimination against them including refusal to issue passports.

When I Google the words: Israel persecution of Christians I get a number of hits including from 60 minutes which has an episode on youtube:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1z4oHygPo 
I haven't watched it but it seems it is a debate about whether the assertion is true of not.

Are Christians persecuted in Israel? Are they significantly discriminated against eg as I understand Korean descent people are in Japan?

Another website which seem to support that there is at least strong discrimination is at:
http://www.persecution.org/category/countries/middle-east/israel/

Should reference be made to this in this article? Even if there is &quot;only&quot; severe discrimination against them rather than persecution (or is that just a semantic difference)?
[[User:Phanly|dinghy]] ([[User talk:Phanly|talk]]) 10:05, 29 October 2012 (UTC)
:Depends on your definition.  Does discrimination include being the only Middle Eastern country where their population is growing? If so, I'd say yes. 
:Here's another tip - don't believe everything on YouTube or some website that anyone can publish.  If you have reliable sources, bring it. --&lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px dashed;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Jethro B|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;Jethro&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User talk:Jethro B|&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;B&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 15:28, 29 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
