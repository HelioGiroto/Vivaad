      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43074">The term '''Hyper-Calvinism''' is used in the writings of [[Iain Murray]], Curt Daniel, Peter Toon and others who seek to defend an offer of salvation for all who hear the gospel and a universal duty upon all to receive the salvation offered. 

The controversy over indiscriminate gospel offers and duty-faith historically arose from within the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] tradition among the early [[England|English]] [[Particular Baptists]] in the mid 18th century. It can be seen in the teachings of men like [[Joseph Hussey]] (d. 1726), [[John Skepp]] (d. 1721), [[Lewis Wayman]] (d. 1764), [[John Brine]] (d. 1765), [[William Gadsby]] (d. 1844) and [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]] (d. 1771). It became widespread among the English Particular Baptists of that day, though some Particular Baptists disagreed with the views of Wayman, Skepp, and Brine.

Opposition to duty-faith and indiscriminate gospel offers had a large influence among the particular baptist denominations during the 18th and 19th centuries. In more modern times, these views have been preserved among the [[Gospel Standard]] or [[Strict Baptists]] churches and certain [[Primitive Baptist]] churches. 

==Definition==
Peter Toon notes that the expression &quot;Hyper-Calvinism&quot; came to be generally used in the 19th century. &quot;The terms ‘False Calvinism’ and ‘High Calvinism’ were used in the latter part of the 18th century to describe what we have described as ‘Hyper-Calvinism’. It was only in the 19th century that the expression Hyper-Calvinism came to be generally used to describe the same doctrinal system which some people in the 18th century called High Calvinism.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Peter Toon,The Emergence of Hyper-Calvinism
in English Nonconformity  [http://www.anglicanbooksrevitalized.us/Peter_Toons_Books_Online/History/hypercal1.htm source]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers define Hyper-Calvinism as a denial of the need or desirability to present a universal call to repent and believe the gospel. Other writers describe it in terms of emphasis.

===Denial of a universal call to repent and believe the gospel===
'''[[Iain Murray]]'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Hyper-Calvinism in its attempt to square all truth with God's purpose to save the elect, denies that there is a universal command to repent and believe, and asserts that we have only warrant to invite to Christ those who are conscious of a sense of sin and need. In other words, it is those who have been spiritually quickened to seek a Saviour and not those who are in the death of unbelief and indifference, to whom the exhortations of the Gospel must be addressed. In this way a scheme was devised for restricting the Gospel to those who there is reason to suppose are elect.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Iain Murray, The Forgotten Spurgeon (Banner of Truth, 1998), p. 47. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jKg9AAAAYAAJ&amp;q=iain+Murray,+The+Forgotten+Spurgeon&amp;dq=iain+Murray,+The+Forgotten+Spurgeon&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eDKVTN7tFISgsQOA9836Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Engelsma'''&lt;/br&gt;
&quot;Hyper-Calvinism is the denial that God in the preaching of the gospel calls everyone who hears the preaching to repent and believe. It is the denial that the church should call everyone in the preaching. It is the denial that the unregenerated have a duty to repent and believe. It manifests itself in the practice of the preacher’s addressing the call of the gospel, &quot;repent and believe on Christ crucified,&quot; only to those in his audience who show signs of regeneration and, thereby, of election, namely, some conviction of sin and some interest in salvation.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;David J. Engelsma, Hyper-Calvinism &amp; the Call of the Gospel, 1994 [http://books.google.com/books?id=AHxpAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=David+Engelsma+hyper+calvinism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jhuVTLr6II7CsAPUyojBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Peter Toon]]'''&lt;/br&gt;
Peter Toon states that Hyper-Calvinism &quot;made no distinction between the secret and revealed will of God, and tried to deduce the duty of men from what it taught concerning the secret, eternal decrees of God. This led to the notion that grace must only be offered to those for whom it was intended.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Peter Toon, The Emergence of Hyper-Calvinism in English Non-Conformity, 1967 [http://www.anglicanbooksrevitalized.us/Peter_Toons_Books_Online/History/hypercal1.htm source]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description in terms of emphasis===
'''Curt Daniel'''&lt;/br&gt;
Curt Daniel defines Hyper-Calvinism as &quot;...that school of supralapsarian Five Point Calvinism which so stresses the sovereignty of God by overemphasizing the secret over the revealed will and eternity over time, that it minimizes the responsibility of Man, notably with respect to the denial of the word ‘offer’ in relation to the preaching of the Gospel of a finished and limited atonement, thus undermining the universal duty of sinners to believe savingly with assurance that the Lord Jesus Christ died for them.&quot;... it is the rejection of the word offer in connection with evangelism for supposedly Calvinistic reasons... the only real and tangible thing which differentiates the Hyper from the High-Calvinist is the word offer.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Curt Daniel, Hyper-Calvinism and John Gill, 1983 [http://books.google.com/books?id=KNzMSQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Curt+Daniel,+Hyper-Calvinism+and+John+Gill&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HhyVTMrNE4SksQPfl4HlCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA source]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic definition of the term===
Despite the doctrine of [[limited atonement]] being taught in a common [[Calvinist]] creed known as [[Canons of Dort]] (1619)&lt;ref name=&quot;dort&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/dort.htm |title=Canons of Dort |location=SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 8. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;Hyper-Calvinism&quot; in previous generations has been used to define those who reject universal atonement or a general design in the death of Christ.&lt;br&gt;
'''George Croft (1825)'''&lt;/br&gt;
&quot;Should it be asked, whether all Calvinists differ from Arminians, only in reference to effectual grace and perseverance, it is frankly acknowledged, that there are some who differ from them in other points. These persons are generally styled High-Calvinists, or Hyper-Calvinists. Hyper signifies above, and Hyper-Calvinists are so called, because their system is above genuine Calvinism. The Hyper-Calvinist holds the particular design of Christ's death, but denies its general design; whereas moderate or modern Calvinists, as they are called, hold both.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Croft, The Christian instructor, 1825 [http://books.google.com/books?id=A9gGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=hyper+calvinism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lB2VTJnnGJS4sAPlkPnACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=hyper%20calvinism&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Protestant dictionary (1904)'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Some who teach particular redemption, as Calvin taught it, hold with Calvin the theory of universal atonement, and others, who are hyper-Calvinists, maintain that of a limited atonement. The Calvinists would make the offer of salvation to all, but the hyper-Calvinists would limit the scope of the Gospel invitations to the elect; some go so far as to refuse to press upon the sinner the acceptance of salvation.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;A Protestant dictionary by Charles Henry Hamilton Wright, Charles Neil, 1904 [http://books.google.com/books?id=B4eFbRYVc94C&amp;pg=PA575&amp;dq=hyper+calvinism+limited+atonement&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qQNFTajCCIa-sAOGoJnzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
===The Gospel Standard Articles of Faith===
&quot;We believe that the eternal redemption which Christ has obtained by the shedding of His blood is special and particular; that is to say, that it was intentionally designed only for the Elect of God, the Sheep of Christ, who therefore alone share in the special and peculiar blessings thereof.&quot; (ARTICLE 6, PARTICULAR REDEMPTION) &quot;We believe that the invitations of the Gospel, being spirit and life, are intended only for those who have been made by the blessed Spirit to feel their lost state as sinners and their need of Christ as their Saviour, and to repent of and forsake their sins.&quot; (ARTICLE 24, GOSPEL INVITATIONS) &quot;We deny that Christ died for all mankind.&quot; (ARTICLE 25, UNIVERSAL REDEMPTION DENIED) &quot;We deny duty faith and duty repentance – these terms signifying that it is every man’s duty to spiritually and savingly repent and believe. We deny also that there is any capability in man by nature to any spiritual good whatever. So that we reject the doctrine that men in a state of nature should be exhorted to believe in or turn to God.&quot; (ARTICLE 26, DUTY FAITH AND DUTY REPENTANCE DENIED) &quot;We deny that the Holy Spirit ever enlightens the non-elect, to make them capable at all of receiving grace.&quot; (ARTICLE 27, THE NON-ELECT INCAPABLE OF RECEIVING GRACE) &quot;We reject the doctrine called “Baxterianism”; that is to say, that while all the elect shall assuredly be saved, there is a residuum of grace in Christ for the rest, or any of the rest, if they will only accept it.&quot; (ARTICLE 28, BAXTERIANISM DENIED) &quot;While we believe that the Gospel is to be preached in or proclaimed to all the world, as in Mark 16. 15, we deny offers of grace; that is to say, that the gospel is to be offered indiscriminately to all.&quot; (ARTICLE 29, INDISCRIMINATE OFFERS OF GRACE DENIED) &lt;ref&gt;The Gospel Standard Articles of Faith and Rules [http://www.gospelstandard.org.uk/files/Articles.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duty-faith in relation to Adam===
Wayman contends that saving faith was not in the power of man at his best before [[fall of man|the fall]] and therefore makes the following deduction, &quot;What Adam had, we all had in him; and what Adam lost, we all lost in him, and are debtors to God on both accounts; but Adam had not the faith of God's [[Predestination (Calvinism)|elect]] before the fall, and did not lose it for his posterity; therefore they are not debtors to God for it while in unregeneracy&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''A Further Enquiry after Truth'', London: J &amp; J. Marshall, 1738, p.&amp;nbsp;51. [this book is by Lewis Wayman and sold by J. &amp; J. Marshall] [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3239417/Cite library source]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Brine gives some insight into Wayman's statement. Brine taught that every duty incumbent on Adam in his unfallen state he also had the ability to perform, and this duty extends to all men in their fallen state regardless of their lack of ability. Brine maintained that a lack of ability does not release a man from duty (with which most Calvinists would agree), but he sees salvation in a different category because, &quot;with respect to special faith in Christ, it seems to me that the powers of man in his perfected state were not fitted and disposed to that act&quot; &lt;ref&gt;A Refutation of Arminian Principles, John Brine, 1743 [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Duty%20Faith/John_Brine_A_Refutation[1&amp;#93;.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

William Styles reasoned that if saving faith was a duty in the law, it must have been a duty upon Adam to trust in the blood and righteousness of Christ while in a state of innocency. &quot;If spiritual Faith is a natural duty—namely, if it is obligatory on account of the relation in which men stand to God as creatures to their Creator—it is commanded by the Moral Law, and it was incumbent on Adam as much as on any of his posterity. That it is not commanded by the Moral Law is admitted—or if denied involves absurdity. Faith is the trust of a sinner as such in the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ. If, then, spiritual Faith is a creature duty, it was incumbent on Adam in a state of innocency to trust as a sinner in the redemptive work of Christ. For which none contend.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;William Styles, Manual of Faith and Practice, 1897 [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Pdf/William_Styles_Baptist_Manual_Complete_5a.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duty-faith in relation to the atonement of Christ===
====Interactions with Arminianism====
Many Calvinistic ministers defended the doctrine of [[Atonement (limited view)|particular redemption]] by denying the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] view of duty faith. The Arminian [[Daniel Whitby]] opposed the doctrine of particular redemption because of duty faith. He wrote, &quot;Now if it were the duty, even of them who perish under the preaching of the gospel, to own Christ as their Saviour, and to believe to the salvation of their souls, it follows either that it is, and, in all generations since our Saviour's coming, was, their duty to believe a lie, and to apply that to them which belonged not to them; or that Christ's death might truly have been applied to, and therefore was most certainly intended for, the salvation of those souls that perish.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Daniel Whitby, A Discourse [http://www.google.com/books?id=D809AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;vq=fall+away&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=fall%20away&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt; A defense of duty faith arose from the Arminians who considered the doctrine of limited atonement to be inconsistent with the universal offer and duty-faith. [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] reasoned against the Calvinistic view of the atonement when he wrote, &quot;...all consistent preaching must be based on the supposition that no one can be saved except the elect for whom Christ died, and all offers of salvation made to others must be based on falsehood and insincerity... all offers of salvation made to those for whom Christ did not bear the penalty of the law must be based on falsehood and insincerity.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes, The Atonement [http://books.google.com/books?id=Rlq03Cjej0YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Albert+Barnes,+The+Atonement&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YyOVTJu-B4bSsAPxhoHACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Calvinistic ministers answered these common arguments by refuting the Arminian view of duty faith and the free offer of redemption. They reasoned that if duty faith and the free offer are true: 1. God may be charged with offering a lie and commanding souls to receive the blessings of this lie by faith. 2. The doctrine of particular and limited atonement must be inconsistent with the free offer and duty faith. W. Kitchen reasoned that duty faith would imply a universal design in the atonement. He wrote, &quot;Duty-faith, then, calls upon every one who hears the gospel to exercise a faith which at once gives him the warrant to believe, and will ultimately give him to know, that Jesus loved him and gave himself for him...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;W. KITCHEN, The Voice of Truth; or, Strict baptists' magazine, January 1867 [http://books.google.com/books?id=cSgEAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source] Note: the article starts on pg. 5 and continues on pg. 27 after pg.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Barnes rejected the doctrine of limited atonement by rejecting the literal payment for sin in Christ's death. He wrote, &quot;If it were a literal payment of a debt; for a payment of a debt could not be general; that is, the payment of a specific sum of money due to another would not be a transaction of such a nature that a third person could avail himself of that payment as a reason why he should be discharged from the obligation of paying a claim on him.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes, The Atonement [http://books.google.com/books?id=Rlq03Cjej0YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Albert+Barnes,+The+Atonement&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YyOVTJu-B4bSsAPxhoHACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Calvinistic ministers have defended the doctrine of limited atonement by defending the doctrine of a literal payment for the sins of the elect by the atonement of Jesus Christ. &quot;While cheerfully admitting the sufficiency of Immanuel’s death to have redeemed all mankind, had all the sins of the whole human species been equally imputed to him; and had he, as the Universal Representative, sustained that curse of the law which was due to all mankind; yet we cannot perceive any solid reason to conclude, that his propitiatory sufferings are sufficient for the expiation of sins which he did not bear, or for the redemption of sinners whom he did not represent, as a sponsor, when he expired on the cross. For the substitution of Christ, and the imputation of sin to him, are essential to the scriptural doctrine of redemption by our adorable Jesus.–We may, therefore, safely conclude, that our Lord’s voluntary substitution, and redemption by his vicarious death, are both of them limited to those, for whom he was made sin–for whom he was made a curse–and for whose deliverance from final ruin, he actually paid the price of his own blood.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Abraham Booth, “Divine Justice Essential to the Divine Character,” in The Works of Abraham Booth, 1813 [http://books.google.com/books?id=YEwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Abraham+Booth,+“Divine+Justice+Essential+to+the+Divine+Character,”+in+The+Works+of+Abraham+Booth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=biSVTIayFJCqsAOL9OzkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]  Note: see pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interactions with Andrew Fuller and Neonomianism====
[[Andrew Fuller]] was a minister among the particular baptist who is well known for defending duty-faith and the free offer. Andrew Fuller sought to reconcile the free offer with particular redemption by teaching that there was a universal sufficiency in the atonement. He writes, &quot;In short, we must either acknowledge an objective fulness in Christ's atonement, sufficient for the salvation of the whole world to believe in Him; or, in opposition to the Scripture and common sense, confine our invitation to believe, to such persons as have believed already.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fuller, The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation [http://books.google.com/books?id=KSkNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Andrew+Fuller,+The+Gospel+Worthy+of+All+Acceptation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eCaVTM71DIGasAOZ1_2_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Andrew Fuller's view was rejected by many Calvinistic ministers. Many considered his arguments to be [[Neonomianism]]. William Rushton replied to Andrew Fuller's statement by writing, &quot;This is the marrow of what has been called Neonomianism; which doctrine, as to substance, is taught in the writings of Mr. Baxter, of the Arminians, and of the most learned of the Roman Catholics... All the efficacy unto justification which Mr. Fuller allows to the obedience and death of Christ is, that the Redeemer merited this great blessing for us, on the conditions of our believing the gospel; or, in other words, that the blood of Christ hath merited salvation for us, on milder terms than those required by the law of works... The conditional sufficiency for the justification of the whole world, which Mr. Fuller ascribes to the work of Christ, places all the efficacy thereof in the act of believing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;William Rushton, A defense of Particular Redemption, 1831 [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Pdf/William_Rushton_PARTICULAR_REDEMPTION.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy was not only over duty faith and the free offer, but it was also over the intention and purpose of the atonement. If it could be proved by the Arminians that the atonement was designed to provide the opportunity of redemption for all men universally, then the atonement would not be inconsistent with duty faith and the free offer. Andrew Fuller writes, &quot;If the atonement of Christ were considered as the literal payment of a debt, it might, for aught I know, be inconsistent with indefinite invitations.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Fuller, The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation [http://books.google.com/books?id=KSkNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Andrew+Fuller,+The+Gospel+Worthy+of+All+Acceptation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eCaVTM71DIGasAOZ1_2_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt; John Stevens made an open reply to Andrew Fuller's book by writing an entire book addressing Andrew Fuller's statements. John Stevens put forth this argument, &quot;It has been, and still is, thought to be very inconsistent and absurd, to suppose that God can have made it the duty of any man to believe in Christ for the salvation of his soul, or, that he can have promised salvation to him on his so believing, when all the while his salvation was not the end for which he died.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Stevens, Help for the True Disciples of Emmanuel: Being an answer to a book, Published by the late Rev. Andrew Fuller, entitled The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation; or, The Duty of Sinners to Believe in Christ. [http://www.mountzionrarebookspbc.org/PDF%20BOOKS/John%20Stevens/An%20Answer.htm source]&lt;/ref&gt; Many have considered Andrew Fuller's teaching to be rooted in Neonomianism. Fuller expressed such views in these words, &quot;Yet, to speak of sins as being pardoned before they are repented of, or even committed, is not only to maintain that on which the Scriptures are silent, but to contradict the current language of their testimony. If all our sins, past, present, and to come, were actually forgiven, either when Christ laid down his -life, or even on our first believing, why did David speak of 'confessing his transgression,&quot; and of God &quot;forgiving his iniquity?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Works, vol.1, p.&amp;nbsp;282 [http://books.google.com/books?id=vDsYAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=andrew+fuller&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zyeVTKG9CYG4sQPenem_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical Understanding of Duty-faith and the Law of Works===
For [[John Brine]] and others, the argument against duty faith focuses on understanding the difference between works of the law and faith in Christ unto salvation. John Brine writes, &quot;The Law is not of Faith: It doth not present the Object of Faith, that all will allow. Nor doth it direct to the Act of Faith in Christ, as a Saviour. The Law, as a Covenant, requires Obedience, in order to Acceptance, and receiving the promised Reward. Do and live is the Language of it, but not believe and be saved: Yea, it is so far from requiring Faith in Christ for Salvation, that it allows not the Subject of it to hope for Deliverance from Misery.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Brine, Motives to Love and Unity Among Calvinists who Differ on some Points [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Duty%20Faith/JOHN_BRINE_ANSWER.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt; In short, if it could be proven that the law does command sinners to trust in Christ as their savior, then John Brine's argument would not be able to support the denial of duty faith. Many Calvinists opposed duty faith because it teaches that saving faith is a duty commanded in the Law of works, as Job Hupton writes, &quot;While the two covenants are distinct, the things belonging to the one, must be kept separate from those pertaining to the other. The blessings of that of grace cannot, with the least shadow of propriety, be said to be the duties of that of works.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Job Hupton, A Blow Struck at the Root of Fullerism [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Toplady/Job_Hupton_Fullerism.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Orthodox Position of the Reformed Calvinists==
===John Calvin===
'''He invites to himself both the reprobate and the elect in common'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Last of all, David confesses that it was entirely owing to the pure grace of God that he had come to possess so great a good, and that he had been made a partaker of it by faith. It would be of no advantage to us for God to offer himself freely and graciously to us, if we did not receive him by faith, seeing he invites to himself both the reprobate and the elect in common; but the former, by their ingratitude, defraud themselves of this inestimatable blessing.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;Calvin, Psalms 16:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offered to all the world'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;That, then, is how our Lord Jesus bore the sins and iniquities of many. But in fact, this word “many” is often as good as equivalent to “all“. And indeed, our Lord Jesus was offered to all the world. For it is not speaking of three or four when it says: ‘For God so loved the world, that he spared not His only Son.” But yet we must notice that the Evangelist adds in this passage: “That whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but obtain eternal life.” Our Lord Jesus suffered for all, and there is neither great nor small who is not inexcusable today, for we can obtain salvation through him. Unbelievers who turn away from Him and who deprive themselves of him by their malice are today doubly culpable. For how will they excuse their ingratitude in not receiving the blessing in which they could share by faith?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Sermons on Isaiah’s Prophecy of the Death and Passion of Christ, 52:12, p., 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Their unbelief prevents them'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;“To bear,” or, “take away sins”, is to free from guilt by his satisfaction those who have sinned. He says the sins of many, that is, of all, as in Romans 5:15. It is yet certain that not all receive benefit from the death of Christ; but this happens, because their unbelief prevents them.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Hebrews 9:28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confessions and Catechisms===
'''The Westminster Standards'''&lt;br&gt;
The word &quot;offer&quot; or &quot;free offer&quot; was used in the [[Westminster Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Confession of Faith VII/III [http://www.gracefallbrook.org/westminster_standards/The_Westminster_Confession_of_Faith.pdf source]; Larger Catechism Ans. 32, 63, 68 [http://www.puritanseminary.org/media/Larger_Catechism.pdf source]; Shorter Catechism Ans. 31 and 86 [http://www.puritanseminary.org/media/Shorter_Catechism.pdf source].&lt;/ref&gt; The Larger Catechism leaves no room for doubt that the word is used in reference to non-elect persons; &quot;...who, for their wilful neglect and contempt of grace offered to them, being justly left in their unbelief, do never truly come to Jesus Christ&quot; (Larger Catechism Ans. 68).

'''Question &amp; Answers on the Shorter Catechism'''&lt;br&gt;
In the 18th century, John Brown answered questions on the free offer and duty-faith in his &quot;Question &amp; Answers on the Shorter Catechism.&quot; He wrote, &quot;Q. Doth God command every man that hears the gospel to take his gift Christ out of his hand ?—A. Yes ; under pain of his most dreadful wrath, 1 John iii. 23. Q. What mean you by Christ's offer of himself?—A. His holding forth himself as able and willing to save, and inviting sinners to receive salvation from him. Q. To whom doth Christ offer himself?—A. To every one that hears the gospel, without exception, Prov. viii. 4. Q. In what manner is Christ offered in the gospel ?—A. Fully, freely, earnestly, and indefinitely, Isa. lv... Q. How is Christ offered indefinitely ?—A. The gospel offer of him suits every hearer's case as exactly as if he was named in it, Rev. iii. 17, 18. Q. What do you understand by embracing of Christ as offered in the gospel 1—A. A particular persuasion that Christ in the promise is mine; and made of God to me wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; and trusting on his word, that he will act up to all his saving characters to me in order to promote my everlasting salvation... Q. How do we receive him in agreeableness to his being indefinitely offered?—A. By applying the offer as particularly to ourselves as if it had pointed us out by name, and were not to another, Gal. ii. 20.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Brown, Questions &amp; Answers on the Shorter Catechism, 1796 [http://books.google.com/books?id=wigPAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shorter+catechism+john+brown&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pSiVTM6aHJOCsQOchJzACg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes from teachers who opposed duty-faith and the free offer==
===Answering duty-faith===
'''Christopher Ness'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Evangelical repentance is the gift of free grace; faith is the gift of God. What is God's, as a gift to bestow, cannot be man's duty to perform as a condition of salvation. Those who are invited to look to Christ, to come to Him for salvation, are very minutely described: they are the weary and heavy laden with sin, the penitent, the hungry and thirsty soul, etc., etc.; these are the characters invited to come to and believe in Christ, and not all men (Mt 11:28; Isa 55:1; Mr 2:17).&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ness (1621–1705) (An Antidote Against Arminianism by Christopher Ness [http://www.todaysprophecy.com/An%20Antidote%20Against%20Arminianism%20by%20Christopher%20Ness.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J.H. Gosden'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;We believe that all men are under obligation to believe and obey God. Though the Adam Fall utterly depraved and alienated human nature from God and goodness, rendering him as entirely incapable as unwilling to submit to God's law, yet the divine Lawgiver has not lost His power to command and to judge. Man's inability does not exonerate him...  But what is every man duty-bound to believe? Surely not that each individual is himself interested in the redemption work of Christ, Man is not called upon to believe a lie.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Gospel Standard Baptist Articles of Faith by J.H. Gosden [http://books.google.com/books?id=JyHxYdhZM2kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=J.H.+Gosden&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qymVTKvGLIrWtQPxnNm_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Styles'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;If Faith be a duty, it is a work; but according to the reasoning of the Apostle, the works of the Law are contradistinguished from Faith. Yet if Faith be a natural duty—though we are saved by grace—it is through the works of the law. The Covenant of Works is blended with the Covenant of Grace, and &quot;grace is no more grace.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;William Styles, A Manual of Faith and Practice, [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Pdf/William_Styles_Baptist_Manual_Complete_5a.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Taylor'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A man is called upon to believe in God so far as his knowledge goes of God, both in His works of grace and His works of providence. No man is called upon to believe what he never heard... To believe in Christ as my own Saviour is purely a spiritual act; and before I can do this, it is certain I must have a revelation of Christ to my soul.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Taylor, Deceiving the Souls of Thousands, 1875 [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Pdf/BENJAMIN%20TAYLOR%20DECEVING%20SOULS%20OF%20THOUSANDS.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Foreman'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;...faith cannot be separated from any part of its connection and interest... If faith unto salvation be the natural man's duty, then it must be the natural man's duty to be all that the actual believer, through grace unto salvation, really and properly is... it must be the natural man's duty to have all what the actual believer through grace unto salvation truly and properly has, according to the word of God... it must be the natural man's duty for God himself to be to him all what by promise and gift he is to those who through grace do believe unto salvation... it must be the natural man's duty for God to do for him, and give to him, all what by promise he does and gives to those who through grace do really believe unto salvation... If duty faith were a truth, it must have some meaning with God in regard to salvation; and such a meaning too, as that if it were the universal duty of all men, wherever the gospel comes, to believe unto salvation, then salvation would be as universal as the spread of the gospel, if all men did but do their duty.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Foreman, Duty Faith, 1860 [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Pdf/JOHN_FOREMAN_DUTY_FAITH_2007.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[William Huntington (preacher)|William Huntington]]'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;...such doctrine [duty-faith] had no good effect, either upon the saint, or upon the sinner: not to the saint, for he was sent to Moses for help; nor to the sinner, for he was sent to the physician before he was sick. Nor will God ever attend with his blessing and his seal such a doctrine as this to the conversion of any soul living... There is a great difference between law and gospel, works and grace, the letter and the Spirit; and between a legal commandment and a life-giving commandment.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;William Huntington, Excommunication [http://williamhuntington.net/Works/Volume11/11002.htm source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[John Gill (theologian)| John Gill ]]'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;...the law is not of faith, so faith is not of the law. There is a faith indeed which the law requires and obliges to, namely, faith and trust in God, as the God of nature and providence; for as both the law of nature, and the law of Moses, show there is a God, and who is to be worshipped; they both require a belief of him, and trust and confidence in him... moreover the law obliges men to give credit to any revelation of the mind and will of God he has made, or should think fit to make unto them at any time; but as for special faith in Christ as a Saviour, or believing in him to the saving of the soul; this the law knows nothing of, nor does it make it known.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;(John Gill, The Body of Divinity: Of the Gospel [http://www.pbministries.org/books/gill/gills_archive.htm source])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Answering indiscriminate offers===
'''[[Robert Hawker]]'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;...They make offers of CHRIST to such, in direct contradiction to Scripture: and, instead of inviting, as JESUS did, the weary and heavy laden only; and as his servants were commanded to do, the thirsty; they invite all. Reader! I beseech you for a moment to consider this subject, and, if the LORD be your teacher, you will soon discover the fallacy of it; and learn, that such men are guided by the pride and vanity of their own heart, (as if they possessed the power of persuasion,) and are not taught of GOD... Invitations to come to CHRIST, And exhortations to follow CHRIST, are addressed only to the Church. Paul's exhortation in this place begins, finally brethren. And all his Epistles, are to the faithful in CHRIST JESUS, and the called to be saints... Cast out the bond-woman and her son, is the language of the HOLY GHOST: for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. 2 Corinthians 1:29. 1 Corinthians 3:21-23. Galatians 4:22. to the end. Upon what grounds can men make offers of CHRIST to the world at large, in the face of these scriptures? It is like holding money to the view of a prisoner looking through his iron window on those passing by; but holding it out beyond all possibility of his reaching it... I expect that great opposition will be made to this statement, if it so happens, that my Poor Man's Commentary should fall under the eye of any of the Pharisaical characters I have been alluding to. But these things affect me, not. Those evidences I have brought, are sound, and scriptural. To show such men, that the powers of persuasion they think they possess, are more sound without meaning, as to do by them, as by the idols of Micah: taking away their gods, and what have they more? Judges 18:24... If men would, or could, read their Bibles under GOD the SPIRIT'S teaching, they would soon discover, the mighty difference, between preaching the Gospel, and inviting men to CHRIST, or making offers of CHRIST, whom GOD invites not, and to whom no offers are made. Preaching the Gospel, or preaching CHRIST, which is one and the same, is to be done to the mixed multitude, as the Apostles did. Reader! ponder well the subject; for it is highly important. If we would, or could discern, between preaching CHRIST, which, as I said before, if truly ordained by the HOLY GHOST, they are directed to do; and offering CHRIST, which is little short of blasphemy to attempt: they would shudder at the latter, and go forth with the deepest humility, and not fleshly pride, to the former. And yet, so little apprehensive are some of these self-taught men, of the vast difference, in the work; that they not only offer CHRIST without reserve, to all they meet, both in their preachings, and writings; but they urge their hearers, or readers; to an instant accepting, and to lay hold of the present opportunity, lest another should not be afforded them. If the subject was not so truly solemn as it is, one might be tempted to smile, at such ignorance, and presumption. As if their persuasion, and not GOD'S grace, was the cause of acceptance. And as if that grace depended upon the will of man, to improve it, in the moment of man's offer, or it would be lost forever. Oh! what a different statement the LORD the SPIRIT gives, of those, who received CHRIST which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of GOD. John 1:12, 13.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Robert Hawker, Commentary from Philippians 4 [http://grace-ebooks.com/library/index.php?dir=Robert%20Hawker/ source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[John Brine]]'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;With respect to offers and tenders of mercy and salvation to sinners I observe: That Christ and his salvation are to be proposed for acceptance, to all who see their need of him, that this includes an offer in it, but is more than an offer, and that he is graciously given to them, and ‘tis their duty to embrace and receive him.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The Sermons of John Brine - Sermon 9: A Refutation of Arminian Principles, John Brine, 1743 [http://sermonplayer.com/c/Abrahamjuliot/pdf/2753324_17080.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]]'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The gospel is indeed ordered to be preached to every creature to whom it is sent and comes... And that there are universal offers of grace and salvation made to all men I utterly deny; nay, I deny they are made to any; no, not to God’s elect; grace and salvation are provided for them in the everlasting covenant, procured for them by Christ, published and revealed in the gospel, and applied by the Spirit.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Sermon 7: THE DOCTRINE OF PREDESTINATION STATED, AND SET IN THE SCRIPTURE LIGHT, John Gill [http://www.pbministries.org/books/gill/Sermons&amp;Tracts/sermon_07.htm source]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Tant'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;If then the gospel is good tidings because it proclaims blessings that are given to, secured for, and wrought in the souls of all interested in them, independent of creature merit, creature wisdom, creature seeking, creature asking, or creature diligence; then that gospel which gives an opposite view of these things is not good tidings. An offered gospel does do so; therefore an offered gospel is a contradiction to itself, and cannot be the gospel of the ever blessed God, for he is not the author of confusion, 1 Cor. 14:23, Therefore an offered gospel is contrary to God's Word and Will.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;William Tant, On offering the Gospel, 1837 [http://www.mountzionpbc.org/Pdf/William_Tant_On_offering_the_Gospel.pdf source]&lt;/ref&gt;
