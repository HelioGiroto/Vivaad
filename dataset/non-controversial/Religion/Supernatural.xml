{{Paranormal}}
[[File:Saint Pierre tentant de marcher sur les eaux by François Boucher.jpg|thumb|One of the many supernatural acts attributed to [[Jesus]], [[Jesus walks on water|walking on water]]. Art by [[François Boucher]]  Cathédrale Saint-Louis (1766) [[Versailles]]]]

The '''supernatural''' ([[Medieval Latin]]: ''supernātūrālis'': ''supra'' &quot;above&quot; + ''naturalis'' &quot;nature&quot;, first used: 1520–30 AD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/supernatural?s=t Etymology from Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=supernatural&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Etymology on-line]&lt;/ref&gt; is that which is not subject to the [[laws of nature]], or more figuratively, that which is said to exist above and beyond nature. With [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] and medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] origins, the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] considerations can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural]], will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected. In popular culture and fiction, the supernatural is whimsically associated with the [[paranormal]] and the [[occult]], this differs from traditional concepts in some [[religion]]s, such as Catholicism, where divine [[miracle]]s are considered supernatural.

==In Catholicism==
{{merge from|Supernatural order|date=September 2011}}
In [[Catholicism]], while the meaning of the term and its antithesis vary, the “Supernatural Order” is the gratuitous production, by God, of the ensemble of miracles for the elevation of man to a [[state (theology)|state of grace]], including the [[hypostatic union]] (Incarnation), the [[beatific vision]], and the ministry of [[angels]]. Divine operation, “spiritual facts” and “voluntary determinations” are consistently referred to as “supernatural” by those who specifically preclude the “extrinsic concurrence” of God or by those espousing a [[materialism|materialist]] or [[determinism|determinist]] worldview that excludes immaterial beings or [[free will]]. Barring disingenuous intent, there is no objection to this manner of speaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sollier1912&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14336b.htm |last=Sollier |first=Joseph |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Supernatural Order |vol=14 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |year=1912 |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Catholic theologians sometimes call supernatural the miraculous way in which certain effects, in themselves natural, are produced, or certain endowments (like man's immunity from death, suffering, passion, and ignorance) that bring the lower class up to the higher though always within the limits of the created, but they are careful in qualifying the former as accidentally supernatural (''supernaturale per accidens'') and the latter as relatively supernatural (''prœternaturale''). For a concept of the substantially and absolutely supernatural, they start from a comprehensive view of the natural order taken, in its amplest acceptation, for the aggregate of all created entities and powers, including the highest natural endowments of which the rational creature is capable, and even such Divine operations as are demanded by the effective carrying out of the cosmic order. The supernatural order is then more than a miraculous way of producing natural effects, or a notion of relative superiority within the created world, or the necessary concurrence of God in the universe; it is an effect or series of effects substantially and absolutely above all nature and, as such, calls for an exceptional intervention and gratuitous bestowal of God and rises in a manner to the Divine order, the only one that transcends the whole created world…  It is obvious also that this uplifting of the rational creature to the supernatural order cannot be by way of absorption of the created into the Divine or of fusion of both into a sort of monistic identity, but only by way of union or participation, the two terms remaining perfectly distinct.|Joseph Sollier|The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14.|Supernatural Order}}

Divine revelation of the supernatural order is considered to be a matter of fact, contingent upon proper evidence of such, (miracle, prophecy etc.). “The revelation and its evidences are called extrinsic and auxiliary supernatural, the elevation itself retaining the name of intrinsic or, according to some, theological supernatural.” The supernatural order was analyzed primarily by [[scholasticism|scholastic]] and post-Tridentine theologians. Theories denying or belittling the supernatural order, are historically classified into three groups:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sollier1912&quot;/&gt;
# present ''de facto'' condition ([[Pelagianism]], [[Beghards]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]] influence),
# the original status of man (Reformers such as [[Michel Baius|Baius]], [[Protestant]] and the [[Jansenist]] School),
# possibility and evidence (Rationalist School, from [[Socinus]] to the present Modernists).

{{quotation|[[Antonio Rosmini|Rosmini]] … unwittingly, [may] have paved the way for them in the following vaguely [[Subjectivist]] proposition: “The supernatural order consists in the manifestation of Being in the plenitude of its reality, and the effect of that manifestation is a God-like sentiment, inchoate in this life through the light of faith and grace, consummate in the next through the light of glory” (36th Rosminian proposition condemned by the Holy Office, 14 Dec., 1887). Preserving the dogmatic formulæ while voiding them of their contents, the Modernists constantly speak of the supernatural, but they understand thereby the advanced stages of an evolutive process of the religious sentiment. There is no room in their system for the objective and revealed supernatural: their Agnosticism declares it unknowable, their [[Immanentism]] derives it from our own vitality, their symbolism explains it in term of subjective experience and their criticism declares non-authentic the documents used to prove it. “There is no question now,” says Pius X, in his Encyclical “Pascendi” of 8 Sept., 1907, “of the old error by which a sort of right to the supernatural was claimed for human nature. We have gone far beyond that. We have reached the point where it is affirmed that our most holy religion, in the man Christ as in us, emanated from nature spontaneously and entirely. Than this, there is surely nothing more destructive of the whole supernatural order.” …
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the commonly received axiom that “grace does not destroy but only perfects nature” they establish between the two orders a parallelism that is not mutual confusion or reciprocal exclusion, but distinction and subordination. The [[Scholasticism|Schoolmen]] spoke freely of nature's possibilities (''potentia obedientialis'') and even conations (''appetitus naturalis'') towards the supernatural. To those traditional methods and views some Christian writers have, of late, endeavoured to add and even substitute another theory which, they claim, will bring the supernatural home to the modern mind and give it unquestionable credentials. The novel theory consists in making nature postulate the supernatural. Whatever be the legitimity of the purpose, the method is ambiguous and full of pitfalls. Between the Schoolmen's ''potentia obedientialis'' and ''appetitus moralis'' and the Modernist tenet according to which the supernatural “emanates from nature spontaneously and entirely” there is space and distance; at the same time, the Catholic apologist who would attempt to fill some of the space and cover some of the distance should keep in mind the admonition of Pius X to those “Catholics who, while rejecting immanence as a doctrine, employ it as a method of apologetics, and who do this so imprudently that they seem to admit that there is in human nature a true and rigorous necessity with regard to the supernatural order and not merely a capacity and suitability for the supernatural such as has at all times been emphasized by Catholic apologists” (Encyclical “Pascendi”).|Joseph Sollier|The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14.|Supernatural Order}}

== Process theology ==
{{main|Process theology}}
Process theology or ''process thought'' is a school of thought influenced by the metaphysical [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1861–1947) and further developed by [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000).
{{quote|It is not possible, in process metaphysics, to conceive divine activity as a “supernatural” intervention into the “natural” order of events. Process theists usually regard the distinction between the supernatural and the natural as a by-product of the doctrine of creation ''ex nihilo''. In process thought, there is no such thing as a realm of the natural in contrast to that which is supernatural. On the other hand, if “the natural” is defined more neutrally as “what is in the nature of things,” then process metaphysics characterizes the natural as the creative activity of actual entities. In Whitehead's words, “It lies in the nature of things that the many enter into complex unity” (Whitehead 1978, 21). It is tempting to emphasize process theism's denial of the supernatural and thereby highlight what the process God cannot do in comparison to what the traditional God can do (that is, to bring something from nothing). In fairness, however, equal stress should be placed on process theism's denial of the natural (as traditionally conceived) so that one may highlight what the creatures cannot do, in traditional theism, in comparison to what they can do in process metaphysics (that is, to be part creators of the world with God).&lt;ref name=&quot;sep-process-theism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Donald |last=Viney |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Process Theism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/process-theism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Donald Viney|&quot;Process Theism&quot; in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''}}

==Contrasting views==
{{see also|The nature of God in Western theology|Anthropology of religion|Biblical cosmology}}

One complicating factor is that there is no universal agreement about the definition of &quot;natural&quot; or the limits of [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in [[religion|religious]] [[spirituality]] and [[occultism]] or [[spiritualism]]. Additionally, by definition anything that exists naturally is not supernatural.

{{quote|For sometimes we use the word ''[[nature]]'' for that ''Author of nature'' whom the [[scholasticism|schoolmen]], harshly enough, call ''[[natura naturans]]'', as when it is said that ''nature'' hath made man partly corporeal and [[Mind-body dualism|partly immaterial]]. Sometimes we mean by the ''nature'' of a thing the ''[[essence]]'', or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the ''[[quiddity]]'' of a thing, namely, the ''[[property (philosophy)|attribute]]'' or ''attributes'' on whose score it is what it is, whether the thing be [[matter|corporeal]] or not, as when we attempt to define the ''nature'' of an ''[[angel]]'', or of a ''[[triangle]]'', or of a ''[[fluid]]'' body, as such. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an internal principle of [[motion (physics)|motion]], as when we say that a stone let fall in the [[air (classical element)|air]] is by ''nature'' carried towards the centre of the [[earth (classical element)|earth]], and, on the contrary, that [[fire (classical element)|fire]] or flame does ''naturally'' move upwards toward [[firmament|heaven]]. Sometimes we understand by ''nature'' the established course of things, as when we say that ''nature'' makes the [[night]] succeed the [[day]], ''nature'' hath made [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] necessary to the [[life]] of men. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an [[physiology|aggregate of powers]] belonging to a body, especially a [[body|living one]], as when [[physician]]s say that ''nature'' is strong or weak or spent, or that in such or such [[disease]]s ''nature'' left to herself [[immune system|will do the cure]]. Sometimes we take nature for the [[universe]], or system of the corporeal works of [[God]], as when it is said of a [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], or a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], that there is no such thing in ''nature'', i.e. in the world. And sometimes too, and that most commonly, we would express by ''nature'' a [[mother nature|semi-deity]] or other strange kind of being, such as this discourse examines the notion of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And besides these more absolute acceptions, if I may so call them, of the word ''nature'', it has divers others (more relative), as ''nature'' is wont to be set or in [[opposite (semantics)|opposition]] or contradistinction to other things, as when we say of a stone when it falls downwards that it does it by a ''[[classical elements|natural motion]]'', but that if it be thrown upwards its motion that way is ''violent''. So chemists distinguish [[vitriol]] into ''natural'' and ''fictitious'', or made by art, i.e. by the intervention of human power or skill; so it is said that [[water (classical element)|water]], kept suspended in a sucking pump, is not in its ''natural'' place, as that is which is stagnant in the well. We say also that wicked men are still in the state of ''nature'', but the regenerate in a state of ''[[divine grace|grace]]''; that cures wrought by [[medicine]]s are natural operations; but the [[miraculous]] ones wrought by [[Christ]] and his [[apostle (Christian)|apostle]]s were ''supernatural''.&lt;ref&gt;

The term &quot;supernatural&quot; is often used interchangeably with [[paranormal]] or [[preternatural]]&amp;nbsp;— the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed the bounds of possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=znMqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22supernatural+beliefs%22+%22paranormal%22&amp;dq=%22supernatural+beliefs%22+%22paranormal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SdpNTMioFoeglAeH97D5DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg |title=The paranormal – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that, ''ex hypothesi,'' violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are [[realism|realistically accountable]].

Many supporters of supernatural explanations believe that past, present, and future complexities and mysteries of the [[universe]] cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the unexplained. Proponents of supernaturalism regard their belief system as more flexible, allowing more diversity in terms of intuition and epistemology.

Views on the &quot;supernatural&quot; see it, for example, as:

* '''indistinct from nature'''. From this perspective, some events occur according to the [[laws of nature]], and others occur according to a separate set of principles external to known nature. For example, in Scholasticism, it was believed that God was capable of performing any miracle so long as it didn't lead to a logical [[contradiction]]. As a [[pedagogical]] exercise, a physics university instructor might ask what the aftermath would be, as nature returns to normal, following a hypothetical miraculous intervention by God, similar to a modern [[thought experiment]]. Some religions posit immanent deities, however, and do not have a tradition analogous to the supernatural; some believe that everything anyone experiences occurs by the will ([[occasionalism]]), in the mind ([[neoplatonism]]), or as a part ([[nondualism]]) of a more fundamental divine reality ([[platonism]]).

* '''incorrectly attributed to nature'''. Others believe that all events have natural and only natural causes. They believe that human beings ascribe supernatural attributes to purely natural events, such as [[lightning]], [[rainbow]]s, [[flood]]s, and the [[origin of life]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhong1976&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Zhong Yang Yan Jiu Yuan |author2=Min Tsu Hsüeh Yen Chiu So |year=1976 |title=Bulletin of the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, Issues 42-44 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yyQZAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=B.J. |last=Ellis |first2=D.F. |last2=Bjorklund |year=2004 |title=Origins of the Social Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and Child Development |publisher=Guilford Publications |isbn=9781593851033 |lccn=2004022693 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-UjiZwYGdFoC&amp;pg=PA413 |page=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;
