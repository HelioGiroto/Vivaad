== relational transgressions ==

This link [[Relational transgressions#Repairing the damage from relational transgressions]] does not go on the top because what goes on top is only disambig. All see alsos go on the bottom. If you think that the info at relational transgressions should be integrated into the article, then feel free to integrate them into the article.

::There probably wouldnt be much in the way of integration needed. I think it best to copy and paste it into a new &quot;psychology of forgiveness&quot; section then you, I or somebody else could look to doing any necessary integration work. Do you agree ? --[[User:Penbat|Penbat]] ([[User talk:Penbat|talk]]) 10:40, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

:::Yes, that's fine. Go ahead and create a new section - and please put the see also at the end :-) Thanks. [[User:Makana Chai|Makana Chai]] ([[User talk:Makana Chai|talk]]) 17:45, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

::::I put the see also at the end so I can take it off my to do list, but please do create the new section when you can.[[User:Makana Chai|Makana Chai]] ([[User talk:Makana Chai|talk]]) 17:30, 12 March 2010 (UTC)

== Updating page ==

Hi Tinkerman, thanks for the note on my talk page re this article. I think it is wonderful that you want to update it. I agree the most important is to add more on the scientific research. It looks like you have a good set of references which you could just go ahead and put on the page as reading. I am happy to copy edit your drafts. I'm starting a new job soon so not sure how much time I'll have, but I'm sure I can help. Suggest you post a sandbox here so others can participate if they want. Thanks for asking!

== Equal Life Foundation? ==

I see no evidence that there is a real organization with any substance called Equal Life Foundation, and propose that the section related to it be removed. [[User:Makana Chai|Makana Chai]] ([[User talk:Makana Chai|talk]]) 20:34, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

== Rationale for &quot;Undue weight&quot; template placed in ACIM section? ==

An &quot;Undue Weight&quot; template has been placed in the ACIM section requesting a discussion regarding the template, but offering no explanation or discussion here.  Could the editor who placed the template there please explain or elaborate on his or her rationale for inserting the template?  Thanks.

== Scope of the article - forgiveness other than as a religious concept ==

The lion's share of this article - and indeed even of the discussions on this page - appear to revolve around forgiveness within a religious context.

Clearly, forgiveness is an important facet of many, or possibly all, religions and I would certainly not want to suggest that what has been written in this article about that be reduced. However, it is not '''solely''' a religious concept. On the contrary there are many other aspects - emotional, psychological, societal, judicial, etc. that are not really covered in any detail by this article; and I feel the article is the poorer for it.

I came to this article looking for some information on forgiveness as an emotional process. I was able to read some interesting information regarding various philosphies' teachings on the spiritual side of forgiveness, but I am sadly none the wiser on the more down-to-earth details, such as can be found for example in the article on [[grief]].
 
I don't feel suitably knowledgeable to add this information myself, but were someone else to do so, I think it could improve the article immeasurably.  [[User:Petecollier|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;P M C&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:02, 21 June 2011 (UTC)</text>
