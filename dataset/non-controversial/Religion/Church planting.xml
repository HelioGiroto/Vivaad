'''Church planting''' is a process that results in a new (local) Christian [[Ecclesia (church)|church]] being established. It should be distinguished from '''church development''', where a new service, new worship centre or [[Fresh expressions|fresh expression]] is created that is integrated into an already established congregation. For a local church to be planted, it must eventually have a separate life of its own and be able to function without its parent body, even if it continues to stay in relationship denominationally or through being part of a network.

==History of church planting==
Anglican missionary efforts called church planting in British colonies coincided with British colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Marcia|year=2003|title=Rev. of ''The Church Mission Society and World Christianity, 1799-1999'' by Kevin Ward|journal=[[American Society of Church History|Church History]]|volume=72|issue=3|pages=679–80|jstor=4146297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church planting also describes the missionary model of Baptist missionaries, for instance, in mid-twentieth century Brazil. For [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]], church planting, with its focus on establishing new and independent congregations, is a logical outcome of their theology: &quot;Southern Baptist mission work was driven by church planting. Based on a
voluntaristic faith, the work defined individual salvation as the cornerstone of religious life; and religious life took place within local, autonomous congregations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalcanti&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cavalcanti|first=H.B.|year=2001|title=Human Agency in Mission Work: Missionary Styles and Their Political Consequences|journal=[[Sociology of Religion]]|volume=66|issue=4|pages=381–98|jstor=3712387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of church planting==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
These are some models for church planting. In the &quot;parachute drop&quot; method, a church planter and family move into a new location to start a church from scratch. Or, an existing church or church planting organization (mother) provides the initial leadership and resources (money and/or people) to get a new church (daughter) started. Alternately, small groups form and multiply via a network of people meeting in homes (see [[house church]]); in some cases, the individual cells are connected in a larger network that meets together periodically in a large group setting. An existing church may also split. Finally, the expansion of a [[Multi-site church]] may result in new churches (rather than annexes of the larger church) being established.

==Advocates==
[[C. Peter Wagner]] describes Church planting as &quot;the single most effective evangelistic methodology under heaven&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Church Planting for Greater Harvest (Regal, Glendale: 1991) 5&lt;/ref&gt; and for its advocates this remains church planting's greatest rationale.  Recent practitioners{{who|date=November 2011}} have developed theologies of church, place, and community, to answer the criticism of earlier models.{{Clarify|date=November 2011}}

==Practical objections==

For Anglicans and Catholics, &quot;church-planting&quot; can be very problematic because of the territorial nature of a [[diocese]]. For both the Catholic and Anglican churches, this practice may be viewed  as an abrogation of the rights of a local [[bishop]]. This is because the bishop of the diocese has the right to decide where churches will be planted, and the phenomenon of church planting sometimes ignores both courtesy and obedience to the local bishop. This issue is particularly sensitive in regard to the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Anglican diocese of Sydney]] in Australia, from which many Evangelical churches are &quot;planted&quot; in non-evangelical dioceses.&lt;ref&gt;'An Unholy Row'  four corners, transcript: http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/s141770.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England has begun its [[Fresh Expressions]] initiative, which is seeking to encourage the development of new congregations even when they are across parish boundaries, for the sake of mission, under the bishop's permission.  The recent Anglican conference [[GAFCON]] contained a broad hint that it would consider offering oversight to churches that have been planted without authorization from the local bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gafcon.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=29 Global Anglican Future – Holy Land 2008 – GAFCON Final Statement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church Planting Movement==
In a missiological context, church planting may be defined as &quot;initiating reproductive fellowships who reflect the kingdom of God in the world.&quot;{{who|date=November 2011}}{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} When this happens with rapid growth, it is generally known as a '''Church Planting Movement'''.  In a CPM, indigenous churches plant more churches within a people group or geographic area. A church will sponsor formation of multiple spinoff churches that will themselves very quickly reproduce new churches, generally with common teachings and doctrine. It is different from [[Mission (Christianity)|traditional missions]] in that the new churches are generally started by a lay leader from the sponsoring church and not an outside [[missionary]]. A key characteristic of an authentic church planting movement is the rapidity with which a new congregation itself starts another similar church.&lt;ref name=&quot;goal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.onemag.org/church_planting2.htm|title=Our Goal: Church Planting Movements|last=Forlines|first=James|date=n.d.|work=ONE Magazine|publisher=[[National Association of Free Will Baptists]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imb.org/cpm/chapter1.htm|title=Church Planting Movements|year=2002|publisher=[[International Mission Board]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of CPMs===
The modern Church Planting Movement can trace its roots to the mid-nineteenth century when Henry Venn and Rufus Anderson developed the three-self formula of an indigenous missions policy: &quot;they believed that young churches should be self-propagating, self-supporting, and self-governing from their inception.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fanning&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=cgm_missions|title=Church Planting Movements|last=Fanning|first=Don|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[The Center for Global Ministries]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald McGavran]], a missionary in [[India]] who &quot;coined the concept of 'people movements' to Christ,&quot; is credited as an early proponent of the kind of missionary work that underlies the Church Planting Movement, by focusing his missionary work on converting groups of people (&quot;groups, tribes, villages, ethnic groups&quot;) rather than individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;kooistra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mtw.org/home/site/content/documents/ChurchToChurch/Toward%20a%20Definition%20of%20Church-Planting%20Movements.pdf|title=Toward a Definition of Church-Planting Movements|last=Kooistra|first=Paul|date=n.d.|work=Mission to the World|publisher=[[Presbyterian Church in America]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''ONE Magazine'', the official organ of the [[National Association of Free Will Baptists]], such tactics were used successfully in [[Cuba]] in the 1940s by Tom and Mabel Willey; in the 1950s in [[North India]] Carlisle and Marie Hanna; and in the 1960s in [[Ivory Coast]] by LaVerne Miley.&lt;ref name=&quot;goal&quot;/&gt; ''[[Christianity Today]]'' also claims success in Cuba for the &quot;Western Baptists, historically linked to the Southern Baptist Convention.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ahora&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/july/22.20.html|title=Cuba for Christ—Ahora!|last=Weber|first=Jeremy|date=9 July 2009|work=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=27 October 2011|quote=The Communist island's improbable revival is 15 years old and growing stronger.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essentials of CPMs===
There are three key characteristics of a Church Planting Movement: it reproduces rapidly, multiplying churches, and that the churches are indigenous.&lt;ref name=&quot;haney&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/assessing-church-planting-movements|title=Assessing Church Planting Movements|first=Jim|last=Haney|date=1 March 2011|work=Misson Frontiers|publisher=[[U.S. Center for World Mission]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Within a very short time, newly planted churches are already starting new churches that follow the same pattern of rapid reproduction.  Though the rate varies from place to place, Church Planting Movements always outstrip the population growth rate as they race toward reaching the entire people group. Where with other methods of church planting it may take five years to plant a church, with CPM multiple generations of churches may be planted within five months.&lt;ref name=&quot;haney&quot;/&gt;
*&quot;Church Planting Movements do not simply add new churches. Instead, they multiply.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cpm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchplantingmovements.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54:what-are-church-planting-movements&amp;catid=36:the-big-picture&amp;Itemid=78|title=What Are Church Planting Movements?|last=Garrison|first=David|date=1 May 2010|publisher=Church Planting Movements|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most churches in the middle of a Movement will start as many churches as they can, with a goal of filling the area with new churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;haney&quot;/&gt;
*Church Planting Movements are indigenous.  It may start with the training from a non-native missionary or church member, but will very quickly form new congregations that are all within a single ethnic people group.  Leaders are self-identified by their willingness to do what the trainer asks them, and then are given additional instruction on how to reproduce new churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;haney&quot;/&gt;
*Church Planting Movements train leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Anatomy of a Church Planting Movement [https://www.rca.org/Page.aspx?pid=6040] quote: The movement does not need a board; it needs a group of leaders of leaders to form an &quot;apostolic team.&quot; This is the team that becomes the leaders of leaders. Instead of the movement depending on the passion of a leader of leaders, a core group of passionate vision casters of the movement's DNA are scattered about so that every plant is visited annually. This is the primary way to deal with the loss of the movement's founder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Robby. ''Church Planting Movements from One Indian Perspective'' [http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/church-planting-movements-from-one-indian-perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods in Church Planting Movements===
There is not a solitary method used to spark a Church Planting Movement.  The ''Training for Trainers (T4T)'' method  has been successful in China.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve and Kai, Ying. &quot;T4T: A Discipleship ReRevolution&quot; (Monument, CO: WIGTake Resources, 2011) p36&lt;/ref&gt;  It differs from the [[Insider movements|Insider Movement]] in that leaders do not seek to act like indigenous persons, but simply train locals who train others within their (or closely related) people group.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, David ''Church Planting Movements vs Insider Movements: Missiological Realities vs Mythiological Speculations'' in Proceedings of the ISFM 2004 Meeting: Insider Movements [http://www.ijfm.org/PDFs_IJFM/21_4_PDFs/Insider_Garrison.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
