== Why no section on Islamic extremism? ==

To many non-Muslims (especially in the west), the propensity to breed extremism and violent fundamentalism is one of the defining characteristics of Islam. This is in fact the only exposure to Islam that most westerners ever see. And it is inarguable that Islamic extremism is the most widespread form of religious extremism in the world today. So why isn't there a paragraph or two in the article dealing with the topic of extremism? It would certainly be expected of a truly neutral article to discuss the most widely-known aspect of a religion. [[User:Canine virtuoso|Canine virtuoso]] ([[User talk:Canine virtuoso|talk]]) 04:15, 6 March 2012 (UTC)
:Probably for the same reason that [[Christianity]] doesn't discuss the attacks by many fundamentalist Christians on science. Don't underestimate how powerful that section of Christianity is. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 08:00, 6 March 2012 (UTC)
::I hadn't looked for it there, but I agree. Is there a reason or are people just afraid to touch that aspect of either religion? Its there, whether we like it or not. May as well try to give a NPOV overview at least. [[User:Canine virtuoso|Canine virtuoso]] ([[User talk:Canine virtuoso|talk]]) 15:57, 6 March 2012 (UTC)
:::There is a section in the article, [[Islam#Criticism of Islam]], which leads to [[Criticism of Islam]] and in turn to [[Islam and violence]], [[Criticism of Islamism]], [[Islamic terrorism]] and so on. The material would be too much for this article and has been split off into other articles but not in an effort to cover up or being afraid to deal with it but just the standard article is too large. [[User:CambridgeBayWeather|CambridgeBayWeather]] ([[User talk:CambridgeBayWeather|talk]]) 22:22, 6 March 2012 (UTC)
::::[[Criticism of Islam]] doesn't specifically deal with the subject, so you have to click a minimum of two links from [[Islam]] to get to an article that describes violent extremism in Islam.

:::::As long as this happens to Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism etc etc...I don't see a real problem with this.

::What should actually be discussed is the ''misrepresentation'' of Islam by western media as a religion that breeds extremism and violence. Any survey of acts of terrorism in the USA for example would show that far more of these acts are committed by fundamentalist Christians than by moslems, particularly if terrorism against abortion clinics was included in the data. Many of the RS's will also point out that movements with strong nationalist and anti-imperialist elements have been branded as 'islamic extremism', in a way that is not applied to such movements in countries which are mainly non-moslem. In a religion of billions, the proportion of true 'terrorists' is no higher than any other religion. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Riversider2008|River]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[[User:Riversider2008|sider]] &lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Riversider2008#top|talk]])&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 14:50, 25 May 2012 (UTC)

== Terrorism/Islamism (re-visited) ==

It was discussed, all not too long ago, as to why this article has virtually nothing on Islamic terrorism in it. It seems no one could/wanted to add anything to the article on this. There should be a short section on terrorism in a similar fashion to the criticism of Islam part, along with a link to the main article. Any thoughts? --[[User:Τασουλα|Τασουλα]] ([[User talk:Τασουλα|talk]]) 02:26, 22 June 2012 (UTC)

:: A criticism section is usually the mark of a badly written article. As for terrorism and other forms of extremism, they seem to be more of a history section thing to me, pertaining largely to Islam in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Other extreme movements within Islam should be mentioned only with [[WP:WEIGHT|due weight]] and in its relevance to Islam as a whole during their respective places in history.

== Sect section changing in ISLAM ==

{{edit semi-protected|answered=yes}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
There is no sect in ISLAM called ahmaddiyah, so my request is to change sect section in islam with some reliable sources you can watch videos of Islamic scholar on ahmadiyah that they are not muslims and not promoting right religion Practices and they are not in circle of islam because they belive that mirza ghulam qadiyani was last prophet and that is not true. Our beloved Prophet MOHAMMAD pbuh was the last prophet and seal of prophets and messenger. Your attention is highly required on this issue.

&lt;!-- End request --&gt;
[[User:Rjab1|Rjab1]] ([[User talk:Rjab1|talk]]) 00:01, 19 July 2012 (UTC)
:The sources used in the article describe Ahmaddiya followers as Muslims, based on their self-description, their acceptance of the majority of doctrines that mainstream Islam embraces, and the lack of disagreement in areas Muslims typically describe as fundamental (such as the five pillars).  Dismissing them on a sectarian basis will not change the article. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 00:11, 19 July 2012 (UTC)
: {{ESp|c}} Based on the above reply, consensus will be needed before any changes are done.  [[User:RudolfRed|RudolfRed]] ([[User talk:RudolfRed|talk]]) 04:43, 19 July 2012 (UTC)

There is a sect in Islam named the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. One thing that I like to suggest to the author of this article is that Ahmadiyya Muslim Community does beleive that the most respected Prophet, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the last law bearing prophet. The fact that they don't beleive in the Holy Prophet as the last prophet is an accusation that other Muslims put on the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community to show that they are no true Muslims which is completely wrong.

== Suggestions ==

(Apologise about my spelling and grammar) I have been a great fan of wikipedia but I have seen a couple of problems like the Prophet mohamed images. I have read some of the faq about censorship. Just because (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored) that doesn't mean it to offend it's users. As wikipedia needs new users from a variety of background to keep it a neutral.

My suggestion is it possibe to hide some of this images by using ( (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics) The sponsors table ). Therefore if you want to see it you will be able to press the show button.
:I think a better idea would be to include that button but with it defaulted to open, so if you don't want to see it, you can close it. There are more non-muslims than muslims, after all.[[User:Canine virtuoso|Canine virtuoso]] ([[User talk:Canine virtuoso|talk]]) 16:05, 17 August 2012 (UTC)

== Fastest growing religion ==

I deleted &quot;one of the [[claims to be the fastest-growing religion|fastest-growing religions in the world]].&quot; because this is dubious according to the linked article and not mentioned in any other Religions' articles.

Christianity

Growth rate: 1.38 percent

Adherents: 2.2 billion

Means in absolute numbers 30 million


Islam

Growth rate*: 1.84 percent

Adherents: 1.3 billion

Means in absolute numbers 24 million

[[User:Clickenglish|Clickenglish]] ([[User talk:Clickenglish|talk]]) 18:38, 13 August 2012 (UTC)

:The source does not mention that the claim is dubious. I really don't see a problem with it. The article is not stating that it is the fastest growing but one of. Just because it's not mentioned in other articles does not mean that it is wrong to have it here. [[User:CambridgeBayWeather|CambridgeBayWeather]] ([[User talk:CambridgeBayWeather|talk]]) 21:42, 13 August 2012 (UTC)

::By dubious I mean that there are several ways to measure which one is the fastest growing as explained in [[claims to be the fastest-growing religion]]. In absolute numbers it seems to be Christianity. In relative numbers, according to [http://fastestgrowingreligion.com/numbers.html this article], Islam is no 3, after [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Bahá'í]]. This claim is not mentioned in any of these articles' introduction. Why mention it here and not in those articles? It will only add to the myth that Islam is the fastest growing religion. [[User:Clickenglish|Clickenglish]] ([[User talk:Clickenglish|talk]]) 10:53, 14 August 2012 (UTC)

:::Once again the fact that it is not in other articles has nothing to do with this particular one. Now originally the sentence read &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=506899984 Islam is the second-largest and one of the fastest-growing religions in the world.[14][15]]&quot; You seem to be reading this as saying it is the fastest growing which is something the sentence does not claim. You also seem to have missed the fact that there are actually four sources saying that it is one of the fastest growing. There is the one you quoted above which is the link 14 in the sentence. Link 15 contains three other references, [http://www.pbs.org/empires/islam/faithtoday.html Islam Today], [http://www.usnews.com/news/religion/articles/2008/04/07/no-god-but-god No God but God] and [http://www.usnews.com/news/religion/articles/2008/04/07/understanding-islam Understanding Islam] that make the same claim. The other link in that reference is for the number of Muslims Now with the addition of the [http://fastestgrowingreligion.com/numbers.html Fastest Growing Religion] there are five references that all say Islam is '''one of''' the fastest growing. [[User:CambridgeBayWeather|CambridgeBayWeather]] ([[User talk:CambridgeBayWeather|talk]]) 15:51, 14 August 2012 (UTC)

::::Yes, but the same guidelines and rules should apply to all articles. If we reverse the question. Why should it be mentioned in the introduction? That there are several references to this fact is not a sufficient reason. It seems to be an often-repeated myth that Islam is the world's fastest growing religion and I think this is why someone has put it in here but not in the other articles where it could be added too. [[User:Clickenglish|Clickenglish]] ([[User talk:Clickenglish|talk]]) 17:24, 14 August 2012 (UTC)

:::::You keep saying it's a myth but you haven't provided any sources.

== Five Pillars of Islam ==

As the phrase of [[Haji Bektash Veli]] &quot;Whatever you're searching for, search in yourself, It's neither in [[Jerusalem]], [[Mecca]] nor in the [[Hadj]]&quot;, the [[five pillars of Islam]] are not for [[Alevi]] people in [[Turkey]] and [[Balkans]]. They don't workship 5 times a day (namaz), they don't go for the Hadj. They also don't fast in Ramadans. Maybe that should be mentioned in &quot;Five Pillars of Islam&quot; section. --[[User:Cemyildiz|Cemyildiz]] ([[User talk:Cemyildiz|talk]]) 21:37, 26 August 2012 (UTC)

== Another Suggestion ==

Dear Author of the article Islam I thank you for adding the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community as one of the sects of Islam. There is a sect in Islam named the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. One thing that I like to suggest for this article is that Ahmadiyya Muslim Community does beleive that the most respected Prophet, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), is the last law bearing prophet. The fact that they don't beleive in the Holy Prophet as the last prophet is an accusation that other Muslims put on the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community to show that they are no true Muslims which is completely wrong. I would extremely appreciate it if you could make that change. May God shower His blessings upon you and your loved ones, Amen.

:Based on a discussion I recently had with another user, I am inclined to agree here.

== American hooligans paid to stage protest ==

America is paying its hooligans to stage protests. America knows very well that the 99.9% of Muslims do not give a damn about ridiculous films and will not react in anyway. The Quran clearly says that if anybody comes to fight, you have to fight but if they insult Islam from far simply ignore them and don't give them the satisfaction of a reaction. America knows that the 99.9% of Muslims will not give them the satisfaction of a reaction. So they are paying the 0.1% to stage protests and use that to try and make the 99.9% Muslims feel bad. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsUtvOW6SR0

This needs to be put in the article of how the main people who control western countries who are atheist and are concerned only with their interests and their two servants that they use occasionally from time to time the Christian fundamentalists and European Jews are using fake Muslims, people posing as Muslims to cause trouble to the Muslim community. This is in contrast to East Asian countries (China, Japan, Korea) that are more interested in equality and rise of Asia and Africa and end of western de facto colonialism. All Muslim scholars are in agreement that these are manufactured protests to demonize Muslims and cause problems for the China-Muslim-Africa alliance. [[User:Real Muslims|Real Muslims]] ([[User talk:Real Muslims|talk]]) 15:33, 16 September 2012 (UTC)

:Youtube is not a [[WP:RS|reliable source (you may view the reliable sourcing guidelines here)]].  If people are stupid enough to stage protests, people are stupid enough to protest.

Given the youtube vid you cite, it sounds too much like a [[No True Scotsman]] fallacy for me to assume that it is anything otherwise.  Plus, it's biased to limit the discussion only to Muslim scholars. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 14:59, 18 September 2012 (UTC)
:::Agreed. YouTube is not a good source, and I highly doubt that ''all'' Muslim scholars think the protests are staged. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; text-shadow: 0 0 .2em #6af; font-size:10.1pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 17:19, 18 September 2012 (UTC)

== Minor Sects / Varients? ==
After years of studying the religions of the world, Islam included, I have noticed something odd. In Afghanistan, the Pashtun people seem to follow a different sect. While I see no mention or Spirits, Magic or Spellcasters in Islam, the Pashtun tribes of Afghanistan cling very much to these beliefs, on top of their Islamic ideals. 
A good example would be the dotted tattoos seen on Pashtun warriors' hands, believed to confer luck and skill in battle (Tattooed on by a &quot;wise woman&quot;). Or the ornamentation of trucks, believed to ward off evil spirits. I haven't seen these anywhere else I have traveled in the Islamic world (Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia). I could be my ignorance, but are these &quot;trends&quot; common across Islam, or is this unique to the Pashtun tribe? The Tajik and Hazara tribes do not seem to hold these beliefs.[[User:Justin.blodgett|SGT Justin Gregory Blodgett, US Army Infantryman]] ([[User talk:Justin.blodgett|talk]]) 18:48, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

:It happens in many parts of the world. Islam in parts of Africa sometimes maintain similar traditional beliefs. It's also true for all the major missionary religions including Christianity, not just Islam. The orthodox beliefs of the &quot;new&quot; religion are mapped on to the older local beliefs. There's an article on it: [[Syncretism]]. [[User:DeCausa|DeCausa]] ([[User talk:DeCausa|talk]]) 19:13, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

::Makes sense now, sort of like a culturization of specified religions. I just found it odd that is was almost minor, and tribal specific. Though I do not agree with some of the [[Syncretism|Article's]] points, but thats a conversation for another Talk forum.

:::It seems to me that you probably didn't spend enough time with the Tajiks, Hazaras and the so many other ethnic groups in Afghanistan. They all believe in these [[superstition]]s. It relates to palm reading, fortune telling, or even witchcraft and Islam prohibits this. However, some ideas are allowed. Those trucks usually have the names Allah, Muhammad, and religious text, as well as eyes and other nonsense. Religious text do ward off evil [[Jinn]]s because these Jinns are invisible spirits who walk around everywhere on earth, including in people's houses. We can't see them but they are there. According to Islam, they also live inside each human. But my point is that this has nothing to do with Islam or any other religion.--[[User:Chilum aw charrs|Chilum aw charrs]] ([[User talk:Chilum aw charrs|talk]]) 06:00, 7 November 2012 (UTC)

== Use of &quot;Qu'ran&quot; ==

I have noticed that the principle scripture of Islam is listed in the article as the &quot;Qu'ran&quot;, &quot;Quran&quot; and even lowercase, &quot;quran&quot;. Can somebody determine the proper canonical term and apply it uniformly throughout the article? I would do it but I'm not religious scholar, but I feel at least it should be uniform.
