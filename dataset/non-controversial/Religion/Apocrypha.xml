{{Redirect|Apocryphal|the adjective|wiktionary:apocryphal}}

The term '''''apocrypha''''' is used with various meanings, including &quot;hidden&quot;, &quot;esoteric&quot;, &quot;spurious&quot;, &quot;of questionable authenticity&quot;, ancient Chinese &quot;revealed texts and objects&quot; and &quot;Christian texts that are not [[Biblical canon|canonical]]&quot;.

The word is originally [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{lang|grc|ἀπόκρυφα}}) and means &quot;those hidden away&quot;. Specifically, {{lang|grc|ἀπόκρυφα}} is the neuter plural of {{lang|grc|ἀπόκρυφος}}, an adjective related to the verb ἀποκρύπτω [infinitive: ἀποκρύπτειν] (apocriptein), &quot;to hide something away.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apocrypha Apocrypha - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The general term is usually applied to the books in the [[Roman Catholic]] Bible or the Christian old testament, and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Bible, but not the [[Protestant]] Bible on their claim that it is not God's word.  So, it is misleading in this sense to refer to the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]] or [[Gnostic]] writings as apocryphal, because they would not be classified in the same category by orthodox believers: they would be classified as a [[heretical]] subset of [[antilegomena]]e, to distinguish them from now-canonical ancient antilegomenae such as [[2 Peter]], [[3 John]] and the [[Revelation of John]], and non-canonical but non-heretical books which were quoted by the [[Church Fathers|Early Fathers]] such as the [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] [[Epistle of Barnabas]], the [[Didache]], or [[The Shepherd of Hermas]]. The gnostic writings are generally not accorded any status, not even a negative one: they are ignored, as they are incompatible with the accepted canon ''prima facie''. Non-[[Biblical canon|canonical]] books are texts of uncertain authenticity, or writings where the work is seriously questioned.  Given that different [[Christian denomination|denominations]] have different beliefs about what constitutes [[Christian Biblical canons|canonical]] [[scripture]], there are several versions of the apocrypha.

During 16th-century controversies about the [[biblical canon]], the word acquired a negative connotation, and has become a [[synonym]] for &quot;spurious&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. This usage usually involves fictitious or legendary accounts that are plausible enough to be commonly considered true. For example, [[Laozi]]'s alleged authorship of the [[Tao Te Ching]] and the [[Parson Weems]] account of [[George Washington]] and the [[cherry]] tree are considered apocryphal.

== Definitions and usage==
''Apocrypha'' has evolved in meaning somewhat, and its associated implications have ranged from positive to [[pejorative]]. ''Apocrypha'', according to [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]], means &quot;books included in the [[Septuagint]] and [[Vulgate]] but excluded from the Jewish and Protestant canons of the Old Testament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apocrypha Apocrypha]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Esoteric writings and objects===
The word &quot;apocryphal&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἀπόκρυφος}}) was first applied, in a positive sense, to writings which were kept secret because they were the vehicles of [[esoteric]] knowledge considered too profound or too sacred to be disclosed to anyone other than the initiated.  For example, it is used in this sense to describe ''A Holy and Secret Book of Moses, called Eighth, or Moyseos holy books citing esoteric eighth St ({{lang|grc|Μωυσέως ἱερὰ βίβλος ἀπόκρυφος ἐπικαλούμενη ὀγδόη ἢ ἁγία}}''). This is a text taken from a [[Leiden University Library|Leiden papyrus]] of the third or fourth century AD. The text may be as old as the first century, but other proof of age has not been found. In a similar vein, the [[Apprenticeship|disciples]] of the [[Gnostic]] [[Prodicus]] boasted that they possessed the secret ({{lang|grc|ἀπόκρυφα}}) books of [[Zoroaster]]. The term in general enjoyed high consideration among the [[Gnostics]] (see [[Acts of Thomas]], pp.&amp;nbsp;10, 27, 44).&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{harvnb| Charles|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned Sinologist [[Anna Seidel]] refers to texts and even items produced by ancient Chinese sages as apocryphal and studied their uses during [[Six Dynasties]] China (220 to 589 AD).  These artifacts were used as symbols legitimizing and guaranteeing the Emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]].  Examples of these include talismans, charts, writs, tallies, and registers.  The first examples were stones, jade pieces, bronze vessels and weapons, but came to include talismans and magic diagrams.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeidelAnna&quot;&gt;Seidel, Anna. &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises. pp. 291-371.&lt;/ref&gt; From their roots in [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era China (1066 to 256 BC) these items came to be surpassed in value by texts by the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty (206 BC to 220 CE). Most of these texts have been destroyed as Emperors, particularly during the [[Han dynasty]], collected these legitimizing objects and proscribed, forbade and burnt nearly all of them to prevent them from falling into the hands of political rivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeidelAnna&quot; /&gt; It is therefore fitting with the Greek root of the word, as these texts were obviously hidden away to protect the ruling Emperor from challenges to his status as Heaven's choice as sovereign.

=== Writings of questionable value ===&lt;!-- This was originally part of the Esoteric writing section, but it does not seem to fit. It seems to be a separate topic --&gt;
&quot;Apocrypha&quot; was also applied to writings that were hidden not because of their divinity but because of their questionable value to the church. Many in [[Protestant]] traditions cite Revelation 22:18-19 as a potential curse for those who attach any canonical authority to extra-biblical writings such as the Apocrypha. However, a strict explanation of this text would indicate it was meant for only the [[Book of Revelation]]. Rv.22:18-19f. (KJV) states:  &quot;For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.&quot;  In this case, if one holds to a strict [[hermeneutic]], the &quot;words of the [[prophecy]]&quot; do not refer to the Bible as a whole but to Jesus' ''Revelation'' to John. [[Origen]], in ''Commentaries on Matthew'', distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings: {{lang|grc|γραφὴ μὴ φερομένη μέν ἒν τοῖς κοινοῖς καὶ δεδημοσιευμένοις βιβλίοις εἰκὸς δ' ὅτι ἒν ἀποκρύφοις φερομένη}} (''writing not found on the common and published books in one hand, actually found on the secret ones on the other'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1016.htm ''Commentaries on Matthew'', X. 18, XIII. 57]{{Nonspecific|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of αποκρυφος is here practically equivalent to &quot;excluded from the public use of the church&quot;, and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

=== Spurious writings ===
In general use, the word &quot;apocrypha&quot; came to mean &quot;false, spurious, bad, or heretical.&quot; This meaning also appears in Origen's prologue to his commentary on the [[Song of Songs]], of which only the [[Latin]] translation survives: ''De scripturis his, quae appellantur apocryphae, pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem.''&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; &quot;Concerning these scriptures, which are called apocryphal, for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders, it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority.&quot;

=== Other meanings ===
Other uses of ''apocrypha'' developed over the history of Western Christianity.  The [[Gelasian Decree]] refers to religious works by [[church fathers]] [[Eusebius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] as apocrypha. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] defined the word as meaning simply &quot;obscurity of origin,&quot; implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered as apocryphal. On the other hand, [[Jerome]] (in ''Protogus Galeatus'') declared that all books outside the Hebrew canon were apocryphal.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; In practice, Jerome treated some books outside the Hebrew canon as if they were canonical, and the Western Church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha, instead retaining the word's prior meaning (''see: [[Deuterocanon]]''). As a result, various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha, treating them with varying levels of regard. 

Some apocryphal books were included in the [[Septuagint]] with little distinction made between them and the rest of the [[Old Testament]]. [[Origen]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] and others cited some apocryphal books as &quot;scripture,&quot; &quot;divine scripture,&quot; &quot;inspired,&quot; and the like. On the other hand, teachers connected with [[Palestine]] and familiar with the [[protocanonical books|Hebrew canon]] excluded from the canon all of the Old Testament not found there. This view is reflected in the canon of [[Melito of Sardis]], and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the [[Hebrew]] collection, but were of value for moral uses, as introductory texts for new converts from [[paganism]], and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as &quot;[[ecclesiastical]]&quot; works by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;  

These three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the [[Protestant Reformation]], when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s alike. In 1546 the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reconfirmed the canon of Augustine, dating to the second and third centuries, declaring &quot;He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin [[Vulgate]], as sacred and canonical.&quot; The whole of the books in question, with the exception of [[1 Esdras]] and [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], were declared canonical at Trent.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; The Protestants, in comparison, were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon. Some considered them divinely inspired, others rejected them. Anglicans took a position between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches; they kept them as Christian intertestamental readings and a part of the Bible, but no doctrine should be based on them. [[John Wycliffe]], a 14th century Christian Humanist, had declared in his biblical translation that &quot;whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without authority or belief.&quot;&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; Nevertheless, his translation of the Bible included the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] and the Epistle of the Laodiceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/wycliffe/ Wyclif's Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

The respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between Protestant denominations. In both the [[Luther Bible|German]] (1534) and [[Coverdale Bible|English]] (1535) translations of the Bible, the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books, although the Lutheran and Anglican lists are different. In some editions (like the Westminster), readers were warned that these books were not &quot;to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.&quot; A milder distinction was expressed elsewhere, such as in the &quot;argument&quot; introducing them in the [[Geneva Bible]], and in the Sixth Article of the [[Church of England]], where it is said that &quot;the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners,&quot; though not to establish doctrine.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

According to the [[Orthodox Anglican Church]]:

{{quote|On the other hand, the Anglican Communion emphatically maintains that the Apocrypha is part of the Bible and is to be read with respect by her members. Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the Benedictus es and Benedicite, are taken from the Apocrypha. One of the offertory sentences in Holy Communion comes from an apocryphal book (Tob. 4: 8-9). Lessons from the Apocrypha are regularly appointed to be read in the daily, Sunday, and special services of Morning and Evening Prayer. There are altogether 111 such lessons in the latest revised American Prayer Book Lectionary [The books used are: II Esdras, Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Three Holy Children, and I Maccabees.] The position of the Church is best summarized in the words of Article Six of the Thirty-nine Articles: “In the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority there was never any doubt in the Church… And the other Books (as Hierome [St. Jerome] saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine…”{{Citation needed|date=March 2010|reason=dead link:  http://www.orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.PDF ''The Apocrypha, Bridge of the Testaments'' }} }}

===Metaphorical usage===
The adjective ''apocryphal'' is commonly used in modern English to refer to any text or story considered to be of dubious veracity or authority, although it may contain some moral truth. In this broader metaphorical sense, the word suggests a claim that is in the nature of [[folklore]], [[factoid]] or [[urban legend]].

==Texts==
===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish apocrypha}}
Although traditional rabbinical Judaism insists on the exclusive canonization of the current 24 books in the [[Tanakh]], it also claims to have an oral law handed down from [[Moses]]. The [[Sadducees]] - unlike the [[Pharisees]] but like the [[Samaritans]] - seem to have maintained an earlier and smaller number of texts as canonical, preferring to hold to only what was written in the Law of Moses&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=40&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Sadducees Jewish Encyclopedia: Sadducees]&lt;/ref&gt; (making most of the presently accepted canon, both Jewish and Christian, ''apocryphal'' in their eyes).  Certain circles in Judaism, such as the [[Essene]]s in Judea and the [[Therapeutae]] in [[Egypt]], were said to have a secret literature (see [[Dead Sea scrolls]]). Other traditions maintained different customs regarding canonicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/sbrandt/canon.htm The Old Testament Canon]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopic Jews, for instance, seem to have retained a spread of canonical texts similar to the Ethiopian [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/BIBLE/ethold.stm Ethiopian Orthodox Old Testament]&lt;/ref&gt; cf ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', Vol 6, p 1147. A large part of this literature consisted of the apocalypses. Based on prophecies, these apocalyptic books were not considered scripture by all, but rather part of a literary form that flourished from 200 BC to AD 100.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Intertestamental===
{{Main|Biblical apocrypha}}
{{see also|Intertestamental period}}
During the [[Apostolic Age|birth of Christianity]], some of the Jewish apocrypha that dealt with the coming of the Messianic kingdom became popular in the rising [[Jewish Christian]] communities. Occasionally these writings were changed or added to, but on the whole it was found sufficient to reinterpret them as conforming to a [[New Covenant|Christian viewpoint]]. Christianity eventually gave birth to new apocalyptic works, some of which were derived from traditional Jewish sources. Some of the Jewish apocrypha were part of the ordinary religious literature of the [[Early Christians]]. This was strange, as the large majority of Old Testament references in the New Testament are taken from the Greek [[Septuagint]], which is the source of the [[deuterocanonical books]]&lt;ref&gt;''Deuterocanonical books'' literally means books of the second canon. The term was coined in the 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as most of the other [[biblical apocrypha]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''Style Manual for the Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical literature'' instead of ''apocrypha'' in academic writing, although not all apocryphal books are properly deuterocanonical.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slightly varying collections of additional Books (called deuterocanonical by the Roman Catholic Church) form part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] canons. See [[Development of the Old Testament canon]].

The [[Book of Enoch]] is included in the biblical canon only of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches of Ethiopia and Eritrea.  The [[Epistle of Jude]] quotes the book of Enoch, and some believe the use of this book also appears in the four gospels and [[1 Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, T.E. and J., &quot;The Comprehensive New Testament&quot;, Cornerstone Publications (2008), ISBN 978-0-9778737-1-5&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.accordancebible.com/Comprehensive-Crossreferences] The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were believed in by the writer of the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] and much of the early church. The epistles of Paul and the gospels also show influences from the [[Book of Jubilees]], which is part of the Ethiopian canon, as well as the [[Assumption of Moses]] and the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]], which are included in no biblical canon.

The high position which some apocryphal books occupied in the first two centuries was undermined by a variety of influences in the Christian church. All claims to the possession of a secret tradition (as held by many [[Gnostic]] sects) were denied by the influential theologians like [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]], which modern historians refer to as the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|Proto-orthodox]], the timeframe of true inspiration was limited to the apostolic age, and universal acceptance by the church was required as proof of apostolic authorship. As these principles gained currency, books deemed apocryphal tended to become regarded as spurious and heretical writings, though books now considered deuterocanonical have been used in liturgy and theology from the first century to the present.

===Christianity===
{{Main|New Testament apocrypha}}
[[New Testament apocrypha]]—books similar to those in the [[New Testament]] but almost universally rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants—include several gospels and lives of apostles. Some were written by early Jewish Christians (see the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]). Others of these were  produced by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] authors or members of other groups later defined as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]]. Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early [[Christianity]] among religious scholars, while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit mention of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the pseudepigraphical [[Infancy Gospel of James]].

The [[Gnosticism|Gnostic tradition]] was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels. While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. The [[Gospel of Judas]], a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006.

Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] have in the past also included [[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|I &amp; II Clement]] and [[Shepherd of Hermas]] in their [[New Testament]] canon.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
[[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith, Jr.]] said that when compiling the inspired version of the Holy Bible, he inquired of Heavenly Father about what to do regarding the Apocrypha, the Deuterocanonical Books of the Catholic bible, that are not the 66 books contained in the 1769 edition of the Authorized King James Bible. What Smith claimed to receive from God is now stated in Section 91 of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. 

&quot;Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha-There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly; There are many things that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men. Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated. Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the spirit manifesteth truth; And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom; And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.&quot; 

The 91st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants is the reason that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints currently uses the 1769 edition of the Authorized King James Bible along with excerpts from the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|Joseph Smith Translation (JST)]]. Furthermore, despite having canonized the 1769 edition of the Authorized King James Bible, Joseph Smith Jr. made a note that the Song of Solomon was not inspired, and therefore it is considered Apocrypha despite it being contained in the canon. The [[Community of Christ]], another offshoot of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], has canonized the JST and therefore has excluded the Song of Solomon.

===Taoism===
Prophetic texts called the ''Ch'an-wei'' were written by [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC to 220 CE) Taoist priests to legitimize as well as curb imperial power.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Seidel, Anna. &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises. 291-371.&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with treasure objects that were part of the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] (1066 to 256 BC) royal treasures. Emerging from the instability of the [[Warring States]] Period (476-221 BC), ancient Chinese scholars saw the centralized rule of the Zhou as an ideal model for the new Han empire to emulate. The ''Ch'an-wei'' are therefore texts written by Han scholars about the Zhou royal treasures, only they were not written to record history for its own sake, but for legitimizing the current imperial reign. These texts took the form of stories about texts and objects being conferred upon the Emperors by Heaven and comprising these ancient sage-king's (this is how the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] emperors were referred to by this time, about 500 years after their peak) royal regalia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The desired effect was to confirm the Han emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]] through the continuity offered by his possession of these same sacred talismans. It is because of this politicized recording of their history that it is difficult to retrace the exact origins of these objects. What is known is that these texts were most likely produced by a class of literati called the ''Fang-Shih''. These were a class of nobles who were not part of the state administration; there were considered specialists or occultists, for example diviners, astrologers, alchemists or healers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It is from this class of nobles that the first [[Taoist]] priests are believed to have emerged. [[Seidel]] points out however that the scarcity of sources relating to the formation of the early [[Taoist]] church make the exact link between the apocryphal texts and the Taoist church unclear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Buddhism===
Apocryphal [[Jataka tales|Jatakas]] of the [[Pali]] Buddhist canon, such as those belonging to the Paññāsajātaka collection, have been adapted to fit local culture in certain [[South East Asia]]n countries and have been retold with amendments to the plots to better reflect Buddhist morals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.th/books/about/The_tale_of_Prince_Samuttakote.html?id=xt3YAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y The tale of Prince Samuttakote: a Buddhist epic from Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Pali tradition, the apocryphal Jatakas of later composition (some dated even to the 19th century) are treated as a separate category of literature from the &quot;Official&quot; Jataka stories that have been more-or-less formally canonized from at least the 5th century &amp;mdash; as attested to in ample epigraphic and archaeological evidence, such as extant illustrations in [[bas relief]] from ancient temple walls.
