__TOC__

== Terminology section cleanup ==

The terminology section does need a cleanup.

It is currently structured as follows:

1) a formal definition of the Hebrew term &quot;Haredi&quot;
2) the use of the term ultra-orthodox
3) alternative terms

I think this structure is good and should remain this way. However, section 2 seems to be entirely focused at a few relatively obscure sources who deep the term as controversial. 
*Norman Lamm, a modern Orthodox (not Haredi) Rabbi, is quoted. Possibly okay to leave in, although not sure of its significance.
*Canada's Centre for Faith and Media is given a lengthy space with a long paragraph. There is little I can find on this organisation apart from its own website. There is no reason why wikipedia should give it so much credit at the expense of the vast majority of other credible media organisations who do use the term ultra-orthodox.
*The Star Ledger, a New Jersey based Newspaper, relatively tiny in the context of all newspapers who ever report on Haredi Jews.

This section should either be cut down and be more succinct. Alternatively, if the Star Ledger and Canada's Centre for Faith and Media are noted, should all the other papers and bodies (who do use ultra-Orthodox) be listed?

Again, I refer to my original structure and that is a good way to have it: Discuss the fact that ultra-orthodox is the main translation but there are a few who deem it controversial. Anyone who reads up on Haredi jews in English who find 95% use the term ultra-orthodox, so I cannot see why wikipedia should only focus on the few who oppose it.

Please discuss further...  --[[User:Halma10|Halma10]] ([[User talk:Halma10|talk]]) 19:07, 16 September 2011 (UTC)
::The sources may be reliable, but that doesn't mean that they themselves are not using it in a prejorative manner. If one goes back to the earlier part of the last century, one can see Jewish history being treated this way (see Malcolm Hay, ''Thy Brother's Blood'', Hart Publishing Co., 1975) in many cases; today this is still found for certain politically-incorrect groups. Also, if a large portion of the people themselves consider it prejorative, this also makes it contraversial. I do concede that as of late this term has been used by some Haredi sources.[[User:Mzk1|Mzk1]] ([[User talk:Mzk1|talk]]) 20:52, 4 October 2011 (UTC)
:A number of reliable sources indicate that the term is, or can be, controversial. The article presents this in a brief and NPOV way. I don't see where the tag is warranted. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:33, 27 September 2011 (UTC)

::Jayjg, yes there may be a few sources and I do agree that some view the term as controversial, and this should indeed be noted in the article. My concern lies in the proportionality of the discussion. If you were to read articles/news/research on the ultra-Orthodox you would find that this term is used almost universally. Thus, the wiki section gives the false impression the the view of it being a pejorative term is somewhat mainstream. As Mzk1 pointed out, this term is also used amongst the ultra-Orthodox.--[[User:Halma10|Halma10]] ([[User talk:Halma10|talk]]) 22:00, 6 November 2011 (UTC)
:::I don't see how it gives that impression, but in any event, you can't add your own opinions to the article - everything you add must be [[WP:V|cited]] to [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Do you have any reliable sources that discuss the prevalence or use of the terms &quot;haredi&quot; or &quot;ultra-Orthdox&quot;? I'd be happy to see them, and to help you add them to the article, regardless of the position they espouse.

::::I find this disturbing that one person (Jayjg) has hogged this article, when this author has clear lack of knowledge of the Haredi community - given that various comments made (for example, being completely surprised that Strictly Orthodox was the same as ultra-Orthodox). If every word on wiki was sourced, 90% would be gone - including this very article. Facts are figure are sourced, but broad overviews are not (if you look at any article). Wikipedia relies on experts in those fields to give an overview and provide citations where relevant. I am not going to engage in this this further, but find it a shame and baffled by this person's motives (unless he/she view themselves as a proponent or opponent of Haredim, rather than objective author). I am concerned as this person seems hardly willing to engage in any discussion (for example, a citation by the BBC was removed with no reason). It would be better if there were more authors involved in these discussions rather than the self-styled owner of this page. For people who read this, be cautious of this page's content and read some reliable material elsewhere.--[[User:Halma10|Halma10]] ([[User talk:Halma10|talk]]) 20:19, 7 November 2011 (UTC)
:::::I will proceed with a Dispute Resolution request in the coming week, and we can hopefully resolve some these matters that way.--[[User:Halma10|Halma10]] ([[User talk:Halma10|talk]]) 20:24, 7 November 2011 (UTC)
::::::Feel free to do so, but if I were you I'd carefully review [[WP:V]] and [[WP:NPA]] first. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 02:24, 9 November 2011 (UTC)

== Fired for observing the Sabbath ==

The article contains the passage:

&quot;Jews refusing to work on the Sabbath were almost always fired at the end of the week;[citation needed]; the large majority of those who desisted from working on Saturday had to face the formidable challenge of finding new work each week).[citation needed]&quot;

I don't think citations can be found to support this.  Starting in the 1880's, the first large wave of Jewish immigrants included many who founded businesses, then hired other Jews, providing a way to remain both observant and employed.  

In my moderately extensive reading, I have never come across stories of Jews who hired on to Gentile firms, concealing their refusal to work Saturdays, then surprising the employer at the end of the week and getting fired.  How could this happen?  New Jewish immigrants could not conceal their Jewish background.  English was not taught or spoken in the ghetto, and the immigrants' accent and limited English proficiency would have given them away.  

Someone who feels they have some intellectual authority on this point should consider removing the quoted passage.

:I personally know people whose (great)grandparents were affected by this, and who told me it was indeed quite common. --[[User:Piz d&amp;#39;Es-Cha|Piz d&amp;#39;Es-Cha]] ([[User talk:Piz d&amp;#39;Es-Cha|talk]]) 19:17, 31 December 2011 (UTC)


There's a famous book, All for The Boss, by the daughter of one of the haredi leaders of america at the time, i've read it, it's a perfect citation. just too tired to put it in :/

== Involvement in the Israeli political process, military, economy and education ==

Can somebody add some more information about recent Haredi involvement in Israeli political parties (only Shas discussed in some detail so far) and in the IDF? In the labour market? Or lack of involvement, voluntary or involuntary? Also on curriculum of Haredi schools and to what extent it overlaps with the one taught in other Israeli schools? I don't know enough about if myself. Many thanks. [[User:Nescio vos|Nescio vos]] ([[User talk:Nescio vos|talk]]) 11:21, 3 January 2012 (UTC)

:: You are completely right, but I think it reflects a wider problem that the entire article needs a major cleanup. Some sections are written in long essay style form and also doesn't reflect what is happening with Haredim today (as you mentioned with education, employment etc.)--[[User:Halma10|Halma10]] ([[User talk:Halma10|talk]]) 22:03, 3 January 2012 (UTC)

== &quot;like other Orthodox Jews&quot; ==

isn't the phrase &quot;like other orthodox jews&quot; in the opening pgraph too vague? i'm not sure that Modern Orthodox Jews would consider themselves part of an unbroken chain of tradition. Doesn't the very title &quot;modern&quot; imply otherwise?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/95.86.77.244|95.86.77.244]] ([[User talk:95.86.77.244|talk]]) 09:26, 30 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
