'''Simony''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈsaɪ.mə.ni]}} or {{IPA|[ˈsɪ.mə.ni]}}) is the act of paying for [[sacrament]]s and consequently for [[Liturgy of the Hours|holy office]]s or for positions in the hierarchy of a church, named after [[Simon Magus]], who appears in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:9-24. Simon Magus offers the disciples of [[Jesus]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], payment so that anyone on whom he would [[Laying on of hands|place his hands]] would receive the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. This is the origin of the term ''simony'';&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1965), New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, vol.2, ''p.''932, &quot;Simon.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but it also extends to other forms of trafficking for money in &quot;spiritual things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1880)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;halsbury832&quot;&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt; Simony was also one of the important issues during the [[Investiture Controversy]].

==History==
Simony is an offence against the law of the church. In the [[canon law]] the word bears a more extended meaning than in [[English law]]. ''Simony according to the canonists'', says [[John Ayliffe]] in his ''[[John Ayliffe#Works|Parergon]]'', &lt;blockquote&gt;''is defined to be a deliberate act or a premeditated will and desire of selling such things as are spiritual, or of anything annexed unto spirituals, by giving something of a temporal nature for the purchase thereof; or in other terms it is defined to be a commutation of a thing spiritual or annexed unto spirituals by giving something that is temporal.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' the Decretum&lt;ref&gt;Pt. ii. cause i. quest. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decretals &lt;ref&gt;Bk. v. tit. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the subject. The offender whether ''simoniacus'' (one who had bought his orders) or ''simoniace promotus'' (one who had bought his promotion), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition from orders if a secular priest - to confinement in a stricter [[monastery]] if a regular. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent ''simoniace promotus'' was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same penalties as though he were guilty. 

Certain matters were simoniacal by the [[canon law]] which would not be so regarded in English law.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the sale of [[tithes]], the taking of a fee for [[Confession (religion)|confession]], absolution, marriage or burial, the concealment of one in [[mortal sin]] or the reconcilement of an impenitent for the sake of gain, and the doing of [[homage]] for spiritualities.&lt;/ref&gt; So grave was the crime of simony considered that even infamous persons could accuse of it. English provincial and [[legatine]] constitutions continually assailed simony.

===Church of England===
The [[Church of England]] also struggled with the practice after its separation from Rome. For the purposes of [[English law]], simony is defined by [[William Blackstone]] as the corrupt presentation of any person to an ecclesiastical [[benefice]] for money, gift or reward.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''&lt;/ref&gt; While [[English and Welsh law|English law]] recognised simony as an offence,&lt;ref&gt;'''3''' ''[[Edward Coke|Coke's Institutes]]'' 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; it treated it as merely an ecclesiastical matter, rather than a crime, for which the punishment was forfeiture of the office or any advantage from the offence and severance of any patronage relationship with the person who bestowed the office. Both [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I]] promulgated statutes against simony.  The cases of [[Bishop of St. David's]] [[Thomas Watson (Bishop of St David's)|Thomas Watson]] in 1699&lt;ref&gt;Handley, S. (2004) &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28868 Watson, Thomas (1637–1717)]&quot;, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press. Retrieved 21 August 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Dean of York]] [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William Cockburn]] in 1841 were particularly notable.&lt;ref name=&quot;times410410&quot;&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 10 April 1841, p.6 col.b, reprinted from the ''Cambridge Advertiser''&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Benefice]]s Act 1892, a person guilty of simony is guilty of an offence for which he may be proceeded against under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892. An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways – in promotion to orders, in presentation to a [[benefice]], and in resignation of a [[benefice]]. The [[common law]] (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of [[the Crown]]) has been considerably modified by statute. Where no statute applies to the case, the doctrines of the canon law may still be of authority.

{{As of|2011}}, simony remains an offence.&lt;ref name=&quot;halsbury832&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;halsbury1359&quot;&gt;''Halsbury'' '''1359'''&lt;/ref&gt; An unlawfully bestowed office can be declared void by [[the Crown]], and the offender can be disabled from making future appointments and fined up to £1000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simony Act 1588]], s.4&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy are no longer required to make a declaration as to simony on [[ordination]] but offences are now likely to be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Measure 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;2003 No.3&lt;/ref&gt; r.8.&lt;ref name=&quot;halsbury1359&quot;/&gt;
