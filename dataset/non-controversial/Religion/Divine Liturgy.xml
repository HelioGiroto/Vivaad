'''Divine Liturgy''' ({{lang-el|θεία λειτουργία}}, {{lang-ka|''საღმრთო ლიტურგია''}}, {{lang-bg|Божествена литургия}}, {{lang-rus|''Божественная литургия''}}, {{lang-hy|պատարակ}}, {{lang-sr|Света Литургија}}, {{lang-ro|Sfânta Liturghie}}) is the common term for the [[Eucharist]]ic service of the [[Byzantine church|Byzantine]] tradition of [[Christian liturgy]]. As such, it is used in the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Armenian Christians, both of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenianchurchwd.com/ Western Diocese | Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniancatholic.ru/en/index.html Armenian Catholic Church in Russia | Welcome!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; use the same term. Some [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] employ the term &quot;holy offering&quot; ([[Syriac]]: ''[[Holy Qurbana|qurbana qadisha ]]'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: ''surb patarag'') for their Eucharistic liturgies instead. The term is sometimes applied also to [[Latin Rite]] Eucharistic liturgies, though the term [[Mass (liturgy)|''Mass'']] is more commonly used there.

In Eastern traditions, especially that of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Divine Liturgy is seen as transcending time, and the world. All believers are believed to be united in worship in the Kingdom of God along with departed Saints and the celestial [[Angels]]. To this end, everything in the Liturgy is seen as symbolic, yet also not just merely symbolic, but making the unseen reality manifest. According to Eastern tradition and belief, the Liturgy's roots go back to Jewish worship and the adaptation of Jewish worship by [[Early Christians]]. This can be seen in the first parts of the Liturgy that is termed, the &quot;Liturgy of the Word&quot; that includes reading of scriptures and the Sermon/Homily. The latter half was believed to be added based on the [[Last Supper]] and the first Eucharistic celebrations by Early Christians. Eastern Christians participating in the Liturgy also traditionally believe that the Eucharist is the central part of the service, as they believe it truly becomes the real [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]], and through their partaking of it, they see themselves as together becoming the Body of Christ (that is, the [[Christian Church|Church]]). Each Liturgy has its differences from others, but most are very similar to each other with adaptations based on tradition, purpose, culture and theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OCA Q&amp;A on the Divine Liturgy |url=http://www.oca.org/QAindex-divineliturgy.asp?SID=3 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in North America: Worship |url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/worship |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Byzantine Rite ==
[[Image:Meister der Palastkapelle in Palermo 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of Ss. [[Basil the Great]] (left) and [[John Chrysostom]], authors of the two most frequently used Divine Liturgies, c. 1150 ([[mosaic]] in the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]], [[Palermo]]).]]

There are three Divine Liturgies in the [[Byzantine Rite]] that are in common use in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine Catholic churches:

* The [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]] ([[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century A.D.]]), used on most days of the year, and as a vesperal liturgy on the [[Annunciation]].
* The [[Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great]] ([[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century A.D.]]), used on the 5 Sundays of [[Great Lent]], and on [[Saint Basil]]'s feast day (January 1). On the eves of [[Christmas Eve|the Nativity]] and [[Theophany]], and on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] and [[Holy Saturday]], it is celebrated as a [[Vespers|vesperal]] liturgy. In some traditions, Saint Basil's Liturgy is also celebrated on the [[Feast of the Cross|Exaltation of the Life-giving Cross]] on September 14. All together, St. Basil's liturgy is celebrated 10 times out of the liturgical year.
* The [[Liturgy of St. James|Divine Liturgy of St. James of Jerusalem]] ([[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century A.D.]]), celebrated once a year in Jerusalem (and a few other churches) on the [[feast day]] of [[James the Just|St. James]], brother of the Lord and first bishop of Jerusalem, to whom this Liturgy is traditionally attributed. 

Additionally, the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] ([[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century A.D.]]), is used on Wednesdays and Fridays during [[Great Lent]] and on the first three days of [[Holy Week]]. It is essentially the office of [[vespers]] with a communion service added, the Holy Gifts having been consecrated and reserved the previous Sunday. It is traditionally attributed to [[Pope Gregory I|St. Gregory the Dialogist]]. The Divine Liturgy of St. Mark was also observed in the Orthodox (Chalcedonian) Patriarchate of Alexandria on at least that Saint's day until fairly recent times.

The Hierarchical Liturgy. As numbers in a diocese increased dramatically the bishop as presiding over the Eucharistic assembly appointed presbyters as celebrant in the local community (the parish). Still, the Church is understood in Eastern Orthodoxy not in terms of the presbyter, but the diocesan bishop. When the latter is present, he is chief celebrant. Phrases and hymns are also added. The hierarch commemorates his hierarch demonstrating unity with the greater Orthodox community.

=== Structure ===
:''Note: Psalms are numbered according to the Greek [[Septuagint]]. For the Hebrew [[Masoretic]] numbering that is more familiar in the West, usually add '1'.  (See the main [[Psalms#Numbering|Psalms]] article for an exact correspondence table.)''

The format of Divine Liturgy is fixed, although the specific readings and [[hymn]]s vary with season and feast.  

While arrangements may vary from liturgy to liturgy, the Divine Liturgy always consists of three interrelated parts:
* the [[Liturgy of Preparation]], which includes the entry and vesting prayers of the clergy and the [[Prothesis (liturgy)|Prothesis]];
* the Liturgy of the Catechumens, so called because in ancient times [[catechumen]]s were allowed to attend, also called the Liturgy of the Word;
* and the Liturgy of the Faithful, so called because in ancient times only faithful members in good standing were allowed to participate. In modern times, [[closed communion|this restriction]] applies only to Holy Communion — reception of the [[sacrament]] of [[eucharist|holy communion]].

A typical celebration of the Byzantine Liturgy consists of:

=== Liturgy of Preparation ===

{{Quote box
 | quote  = The journey is to the Kingdom. This is where we are going—not symbolically, but really.

}}
''This part of the Liturgy is private, said only by the priest and deacon. It symbolizes the hidden years of Christ's earthly life.''
* [[Entrance prayers|Entrance]] and [[vesting prayers]]°—the clergy come into the church, venerate the [[icon]]s and put on their [[vestments]].
* [[Liturgy of Preparation]]—the [[priest]] and [[deacon]] prepare the bread and wine for the [[Eucharist]] (see [[prosphora]]) at the [[Table of Oblation]] (Prothesis)
* [[Kairos]] — a preliminary dialog between the priest and the deacon

=== Liturgy of the Catechumens ===

This is the public part of the Liturgy:
* Opening [[blessing]] by the priest°—He raises the [[Gospel Book]], making the [[sign of the cross]] with it over the [[Altar]] and proclaiming: &quot;Blessed is the kingdom of [[Trinity|the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit]], now and ever and unto ages of ages&quot;

Parts marked ° indicate portions that can change according to the day or liturgical season of the year. Some parts change at every Divine Liturgy, some parts only change at [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter).

Note that almost all texts are chanted throughout the Divine Liturgy, not only hymns but litanies, prayers, creed confession and even readings from the Bible. The sole exception is the sermon.

== Oriental Orthodoxy ==
The [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches use the term &quot;Divine Liturgy&quot; for their Eucharistic services, even if also other names such as ''[[Holy Qurbana]]'' and ''Badarak'' are usual in some Oriental Orthodox traditions. Oriental Orthodoxy owns a richness of different liturgies, which are named after the [[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]] included.

At present, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] has three Divine Liturgies:

* The Coptic Liturgy of St. Basil (4th century AD)
* The [[Liturgy of St Cyril|Liturgy of St. Mark the Apostle]], this liturgy is also known as the Liturgy of St. Cyril
* The [[Liturgy of St Gregory the Theologian]]

The Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated on most Sundays and contains the shortest anaphora. The Liturgy of St. Gregory is usually used during the feasts of the Church but not exclusively. In addition the clergy performing the Liturgy can combine extracts of The Liturgies of St. Cyril and St. Gregory to the more frequently used St. Basil at the discretion of the Priest or Bishop.
