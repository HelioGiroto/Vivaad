While fasting from dawn until sunset Muslims refrain from consuming [[food]], drinking liquids, smoking and sexual relations; and in some interpretations from swearing.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Andrew Egan - 2002 - page 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dubai - Page 189, Andrea Schulte-Peevers - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islam, the ''[[sawab]]'' (rewards) of fasting are many, but in this month they are believed to be multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2465-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-125.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 125. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasting for Muslims during Ramadan typically includes the increased offering of ''[[salat]]'' (prayers) and recitation of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/006-sat.php |title=  Sunan Abu-Dawud - (The Book of Prayer) - Detailed Injunctions about Ramadan, Hadith 1370 |first= Sulayman |last= [[Abu Dawud]]-Ibn-Ash'ath-AsSijisstani |work= Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement of The University of Southern California |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2391-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-199.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 199. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Quran==

Chapter 2, Revelation 185 of the Quran states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran; a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, a number of other days. Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you; and that you should complete the period, and that you should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that perhaps you may be thankful.{{cite quran|2|185}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, according to the Quran, [[Muhammad]] first received revelations in the lunar month of Ramadan. Therefore, the month of Ramadan is considered to be the most sacred month of the Islamic calendar, the recording of which began with the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].

==Beginning of Ramadan==
''[[Hilal_(crescent_moon)|Hilāl]]'' (the [[Lunar phase|crescent]]) is typically a day (or more) after the astronomical new moon. Since the new moon indicates the beginning of the new month, Muslims can usually safely estimate the beginning of Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hilalsighting.org/papers/salman.pdf Hilal Sighting &amp; Islamic Dates: Issues and Solution Insha'Allaah]. Hilal Sighting Committee of North America ([http://www.hilalsighting.org/ website]). Retrieved 19 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to many Muslims, this is not in accordance with authenticated Hadiths stating that visual confirmation per region is recommended. The consistent variations of a day have existed since the time of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2466-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-124.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 124 |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices during Ramadan==
===Fasting===
{{Main|Sawm of Ramadan}}
Ramadan is a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims also increase restraint, such as abstaining from sexual relations and generally sinful speech and behavior. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Ramadan also teaches Muslims how to better practice self-discipline, self-control,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2008/08/29/ramadhan_2008_feature.shtml Why Ramadan brings us together]; ''[[BBC]]'', 01 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate; thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity ([[zakat]]).&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/27/AR2008092702592_2.html?nav=rss_world Help for the Heavy at Ramadan], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 27 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes compulsory for Muslims to start fasting when they reach puberty, so long as they are healthy, sane and have no disabilities or illnesses. Exemptions to fasting are travel, menstruation, illness, older age, pregnancy, and breast-feeding. However, many Muslims with medical conditions insist on fasting to satisfy their spiritual needs, and healthcare professionals must work with their patients to reach common ground. Professionals should closely monitor individuals who decide to persist with fasting. &lt;ref name=&quot;unbiaseddietician&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/072709p56.shtml |title=Understanding Muslim Fasting Practices |first1= Dr. Nour |last1=El-Zibdeh |work=todaysdietitian.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While fasting is not considered compulsory in [[youth|childhood]], many children endeavour to complete as many fasts as possible as practice for later life. Those who are unable to fast are obliged to make up for it. According to the Quran, those ill or traveling (''musaafir'') are exempt from obligation, but still must make up the days missed later on.&lt;ref name=&quot;q2-184&quot;&gt;{{cite quran|2|184|s=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Health effects====
Fasting does not pose any medical risks to healthy individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;unbiaseddietician&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/072709p56.shtml |title=Understanding Muslim Fasting Practices |first1= Dr. Nour |last1=El-Zibdeh |work=todaysdietitian.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of cardiologists in the UAE found that people observing Ramadan enjoy a positive effect on their lipid profile, which means there is a reduction of cholesterol in the blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emirates247.com/hala-ramadan/fasting-for-ramadan-is-good-for-your-heart-uae-study-2012-07-20-1.468006|title=Ramadan fasting is good for the heart: study |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2012 |work=[[Emirates 24/7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suhoor===
{{Main|Sahri}}
Each day before dawn, Muslims observe a pre-fast meal called [[Suhoor]]. Due to the high diversity of the global Muslim community ([[ummah]]),  the typical suhoor or iftar meals vary. A few dates and a cup of water are typically the first foods to break the fast, while fried pastries, salads, nuts, legumes, and breads are also common. &lt;ref name=&quot;unbiaseddietician&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/072709p56.shtml |title=Understanding Muslim Fasting Practices |first1= Dr. Nour |last1=El-Zibdeh |work=todaysdietitian.com |accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After stopping a short time before dawn, Muslims hasten to pray the first prayer of the day, the [[Fajr prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.hadithcollection.com/sahihmuslim/134-Sahih%20Muslim%20Book%2006.%20Fasting/10921-sahih-muslim-book-006-hadith-number-2415.html |title=  Sahih Muslim - Book 006 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 2415 |first= Abul-Hussain |last= Muslim-Ibn-Habaj | work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2446-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-144.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 144 |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iftar===
{{Main|Iftar}}
[[File:Iftar in Istanbul Turkey.jpg|thumb|Iftar in [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]],Turkey]]
At sunset, families hasten for the fast-breaking meal known as Iftar. Considering the high diversity of the global Muslim population, it is impossible to describe typical suhoor or iftar meals. Suhoor can be dinner, or iftar, leftovers, typical breakfast foods, or ethnic foods. Social gatherings, many times buffet style, at iftar are frequent, and traditional dishes are often highlighted. A few dates and a cup of water are usually the first foods to break the fast, while fried pastries, salads, nuts, legumes, and breads are common. Traditional desserts are often unavoidable, especially those made only during Ramadan. Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are also consumed. Soft drinks and caffeinated beverages are consumed to a lesser extent.&lt;ref name=&quot;unbiaseddietician&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/072709p56.shtml |title=Understanding Muslim Fasting Practices |first1= Dr. Nour |last1=El-Zibdeh |work=todaysdietitian.com |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle East]], the Iftar meal consists of water, juices, dates, salads and appetizers, one or more entrees, and dessert. Typical entrees are &quot;lamb stewed with wheat berries, lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, or roast chicken served with chickpea-studded rice pilaf&quot;. A rich dessert such as [[baklava]] or kunafeh (&quot;a buttery, syrup-sweetened kadaifi noodle pastry filled with cheese&quot;) concludes the meal.&lt;ref name=&quot;la&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-ramadan-20120721,0,1433650.story |title=Ramadan's high note is often a dip |first1=Faye |last1=Levy |first2=Yakir |last2=Levy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Over time''', iftar has grown into banquet festivals. This is a time of fellowship with families, friends and surrounding communities, but may also occupy larger spaces at masjid or banquet halls for 100 or more diners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-08-08/news/fl-ramadan-food-20100808_1_iftar-fasting-muslims-hail |title=Ramadan: Muslims feast and fast during holy month |first=James D. |last=Davis |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2012|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many around the world, iftar starts with the eating of one or more (usually three) [[Phoenix dactylifera#Dates|dates]] &amp;ndash; as Muhammad used to do. Following that, Muslims adjourn for the Maghrib prayer, the fourth of the five daily prayers, after which the main meal is served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/Muslims_fast_and_feast_as_Ramadan_begins.html?showFullArticle=y |title=Muslims fast and feast as Ramadan begins |first=Melissa |last=Fletcher Stoeltje
|date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=22 July 2012 |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
{{Main|Zakat|Sadaqa}}
Charity is very important in Islam, and even more so during Ramadan. Zakat, often translated as &quot;the poor-rate&quot;, is obligatory as one of the pillars of Islam; a fixed percentage required to be given by those with savings. Sadaqa is voluntary charity in given above and beyond what is required from the obligation of zakat. In Islam all good deeds are more handsomely rewarded in Ramadan than in any other month of the year. Consequently, many will choose this time to give a larger portion, if not all, of the zakat for which they are obligated to give. In addition, many will also use this time to give a larger portion of sadaqa in order to maximize the reward that will await them on the [[Day of Judgment]].

In many Muslim countries, it is a common sight to see people giving more food to the poor and the homeless, and even to see large public areas for the poor to come and break their fast. It is said that if a person helps a fasting person to break their fast, then they receive a reward for that fast, without diminishing the reward that the fasting person got for their fast.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Increased prayer and recitation of the Quran===
In addition to fasting, Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran. Some Muslims perform the recitation of the entire Quran by means of special prayers, called ''[[Tarawih]]''.  These voluntary prayers are held in the mosques every night of the month, during which a whole section of the Quran (''[[Juz']]'', which is 1/30 of the Quran) is recited. Therefore, the entire Quran would be completed at the end of the month. Although, it is not required to read the whole Quran in the [[Tarawih|Salatul Tarawih]] prayers, it is common.

==Laylat al-Qadr==
{{Main|Laylat al-Qadr}}
Sometimes referred to as &quot;the night of power&quot; or 'the night of decree&quot;, [[Laylat al-Qadr]] is considered the most holy night of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Robinson | first = Neal | title = Islam: A Concise Introduction | publisher = Georgetown University Press | year = 1999 | location = Washington | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-87840-224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2465-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-125.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 125|first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the night in which Muslims believe the first revelation of the Quran was sent down to Muhammad stating that this night was &quot;better than one thousand months [of proper worship], as stated in Chapter 97:3 of the Qu'ran.

Also, generally, Laylat al-Qadr is believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last 10 days of Ramadan, i.e., either the night of the 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/65-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2032.%20Praying%20at%20Night%20In%20Ramadhan%20(Taraweeh)/2479-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-032-hadith-number-238.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 032 (Praying at Night In Ramadhan), Hadith 238|first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Ramadan==
===Eid ul-Fitr===
{{Main|Eid ul-Fitr}}
The Muslim holiday of ''Eid ul-Fitr'' ({{lang-ar|عيد الفطر}}, &quot;festivity of breaking the fast&quot;), sometimes spelled in English as ''Eid al-Fitr'', marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month called ''Shawwal'' in Arabic. This first day of the following month is declared after another crescent [[new moon]] has been sighted or the completion of 30 days of fasting if no visual sighting is possible due to weather conditions. This first day of ''Shawwal'' is called ''Eid ul-Fitr''. ''Eid Ul-Fitr'' may also be a reference towards the festive nature of having endured the month of fasting successfully and returning to the more natural disposition (''fitra'') of being able to eat, drink and resume intimacy with spouses during the day.

For the manner in which the Eid is celebrated, see ''[[Eid ul-Fitr]]'' and ''[[Salat al Eid]]''.

==Cultural aspects==
[[File:Lanterns from below.JPG|thumb|Ramadan lantern decorations]]
[[File:Ramadan jerusalem kmhad.jpg|thumb|Ramadan in the Old City of Jerusalem]]

Various cultural additions are mistakenly associated as part of the original celebrations arising from the time of Muhammad, as many of the forms of celebration in various cultures and countries have added. For example, no symbols of Ramadan were evident in any scholarly literature of Muhammad's lifetime, yet in some places Ramadan is met with various decorations.{{Citation needed| date=August 2012}}

For example, in some Muslim countries today lights are strung up in public squares, and across city streets, to add to the festivities of the month. [[Lantern]]s have become symbolic decorations welcoming the month of Ramadan. In a growing number of countries, they are hung on city streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/slideshow/muslims-begin-fasting-start-ramadan-holy-month-16822614 |title= Muslims begin fasting for Ramadan|first= |last= |work= ABC News |date= July 18, 2012 |accessdate= 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/the-spirit-of-ramadan-is-here-but-why-is-it-still-so-dark |title=The spirit of Ramadan is here, but why is it still so dark? |author= Taryam Al Subaihi |date= July 29, 2012 |work= The National|accessdate= July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://shine.yahoo.com/decorate-ramadan-175400368.html |title= How to decorate for Ramadan |first= Sylvia |last= Cochran |work= Yahoo-Shine|year= August 8, 2011 |accessdate= 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of lanterns as a decoration becoming associated with Ramadan is believed to have originated during the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] primarily centered in [[Egypt]], where the Caliph Al-Muizz Lideenillah was greeted by people holding lanterns to celebrate his ruling. From that time lanterns were used to light mosques and houses throughout the capital city of [[Cairo]]. Shopping malls, places of business, and people's homes can be seen with stars and crescents, as well as, various lighting effects, as well. Some Muslim parents, residing in Western countries mimick modern Christmas celebration traditions, as a means of trying to make Ramadan a more enjoyable time for their children who are too young to fast and understand the spiritual significance of the holy month.{{Citation needed| date=August 2012}}

Some Muslims may use a ''Ramadan calendar'' to help their children understand Ramadan.{{Citation needed| date=August 2012}} There are 29 or 30 flaps, behind which there may be a small piece of chocolate, a sweet or a toy. The calendars are similar to and may have developed from [[advent calendar]]s,{{Citation needed| date=August 2012}} which are popular during the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas period]].

==Origins==

===Origin of the word Ramadan===
Ramadan, as a name for the month, is of Muslim origin. However, prior to Islam's exclusion of [[intercalary days]] from its calendar, the name of this month was called Natiq and [due to the intercalary days added] always occurred in the warm season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=75&amp;region=EN Quran, Short Commentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the first [[Wahy|revelation]] to Muhammad was sent down during the month of Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;Quran Chapter 2, Revelation 185&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[God]] proclaimed to Muhammad that fasting for His Sake was not a new innovation in monotheism, but rather an obligation practiced by those truly devoted to The Oneness of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quran Chapter 2, Revelation 183&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Pre-Islamic observation of fasting ===
During the [[Jahilliyah]] (i.e. pre-Islamic period) the tribe of Quraish and the Jews used to fast on the day of Ashura &lt;ref name=&quot;Hadith 222&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2368-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-222.html|title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 222. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hadith 223&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2367-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-223.html|title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 223. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hadith 220&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2370-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-220.html |title=  Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 220. |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Bukhari-Ibn-Ismail |work= hadithcollection.com |accessdate= 19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marks two historical events: the day Nuh (Noah) left the Ark, and the day that Musa (Moses) was saved from the Egyptians by Allah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/ashura.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Ashura may or may not be referring to the [[Judaism|Jewish practice]] of fasting on [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] I.145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Goyṭayn | first = Šelomo D. | title = Studies in Islamic history and institutions | publisher = E.

Abu Zanad, an Arabic writer from Iraq who lived around 747 A.D. (after the founding of Islam), wrote that at least one [[Mandaean]] community located in northern Iraq observed Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Allah ibn Zakwan Abi al-Zanad.
