There are 20,000 Jedi's living in Canada, I feel they are not represented by this page

==Head of State, Succession==

The article states: &quot;The succession laws forbid Roman Catholics and their spouses from occupying the throne, and the reigning monarch is also ex officio Supreme Governor of the Church of England.&quot;  

Yes, but the Statute of Westminister clearly released Canada and other members of the Commonwealth from rules governing succession to the throne. The question is, are there laws currently in place in Canada which would forbid a Roman Catholic from being Canada's head-of-state? No law requires us to recognize Elizabeth's eventual successor.--[[User:Ggbroad|Ggbroad]] 00:46, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

== Separation of church and state ==


I'm from the U.S. and am curious to what degree Canada does or does not require or practice [[separation of church and state]].  Is the government ever prohibited from funding religious activities or messages, or can it do whatever it wants? Is there a line beyond which state involvement in religion becomes controversial?  Do politicians make a big deal about religion when running for office?  When did Canada stop having a state religion (when it was part of the UK, it was presumably the Church of England)? -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] 19:49, 1 August 2007 (UTC)
:As far as the article on state religion says, the Church of England was disestablished in [[1854]] as the state religion of the province of Canada. So, since independence Canada has not had a state religion. The restrictions governing the involvement of religion and state are found in Supreme Court cases referring to freedom of religion and the striking down of religious laws due to a perception of discrimination against those of other or no faith. But no, there exists no strict separation of church and state, which has led to a muted pluralism in Canadian policy.

== Christian Orthodox #s ==

People are adding stats for the smallest groups of this small group. THis gives the wrong impression about relative %s. The largest groups are Greek Orthodox &amp; n.i.e.s. If you are going to add your group please add the rest too. Here are the numbers for 2001 - but I doubt we should be including groups of 0.02%. Details are at:

==Schism?==
Why is the Roman Orthodox Church seperated from the statistics of the Eastern Orthodox Church?

== Neopaganism? ==

There are a lot of religions left out of this. How can neopaganism be left out (and others I'm sure), when there isn't even an &quot;other&quot; category? I mean, the percentages only add up to 99.9%, but I still think more than 0.1% of Canadians are some religion other than those listed here. Even if the number is that small, perhaps it should be listed as other? [[User:Spock of Vulcan|Spock of Vulcan]] ([[User talk:Spock of Vulcan|talk]]) 17:36, 3 November 2010 (UTC)
:I just realised that there is an other category. Sorry about that! However, that makes me even more curious about where that extra 0.1% is. Maybe people who refused to answer? I wish these surveys would be more thorough and not group so many people into &quot;other&quot;.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Spock of Vulcan|Spock of Vulcan]] ([[User talk:Spock of Vulcan|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Spock of Vulcan|contribs]]) 17:39, 3 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Religion in Canada

The paragraph “While the majority of Québécois are still professed Latin rite Roman Catholics, rates of church attendance are today extremely low, in fact, they are the lowest of any region in North America today. “ is incorrect. According to Stats Canada, the highest level of non church attendance is British Columbia. http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2006001/c-g/4097584-eng.htm
The Catholic Church in Quebec does not practice a Latin Rite, though permitted, on the grounds that they say there is a lack of interest amongst Catholics.

This also applies to “There are very few evangelicals in Quebec and in the largest urban areas, which are generally secular, although there are several congregations above 1000 in most large cities.” This may be an opinion but there is no evidence to support this highly debatably proposition that ‘large urban areas’ in Quebec are any more secular than large urban areas anywhere else.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.67.163.102|76.67.163.102]] ([[User talk:76.67.163.102|talk]]) 02:37, 28 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
