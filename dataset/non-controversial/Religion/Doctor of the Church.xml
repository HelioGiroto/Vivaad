      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20087">[[File:Isidor von Sevilla.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|St. [[Isidore of Seville]], a 7th century Doctor of the Church, depicted by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (c. 1628) with a book, common iconographical object for a doctor.]]
'''Doctor of the Church''' ([[Latin]] ''doctor'', teacher, from Latin ''docere'', to teach) is a title given by a variety of [[Christian church]]es to individuals whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine.

==Catholic Church==
In the [[Catholic Church]], this title is given to a saint from whose writings the whole Church is held to have derived great advantage and to whom &quot;eminent learning&quot; and &quot;great sanctity&quot; have been attributed by a proclamation of a [[pope]] or of an [[ecumenical council]]. This honour is given rarely, and only after [[canonization]]. No ecumenical council has yet exercised the prerogative of proclaiming a Doctor of the Church.

[[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], and [[Pope Gregory I]] were the original Doctors of the Church and were named in 1298. They are known collectively as the Great Doctors of the Western Church.  The four Great Doctors of the Eastern Church, [[John Chrysostom]], [[Basil the Great]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] were recognized in 1568 by [[Pope St. Pius V]].

The Doctors' works vary greatly in subject and form. Some, such as Pope Gregory I and Ambrose were prominent writers of letters and short treatises. [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[John of the Cross]] wrote [[mystical theology]]. Augustine and [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]] defended the Church against [[heresy]] (Bellarmine condemned [[Giordano Bruno]] to death). [[Bede|Bede's]] ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' provides the best information on [[England]] in the early Middle Ages. Systematic theologians include the Scholastic philosophers [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Until 1970, no woman had been named a doctor in the church, but since then four additions to the list have been women: [[Saint]]s [[Teresa of Ávila]] (St. Teresa of Jesus), [[Catherine of Siena]] by [[Pope Paul VI]], [[Thérèse de Lisieux]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/doctor-of-the-universal-church/]&lt;/ref&gt; (St. Therese of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face), &quot;the Little Flower&quot; by [[Pope John Paul II]], and [[Hildegard of Bingen]] by [[Benedict XVI]]. Saints Teresa and Therese were both [[Discalced Carmelite]]s.

Traditionally, in the [[Liturgy]], the Office of Doctors was distinguished from that of [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessors]] by two changes: the Gospel reading ''Vos estis sal terrae'' (&quot;You are the salt of the earth&quot;), Matthew 5:13–19, and the eighth Respond at Matins, from Ecclesiasticus 15:5, ''In medio Ecclesiae aperuit os ejus, * Et implevit eum Deus spiritu sapientiae et intellectus. * Jucunditatem et exsultationem thesaurizavit super eum.'' (&quot;In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth, * And God filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding. * He heaped upon him a treasure of joy and gladness.&quot;) The [[Nicene Creed]] was also recited at Mass, which is normally not said except on Sundays and the highest-ranking feast days. The 1962 revisions to the Missal dropped the Creed from feasts of Doctors.

As of 2012, the Catholic Church has named 35 Doctors of the Church. Of these, the 18 who died before the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054 (marked * in the list below) are also venerated by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].  Among these 35 are 26 from the West and 9 from the East; 4 women; 18 bishops, 12 priests, 1 deacon, 3 nuns, 1 consecrated virgin; 26 from Europe, 3 from Africa, 6 from Asia. More Doctors (12) lived during the 4th century than any other, while the 2nd, 9th, 10th, and 20th centuries possessed no Doctors at all.

===New Doctors=== 
On 20 August 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] announced that he would soon declare [[John of Avila|St. John of Ávila]] a Doctor of the Church. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope to proclaim St John of Avila Doctor of the Universal Church|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-proclaims-st-john-of-Ávila-doctor-of-the-univ|work=News.va|publisher=Holy See|accessdate=21 August 2011|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although no official announcement was given, it was reported in December 2011 that Pope Benedict intended to declare [[Hildegard of Bingen]] as a Doctor of the Church despite her not yet having been officially canonised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope to Canonize and Name Hildegard of Bingen as Doctor of the Church|url=http://www.romereports.com/palio/pope-to-canonize-and-name-hildegard-of-bingen-as-doctor-of-the-church-english-5666.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liturgical cult of St. Hildegard of Bingen was officially extended to the universal Church by Pope Benedict XVI on 10 May 2012, clearing the way for her to be named a Doctor of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romereports.com/palio/benedict-xvi-officially-declares-hildegard-of-bingen-a-saint-english-6759.html &quot;Benedict XVI officially declares Hildegard of Bingen a Saint&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pope Benedict formally declared SS John of Ávila and Hildegard of Bingen to be Doctors of the Church on 7 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-two-new-doctors-of-the-church&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other recognised Doctors===
In addition, parts of the Roman Catholic Church have recognised other individuals with this title. In [[Spain]], [[Fulgentius of Cartagena]], [[Ildephonsus of Toledo]] and [[Leander of Seville]] have been recognized with this title.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Though not named Doctors of the Church or even canonized, [[Beatification|Bl.]] [[John Duns Scotus]] has been called ''Doctor subtilis'' (Subtle Doctor), and the priest and professor [[Francisco Suárez]] ''Doctor eximius'' (Exceptional Doctor).

The [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] recognises Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Augustine, Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and John Chrysostom, as well as [[Ephrem the Syrian]], Isaac the Elder, Pope Leo I, John of Damascus, Cyril of Alexandria, Cyril of Jerusalem, [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], and [[Gregory of Nyssa]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] honours as doctor [[Polycarp]], [[Eustathius of Antioch]], Meletius, [[Alexander of Jerusalem]], Athanasius, Basil, Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom, [[Fravitta of Constantinople]], Ephrem the Syrian, [[Jacob of Nisibis]], [[James of Serug]], [[Isaac of Armenia]], [[Isaac of Nineveh]], and [[Maruthas]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
The [[Eastern Orthodox]] church honors many of the pre-schism saints as well, but the application of the term &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot; is, in effect, unnecessary within the overall praxis of Eastern Orthodox theology, thus omitting the need to look for lists of officially recognized &quot;Doctors&quot;. The more usual term used is ''Father''. An [[Eastern Orthodox]] understanding of such notables includes saints such as [[Photios I of Constantinople]] (''see [[Photian schism]]''), [[Gregory Palamas]] and [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]]. One consistent use of the category is the trio of [[Basil the Great]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[John Chrysostom]], recognized as universal teachers and known as the Three Holy Hierarchs, representing the Christianization of the Hellenic tradition and education. In addition, besides [[St John the Evangelist]], two other saints bear the title 'Theologian': they are St. [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and St. [[Symeon the New Theologian]].

==Armenian Church==
The [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]] recognizes as Doctors of the Church [[Hierotheus the Thesmothete]], [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], [[Pope Sylvester I]], Athanasius of Alexandria, Cyril of Alexandria, Ephrem the Syrian, Basil the Great, Gregory Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, Epiphanius of Salamis, John Chrysostom, Cyril of Jerusalem, and their own saints [[Saint Mesrob|Mesrob]], [[Eliseus the historiographer]], [[Moses of Chorene]], [[David the philosopher]], [[Gregory of Narek]], [[Nerses III the Builder]], and [[Nerses of Lambron]]. (See also [[Vardapet]])

==Assyrian Church of the East==
The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] recognizes as Doctors of the Church Eliseus, [[Diodore of Tarsus]], [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], and [[Nestorius]].

==Anglicanism==
The churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] tend not to use the term &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot; in their calendars of saints, preferring expressions such as &quot;Teacher of the Faith&quot;. Those thus recognized include figures from before and after the Reformation, most of whom are also recognized as ''Doctors of the Church'' by Rome. Those designated ''Teachers of the Faith'' in the [[Church of England]]'s [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]] are as follows:

*[[Basil the Great]] and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]
*[[Hilary of Poitiers]]
*[[Francis de Sales]]
*[[Thomas Aquinas]]
*[[Cyril of Jerusalem]]
*[[Frederick Denison Maurice]]
*[[William of Ockham]]
*[[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]
*[[Catherine of Siena]]
*[[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]]
*[[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem of Syria]]
*[[Sadhu Sundar Singh|Sundar Singh of India]]
*[[Cyril of Alexandria]]
*[[Irenaeus|Irenæus]]
*[[Bonaventure]]
*[[Gregory of Nyssa]] and his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]]
*[[Brooke Foss Westcott]]
*[[Jeremy Taylor]]
*[[Bernard of Clairvaux]]
*[[Augustine of Hippo]]
*[[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]]
*[[John Chrysostom]]
*[[Sergei of Radonezh]]
*[[Jerome]]
*[[Teresa of Ávila]]
*[[Richard Hooker]]
*[[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]]
*[[Pope Leo I|Leo the Great]]
*[[John of Damascus]]
*[[Ambrose]]
*[[John of the Cross]]

Since all of the above appear in the calendar at the level of [[Lesser Festival (Church of England)|Lesser Festival]] or [[Commemoration (Church of England)|Commemoration]], their celebration is optional. Similarly, because &quot;In the Calendar of the Saints, diocesan and other local provision may be made to supplement the national Calendar&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Common Worship'' (Main Volume), p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; those Doctors of the Church recognized by Rome may also be celebrated in the Church of England.

==Lutheranism==
The [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran calendar of saints]] does not use the term &quot;Doctor of the Church.&quot; The calendar of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] refers to [[Martin Luther]] by the title of &quot;Doctor&quot; in recognition of his academic degree, [[Doctor of Theology]] from the [[University of Wittenberg]] in 1512.
