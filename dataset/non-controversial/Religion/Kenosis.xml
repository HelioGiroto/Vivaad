In [[Christian theology]], '''''Kenosis''''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[emptiness]] {{Lang|el|κένωσις}} (''kénōsis'')) is the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to [[God|God's]] divine will. 

The word {{lang|el|ἐκένωσεν}} (''ekénōsen'') is used in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:7, &quot;[[Jesus]] made himself nothing ...&quot; ([[New International Version|NIV]]) or &quot;...he emptied himself...&quot; ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]), using the verb form {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') &quot;to empty&quot;. See also [http://blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=2758 Strong's G2758].

==Etymology and definition==
Etymology is from Greek {{lang|el|κενόω}} (''kenóō'') &quot;to empty out&quot;. The Liddell–Scott [[Greek–English Lexicon]] gives the following simplified definition simplified for the noun:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fnwsis&amp;highlight=empty κέν-ωσις , εως]&amp;nbsp;— A. emptying, depletion, {{lang|el|οὐχὶ πεῖνα καὶ δίψα}} . . {{lang|el|κενώσεις τινές εἰσι}} . . ; [[Plato]] [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] 585b, cf.

# emptying, depletion, emptiness (of life) (e.g. [[Vettius Valens]])
# depletion, low diet, as opposed to ''plerosis'' fullness (e.g. [[Hippocrates]])
# waning (of the moon) (e.g. [[Epicurus]])

==New Testament usage==
The New Testament does not use the actual word ''kénōsis''&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians (ed. Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort) in I Corinthians, chapter 9: ... {{lang|el|γάρ μοι μᾶλλον ἀποθανεῖν ἢ&amp;nbsp;– τὸ καύχημά μου οὐδεὶς '''κενώσει'''. ἐὰν γὰρ εὐαγγελίζωμαι, οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα, ἀνάγκη}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the verb form ''kenóō'' occurs five times (Ro.4:14, 1Co.1:17, 9:15, 2Co.9:3, Phil.2:7). Of these five times it is Phil 2:7, in which Jesus is said to have &quot;emptied himself,&quot; which is the starting point of Christian ideas of kenosis.

[[John the Baptist]] displayed the attitude when he said of Jesus, &quot;He must become greater; I must become less.&quot; (Jn 3:30).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://padretex.com/?p=27 | title=The Initial Movement of the Eucharist | author=Fr.

==Kenosis in Christology==
===John of the Cross===
{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}
In [[Christian theology]], ''kenosis'' is the concept of the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God and the divine will. It is used both as an explanation of the [[Incarnation]], and an indication of the nature of God's activity and will. [[Mystical theology|Mystical theologian]] [[John of the Cross]]' work &quot;[[Dark Night of the Soul]]&quot; is a particularly lucid explanation of God's process of transforming the believer into the icon or &quot;likeness of Christ&quot;.

An apparent dilemma arises when Christian theology posits a God outside of [[time]] and [[space]], who enters into time and space to become human ([[incarnation|Incarnate]]). The doctrine of Kenosis attempts to explain what the [[Son of God]] chose to give up in terms of his divine attributes, in order to assume human nature. Since the incarnate Jesus is [[Hypostatic Union|simultaneously truly human and truly divine]], Kenosis holds that these changes were temporarily assumed by God in his incarnation, and that when [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Jesus ascended back into heaven]] following the resurrection, he fully reassumed all of his original attributes and divinity.

Specifically it refers to attributes of God that are thought to be incompatible with becoming fully human. For example, God's [[omnipotence]], [[omnipresence]], [[omniscience]] as well as his [[aseity]], [[eternity]], [[infinity]], [[impassibility]] and [[immutability (theology)|immutability]]. Theologians who support this doctrine often appeal to a reading of [[Philippians 2:5-8]]. Critics of Kenosis theology argue that the context of Philippians 2:5-8 is referring to Jesus taking the form of a servant to conceal his divine glory (revealed temporarily in the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]), or to forsaking his place and position in heaven to dwell among men, as opposed to forsaking his divine attributes or nature (see [[syncatabasis]]).

Kenotic [[Christology]] focuses on certain passages in the [[Gospels]] where Jesus was not omniscient concerning the date of the Second Advent ({{bibleverse||Mark|13:32}}, Matthew 24:36), and draws attention to the fact that He was not omnipresent during the incarnation. It became a central issue in the [[Protestant]] debates of the sixteenth century, and was revived in the nineteenth century to reinterpret classical doctrines of the incarnation.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Orthodox Mystical Theology of the East emphasises following the example of Christ. Kenosis is only possible through humility and presupposes that one seeks union with God.  The [[Poustinia]] tradition of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is one major expression of this search.

Kenosis is not only a Christological issue in Orthodox theology, it has moreover to do with [[Pneumatology]], namely to do with the Holy Spirit. Kenosis, relative to the human nature, denotes the continual [[epiklesis]] and self-denial of one's own human will and desire. With regard to Christ, there is a kenosis of the Son of God, a condescension and self-sacrifice for the redemption and salvation of all humanity. Humanity can also participate in God's saving work through [[theosis]]; becoming holy by grace.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of God the Son with the God the Father.&quot; Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0824/_P16.HTM#N5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, in Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis never concerns becoming like God in essence or being, which is [[pantheism]]; instead, it concerns becoming united to God by grace, through his [[Essence-Energies distinction|Energies]]. Orthodox theology distinguishes between divine [[Essence-Energies distinction|Essence and Energies]]. Kenosis therefore is a paradox and a mystery since &quot;emptying oneself&quot; in fact fills the person with divine grace and results in union with God. Kenosis in Orthodox theology is the transcending or detaching of oneself from the world or the passions, it is a component of dispassionation. Much of the earliest debates between the Arian and Orthodox Christians were over kenosis. The need for clarification about the human and divine nature of the Christ (see the [[hypostatic union]]) were fought over the meaning and example that Christ set, as an example of kenosis or ekkenosis.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of
God the Son with the God the Father.&quot; Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92-95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
Another perspective is the idea that God is self-emptying. He poured out himself to create the [[cosmos]] and the [[universe]], and everything within it. Therefore, it is our duty to pour out ourselves. (This is similar to C.S. Lewis's statement in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that a painter pours his ideas out in his work, and yet remains quite a distinct being from his painting.)

===Catholicism===
Although Catholicism accepts it, Pope Pius XII in 1951 wrote ''Sempiternus Rex Christus'', in which he condemns a particular interpretation of [[Philippians]] in regards to the kenosis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is another enemy of the faith of Chalcedon, widely diffused outside  the fold of the Catholic religion. This is an opinion for which a rashly and falsely understood sentence of St. Paul's Epistle to the Philippians (ii, 7), supplies a basis and a shape. This is called the  kenotic doctrine, and according to it, they imagine that the divinity was taken away from the Word in Christ. It is a wicked invention, equally to be condemned with the Docetism opposed to it. It reduces the whole mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption to empty the bloodless imaginations. 'With the entire and perfect nature of man'--thus grandly St. Leo the Great--'He Who was true God was born, complete in his own nature, complete in ours' (Ep. xxviii, 3. PL. Liv, 763. Cf. Serm. xxiii, 2. PL. lvi, 201).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_pi12sr.htm Sempiternus Rex Christus]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unitarianism===
Since all forms of [[Unitarianism]] do not accept the personal [[pre-existence of Christ]] therefore all Unitarian interpretations of Phil.2:7, and the concept of &quot;kenosis&quot;, Christ &quot;emptying&quot; himself, take as a starting point that his &quot;emptying&quot; occurred in life, and not before birth. However as [[Thomas Belsham]] put it, there are varying views on when in life this emptying occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Belsham ''American Unitarianism: or A Brief history of the progress and present state of the Unitarian Churches in America'' 1816 p119 &quot;In answer to the inquiry ; when was it, after entering on bis publick ministry, that Christ emptied himself of the form of God, and look on him the form of a servant and the fashion of a man?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Belsham took this to be at the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], whereas [[Joseph Priestley]]&lt;ref&gt;Belsham, op.cit., p119 citing Priestley's ''Letters'' p139&lt;/ref&gt; took this to be in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] when Christ did not resist arrest. The [[Christadelphian]] Tom Barling considered that the &quot;emptying&quot; of Christ was a continual process which started in the earliest references to Christ's character, Luke 2:40,52, and continued through the [[temptations of Christ]] and his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Barling ''The Letter to the Philippians'' CMPA Birmingham 1957 p46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnosticism===
The equivalent to kenōsis in Gnostic literature is Christ's withdrawal of his own luminosity into himself, so as to cease dazzling his own disciples. At the request of his disciples, &quot;Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. S. Mead (translator) : ''Pistis Sophia''. (lib. 1, cap. 6) ) http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ps/ps010.htm (p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; There are parallels to this voluntary withdrawal of the incarnate deity's light in the literatures of other religions also, such as in Daoism, where when the incarnate deity &quot;Crane Boy&quot; came to the world of humans in his incarnation as Han Xiangzi, he &quot;concealed his auspicious light, left the underworld, and returned to the world of humans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng (translated by Philip Clart) : ''The Story of Han Xiangzi''. University of Washington Press, Seattle, 2007. ISBN 0-295-98690-5. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenotic ethic===
The '''kenotic ethic''' is the [[ethic]] of [[Jesus]], considered as the ethic of [[sacrifice]]. The Philippians passage urges believers to imitate Christ's self-emptying. In this interpretation, Paul was not primarily putting forth a theory about God in this passage, rather he was using God's humility exhibited in the incarnation event as a call for Christians to be similarly subservient to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jay Oord]] ''Defining Love: A Philosophical, Scientific, and Theological Engagement'', Brazos Press, 2010. 1-58743-257-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oord. T.J. &quot;Essential Kenosis&quot; in ''The Nature of Love: A Theology'', Chalice Press, 2010. ISBN 9780827208285'' pp. 149,155.&lt;/ref&gt;
