'''Comparative religion''' is that branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. There are many benefits to such a course of enquiry but in general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]] and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. A person who has undertaken such a course of study has a much richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine&quot;  [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after [http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm What is Religion? Definitions and Quotes.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] are generally classified as [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]], [[Indian religions|Indian]] or [[Taoic religion|Taoic]].  Areas of study also include [[creation myth]]s and [[Humanism]].

==Abrahamic religions==
{{Main|Abrahamic religion}}
{{POV-section|date=January 2012}}
In the study of comparative religion, the category of Abrahamic religions consists of the three [[monotheistic]] religions, [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], which claim [[Abraham]] (Hebrew ''Avraham'' אַבְרָהָם ; Arabic ''Ibrahim'' إبراهيم ) as a part of their sacred history. Other religions (such as the [[Bahá'í Faith]]) that fit this description are sometimes included but are often omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html Why Abrahamic?] Lubar Institute for the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

The original belief in the [[One God]] of Abraham eventually became present-day [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Christians believe that Christianity is the [[Supersessionism|fulfillment]] and continuation of the Jewish [[Old Testament]]. Christians believe that [[Jesus]] (Hebrew ''Yeshua'' יֵשׁוּעַ) is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] [[prophecy]], and believe in subsequent New Testament revelations based on the divine authority of Jesus in Christian belief (as the [[Incarnation|Incarnation of God]]). Islam believes the present Christian and Jewish scriptures have been [[Tahrif|corrupted]] over time and are no longer the original divine revelations as given to [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and other prophets. For Muslims, the ''[[Qur'an]]'' is the final, complete revelation from [[God]] (Arabic الله ''[[Allah]]''), who believe it to have been [[divine revelation|revealed]] to [[Muhammad]], who is believed by Muslims to be the [[Prophet of Islam|final prophet of Islam]].

[[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] are two closely related [[Abrahamic religion]]s that in some ways parallel each other and in other ways diverge in theology and practice.

The historical interaction of [[Islam]] and Judaism started in the 7th century CE with the origin and spread of Islam. There are many common aspects between Islam and Judaism, and as Islam [[History of Islam|developed]], it gradually became the major religion closest to Judaism. As opposed to Christianity which originated from interaction between ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] cultures, Judaism is very similar to Islam in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi David Rosen, [http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations,%20Past%20&amp;%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc Jewish-Muslim Relations, Past and Present], November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There are many traditions within Islam originating from traditions within the [[Hebrew Bible]] or from post-biblical Jewish traditions. These practices are known collectively as the [[Isra'iliyat]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Justin Jaron Lewis, [http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html  Islam and Judaism], October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical interaction between Christianity and Islam connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in Islam. Islam and Christianity share their origins in the Abrahamic tradition, although Christianity predates Islam by centuries. Islam accepts many aspects of Christianity as part of its faith - with some differences in interpretation - and rejects other aspects. Islam believes the [[Qur'an]] is the final revelation from [[God]] and a completion of all previous revelations, including the [[Bible]].

== Indian and Indo-European religions ==
{{Main|Indian religions|Vedic Brahmanism|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Proto-Indo-European religion}}
The term &quot;Indian religions&quot; refers to a number of religions that have originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] tracing their origins through [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]] ultimately to [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]. They encompass [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].

Other largely extinct [[Indo-European religion]]s closely allied to the Indian religions, sharing a common history, include [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Celtic Polytheism|Celtic]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]], [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] and [[Norse mythology]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

{{further2|[[Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu]], [[Gautama Buddha in world religions]], and [[God in Buddhism]]}}

Buddhism and modern Hinduism are both post-Vedic religions. [[Gautama Buddha]] is mentioned as an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the [[Puranic]] texts of Hinduism. Some Hindus believe the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] accepted and incorporated many tenets of Hinduism in his doctrine, however, Buddhists disagree and state there was no such thing as Hinduism at the time of Buddha and in fact, &quot;Indeed, it absorbed so many Buddhist traits that it is virtually impossible to distinguish the latter in medieval and later Hinduism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MLA style:

Gandhi, like Hindus, did not believe Buddha established a non-Hindu tradition. He writes, &quot;I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;P. 17 ''Gandhi'' By Ronald Terchek&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taoic religions ==
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
{{further2|[[Tao]] and [[De (Chinese)|De]]}}
[[File:Dao4-revision.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Chinese character]] depicting ''[[Tao]]'', the central concept in Taoism.]]

A Taoic religion is a religion, or religious philosophy, that focuses on the [[East Asian]] concept of ''[[Tao]]'' (&quot;The Way&quot;). This forms a large group of religions including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Jeung San Do]], [[Shinto]], [[Yiguandao]], [[Chondogyo]], [[Chen Tao (&quot;True Way&quot;)|Chen Tao]] and [[Caodaism]]. In large parts of East Asia, [[Buddhism]] has taken on some taoic features.

''[[Tao]]'' can be roughly stated to be the flow of the universe, or the force behind the natural order. It is believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered and is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the ''Tao''. The flow of ''[[Ch'i]]'', as the essential energy of action and existence, is compared to the universal order of ''Tao''. Following the ''Tao'' is also associated with a &quot;proper&quot; attitude, morality and lifestyle. This is intimately tied to the complex concept of ''[[De (Chinese)|De]]'', or literally &quot;virtue&quot; or &quot;power.&quot; ''De'' is the active expression of ''Tao''.

Taoism and Ch'an Buddhism for centuries had a mutual influence on each other in China, Korea and Vietnam. These influences were inherited by [[Zen Buddhism]] when Ch'an Buddhism arrived in Japan and adapted as Zen Buddhism.
