{{Buddhism}}
In [[Buddhism]], a '''bodhisattva''' ({{lang-sa|बोधिसत्त्व}} ''bodhisattva''; {{lang-pi|बोधिसत्त}} ''bodhisatta'') is either an enlightened (''[[bodhi]]'') existence (''[[sattva]]'') or an enlightenment-being or, given the variant [[Sanskrit]] spelling ''satva'' rather than ''sattva,'' &quot;heroic-minded one (''[[satva]]'') for enlightenment (''[[bodhi]]'').&quot;  The Pali term has sometimes been translated as &quot;wisdom-being,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AC75&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink=Ananda Coomaraswamy |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books |location=Boston|page=225 |lccn=64056434 |quote=&quot;...the term Bodhisatta, or Wisdom-being, first used of [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]] between the Going-forth and the attainment of [[Nirvana|Nibbāna]], came to mean a Buddha-designate....&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in modern publications, and especially in [[Vajrayana|tantric]] works, this is more commonly reserved for the term ''[[jñānasattva]]'' (&quot;awareness-being&quot;; Tib. ཡེ་ཤེས་སེམས་དཔའ་་, Wyl. ye shes sems dpa’).  Traditionally, a bodhisattva is anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated ''[[bodhicitta]]'', which is a spontaneous wish to attain [[Buddhahood]] for the benefit of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow'': A Practical Guide to Helping Others, page 1, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) ISBN 978-0-948006-50-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodhisattva is a popular subject in [[Buddhist art]]. Usage of the term bodhisattva has evolved over time. In early Indian Buddhism, for example, the term bodhisattva was primarily used to refer specifically to the Buddha Shakyamuni in his former lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC75&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit&quot;&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70982/bodhisattva&lt;/ref&gt; The Jatakas, which are the stories of his lives, depict the various attempts of the bodhisattva to embrace qualities like self-sacrifice and morality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit&quot; /&gt;

==In Theravāda Buddhism==
The term &quot;''bodhisatta''&quot; ([[Pali|Pāli]] language) was used by [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] in the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli canon]] to refer to himself both in his previous lives and as a young man in his current life, prior to his enlightenment, in the period during which he was working towards his own [[moksha|liberation]]. When, during his discourses, he recounts his experiences as a young aspirant, he regularly uses the phrase &quot;When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta...&quot; The term therefore connotes a being who is &quot;bound for enlightenment&quot;, in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the Pāli canon, the bodhisatta is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the ''[[Jataka|Jātaka]]'' tales.

In the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli canon]], the bodhisatta Siddhartha Gotama is described thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html|title=Ariyapariyesana Sutta|accessdate=2009-03-23|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|before my Awakening, when I was an unawakened bodhisatta, being subject myself to birth, sought what was likewise subject to birth. Being subject myself to aging... illness... death... sorrow... defilement, I sought [happiness in] what was likewise subject to illness... death... sorrow... defilement.|''Ariyapariyesana Sutta''}}

While [[Maitreya]] (Pāli: Metteya) is mentioned in the Pāli canon, he is not referred to as a bodhisattva, but simply the next fully awakened Buddha to come into existence long after the current teachings of the Buddha are lost.

In later [[Theravada|Theravāda]] literature, the term &quot;bodhisatta&quot; is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to [[moksha|liberation]]. The later tradition of commentary also recognizes the existence of two additional types of bodhisattas: the ''paccekabodhisatta'' who will attain [[Pratyekabuddha|Paccekabuddhahood]], and the ''savakabodhisatta'' who will attain enlightenment as a disciple of a Buddha. According to the Theravāda teacher [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] the bodhisattva path was not taught by Buddha [http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha335.htm].

Theravadin bhikku and scholar [[Walpola Rahula]] (Sri Rahula Maha Thera) has stated that the bodhisattva ideal has traditionally been held to be higher than the state of a ''śrāvaka'' not only in Mahāyāna, but also in Theravāda Buddhism. He also quotes an inscription from the 10th Century king of Sri Lanka, [[List_of_Sri_Lankan_monarchs#House_of_Lambakanna_II_.28691.E2.80.931017.29|Mahinda IV]] (956-972 CE) who had the words inscribed &quot;none but the bodhisattvas would become kings of Sri Lanka&quot;, among other examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha126.htm|title=Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism|accessdate=2010-04-18|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is a wide-spread belief, particularly in the West, that the ideal of the Theravada, which they conveniently identify with Hinayana, is to become an Arahant while that of the Mahayana is to become a Bodhisattva and finally to attain the state of a Buddha. It must be categorically stated that this is incorrect. This idea was spread by some early Orientalists at a time when Buddhist studies were beginning in the West, and the others who followed them accepted it without taking the trouble to go into the problem by examining the texts and living traditions in Buddhist countries. But the fact is that both the Theravada and the Mahayana unanimously accept the Bodhisattva ideal as the highest.|Walpola Rahula, ''Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism''}}

Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in [[Thailand]] are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cholvijarn observes that prominent figures associated with the [[Dhammakaya Movement|Self perspective]] in Thailand have often been famous outside scholarly circles as well, among the wider populace, as Buddhist meditation masters and sources of miracles and sacred [[amulet]]s. Like perhaps some of the early Mahāyāna forest hermit monks, or the later Buddhist Tantrics, they have become people of power through their meditative achievements. They are widely revered, worshipped, and held to be [[arhat]]s or (note!) bodhisattvas.}}

==In Mahāyāna Buddhism==
===Bodhisattva ideal===
[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva. 
According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) was originally even an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', or the &quot;Bodhisattva Vehicle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174&quot;&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'' contains a simple and brief definition for the term ''bodhisattva'', which is also the earliest known Mahāyāna definition.&lt;ref&gt;Mall, Linnart. ''Studies in the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita and Other Essays.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2005. pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. ''A history of Indian Buddhism: from Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2007. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is given as the following.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines and its Verse Summary.'' Grey Fox Press. 2001. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;Because he has enlightenment as his aim, a bodhisattva-[[mahāsattva]] is so called.&quot;}}

Mahāyāna Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] by practicing the six perfections.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pages 4-12, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) ISBN 978-0-948006-50-0&lt;/ref&gt; Indelibly entwined with the bodhisattva vow is [[parinamana|merit transference]] (''pariṇāmanā'').

In Mahāyāna Buddhism life in this world is compared to people living in a house that is on fire. People take this world as reality pursuing worldly projects and pleasures without realizing that the house is on fire and will soon burn down (due to the inevitability of death). A bodhisattva is one who has a determination to free sentient beings from [[samsara]] and its cycle of death, rebirth and suffering. This type of mind is known as the [[bodhicitta|mind of awakening]] (''bodhicitta''). Bodhisattvas take [[bodhisattva vows]] in order to progress on the spiritual path towards [[buddhahood]].

There are a variety of different conceptions of the nature of a bodhisattva in Mahāyāna. According to some Mahāyāna sources a bodhisattva is someone on the path to full Buddhahood. Others speak of bodhisattvas renouncing Buddhahood. According to the ''Kun-bzang bla-ma'i zhal-lung'', a bodhisattva  can choose any of three paths to help sentient beings in the process of achieving buddhahood. They are: 
# king-like bodhisattva - one who aspires to become buddha as soon as possible and then help sentient beings in full fledge;
# boatman-like bodhisattva - one who aspires to achieve buddhahood along with other sentient beings and
# shepherd-like bodhisattva - one who aspires to delay buddhahood until all other sentient beings achieve buddhahood. Bodhisattvas like [[Avalokiteshvara|Avalokiteśvara]] and [[Shantideva|Śāntideva]] are believed to fall in this category.

According to the doctrine of some Tibetan schools (like Theravāda but for different reasons), only the first of these is recognized.  It is held that Buddhas remain in the world, able to help others, so there is no point in delay. [[Kelsang Gyatso|Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]] notes:&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune: the Complete Buddhist Path to Enlightenment,'' p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In reality, the second two types of bodhicitta are wishes that are impossible to fulfill because it is only possible to lead others to enlightenment once we have attained enlightenment ourself. Therefore, only king-like bodhicitta is actual bodhicitta. Je Tsongkhapa says that although the other Bodhisattvas wish for that which is impossible, their attitude is sublime and unmistaken.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Nyingma]] school, however, holds that the lowest level is the way of the king, who primarily seeks his own benefit but who recognizes that his benefit depends crucially on that of his kingdom and his subjects. The middle level is the path of the boatman, who ferries his passengers across the river and simultaneously, of course, ferries himself as well. The highest level is that of the shepherd, who makes sure that all his sheep arrive safely ahead of him and places their welfare above his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrul Rinpoche]],  ''Words of My Perfect Teacher,&quot; page 218, &quot;The king's way, called 'arousing bodhicitta with the great wish,' is the least courageous of the three. The boatman's way, called 'arousing bodhicitta with sacred wisdom,' is more courageous. It is said that Lord Maitreya aroused bodhicitta in this way. The shepherd's way, called 'the arousing of bodhicitta beyond compare,' is the most courageous of all. It is said to be the way Lord Mañjuśrĩ aroused bodhicitta.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten grounds===

According to many traditions within Mahāyāna Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bhūmis]].'' Below is the list of the ten ''bhūmis'' and their descriptions according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' and ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation,'' a treatise by [[Gampopa]], an influential teacher of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[Kagyu]] school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)

Before a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of the five paths: 
#the path of accumulation
#the path of preparation

The ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths
#''bhūmi'' 1 the path of insight
#''bhūmis'' 2-7 the path of meditation
#''bhūmis'' 8-10 the path of no more learning

The chapter of ten grounds in the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:

#'''Great Joy:''' It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this ''bhūmi'' the bodhisattvas practice all [[paramita|perfections]] (''pāramitās''), but especially emphasizing [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]] (''dāna'').
#'''Stainless:''' In accomplishing the second ''bhūmi'', the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this ''bhūmi'' is named &quot;stainless&quot;. The emphasized perfection is [[śila|moral discipline]] (''śīla'').
#'''Luminous:''' The third ''bhūmi'' is named &quot;luminous&quot;, because, for a bodhisattva who accomplishes this ''bhūmi'', the light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva. The emphasized perfection is [[kṣanti|patience]] (''{{IAST|kṣānti}}'').
#'''Radiant:''' This ''bhūmi'' is called &quot;radiant&quot;, because it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is [[vīrya|vigor]] (''vīrya'').
#'''Very difficult to train:''' Bodhisattvas who attain this ''bhūmi'' strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditative concentration]] (''dhyāna'').
#'''Obviously Transcendent:''' By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either ''[[saṃsāra|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]]'' or ''[[nirvāṇa|{{IAST|nirvāṇa}}]]'', so this state is &quot;obviously transcendent&quot;.  The emphasized perfection is [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''prajñā'').
#'''Gone afar:''' Particular emphasis is on the perfection of [[upaya|skillful means]] (''upāya''), to help others.
#'''Immovable:''' The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This, the &quot;immovable&quot; ''bhūmi'', is the ''bhūmi'' at which one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.
#'''Good Discriminating Wisdom:''' The emphasized virtue is power.
#'''Cloud of Dharma:''' The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom.

After the ten ''bhūmis'', according to Mahāyāna Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.

With the 52 stages, the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'' recognizes 57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools recognize 3–10 additional grounds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jingangsi.com/wencui/yizuo8.htm 大圆满隆钦宁提派前行念诵文编一遍智妙道]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandao.com/zangchuanfojiao/35/43381.htm 大圆满心性休息颂]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://akanistha.blogspot.com/2009/08/blog-post_4818.html 吉祥鄔金密嚴寺: 八地在般若乘和金剛乘的分別]&lt;/ref&gt;

A bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a ''[[mahāsattva]]''. Some bodhisattvas such as [[Samantabhadra]] are also said to have already attained buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisdom.buddhistdoor.com/alankwan/2009/09/13/459-因地菩薩和果地菩薩/ 459 因地菩薩和果地菩薩]&lt;/ref&gt;

===School doctrines===

Some sutras said a beginner would take 3–22 countless eons (''[[asaṃkhyeya|mahāsaṃkhyeya]] [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]'') to become a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinawts.com/list/budedu1/082718255.htm 三大阿僧祇劫]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaa.org.tw/Chen_voice/a_2008_11_25.pdf 成佛的目的是到每一個世界去度眾生.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwayue.org.tw/lama/question4_08.htm 即身成就與三大阿僧祇劫之修行]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pure Land Buddhism]] suggests buddhists go to the [[pure land]]s to practice. [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Zen]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools say they teach ways to attain buddhahood within one karmic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bukon.idv.tw/mantra/b11.htm 顯教與密教]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yinshun.org/Enlightenment/1997/1997oct/1999oct1.htm 「無諍之辯」導讀]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various traditions within Buddhism believe in specific bodhisattvas. Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] believe in various forms of [[Chenrezig]], who is [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]] in Sanskrit, [[Guanyin]] (Kwan-yin or Kuan-yin) in China and Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and [[Kannon]] (formerly spelled and pronounced: Kwannon) in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the [[Dalai Lama]]s and the [[Karmapa]]s to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.
 
[[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]] is another popular bodhisattva in Japan and China. He is known for aiding those who are lost. His greatest compassionate vow is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who else will go? ... if the hells are not empty I will not become a Buddha. Only when all living beings have been saved, will I attain Bodhi.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or the acts of [[dharma]], is known as a ''[[bodhimanda]]'', and may be a site of [[pilgrimage]]. Many temples and monasteries are famous as ''bodhimandas''; for instance, the island of [[Putuoshan]], located off the coast of [[Ningbo]], is venerated by Chinese Buddhists as the ''bodhimanda'' of [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]]. Perhaps the most famous ''bodhimanda'' of all is the [[bodhi tree]] under which [[Shakyamuni|Śākyamuṇi]] achieved buddhahood.
