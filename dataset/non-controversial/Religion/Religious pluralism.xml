'''Religious pluralism''' is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of religious belief systems co-existing in society. It can indicate one or more of the following:

* As the name of the worldview according to which one's religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus the acknowledgement that at least some truths and true values exist in other religions.
* As acceptance of the concept that two or more religions with mutually exclusive truth claims are equally valid. This may be considered a form of either [[toleration]] (a concept that arose as a result of the [[European wars of religion]]) or [[moral relativism]].
* The understanding that the exclusive claims of different religions turn out, upon closer examination, to be variations of universal truths that have been taught since time immemorial. This is called ''Perennialism'' (based on the concept of ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perrenis]]'') or [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]].
* Sometimes as a synonym for [[ecumenism]], i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s within a single religion.
* As term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different [[religion]]s or [[religious denomination]]s.
*As a social norm and not merely a synonym for religious diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silk 64–81&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Silk | first = Mark| title = Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis | volume = 612 | pages = 64–81

==Definition and scope==
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
[[File:Kazan church.jpg|thumb|right|[[Temple of All Religions]] in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]] ]]
[[Image:1893parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|ight|Congress of [[Parliament of the World's Religions]], [[Chicago]], 1893]]
Religious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in ''Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism'', explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century [[United States]]. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called [[religious tolerance|religious toleration]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Beneke06-6&quot;&gt;Beneke 2006: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beneke06-6&quot;/&gt; In short, religious toleration is only the absence of [[religious persecution]], and does not necessarily preclude [[religious discrimination]]. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], at least if one views the events from &quot;a late eighteenth-century perspective.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beneke06-5&quot;&gt;Beneke 2006: 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with &quot;something that is usually called [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beneke06-6&quot;/&gt; Mark Silka, in &quot;Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis&quot;, states that Religious pluralism &quot;enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a cultural construct that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Silk 64–81&quot;/&gt;

Religious pluralism can be defined as &quot;respecting the otherness of others&quot; and accepting the given uniqueness endowed to each one of us.

===Interfaith dialogue===
{{Main|Interfaith}}
Religious pluralism is sometimes used as a synonym for [[interfaith]] dialogue. Interfaith dialogue refers to dialogue between members of different religions for the goal of reducing conflicts between their [[religion]]s and to achieve agreed upon mutually desirable goals. Inter-religious dialogue is difficult if the partners adopt a position of particularism, i.e. if they only care about the concerns of their own group, but is favored by the opposite attitude of [[universalism]], where care is taken for the concerns of others. Interfaith dialogue is easier if a religion's adherents have some form of [[inclusivism]], the belief that people in other religions may also have a way to [[salvation]], even though the fullness of salvation can be achieved only in one’s own religion. Conversely, believers with an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] mindset will rather tend to [[proselytism|proselytize]] followers of other religions, than seek an open-ended dialogue with them.

===Conditions for the existence of religious pluralism===
{{Main|Religious tolerance}}
Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region, whether or not an individual religion accepts that other religions are legitimate or that freedom of religious choice and religious plurality in general are good things. [[Exclusivist]] religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s argue fiercely against [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of [[paganism]] and [[witchcraft]] are pernicious.  This was a common historical attitude prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like [[Afghanistan|Afghanistan's]] [[Taliban]] regime, which destroyed the ancient [[Buddhas of Bamyan]].

Many religious believers believe that religious pluralism should entail not competition but cooperation, and argue that societal and theological change is necessary to overcome religious differences between different [[religion]]s, and denominational conflicts within the same religion. For most religious traditions, this attitude is essentially based on a non-literal view of one's religious traditions, hence allowing for respect to be engendered between different traditions on fundamental principles rather than more marginal issues. It is perhaps summarized as an attitude which rejects focus on immaterial differences, and instead gives respect to those beliefs held in common.

Giving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation obtains in certain European countries, where [[Roman Catholicism]] or regional forms of [[Protestantism]] have special status. For example see the entries on the [[Lateran Treaty]] and [[Church of England]]

[[Relativism]], the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions gives access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of [[inclusivism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Likewise, [[syncretism]], the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. [[Syncretism]] must not be confused with [[ecumenism]], the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a [[Schism (religion)|schism]].

Religious freedom did not exist at all in many [[Communist]] countries such as [[Albania]] and the Stalinist [[Soviet Union]], where the state prevented the public expression of religious belief and even persecuted some or all religions. This situation persists still today in [[North Korea]], and to some extent in [[China]] and [[Vietnam]].

==History of religious pluralism==
{{Main|History of religious pluralism}}
[[Cultural pluralism|Cultural]] and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[post-modernity]].

==Inter-religious pluralism==
For purposes of exposition, views about religious pluralism may be loosely classified into views about 1) ''inter''-religious pluralism and 2) ''intra''-religious pluralism. By inter-religious pluralism, we mean the views held within one major faith tradition (e.g., Christianity) about the validity or truth of other major faith traditions (e.g., Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, etc.). In contrast, intra-religious pluralism refers to views held by specific schools or denominations ''within'' a major faith tradition (e.g., by Eastern Orthodox Christians) about the validity or truth of other schools or denominations within the same major faith tradition (e.g., about Protestant Christianity or Roman Catholic Christianity).

The following subsections examine inter-religious pluralism within several major faith traditions.

===Bahá'í views===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of [[Bahá'í Faith]], urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and has manifested himself to humanity through several historic messengers. Bahá'u'lláh taught that Bahá'ís must associate with peoples of all religions, showing the love of God in relations with them, whether this is reciprocated or not.

Bahá'í's refer to the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]], which means that God's will is revealed to mankind progressively as mankind matures and is better able to comprehend the purpose of God in creating humanity. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: [[Abraham]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Mohammed]], and Bahá'u'lláh (the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]) among them. In the ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]'' (''Book of Certitude''), Bahá'u'lláh explains that messengers of God have a twofold station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bahá'í writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.

===Buddhist views===
In the ''[[Brahmajala Sutta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://tipitaka.wikia.com/wiki/Brahmajala_Sutta ''Brahmajala Sutta''], retrieved 2009-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha is recorded as stating that the teachings of other sects of his day were based on one or more of 62 erroneous theories, and that falling into those errors would prevent attaining permanent [[Nirvana|liberation]] from suffering:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Bhikku]]s, there are countless philosophies, doctrines, and theories in this world. People criticize each other and argue endlessly over their theories. According to my investigation, there are sixty-two main theories which underlie the thousands of philosophies and religions current in our world. Looked at from the Way of Enlightenment and Emancipation, all sixty-two of these theories contain errors and create obstacles… A good fisherman places his net in the water and catches all the shrimp and fish he can. As he watches the creatures try to leap out of the net, he tells them, ‘No matter how high you jump, you will only land in the net again.’ He is correct. The thousands of beliefs flourishing at present can all be found in the net of these sixty-two theories. Bhikkus, don’t fall into that bewitching net. You will only waste time and lose your chance to practice the Way of Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Brahmajala Sutta, translated by Thich Nhat Hanh (1991), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=sp4uExyk8PEC&amp;dq=old+path+white+clouds&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oxx6D5-v9G&amp;sig=BGPkamoP6SC0phnQRBiLEhZIK3o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AOceS6PID5L4sgOBpdiBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=countless%20philosophies%2C%20doctrines&amp;f=false Old Path, White Clouds]'', Parralax Press. ISBN 978-0-938077-26-8 (pp. 399-400)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Emperor Ashoka]]:

:&quot;All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart.&quot; Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)

:&quot;Contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions.&quot; Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)

When asked, “Don’t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?” the Dalai Lama said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-8376?l=english ''Dalai Lama Asks West Not to Turn Buddhism Into a &quot;Fashion&quot;''], Zenit, 2003-10-08, retrieved 2009-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
People from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don’t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.

In the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something… That is not healthy.

For individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.

I am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible, useless.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Classical Greek and Roman pagan views===
The ancient Greeks were polytheists; pluralism in that historical era meant accepting the existence of and validity of other peoples religions. Ancient Greeks employed [[Interpretatio Graeca]] whereby the gods of other religions were equated with those of their own pantheon. The Romans easily accomplished this task by subsuming the entire set of gods from other faiths into their own religion; this was done on rare occasion by adding a new god to their own pantheon; on most occasions they identified another religion's gods with their own, see [[syncretism]] which can be a form of [[Inclusivism]].

However, because divinity was the basis for the mandate of the state, atheism was considered a capital crime in both ancient Greece and Rome. This was further solidified as the status quo following the installation of the Roman [[imperial cult]] of deification of sitting emperors, and Roman pluralism was not officially extended to Abrahamic monotheistic religions until Christianity (which had been previously branded an atheistic religion by the state) became the de facto official religion of the empire.

===Christian views===
{{Main|Christianity and other religions}}

Some Christians have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some Christians hold this idea to be [[logic]]ally impossible from the [[Principle of contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html Defending Salvation Through Christ Alone] By Jason Carlson, Christian Ministries International&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christians have held that there can be truth value and salvific value in other faith traditions. [[John Macquarrie]], described in the ''Handbook of Anglican Theologians'' (1998) as &quot;unquestionably [[Anglicanism]]'s most distinguished systematic theologian in the second half of the twentieth century,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;p. 168, Timothy Bradshaw (1998), &quot;John Macquarrie,&quot; in: Alister E. McGrath (ed). ''[http://books.google.com/books?client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1&amp;id=ZHzZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=9780281051458&amp;q=macquarrie#search_anchor The SPCK Handbook of Anglican Theologians]'' (pp. 167-168). London: [[SPCK]]. ISBN 978-0-281-05145-8&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that &quot;there should be an end to proselytizing but that equally there should be no syncretism of the kind typified by the [[Baha'i]] movement&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;ref name=macmediate&gt;John Macquarrie (1996). ''Mediators between human and divine: From Moses to Muhammad''. New York: Continuum. ISBN 0-8264-1170-3&lt;/ref&gt;). In discussing 9 founders of major faith traditions (Moses, Zoroaster, Lao-zu, Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad), which he called &quot;mediators between the human and the divine,&quot; Macquarrie wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not deny for a moment that the truth of God has reached others through other channels - indeed, I hope and pray that it has. So while I have a special attachment to one mediator, I have respect for them all. (p. 12&lt;ref name=macmediate/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also teaches a form of religious pluralism, that there is at least some truth in almost all religions and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1977/10/respect-for-other-peoples-beliefs?lang=eng |title=Respect for Other People’s Beliefs |author=Gerald E. Jones |publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |work=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' |date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu views===
The [[Hinduism|Hindu religion]] is naturally pluralistic. A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says that &quot;Truth is One, though the sages know it variously.&quot; (''Ékam sat vipra bahudā vadanti'').&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.164.46&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states that &quot;As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me&quot; (''ye yathā māṃ prapadyante tāṃs tathāiva bhajāmyaham mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=56UM3BIvbHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+1586380273&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20people%20approach%20me&amp;f=false Page 194] in [[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008). ''[[God Makes the Rivers to Flow|Timeless wisdom: Passages for meditation from the world's saints &amp; sages]]'' (see [[God Makes the Rivers to Flow|article]]). Tomales, CA: Nilgiri Press. ISBN 1-58638-027-3. Similar to [[Eknath Easwaran]] (2007). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=a-Oh_-rK5SQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+1586380192&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=approach%20me&amp;f=false The Bhagavad Gita]'', 2nd ed. Tomales, CA: Nilgiri Press, p. 117. ISBN
1586380192 (which substitutes &quot;they&quot; for &quot;people&quot;). Transliteration from Winthrop Sargeant (1984). ''The Bhagavad Gita''. Albany: State University of New York Press, p. 211. ISBN 0-87395-831-4, which translates the same passage as &quot;They who, in whatever way, take refuge in Me, them I reward.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. [[Hinduism]] emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 2002) ISBN 1-884852-04-1&lt;/ref&gt; Just as Hindus worshiping [[Ganesh]] is seen as valid by those worshiping [[Vishnu]], so someone worshiping Jesus or Allah is accepted. Many ''foreign'' deities become assimilated into Hinduism, and some Hindus may sometimes offer prayers to Jesus along with their traditional forms of [[God in Hinduism|God]].

===Islamic views===
{{Main|Islam and other religions}}

Reference to Islamic views on religious pluralism is found in the [[Quran]]. The following verses are generally interpreted as an evidence of religious pluralism:

[[Sura]]h Al-Ma'idah verse 48 states:
{{quote
|If Allah so willed, he would have made you a single People, but his plan is to test each of you separately, in what He has given to each of you: so strive in all virtues as in you are in a race. The goal of all of you is to Allah. It is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute. ({{cite quran|5|48|style=nosup}}) }}

[[Sura]]h Al-Ankabut verse 46 states:
{{quote
|And dispute not with the [[People of the Book]], except with means better than mere disputation, unless I be with those of them who inflict wrong and injury, but say to them: &quot;We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our God and your God is one; and it is to Him that we bow.&quot;  ({{cite quran|29|46|style=nosup}}) }}

&quot;Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands outs clear from Error&quot; . Verse 2:256 of Surat Al-Baqarah

&quot;If they charge you with falsehood, say: 'For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds! You are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what you do' &quot; . Verse 10:41 of Surat Yunus

&quot;Say, 'The Truth is from your Lord' Let him who will, believe, and let him who will, reject (it)' &quot; Verse 18:29 of Surat Al-Kahf

&quot;To you (non-believers) be your Way (Religion), and to me mine&quot; . Verse 109:6 of Surat Al-Kafirun

The Quran criticizes Christians and Jews who believed that their own religions the only source of Truth.

{{quote
|They say, if you want to be guided to salvation, you should either become a Jew or Christian. Say: What about the religion of Abraham, he also worshiped no one but Allah.  We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, to Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes of Israel, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to all prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah.  So, if they believe, they are indeed on the right path, but if they turn back, Allah will suffice them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.  This is the Baptism of Allah.  And who can baptize better than Allah.  And it is He Whom we worship. Say: Will you dispute with us about Allah, He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and you for yours; and that We are sincere in Him? Or do ye say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than Allah? Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from Allah.  But Allah is not unmindful of what ye do! That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case.(  ({{cite quran|2|135-141|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-Baqara verse 113 states:
{{quote
|The Jews say: &quot;The Christians have nothing to stand upon&quot;; and the Christians say: &quot;The Jews have nothing to stand upon.&quot; Yet they both have something to stand upon, they both recite the Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but Allah will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment. ({{cite quran|2|113|style=nosup}}) }}

Many Muslims agree that cooperation with the Christian and Jewish community is important but some Muslims believe that theological debate is often unnecessary:
{{quote
|Say: “O People of the Book! Come to what is common between us and you: That we worship none but God, that we associate no partners with Him, that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords other than Allah. If then they turn back, say: 'Bear witness that we are bowing to Allah’s will.'&quot;  ({{cite quran|3|64|style=nosup}}) }}

Islam's fundamental theological concept is belief in one God. Muslims are not expected to visualize God but to worship and adore him as a protector. Any kind of idolatry is condemned in Islam.({{cite quran|112|2|style=nosup}}) As a result, Muslims hold that for someone to worship any other gods or deities other than Allah (''[[Shirk (polytheism)|Shirk]]'' ([[polytheism]])) is a sin that will lead to separation from [[Allah]]. 

[[Muslims]] believe that [[Allah]] sent the [[Qur'an]] to bring peace and harmony to humanity through [[Islam]] (submission to Allah).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicbookseller.com/product_info.php/6_Modern_Issues/Islam_and_Universal_Peace/ Islam and Universal Peace]
[[Sayyid Qutb]]1977 ISBN B0006CU4HG&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad]]'s worldwide mission was to establish universal peace under the ''[[Khilafat]]''. 

The ''Khilafat'' ensured security of the lives and property of non-Muslims under the ''[[dhimmi]]'' system.

This status was originally only made available to non-Muslims who were &quot;[[People of the Book]]&quot; (Christians, Jews, and Sabians), but was later extended to include Zoroastrians, Sikhs,Hindus, Mandeans(Sabians), and Buddhists.

''Dhimmi'' had more rights than other non-Muslim religious subjects, but often fewer legal and social rights than Muslims. Some Muslims, however, disagree, and hold that adherents of these faiths cannot be ''dhimmi''.  

Dhimmi enjoyed some freedoms under the state founded by [[Muhammad]] and could practice their religious rituals according to their faith and beliefs. 

It should be noted that non-Muslims who were not classified as &quot;people of the book&quot;, for example practitioners of the pre-Muslim indigenous Arabian religions, had few or no rights in Muslim society.
 
[[Muslim rule]] spread through conquest and this indirectly coerced many to convert to [[Islam]]. In other words, war was waged to put lands under Muslim rule, but the subjects were theoretically free to continue practice whatever religion they chose. However, the [[non-Muslim]] dhimmis were subject to taxation [[jizyah]] at a different rate of the [[Muslim]] [[zakat]]. [[Dhimmi]]s also faced economic impediments, restrictions on political participation and/or social advancement based on their non-Muslim status.

[[Religious persecution]] is also prohibited,{{cite quran|10|99 | end=100 | translator=y}} although religious persecution in Muslim majority states have occurred, especially during periods of cruel rulers and general economic hardships. Pre-Islamic religious minorities continue to exist in some of their native countries, although only as marginal percentages of the overall population.

The [[Sufi]]s were practitioners of the esoteric mystic traditions within an Islam at certain point sufism defined by the sufi master or [[Pir (Sufism)]] or [[fakeer]] or [[Wali]] in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together. E.g. Christiainity, Judaism, paganism, platonism, Zorostrainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time. The most famous of the sufis is [[Rumi]]. Other famous sufi masters are [[Sheikh Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Waris Shah]], [[Ghazali]], [[Mian Mir]], [[Attar of Nishapur]], [[Amir Khusrow]], [[Salim Chishti]]. see many more famous sufis here [[List of Sufis]]. The sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluarism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern day academia as well as philosophers of other religions.  See also [[Blind men and an elephant]].

Persian poet Rumi says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &quot;I looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was.&quot; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi also says

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &quot;How many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth&quot;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi also says:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;A true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,
be sure of that.
Since in the religion of Love,
there is no irreverence or faith.
When in Love,
body, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.
Become this,
fall in Love,
and you will not be separated again.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The sufi platform was considered by exoteric dogmatic Muslims as a trojan horse ideology executing doctrine of deception (see [[Taqiyya]]) to convert others while others considered it outright heresy, blasphemy, innovation(biddah), kuffar, apostasy, haram and as such many sufis have gone under persuctions and executions for apostasy and trison charges at which point many tend to have supernatural events take place alike to Jesus crucification. Many sufis throughout their life display religious healing, miracles and supernatural events which seems like God has connected with the sufi alike to vedic and buddhist enlightenment. For more see [[Fana (Sufism)]], [[Baqaa]], [[Yaqeen]], [[Kashf]], [[Manzil]], [[Haqiqa]], [[Sufi metaphysics]], [[Sufi philosophy]].

====Ahmadiyya views====
{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
Ahmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the [[Quran]], every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: ''And there is a guide for every people''. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]] states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], founders of [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]] to be divinely appointed individuals.

The Second [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Khalifatul Maish]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] writes:
“According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Holy Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America - all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Holy Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.” &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;“Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur’an” by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad. Part 2, Argument 4 Section labeled “A Grand Conception”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; 

[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] wrote in his book ''[[A Message of Peace]]'':
“Our God has never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Mirza Ghulam Ahmad pg. 6&quot;&gt;“A Message of Peace” by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, pg. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jain views===
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
''Anekāntavāda'', the principle of relative pluralism, is one of the basic principles of [[Jainism]]. In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas (2002) p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp.400-7&lt;/ref&gt; Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the [[Kevala Jnana|Kevalins]] - the omniscient beings - can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with  '' andhgajnyaya '' or the &quot;[[Blind men and an elephant|maxim of the blind men and elephant]]&quot;, wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective.&lt;ref name = hughes&gt;Hughes, Marilynn (2005) p.590-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish views===
{{Main|Jewish views of religious pluralism}}

===Sikh views===
The [[Sikh Gurus]] (religious leaders) have propagated the message of &quot;many paths&quot; leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who treading on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths can, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]] can certainly achieve salvation. Students of the Sikh faith are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and  practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions and of influences on and from [[Sufism]] as well as [[Hinduism]] see [[Islam and Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism and Sikhism]].

'''The holy book of the [[Sikh]]s (the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]) says, '''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Do not say that the Vedas and the Koran (semetic books i.e. Bible, torah and quran) are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.&quot; Guru Granth Sahib page 1350.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1350&amp;english=t&amp;id=57718 Sriganth.org Guru Granth Sahib page 1350]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As well as; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some call the Lord 'Ram, Ram', and some 'Khuda'. Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allah'.  He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer.  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white.  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven.  Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master.&quot;
(Sri Guru Granth Sahib Page:885) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?ction=Page&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;Param=885|work=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;One who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth.&quot; (SGGS Ang 142)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pluarism in sggs|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&amp;Param=142|work=pluarism in sggs|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator.&quot; Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Guru Granth Sahib also says that [[Bhagat Namdev]] and [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]], who were both believed to be [[Hindu]]s, both attained salvation though they were born before [[Sikhism]] took root and were clearly not Sikhs.This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that &quot;peoples of other faiths&quot; can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation. 

Additionally the Guru Granth Sahib says;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1|| 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=aval allah|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1349&amp;english=t&amp;id=57707#l57707|work=aval allah}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, the Guru Granth Sahib provides this verse: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;[[Bhagat Namdev|Naam Dayv]] the printer, and [[Kabir|Kabeer]] the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His [[Shabda|Shabad]] (&quot;word&quot;) lose their ego and class consciousness.&quot; [[Guru Granth Sahib]] page  67 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=67&amp;english=t&amp;id=2722 Srigranth.org Guru Granth Sahib page  67]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the 15 [[Sikh Bhagats]] who are mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region.

The pluaristic dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming enlightened saying the words &quot;Na koi hindu na koi musalman&quot; - There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim. He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.

Sikhs have always being eager exponents of [[interfaith dialogue]] and will not only accept the right of other to practise their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others. See the '''sacrifice of the ninth Sikh Guru, [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar|Guru Tegh Bahadar]]''' who on the final desperate and heart-rending pleas of the Kashmiri Pandit, agreed to put up a fight for their right to practise their religion in which he was executed so another religion besides his own could have the freedom to practice their religion against the tyrant moghul empire who were forcing people to accept Islam.

==Intra-religious pluralism==
As noted earlier, intra-religious pluralism refers to views held by specific schools or denominations ''within'' a major faith tradition (e.g., by Eastern Orthodox Christians) about the validity or truth of other schools or denominations within the same major faith tradition (e.g., about Protestant Christianity or Roman Catholic Christianity). The following subsections describe views about intra-religious pluralism by various denominations and religious thinkers within several major faith traditions.

===Christian views===
====Classical Christian views====
Before the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], mainstream Christianity confessed &quot;one holy catholic and apostolic church&quot;, in the words of the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox Christians, [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief.

Church unity was something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of &quot;validity&quot; when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the ''form'' of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, if still devoid of actual spiritual content. Both generally regard each other as &quot;heterodox&quot; and &quot;schismatic&quot;, while continuing to recognize each other as Christian.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Attitudes of both towards different Protestant groups vary, primarily based upon how strongly Trinitarian the Protestant group in question might be.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Many Christians hold that the Christian church is not just an institution, which can be broken into many denominations. They hold that each instituted church is able to worship [[God]] in a way that conforms to [[Scripture]], which allows for many different styles and customs. They hold that all true Christians are united in belief in Jesus Christ, which can be judged against such documents as the [[Apostles' Creed]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Modern Christian views====
Many Protestant Christian groups hold that only believers which believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation.  They continue to believe in &quot;one&quot; church, believing in fundamental issues there is unity and non-fundamental issues there is liberty. Some [[evangelical]]s are doubtful if the Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy are still valid manifestations of the Church and usually reject religious (typically [[restorationist]]) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as Mormonism; also [[Christian Science]], or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as not distinctly Christian.

Modern Christian ideas on intra-religious pluralism (between different denominations of Christianity) are discussed in the article on [[Ecumenism]].

===Jewish views===
{{Main|Jewish views of religious pluralism}}

==Religious pluralism and human service professions==
The concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions.&lt;ref name=p97/&gt;&lt;ref name=zp&gt;Brian J. Zinnbauer &amp; Kenneth I. Pargament (2000). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=2995869&amp;site=ehost-live Working with the sacred: Four approaches to religious and spiritual issues in counseling]. ''Journal of Counseling &amp; Development'', v78 n2, pp162-171. ISSN 0748-9633&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nf/&gt; For example, [[psychologist]] [[Kenneth Pargament]]&lt;ref name=p97&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament (1997). ''[http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=Vn5XObcpnd4C&amp;dq=pargament+pluralistic&amp;q=pluralism#v=snippet&amp;q=pluralism&amp;f=false The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice]''. New York: Guilford. ISBN 978-1-57230-664-6&lt;/ref&gt; has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''pluralist''. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path &quot;up the mountain of God,&quot; the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality....&quot; (p. 167&lt;ref name=zp/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Importantly, &quot;the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;168).&lt;ref name=zp/&gt; The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as &quot;should religious issues be discussed in counseling?&quot;, have also been presented in tabular form (p.&amp;nbsp;362, Table 12.1).&lt;ref name=p97/&gt;

The profession of [[chaplain]]cy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues that &quot;With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;182).&lt;ref name=nf&gt;Nils Friberg (2001). [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=X4i3jK2cf1YC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=religious+pluralism+nursing&amp;ots=mYnobeA3i2&amp;sig=Ck7lUSMJzHUrlj8oRpDPBTXhp8o#v=onepage&amp;q=pluralism%20&amp;f=false The role of the chaplain in spiritual care]. In [[David O. Moberg]], ''Aging and spirituality: spiritual dimensions of aging theory, research'' (p. 177-190). Routledge.
