&quot;'''Mass'''&quot; is one of the names by which the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]] is called in the [[Roman Catholic]] Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=II.

The Evangelical Princes, in their protest at the Diet of Spires, April 19th, 1529, say, &quot;''Our preachers and teachers have attacked and utterly confuted the popish Mass'', with holy, invincivle, sure Scripture, ''and in its place raised up again the precious, priceless'' SUPPER OF OUR DEAR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, ''which is called'' THE EVANGELICAL MASS''. This is the only Mass founded in the Scriptures of God, in accordance with the plain and incontestable institution of the Saviour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from &quot;Eucharist&quot; others are the &quot;Lord's Supper&quot;, the &quot;Breaking of Bread&quot;, the &quot;Eucharistic assembly (synaxis)&quot;, the &quot;memorial of the Lord's Passion and Resurrection&quot;, the &quot;Holy Sacrifice&quot;, the &quot;Holy and Divine Liturgy&quot; and &quot;Holy Communion&quot;. In these denominations, the term ''Mass'' often colloquially refers to the entire [[church service]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholicism Answer Book|author=John Trigilio, Kenneth Brighenti|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|date=2 March 2007|quote=The term “Mass,” used for the weekly Sunday service in Catholic churches as well as services on Holy Days of Obligation, derives its meaning from the Latin term Missa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{discuss}} In general, Protestants avoid the term &quot;Mass&quot; and use such terms as ''[[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]'' or ''[[service of worship]]'', for doctrinal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring Ecclesiology|quote=Luther also challenged the teaching that Christ is sacrificed at the celebration of the mass. It is important to pause and note that contrary to popular Protestant opinion, official Roman Catholic teaching denies that Christ is, in the mass, sacrificed time and time again. According to the ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church'', &quot;The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it ''re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of the cross, because it is its ''memorial'' and because it ''applies'' its fruit.&quot;|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vw7MqyQYtLkC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Luther+also+challenged+the+teaching+that+Christ+is+sacrificed+at+the+celebration+of+the+mass.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FkjdT-jsOpGq8ASPu6jmCg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Luther%20also%20challenged%20the%20teaching%20that%20Christ%20is%20sacrificed%20at%20the%20celebration%20of%20the%20mass.&amp;f=false|author=Brad Harper, Paul Louis Metzger|publisher=[[Brazos Press]]|date=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the celebration of the Eucharist in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]], including [[Eastern Catholic Churches|those]] in [[Full communion|full]] [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Holy See]], other terms such as the ''[[Divine Liturgy]]'', the ''[[Holy Qurbana]]'' and the ''[[Divine Liturgy|Badarak]]'' are normal.&lt;br /&gt;

The term &quot;Mass&quot; is derived from the [[Late Latin]] word ''missa'' (dismissal), a word used in the concluding formula of Mass in Latin: ''&quot;[[Ite, missa est]]&quot;'' (&quot;Go; it is the dismissal&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''Missa'' here is a [[Late Latin]] substantive corresponding to the word ''missio'' in classical Latin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Liturgy of the Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In antiquity, ''missa'' simply meant 'dismissal'. In Christian usage, however, it gradually took on a deeper meaning. The word 'dismissal' has come to imply a 'mission'. These few words succinctly express the missionary nature of the Church&quot;. ([http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20070222_sacramentum-caritatis_en.html Pope Benedict XVI, ''Sacramentum caritatis'', 51])&lt;br /&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between the Mass in its understanding and what some Anglicans and Lutherans call the Mass, since it considers that they lack the sacrament of orders and therefore &quot;have not preserved the genuine and total reality of the Eucharistic mystery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Unitatis Redintegratio'', sect. 22&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, historically, the Lutheran Church has stated that the Lutheran Mass is &quot;the only Mass founded in the Scriptures of God, in accordance with the plain and incontestable institution of the Saviour.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lutheran/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=581|title=Denominational Differences –Other Denominations|publisher=[[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]|quote=Differences remain about both the number and the nature of the sacraments. Roman Catholics speak of seven sacraments, while Lutherans tend to speak of only two (or three). More important than number is how the sacraments are understood. To take a single example, Lutherans believe that in the Sacrament of the Altar (Communion) Christ’s body and blood are truly present in the bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper, but they do not accept the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which teaches that the elements are permanently changed from the substances of bread and wine to the substances of body and blood. Transubstantiation is rejected for several reasons: It is a philosophical explanation for a work of Christ’s almighty Word which we can only believe, not explain. In seeking to explain a mystery it changes the plain and simple meanings of God’s Word (Scripture refers to the elements as both bread and wine and body and blood, 1 Cor 11:26-27).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
==Mass in the Catholic Church==
{{Main|Mass (Catholic Church)}}
{{See also|Eucharist (Roman Catholic Church)}}
{{Roman Rite of Mass}}
The [[Catholic Church]] sees the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] or [[Eucharist]] as &quot;the source and summit of the Christian life&quot;, to which the other [[sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacraments]] are oriented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3X.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1324]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term &quot;Mass&quot; is generally used only in the [[Latin Church]], while the [[Byzantine-Rite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] use the analogous term &quot;[[Divine Liturgy]]&quot; and other Eastern Catholic Churches have terms such as [[Holy Qurbana]].

Within the fixed structure outlined below, which is specific to the [[Roman Rite]], the Scripture readings, the [[antiphon]]s sung or recited during the entrance procession or communion, and certain other prayers vary each day according to the liturgical calendar.  For more information regarding the structure and history of Mass in the Roman Rite see [[Mass (Catholic Church)]]

===Introductory Rites===
The [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]] enters, with a [[deacon]], if there is one, and altar servers (who may act as [[crucifer]], torch-bearers and [[thurifer]]). He then invites those present to take part in the [[Penitential Rite|Act of Penitence]], which concludes with the priest's prayer of absolution, &quot;which, however, lacks the efficacy of the Sacrament of Penance.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;GIRM, 51&quot;&gt;GIRM, paragraph 51&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Kyrie|Kyrie, eleison]] (Lord, have mercy), is sung or said,&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 52&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]] (Glory to God in the highest), an ancient praise, if appropriate for the liturgical season.&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgy of the Word===
On Sundays and solemnities, three Scripture readings are given. On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the [[Old Testament]] (a term wider than &quot;[[Hebrew Scriptures]]&quot;, since it includes the [[Deuterocanonical Books]]), or the [[Acts of the Apostles]] during [[Eastertide]]. The first reading is followed by a psalm, either recited or sung responsorially.  The second reading is from the [[New Testament]], typically from one of the [[Pauline epistles]]. The final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the [[Gospel]], read by the deacon or priest.  At least on Sundays and [[Holy Days of Obligation]], a [[homily]], a [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]] that draws upon some aspect of the readings or the liturgy of the day, is then given.&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 66&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Creed is professed on Sundays and solemnities,&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 68&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is desirable that in Masses celebrated with the people the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful should usually follow.&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgy of the Eucharist===
[[Image:4200-20080119-0624UTC--nazareth-church-of-the-annunciation-grotto.jpg|thumb|right|Mass in the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Grotto of the Annunciation]], Nazareth.]]
The Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the ceremonial placing of the gifts of bread and wine on the altar,&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 73&lt;/ref&gt; after which the congregation stands, as the priest gives the exhortation to pray, &quot;Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.&quot; The congregation responds: &quot;May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of his name, for our good, and the good of all his holy Church.&quot; The priest then pronounces the variable prayer over the gifts.  

The [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Eucharistic Prayer]], &quot;the centre and high point of the entire celebration&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 78&lt;/ref&gt; then begins with a dialogue between priest and people. The priest continues with one of many Eucharistic Prayer thanksgiving prefaces, which lead to the reciting of the [[Sanctus]] acclamation. The Eucharistic Prayer includes the [[epiclesis]], a prayer that the gifts offered may by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] become the body and blood of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 79c&lt;/ref&gt; The central part is the [[Words of Institution|Institution Narrative and Consecration]], recalling the words and actions of Jesus at his [[Last Supper]], which he told his disciples to do in remembrance of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Luke|22:19}}; {{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the [[Consecration]] and the display to the people of the consecrated elements, the priest says: &quot;The mystery of faith&quot;, and the people pronounce the [[Memorial Acclamation|acclamation]], using one of the three prescribed formulae.&lt;ref&gt;GIRM, paragraph 151&lt;/ref&gt;  It concludes with a [[doxology]], with the priest lifting up the paten with the host and the deacon (if there is one) the chalice, and the singing or recitation of the [[Amen]] by the people.

===Communion rite===&lt;!-- There are links to this heading --&gt;
All together recite or sing the &quot;[[Lord's Prayer]]&quot; (&quot;Pater Noster&quot; or &quot;Our Father&quot;). The priest introduces it with a short phrase and follows it up with a prayer called the [[Embolism (liturgy)|embolism]] and the people respond with the [[doxology]].  The [[sign of peace]] is exchanged and then the &quot;[[Lamb of God]]&quot; (&quot;[[Agnus Dei]]&quot; in Latin) litany is sung or recited, while the priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of fraction and commingling.

The priest then presents the transubstantiated elements to the congregation, saying: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sin of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.&quot; Then all repeat: &quot;Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.&quot; The priest then receives Communion and, with the help, if necessary, of extraordinary ministers, distributes Communion to the people, who usually approach in procession.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIRM, 160&quot;&gt;GIRM, paragraph 160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concluding rite===
The deacon, or in his absence, the priest himself then dismisses the people, choosing one of four formulas, of which the first is &quot;Ite, missa est&quot; in Latin or its equivalent in other languages. The congregation responds: &quot;Thanks be to God.&quot; The priest and other ministers then leave, often to the accompaniment of a recessional hymn.

==Mass in Anglicanism==

[[File:Episcopalian Mass Guide.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Mass Guide used by the congregation of the Church of Saint Mary, an [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines|Episcopal Church]] in [[Sagada, Mountain Province|Sagada]], [[Mountain Province]], [[Philippines]].]]

&quot;Mass&quot; is one of many terms used to describe the [[Eucharist]] in the Anglican tradition. More frequently, the term used is either &quot;Holy Communion,&quot; &quot;Holy Eucharist,&quot; or &quot;the Lord's Supper.&quot; Occasionally the term used in Eastern churches, &quot;the Divine Liturgy&quot;, is also employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#The%20Holy%20Eucharist| title=The Catechism (1979 Book of Common Prayer): The Holy Eucharist|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English-speaking Anglican world, the term used identifies the [[Eucharistic theology]] of the one using it. &quot;Mass&quot; is an [[Anglo-Catholic]] term.

===Structure of the rite===
The various Eucharistic liturgies used by national churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] have continuously evolved from the 1549 and 1552 editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] which both owed their form and contents chiefly to the work of [[Thomas Cranmer]], who had rejected the medieval theology of the Mass in about 1547&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch 1996 412&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=MacCulloch| first=Diarmaid| title=Thomas Cranmer| location=London| publisher=Yale UP|page=412| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1549 rite retained the traditional sequence of the mass, its underlying theology was Protestant.  In the 1552 revision, this was made abundantly plain by the restructuring of the elements of the rite while retaining nearly all the language so that it became, in the words of an anglo-catholic liturgiologist (Arthur Couratin) &quot;a series of communion devotions; disembarrassed of the Mass with which they were temporarily associated in 1548 and 1549&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCulloch 1996 412&quot;/&gt; The further development of the 1552 rite is described in the Article on The [[Book of Common Prayer]] and some rites such as the 1637 Scottish rite and the 1789 one in the United States of America went back to the 1549 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Neill| first=Stephen| title=Anglicanism| publisher=Penguin| location=London| year=1960|page=152,3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the time of the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] in 1559 the services  allowed for a certain variety of theological interpretation. Today's rites generally follow the same general five-part shape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last=Seddon| first=Philip| title=Word and Sacrament| editor-last=Bunting| editor-first=Ian| encyclopedia=Celebrating the Anglican Way| publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton| year=1996| location=London| page=107,8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(some or all of the following elements may be altered, transposed or absent depending on the rite, the liturgical season and use of the province or national church):

* '''Gathering''': Beginning with a [[Trinitarian formula|Trinitarian]]-based greeting or [[liturgical year|seasonal]] acclamation; followed by the [[Collect for Purity]]; the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] or some other song of praise, [[Kyrie eleison]], and/or [[Trisagion]]; and then the [[collect]] of the day. During [[Lent]] and/or [[Advent]] especially, this part of the service may begin or end with a penitential rite.
* '''Proclaiming and Hearing the Word''': Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the [[Gospel]]s, plus a [[psalm]] (or portion thereof) or [[canticle]] between the lessons. This is followed by a [[sermon]] or [[homily]]; the recitation of the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] or [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] Creeds;
* '''The Prayers of the People''': Very varied in their form.  The passing of the peace may be included at this point.
*'''The Celebration of the Eucharist''': The gifts of bread and wine are brought up, along with other gifts (such as money and/or food for a food bank, etc.), and an [[offertory]] prayer is recited. Following this, a [[Eucharistic Prayer]] (called &quot;The Great Thanksgiving&quot;) is offered. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the [[Sursum Corda]]), a preface, the [[sanctus]] and [[Sanctus Benedictus|benedictus]], the Words of Institution, the Anamnesis, an [[Epiclesis]] a petition for salvation and a Doxology. The Lord's Prayer precedes the [[Fraction (religion)|fraction]] (the breaking of the bread), followed by the [[Prayer of Humble Access]] and/or the [[Agnus Dei]], and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine).
*'''Dismissal''': There is a post-Communion prayer, which is a general prayer of thanksgiving. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal.

The liturgy is divided into two main parts: The Liturgy of the Word (Gathering, Proclaiming and Hearing the Word, Prayers of the People)and the Liturgy of the Eucharist (together with the Dismissal), but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist. The sequence of the liturgy are almost identical to the [[Roman Rite]], except the Confession of Sin ends the Liturgy of the Word in the Anglican rites in North America, while in the Roman Rite and in Anglican rites in the rest of the world the Confession is near the beginning of the service.

===Special Masses===
The Anglican tradition includes separate rites for Nuptial Masses, Funeral Masses, and votive Masses. The Eucharist is an integral part of many other sacramental services, including [[ordination]] and [[Confirmation]].

===Ceremonial===
{{See also|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}

Some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] parishes use Anglican versions of the Tridentine Missal, such as the [[English Missal]], ''[[The Anglican Missal]]'', or [[Anglican Missal#The American Missal|American Missal]], for the celebration of mass, all of which are intended primarily for the celebration of the Eucharist. Many Anglo-Catholic parishes in the [[Church of England]] use ''A Manual of Anglo-Catholic Devotion'' (successor to the earlier ''A Manual of Catholic Devotion''). In the [[Episcopal Church USA]], a traditional-language, Anglo-Catholic adaptation of the 1979 [[Book of Common Prayer]] has been published (''An Anglican Service Book'').

All of these books contain such features as meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, [[Proper (liturgy)|proper]]s for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively [[Catholicism|Catholic]] context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and related liturgical books.

These are often supplemented in Anglo-Catholic parishes by books specifying ceremonial actions, such as ''A Priest's Handbook'' by Dennis G. Michno, ''Ceremonies of the Eucharist'', by Howard E. Galley, and ''Ritual Notes'' by E.C.R. Lamburn. Other guides to ceremonial include the [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], ''Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite'' (Peter Elliott), ''Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described'' (Adrian Fortescue), and ''[[The Parson's Handbook]]'' ([[Percy Dearmer]]). In Evangelical Anglican (i.e. Protestant) parishes, the rubrics detailed in the Book of Common Prayer are considered normative.

==Mass in Lutheranism==
{{Main|Divine Service (Lutheran)}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lutheran elevation.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A Lutheran priest elevating the host.]] --&gt;
In the [[Book of Concord]], Article XXIV (&quot;Of the Mass&quot;) of the [[Augsburg Confession]] (1530) begins thus: &quot;Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence.  We do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it... we keep the traditional liturgical form... In our churches Mass is celebrated every Sunday and on other holy days, when the sacrament is offered to those who wish for it after they have been examined and absolved (Article XXIV)&quot;.

[[Martin Luther]] rejected parts of the Roman Rite Catholic Mass, specifically the [[Canon of the Mass]]), which, as he argued, did not conform with {{bibleverse||Hebrews|7:27}}. In that verse, the Old Testament priests, who needed to make a sacrifice for sins on a regular basis, are contrasted with the single priest Christ, who offers his body only once as a sacrifice. The theme is carried out also in {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Heb|9:28}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Heb|10:10}}. He composed as a replacement a revised Latin-language rite, ''[[Formula missae]]'' in 1523 and the vernacular [[Deutsche Messe]] in 1526.

In [[German language|German]], the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and some [[English language|English]] [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], use the word &quot;Mass&quot; for their corresponding service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hope|first=Nicholas|title=German and Scandinavian Protestantism 1700 to1918|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|isbn=0-19-826994-3|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=DFL2GNDHPdYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=November 19, 2011|page=18}}; see also [[Deutsche Messe]]&lt;/ref&gt; but in most English-speaking churches, they call it the &quot;Divine Service&quot;, &quot;Holy Communion, or &quot;the Holy Eucharist&quot;.

The celebration of the Mass in Lutheran churches follows a similar pattern to other traditions, starting with public confession ([[Confiteor]]) by all and a [[Declaration of Grace]] said by the priest or pastor.  Followed by the ''[[Introit]]'', ''[[Kyrie]]'', ''[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]'', [[collect]], the readings with an [[alleluia]] (alleluia is not said during [[Lent]]), [[homily]] (or sermon) and recitation of the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Service of the Eucharist includes the [[General intercessions]], [[Preface]], [[Sanctus]] and [[Eucharistic Prayer]], [[elevation]] of the host and chalice and invitation to the Eucharist. The [[Agnus Dei]] is chanted while the clergy and assistants first commune followed by lay communicants. [[Postcommunion]] prayers and the final blessing by the priest ends the Mass. A Roman Catholic or Anglican of the Anglo-Catholic party would find its elements familiar, in particular the use of the sign of the cross, kneeling for prayer and the Eucharistic Prayer, bowing to the processional crucifix, kissing the altar, incense (among some), chanting, and vestments.

Lutheran churches often celebrate the Eucharist each Sunday, if not at every worship service. This is in keeping with Luther's preference and the Lutheran confessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Preus|first=Klemet|title=Communion Every Sunday: Why?|url=http://storage.cloversites.com/gloryofchrist/documents/COMMUNION%20EVERY%20SUNDAY.htm|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, eucharistic ministers take the sacramental elements to the sick in hospitals and nursing homes. The practice of weekly communion is increasingly the norm again in most Lutheran parishes throughout the world. This restoration of the weekly Mass has been strongly encouraged by the bishops and pastors of the larger Lutheran bodies.

The celebration of the Eucharist may be included in weddings, funerals, retreats, the dedication of a church building and at annual synod conventions. The Mass is also an important aspect of ordinations and confirmations in Lutheran churches.
