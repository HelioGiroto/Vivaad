{{Christianity}}

A '''sermon''' is an [[public speaking|oration]] by a [[prophet]] or member of the [[clergy]]. Sermons address a [[Bible|Biblical]], [[Theology|theological]], [[Religion|religious]], or [[Morality|moral]] topic, usually expounding on a type of [[belief]], [[law]] or [[Human behavior|behavior]] within both past and present contexts. Elements of preaching include exposition, exhortation and practical application.

In [[Christianity]], a sermon (also known as a [[homily]] within some churches) is often delivered in a place of worship, most of which have a [[pulpit]] or [[ambo (liturgy)|ambo]], an elevated architectural feature. The word &quot;sermon&quot; comes from a [[Middle English]] word which was derived from an [[Old French]] term, which in turn came from the [[Latin]] word ''sermō''; (&quot;discourse&quot;), although links have been made between the Latin word serere, which means 'to join together', so this leaves the modern Latin definition open to interpretation. The word can mean &quot;conversation&quot;, which could mean that early sermons were delivered in the form of question and answer, and that only later did it come to mean a monologue. In contrast to this are examples from the Bible, where sermons are speeches without interlocution: Moses' sermon in [[Deuteronomy]] 1-33 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=5&amp;chapter=1&amp;version=9]; Jesus' [[sermon on the mount]] in Matthew 5-7 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205-7;&amp;version=9;]; Peter's sermon after [[Pentecost]] in Acts 2:14-40 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202:14-40;&amp;version=9;].

In modern language, the word &quot;sermon&quot; can also be used [[pejorative]]ly in secular terms to describe a lengthy or tedious speech delivered with great passion, by any person, to an uninterested audience. A '''sermonette''' is a short sermon (usually associated with television broadcasting, as stations would present a sermonette before [[Sign-off (broadcast)|signing off]] for the night).

==Christian tradition==
{{See also|Homiletics}}
[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''The [[Sermon on the Mount]]'' by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]].]]
In Christianity, the most famous sermon is the [[Sermon on the Mount]] by [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. This sermon was probably preached around [[30|30 A.D.]] and is recounted in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (5:1&amp;ndash;7:29, including introductory and concluding material) as being delivered on a mount on the north end of the [[Sea of Galilee]], near [[Capernaum]]. The Sermon on the Mount lays out many of the core principles of [[Christianity]]. Another rendition of much of the same material may be found in the &quot;[[Sermon on the Plain]]&quot; in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (6:17&amp;ndash;49, including introductory material).

During the later [[history of Christianity]], several figures became known for their sermons or a particularly significant sermon. Preachers of the early church include [[Saint Peter|Peter]] (see especially [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 2:14b&amp;ndash;36), [[Stephen]] (see Acts 7:1b&amp;ndash;53), [[Tertullian]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Gregory Nazianzus]]. Sermons in this era were used to spread Christianity across [[Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], sermons inspired the beginnings of new [[religious institute]]s (''e.g.'', [[Saint Dominic]] and [[Francis of Assisi]]). [[Pope Urban II]] began the [[First Crusade]] in November 1095 at the [[Council of Clermont]], [[France]], when he exhorted French knights to retake the [[Holy Land]] in [[Palestine]].

In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition, the art of preaching has developed through the theological field of [[homiletics]].

Many sermons have been written down, collected and published. Such sermons include [[John Wesley]]'s ''53 Standard Sermons'', John Chrysostom's ''Homily on the Resurrection'' (preached every Easter in Orthodox churches) and Gregory Nazianzus' homily &quot;On the Theophany, or Birthday of Christ&quot; (preached every Christmas in Orthodox churches). [[Martin Luther]] began a tradition of publishing sermons ([[Postil|Hauspostille]]) on the Sunday lessons for the edification of readers. This tradition was continued by Chemnitz and Arndt and others into the following centuries &amp;mdash; for example [[CH Spurgeon]]'s stenographed sermons, [[Charles_Spurgeon#The_Metropolitan_Tabernacle_Pulpit|The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit]].&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, C.H., ''Spurgeon's Sermons'', Baker 2003, ISBN 0-8010-1113-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
[[File:Luther-Predigt-LC-WB.jpg|thumb|335px|&quot;The certain mark by which a Christian community can be recognized is the preaching of the gospel in its purity.&quot;—[[Martin Luther|Luther]]&lt;ref&gt;Tappert, T.G., [http://books.google.com/books?id=cHvf_xp6V8IC&amp;pg=RA3-PA325&amp;lpg=RA3-PA325&amp;dq=%22The+certain+mark+by+which+a+Christian+community+can+be+recognized+is+the+preaching+of+the+gospel+in+its+purity.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4jdynQwLJB&amp;sig=n5MpkCtJlJVcN2GES416nCcdAQk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TIK0SfWdLuSOmQfXzcjwBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Selected Writings of Martin Luther], Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007, p.325&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] led to [[Protestant]] sermons, many of which defended the [[schism (religion)|schism]] with the Roman Catholic Church and explained beliefs about scripture, theology and devotion.  The distinctive doctrines of Protestantism held that [[salvation]] was by [[sola fide|faith alone]], and convincing people to believe the Gospel and place trust in God for their salvation through Jesus Christ was the decisive step in salvation. In many Protestant churches, the sermon came to replace the [[Eucharist]] as the central act of Christian worship (although some Protestants such as [[Lutheran]]s give equal time to a sermon and the Eucharist in their [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]). The goal of many Protestant's worship, as conditioned by these beliefs, was to rouse the congregation to a deeper [[faith]], rather than have them just partake in rituals.

In the 18th and 19th centuries during the [[Great Awakening]], major sermons were made at [[Revival meeting|revivals]], which were especially popular in the [[United States]]. These sermons were noted for their &quot;[[Fire and brimstone|fire-and-brimstone]]&quot; message, typified by [[Jonathan Edwards (theology)|Jonathan Edwards]]'s famous &quot;[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]&quot; speech. In these sermons the wrath of God was clearly one to be afraid of, although fear was not the message Edwards was trying to convey in his sermons, he was simply trying to tell the people that they could be forgiven for their sins.

==Jewish Tradition==
Rabbinic ordination often includes the phrase, ''Rabbi, Teacher, and Preacher in Israel'', and there is a long history of using sermons in Judaism as part of education, [[Mussar movement|ethics]], a call to repentance, or as a message of hope, often during difficult times.

In 1939, Rabbi [[Philip R. Alstat]], an early leader of [[Conservative Judaism]], spoke and wrote about the lesson of hope that the festival of [[Passover]] could give to the Jewish people, despite the rising power of [[Nazism]] in Europe:&lt;ref&gt;Sermon quoted in ''The Canadian Jewish Chronicle,'' March 31, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; he counseled hope, and even gratitude, as part of Jewish strength to withstand the pain of events in Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps in our generation the counsel of our Talmudic sages may seem superfluous, for today the story of our enslavement in Egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism, but even more so by tragic realism. We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating &quot;the bread of affliction&quot;?  Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?&lt;br /&gt;And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to &quot;visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.&quot; It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit.  Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall &quot;be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same way, he preached a message of hope in 1938 when he said that,&lt;ref&gt;''Liberty as Theme of Passover,'' New York Times, April 17, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Undaunted, we confidently expect that some day, somehow, the present low ebb of liberty and democracy will be followed by a rising tide whose onrush will irresistibly wash away the ramparts of tyranny.&quot;  His sermons and articles targeted the Jewish community, the United States, the &quot;family of nations,&quot; the &quot;Jewish homeland in Palestine,&quot; and frequently described the importance of the &quot;Jewish State&quot;—a nation yet not created, but which he supported with both his words and his actions.  He shared his vision of that State by proclaiming that, &quot;Whether the Jewish State be large or small, its importance in the family of nations will be determined, not by its limited area, but by its creative genius and cultural contributions to mankind. Like [[Kingdom of Judah|Judaea]] and [[Classical Athens|Athens]] of old, it may be only a small vessel, but exceedingly rich in precious content.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''All Faiths Urged to Fight Dictators,'' New York Times, Nov 17, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are a number of different types of sermons, that differ both in their subject matter and by their intended audience, and accordingly not every preacher is equally well-versed in every type.  The types of sermons are:

* Topical sermons - concerned with a particular subject of current concern;
* Liturgical sermons - sermons that explain the [[liturgy]], why certain things are done during a service, such as why [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] is offered and what it means.&lt;ref&gt;Schüch, Ignaz (1894) ''A manual of homiletics and catechetics: the priest in the pulpit'' (Boniface Luebbermann editor and translator) Benziger, New York, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ITQsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 page 170], [http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/15157571 OCLC 15157571]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biographical]] sermons - tracing the story of a particular biblical character through a number of parts of the Bible.
* Historical sermons - which seek to portray a biblical story within its historical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Schüch, Ignaz (1894) ''A manual of homiletics and catechetics: the priest in the pulpit'' (Boniface Luebbermann editor and translator) Benziger, New York, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ITQsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 page 169], [http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/15157571 OCLC 15157571]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Evangelistic]] sermons - seeking to convert the congregation or bring them back to their previous faith through a recounting of the [[foundational story]] of the religion, in Christianity, the [[Good news (Christianity)|Good News]].
* [[Expository preaching]] - [[exegesis]], that is sermons that expound and explain a text to the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=How Biblical is Expository Preaching?|url=http://www.simonperry.org.uk/#/exposition/4550415875|work=The Baptist Times|accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Redemptive-Historical Preaching]] - sermons that takes into consideration the context of any given text within the broader history of salvation as recorded in the canon of the bible.
* Narrative sermons - which tell a story, often a parable, or a series of stories, to make a moral point.
* Illuminative sermons, also known as proems (''petihta'') - which connect an apparently unrelated biblical verse or religious question with the current calendrical event or festival.&lt;ref&gt;Holtz, Barry W. (1984) ''Back to the Sources: Reading the classic Jewish texts'' Summit Books, New York, [http://books.google.com/books?id=rQ_FVFlRhxsC&amp;pg=PA198 page 198], ISBN 0-671-45467-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Sermons can be both written and spoken out loud.

==Delivery methods==
Sermons also differ on the amount of time and effort used to prepare them.

* [[Manuscript|Script]]ed preaching &amp;mdash; preaching with a previous preparation, it can be with help of notes or a script, or rely on the memory of the preacher.
* [[Extemporaneous preaching]] &amp;mdash; preaching without overly detailed notes and sometimes without preparation.  Usually a basic outline and scriptural references are listed as notes.
* [[Impromptu preaching]] &amp;mdash; preaching without previous preparation.

With the advent of reception theory, researchers also became aware that how sermons are listened to affects their meaning as much as how they are delivered.  The expectations of the congregation, their prior experience of listening to oral texts, their level of scriptural education, and the relative social positions &amp;mdash; often reflected in the physical arrangement &amp;mdash; of sermon-goers vis-a-vis the preacher are part of the meaning of the sermon.
