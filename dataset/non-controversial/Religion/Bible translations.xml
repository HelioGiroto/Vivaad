      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30907">{{About|the general history of Bible translations|translations into specific languages|Bible translations by language}}

The [[Bible]] has been [[translation|translated]] into [[Bible translations by language|many languages]] from the [[biblical languages]] of [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. Indeed, the full Bible has been translated into over 450 languages, and some sections of the Bible have been translated into over 2,000 languages.

The Latin [[Vulgate]] was dominant in [[Western Christianity]] through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]]. [[English Bible translations]] in particular have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium.

==Original text==

===Hebrew Bible===
The [[Tanakh]] was mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. From the 9th century to the 15th century, Jewish scholars, today known as [[Masoretes]], compared the text of all known [[biblical manuscript]]s in an effort to create a unified, standardized text. A series of highly similar texts eventually emerged, and any of these texts are known as [[Masoretic Texts]] (MT). The Masoretes also added vowel points (called [[niqqud]]) to the text, since the original text only contained consonant letters. This sometimes required the selection of an interpretation, since some words differ only in their vowels—their meaning can vary in accordance with the vowels chosen. In antiquity, variant Hebrew readings existed, some of which have survived in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and other ancient fragments, as well as being attested in ancient versions in other languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen1979&quot;&gt;Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed. Uriel Simon, HaMachon L'Yahadut U'Machshava Bat-Z'mananu and Dvir, Tel-Aviv, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
The [[New Testament]] was written in [[Koine Greek]].

The discovery of older manuscripts, which belong to the Alexandrian text-type, including the 4th century Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus, led scholars to revise their view about the original Greek text. Attempts to reconstruct the original text are called ''critical editions''. [[Karl Lachmann]] based his critical edition of 1831 on manuscripts dating from the 4th century and earlier, to demonstrate that the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' must be corrected according to these earlier texts.

The ''autographs'', the Greek [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] written by the original authors, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the versions that do survive. The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (generally minimalist), the [[Byzantine text-type]] (generally maximalist), and the [[Western text-type]] (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.

Most variants among the manuscripts are minor, such as alternative spelling, alternative word order, the presence or absence of an optional definite article (&quot;the&quot;), and so on. Occasionally, a major variant happens when a portion of a text was accidentally omitted (or perhaps even censored), or was added from a marginal gloss. Fortunately, major variants tend to be easier to correct. Examples of major variants are the [[Mark 16|endings of Mark]], the [[Pericope Adulteræ]], the [[Comma Johanneum]], and the [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of Acts]].

Early manuscripts of the letters of Paul and other New Testament writings show no punctuation whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stpaulsirvine.org/images/papyruslg.gif&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}} The [[punctuation]] was added later by other editors, according to their own understanding of the text.

==History of Bible translations==

=== Ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible ===

====Aramaic Targums====
{{main|Targums}}
Some of the first translations of the Jewish Torah began during the [[Babylonian exile|first exile in Babylonia]], when [[Aramaic]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the Jews. With most people speaking only Aramaic and not understanding Hebrew, the [[Targum]]s were created to allow the common person to understand the Torah as it was read in ancient [[synagogues]].

====Greek Septuagint====
{{main|Septuagint}}
By the 3rd century BC, [[Alexandria]] had become the center of  [[Hellenistic Judaism]], and a [[Koine Greek]] translation was compiled in several stages during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC (known to have been complete by 132 BC). The [[Talmud]] ascribes the translation effort to  [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (r. 285-246 BC) who is said to have hired  72  Jewish scholars for the purpose, for which reason the translation is commonly known as the [[Septuagint]], a name which it gained around AD 354-430, &quot;the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Sundberg | first = Albert C., Jr. | editor = McDonald, Lee Martin; Sanders, James A. | encyclopedia = The Canon Debate | title = The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism | year = 2002 | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | isbn = 978-1-56563-517-3 | pages = 72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Septuagint]] (LXX) was the very first translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Greek language|Greek]], and later became the accepted text of the [[Old Testament]] in the church and the basis of its [[Biblical canon|canon]]. The Latin [[Vulgate]] by [[Jerome]] was based upon the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the [[masoretic text]]), and on the Greek text for the [[deuterocanonical books]].

In his ''City of God'' 18.42, while repeating the [[Letter of Aristeas|story of Aristeas]] with typical embellishments, Augustine adds the remark, &quot;It is their translation that it has now become traditional to call the Septuagint&quot; ...[Latin omitted]... Augustine thus indicates that this name for the Greek translation of the scriptures was a recent development. However, he offers no clue as to which of the possible antecedents led to this development:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exod|24:1-8}}, [[Josephus]] [Antiquities 12.57, 12.86], or an elision. ...this name ''Septuagint'' appears to have been a fourth- to fifth-century development.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobes and Silva&quot;&gt;Karen Jobes and Moises Silva, ''Invitation to the Septuagint ISBN 1-84227-061-3, (Paternoster Press, 2001). - The current standard for Introductory works on the Septuagint.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew ([[Masoretic Text]]). This translation was promoted by way of a legend (primarily recorded as the [[Letter of Aristeas]]) that seventy (or in some sources, seventy-two) separate translators all produced identical texts; supposedly proving its accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dines&quot;&gt;Jennifer M. Dines, ''The Septuagint,'' Michael A. Knibb, Ed., London: T&amp;T Clark, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the Septuagint contain several passages and whole books beyond what was included in the Masoretic texts of the [[Tanakh]]. In some cases these additions were originally composed in Greek, while in other cases they are translations of Hebrew books or variants not present in the Masoretic texts. Recent discoveries have shown that more of the Septuagint additions have a Hebrew origin than was once thought. While there are no complete surviving manuscripts of the Hebrew texts on which the Septuagint was based, many scholars believe that they represent a different textual tradition (&quot;Vorlage&quot;) from the one that became the basis for the Masoretic texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen1979&quot; /&gt;

===Early translations in Late Antiquity===
[[Origen of Alexandria|Origen]]'s ''[[Hexapla]]'' placed side by side six versions of the Old Testament, including the 2nd century Greek translations of [[Aquila of Sinope]] and [[Symmachus the Ebionite]]. His eclectic recension of the Septuagint had a significant influence on the Old Testament text in several important manuscripts. The canonical [[Christian Bible]] was formally established by Bishop [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] in 350 (although it had been generally accepted by the church previously), confirmed by the [[Council of Laodicea]] in 363 (both lacked the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]), and later established by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 367 (with [[Revelation]] added), and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate]]'' Latin translation dates to between AD 382 and 420. [[Latin]] translations predating Jerome are collectively known as ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' texts.

Christian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the [[Septuagint]] (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the masoretic text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions. The [[Textus Receptus|received text]] of the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] is in [[Koine Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;Some scholars hypothesize that certain books (whether completely or partially) may have been written in Aramaic before being translated for widespread dissemination. One very famous example of this is [[Logos|the opening]] to the [[Gospel of John]], which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn.&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.

Jerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.

The New Testament was translated into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by [[Ulfilas]]. In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the bible into [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Also dating from the same period are the [[Peshitta|Syriac]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] translations.

There are also several ancient translations, most important of which are in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] dialect of Aramaic (including the [[Peshitta]] and the [[Diatessaron]] gospel harmony), in the Ethiopian language of [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], and in [[Latin]] (both the [[Vetus Latina]] and the [[Vulgate]]). The Bishop of the Goths [[Wulfila]] in the today's Bulgaria translated the Bible into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the mid-4th century.

In 331, the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine]] commissioned [[Eusebius]] to deliver fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople. [[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for [[Biblical canon|canon lists]], and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]] are examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canon Debate'', McDonald &amp; Sanders editors, 2002, pp. 414-415, for the entire paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Bible translations in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumb|left|The '''[[Codex Gigas]]''' from the 13th century, held at the [[Swedish Royal Library|Royal Library]] in [[Sweden]].]]
When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (''marginal glosses'') to correct their text—especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line—and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See [[textual criticism]]. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions and additions.

The earliest surviving complete manuscript of the entire Bible is the [[Codex Amiatinus]], a Latin Vulgate edition produced in 8th century England at the double monastery of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth-Jarrow]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], translation, particularly of the Old Testament was discouraged. Nevertheless, there are some fragmentary [[Old English Bible translations]], notably a lost translation of the [[Gospel of John]] into Old English by the Venerable [[Bede]], which he is said to have prepared shortly before his death around the year 735.  An [[Old High German]] version of the gospel of Matthew dates to 748. [[Charlemagne]] in ca. 800 charged [[Alcuin]] with a revision of the Latin Vulgate.  The translation into [[Old Church Slavonic]] was started in 863 by Cyril and Methodius.

[[Alfred the Great]] had a number of passages of the Bible circulated in the vernacular in around 900.  These included passages from the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Pentateuch]], which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time.  In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared, in the [[est Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] dialect; these are called the ''[[Wessex Gospels]]''.

[[Pope Innocent III]] in 1199 banned unauthorized versions of the Bible as a reaction to the [[Cathar]] and [[Waldensian]] heresies.  The synods of Toulouse and Tarragona (1234) outlawed possession of such renderings. There is evidence of some vernacular translations being permitted while others were being scrutinized.

The complete Bible was translated into Old French in the late 13th century. Parts of this translation were included in editions of the popular ''Bible historiale'', and there is no evidence of this translation being suppressed by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Sneddon, Clive R. 1993. &quot;A neglected mediaeval Bible translation.&quot; ''Romance Languages Annual'' 5(1): 11-16 [http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1993/French-html/Sneddon,Clive.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Bible was translated into Czech around 1360.

The most notable [[Middle English Bible translation]], [[Wyclif's Bible]] (1383), based on the Vulgate, was banned by the Oxford Synod in 1408. A Hungarian [[Hussite]] Bible appeared in the mid 15th century, and in 1478, a Catalan translation in the dialect of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]].  Many parts of the Bible were printed by [[William Caxton]] in his translation of the [[Golden Legend]], and in ''Speculum Vitae Christi'' (''[[The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ]]'').

===Reformation and Early Modern period===
{{See also|Early Modern English Bible translations}}

The earliest printed edition of the Greek New Testament appeared in 1516 from the [[Johann Froben|Froben]] press, by [[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]], who reconstructed its Greek text from several recent manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. He occasionally added a Greek translation of the Latin Vulgate for parts that did not exist in the Greek manuscripts. He produced four later editions of this text. Erasmus was Roman Catholic, but his preference for the [[Byzantine Greek]] manuscripts rather than the [[Latin Vulgate]] led some church authorities to view him with suspicion.

In 1521, [[Martin Luther]] was placed under the [[Imperial ban|Ban of the Empire]], and he retired to the [[Wartburg Castle]]. During his time there, he translated the New Testament from Greek into German.  It was printed in September 1522. The first complete Dutch Bible, partly based on the existing portions of Luther's translation, was printed in [[Antwerp]] in 1526 by Jacob van Liesvelt.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, ISBN 2-503-51411-1, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition with ''[[critical apparatus]]'' (noting variant readings among the manuscripts) was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for &quot;received text&quot;), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' (&quot;now received by all&quot;).

* The use of numbered chapters and verses was not introduced until the Middle Ages and later. The system used in English was developed by Stephanus ([[Robert Estienne]] of Paris) (see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]])

Later critical editions incorporate ongoing scholarly research, including discoveries of Greek papyrus fragments from near Alexandria, Egypt, that date in some cases within a few decades of the original New Testament writings.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce R. ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Paleography'' (Oxford University Press, 1981) cf. [[Papyrus 52]].&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most critical editions of the Greek New Testament, such as UBS4 and [[NA27]], consider the Alexandrian text-type corrected by papyri, to be the Greek text that is closest to the original ''autographs''. Their ''apparatus'' includes the result of votes among scholars, ranging from certain {A} to doubtful {E}, on which variants best preserve the original Greek text of the New Testament.

Critical editions that rely primarily on the Alexandrian text-type inform nearly all modern translations (and revisions of older translations). For reasons of tradition, however, some translators prefer to use the Textus Receptus for the Greek text, or use the ''[[Majority Text]]'' which is similar to it but is a critical edition that relies on earlier manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. Among these, some argue that the Byzantine tradition contains scribal additions, but these later interpolations preserve the orthodox interpretations of the biblical text—as part of the ongoing Christian experience—and in this sense are authoritative. Distrust of the textual basis of modern translations has contributed to the [[King-James-Only Movement]].

The churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] translated the Greek of the Textus Receptus to produce [[vernacular]] Bibles, such as the German [[Luther Bible]] (1522), the Polish [[Brest Bible]] (1563) and the English [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]] (1611).

[[William Tyndale|Tyndale's]] [[Tyndale's Bible|New Testament translation]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536) and his translation of the [[Pentateuch]] (1530, 1534) and the [[Book of Jonah]] were met with heavy sanctions given the widespread belief that Tyndale ''changed'' the Bible as he attempted to translate it. The first complete French Bible was a translation by [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], published in 1530 in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, ISBN 2-503-51411-1, pp. 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Froschauer Bible]] of 1531 and the [[Luther Bible]] of 1534 (both appearing in portions throughout the 1520s) were an important part of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

The first English translations of [[Psalms]] (1530), [[Isaiah]] (1531), [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (1533), [[Ecclesiastes]] (1533), [[Jeremiah]] (1534) and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] (1534), were executed by the Protestant Bible translator [[George Joye]] in [[Antwerp]]. In 1535 Myles Coverdale published the first complete [[Coverdale Bible|English Bible]] also in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, ISBN 2-503-51411-1, pp. 143-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1584 both Old and New Testaments were translated to [[Slovene language|Slovene]] by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writer and theologian [[Jurij Dalmatin]]. The [[Slovenes]] thus became the 12th nation in the world with a complete Bible in their language. [[Samuel Bogusław Chyliński]] (1631–1668) translated and published the first Bible translation into [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Greenslade, ''The Cambridge History of the Bible: The West, from the Reformation to the Present Day''. 1995, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary activity of the [[Jesuit]] order led to a large number of 17th century translations into languages of the [[New World]].

==Modern translation efforts==
{{See also|International Bible Society|Bible  Society|Wycliffe Bible Translators|Institute for Bible Translation}}
The Bible continues to be the most translated book in the world. The following numbers are approximations. {{As of|2005}}, at least one book of the Bible has been translated into 2,400 of the 6,900 languages listed by [[SIL International|SIL]],&lt;ref name=&quot;numtrans&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=The Bible in the Renaissance - William Tyndale| publisher=Dom Henry Wansbrough | url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sben0056/Tyndale.London.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2012}} including 680 languages in Africa, followed by 590 in Asia, 420 in Oceania, 420 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 210 in Europe, and 75 in North America. The United Bible Societies are presently assisting in over 600 Bible translation projects. The Bible is available in whole or in part to some 98 percent of the world's population in  a language in which they are fluent.

The United Bible Society announced that as of 31 December 2007&lt;ref&gt;

Either the Tanakh or the New Testament alone was available in an additional 1168 languages, and portions of the Bible were available in another 848 languages, for a total of 2,454 languages.

In 1999, Wycliffe Bible Translators announced ''Vision 2025''.  This project aims to see Bible translation begun by 2025 in every remaining language community that needs it. They currently estimate that 2,251 languages, representing 193 million people, lack a Bible translation.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2001, Mike Coles, an [[Religious education|RE]] teacher in [[Stepney]], translated The Bible into [[Cockney]] [[Rhyming slang]] and in 2008, graphic representations of The Bible in [[Manga Bible (disambiguation)|Manga]] and [[Lego|''Lego'' brick]] form were given approval by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7750842.stm The Bible but not as you know it], ''[[BBC]] Magazine'', retrieved 28/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences in Bible translations ==
[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|This [[Gutenberg Bible]] is displayed by the United States [[Library of Congress]]]]
{{Further|Bible translations#Approaches|Dynamic and formal equivalence|Bible version debate}}

===Dynamic or formal translation policy===
A variety of linguistic, philological and ideological approaches to translation have been used.  Inside the Bible-translation community, these are commonly categorized as:
* [[Dynamic equivalence]] translation
* [[Formal equivalence]] translation (similar to [[literal translation]])
* [[Idiomatic]], or [[Paraphrase|Paraphrastic]] translation, as used by the late [[Kenneth N. Taylor]]

though modern linguists such as Bible scholar Dr. Joel Hoffman disagrees with this classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goddidntsaythat.com/2009/10/05/formal-equivalence-and-dynamic-equivalence-a-false-dichotom/ &quot;Formal Equivalence and Dynamic Equivalence: A False Dichotomy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]], the original languages of the Bible, like all languages, have some [[idiom]]s and concepts not easily translated, there is in some cases an ongoing critical tension about whether it is better to give a word for word translation or to give a translation that gives a parallel idiom in the target language. For instance, in the [[New American Bible]], which is the English language [[Catholic]] translation, as well as [[Protestant]] translations like the [[King James Version]], the [[Darby Bible]], the [[New Revised Standard Version]], the [[Modern Literal Version]], and the [[New American Standard Bible]] are seen as more literal translations (or &quot;word for word&quot;), whereas translations like the [[New International Version]] and [[New Living Translation]] sometimes attempt to give relevant parallel idioms. [[The Living Bible]] and [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]] are two paraphrases of the Bible that try to convey the original meaning in contemporary language. The further away one gets from word for word translation, the text becomes easier to read while relying more on the theological, linguistic or cultural understanding of the translator, which one would not normally expect a lay reader to require.

===Doctrinal differences and translation policy===
 {{Further|Tetragrammaton in the New Testament}}
In addition to linguistic concerns, theological issues also drive Bible translations. Some translations of the Bible, produced by single churches or groups of churches, may be seen as subject to a point of view by the translation committee.

Among these the [[New World Translation]], produced by Jehovah's Witnesses, is seen as controversial by some because of the renderings of key verses. Especially verses, that in other Bible translations support the deity of Christ, are rendered differently in the NWT.

Also, the NWT often translates the New Testament ''[[Kyrios]]'', &quot;Lord,&quot; as &quot;[[Jehovah]]&quot; when referring to God. The publishers argue that this can be supported by the fact that the oldest copies of the Greek Septuagint found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (such as 8HevXIIgr) generally have the Hebrew [[tetragrammaton]] in the Greek text rather than Greek ''Kyrios'' as found in later Septuagint manuscripts.  An exception to this is the Cave4 Leviticus fragment, which has Greek ''Iao''.&lt;ref&gt;See Dead Sea scroll&lt;/ref&gt; The NWT translators believe that when Jesus read from such earlier scrolls he would have used his father's name and not the title. (Luke 4:18, Jo 17:6, 26)  The NWT translators did this despite the fact that the tetragrammaton does not appear in the Greek manuscript of the New Testament books. The Greek manuscripts use ''Kyrios'' to refer both to Jesus Christ and God the Father.&lt;ref&gt;Under the heading JEHOVAH (In the Christian Greek Scriptures), evidence is also presented to show that the divine name, Jehovah, was used in the original writings of the Christian Greek Scriptures, from Matthew to Revelation. On this basis, the New World Translation, used throughout this work, has restored the divine name in its translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, doing so a total of 237 times. Other translations had made similar restorations, particularly when translating the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew. When discussing “Restoring the Divine Name,” the New World Bible Translation Committee states: “To know where the divine name was replaced by the Greek words Κύριος and Θεός, we have determined where the inspired Christian writers have quoted verses, passages and expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures and then we have referred back to the Hebrew text to ascertain whether the divine name appears there. In this way we determined the identity to give Ky′ri·os and The·os′ and the personality with which to clothe them.” Explaining further, the Committee said: “To avoid overstepping the bounds of a translator into the field of exegesis, we have been most cautious about rendering the divine name in the Christian Greek Scriptures, always carefully considering the Hebrew Scriptures as a background. We have looked for agreement from the Hebrew versions to confirm our rendering.” Such agreement from Hebrew versions exists in all the 237 places that the New World Bible Translation Committee has rendered the divine name in the body of its translation.—NW appendix, pp. 1564-1566.&lt;/ref&gt;
