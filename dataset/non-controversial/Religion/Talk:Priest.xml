== Confusion ==

I found this section (quoted below, on Catholic and Orthodox) confusing. If these churches are “not in commuion with the Roman Catholic Church”, then why are they in the section about the Catholic Church? That the adjective “catholic” appears in the name does not seem to warrant inclusion in the section on “Catholic and Orthodox”. If any stranger were to ask someone in town to direct him to the local Catholic Church, he would be pointed to one of these.

:''Some churches also known by the adjective &quot;...Catholic&quot;, but not in communion with the Roman Catholic Church, do ordain women as well as men as priestesses; such churches include some Old Catholic and Anglican Catholic communities, as well as some Independent Catholic Churches. These non-Roman Catholic, Christian churches, often in imitation of the Anglican Communion, also generally permit the ordination of married people and, sometimes, of homosexuals and bisexuals. ''
I have adjusted the page slightly to clarify this.  [[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 23:04, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

&quot;There are priests in [[:Christianity|Christianity]], [[:Shintoism|Shintoism]], [[:Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[:Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[:Islam|Islam]]&quot;

:&lt;i&gt;Are&lt;/i&gt; there priests in Islam? -- An article may want to include a note about [[Jew]]ish priesthood during the time of the Temple, absence of same afterward (or link to appropriate entry on this). 

No priests in Islam that I'm aware of - lots of officials, ritual butchers for ''halal meat,'' the whole ''ulema,'' but not priests.

::Would a [[mullah]] or [[imam]] be considered (equivalent to) a priest? From the mullah article it looks like in that regard a [[rabbi]] would be closer to the mark (of course, the clergyman most similar in role to a mullah is a mullah). --[[User:Calieber|Calieber]] 18:06, Oct 28, 2003 (UTC)

I'd be interested in knowing where that statement came from that men are not ordained until age 35.  I was in the Catholic seminary six years and never heard of that.  The usual age was 26. [[User:Rsvk|RSvK]] 03:54, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

: Canon 11 of Neocaesarea and Canon 14 of Trullo both say 30 for the given reason that it's the same age at which Christ began his minstry. It was never 35; that was a misstatement.  In actual practise the minimum age is 25. (Enforcement of these canons were always at the discretion of the bishop. Moot at this point, but I thought I'd answer your question anyway. [[User:Csernica|Csernica]] 23:54, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

One definition of &quot;priest&quot; is &quot;one who acts as a mediator between men and the divinity or the gods in any form of religion&quot;. On that purpose priests existed (as far as we know) since 9000 years. (Catalhoyuk - Konya, Turkey ; the bull deity and its mediator) Then there are sun-god believers and reincarnation believers. (such as shamanism). Though in the beginning; priests were old warriors (or hunters, we can't specifically know it. As far as we can see from paintings on the walls, they were going out chasing either people or animals with weapons). When they got old, it was quite dangerous for them to join any fight or hunting because they were generally getting killed.(being a priest was always a way to get out of wars.) To survive they convinced youngs that they were the mediators between them and the divinity of the gods (or the god, or the after-life. We can't know this specifically as well). Actually the word &quot;priest&quot; comes from the late latin word &quot;presbyter&quot; which comes from older greek word &quot;presbyteros&quot; comperative to &quot;presbys&quot; meaning &quot;elder&quot;. Later on astronomers, (or/and first scientists were also using the same technique to survive.). Later on older widows in Europe during 17th century has used the same technique and predicted themselves as witches. (It was the only way for them to survive in the society) Priests also existed in ancient religions of Egypt &amp; Greece etc. I guess it is quite wrong to analyze it only under Abrahamic religions. (Imam by the way means &quot;Leader&quot; in arabic, it was also used for governors of arabic countries) Thus we can state that Imams are generally muslim priests. --[[User:Nerval|Nerval]] 09:33, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)

There is nothing in Islam called priest cuz in Islam there is no intermediate between you &amp; your god you can speak freely &amp; directly to your god at anytime you want &amp; we believe that god is everywhere around us &amp; can even knew what we are thinking of or feeling at the moment &amp; in the Quran [Islam holy book] god describe this special relation between the human &amp; his creator as {he [god] is closer to you [human] even than your own unmblical cord}. As for the [Emam] for the suna muslim or [Mola] for sheia muslims they are nothing more than a guiding instructors who people refer to when they get confused about any islamic legislation or scripture understanding just like the professor in the university very well knowledged &amp; good reputated person whom people trust &amp; learn from but by the end of the day can never replace the real science nor the only source of it..Also eventhough people trust alot their opinions but it is still debatable if there is no clear instruction in the quran or prophit suna. 

== Vestments ==
Recently added section in Christian Traditions needs a tweak, as it suggests that only Orthodox clergy wear ceremonial crosses, cassocks and other vestments.  Any religious clothing experts out there to revise?  Otherwise I'll give it a go...eventually. [[User:Quill|Quill]] 21:23, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:You're right.  Well, someone had to do it anyway, but I gave it a tad more than a tweak. [[User:Csernica|Csernica]] 23:39, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Photo==
I wouldn't use a photo of Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer to represent a typical catholic priest, because he as the founder of Opus Dei represents a small minority within the catholic church that is highly controversal. Someone could ask his/her local catholic priest to take a photo to post here!

I have removed 2 pictures on the grounds that they are not factual.  One is a romanticised 19th ventury depiction of the accient world and the other a bit of Catholic fantasy.  They would be suitable to illustrate a section on priests in art or popular imagination, but we now have plenty of other excellent pictures.  I felt a bit bad removeing the picture of the priestesses as most of the photos are of Catholics, but the top picture of the priestess on the plate is really good. --[[User:Simonxag|Simon Speed]] 11:54, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

==Request for information==

Can poeple more knowledgeable on the subject add to the text on [[Women as theological figures]] - whether notable female theologians or the position of women in religious hierarchies.

There could also be more information on priestess on #this# page.

[[User:Jackiespeel|Jackiespeel]] 20:56, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

== Priestesses ==

If one types in “priestess”, he is linked to this article.  Yet there is no information of priestesses in the usual sense, as in pagan priestesses of the ancient world.  I thought about adding a section on the role of priestesses and their history, but it felt out of place since it deals with classical pagaism rather than contemporary religion.  Is this the right place for that? [[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 23:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:The convention is for new threads to go on the bottom of the page.

:There are sections &quot;In Judaism&quot;, &quot;In Christianity&quot;. I think it would be entirely appropriate to include sections for other religions.

== Marriage and the Priesthood ==
[[Eric Flint]], a science fiction author, suggested that marriage was not uncommon in the Catholic priesthood, even as recently as the 1900s.  He seems to do a respectable amount of research, as is common his profession.  However, I've not been able to find a source to back it up.  Historically speakin', how common have married priests been in the West, and was it ever formally allowed/when was it formally disallowed?  [[User:MrZaius|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;'''MrZaius'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:MrZaius|'''&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;''']]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:50, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
:New threads at the bottom, please.

:Well he's wrong, at least as far as the Latin rite is concerned. A celibate priesthood has been the canonical norm in the West since the 4th century or so. We find canons from African councils in that time mandating it. (These were the same set of canons that first officially defined a Biblical canon.) See [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.iv.html] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.v.html] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.xxvi.html] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.lxxi.html]. These were collections from earlier councils, codified in 419. Obviously it's possible to interpret them to say that a priest should just abstain from his wife before Mass, and this is how the commentary understands them. But by in 691 universal priestly celibacy was certainly the rule in the West since the Quinisext council in that year condemned the practice. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xiv.iii.xiv.html]. This canon was ignored by Rome, of course, as was the council in general. (The Fathers in Trullo understood erroneously that Western priestly celibacy was founded on these African canons, when in facy it was a disciplinary vow imposed prior to ordination.) There's a reasonably thorough discussion here [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03481a.htm]. (The online edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia was published in 1908, close to the time Flint was talking about, and if a married Catholic priesthood was &quot;not uncommon&quot; it would surely be mentioned there.)

:Now, it's barely possible that Flint was referring to Eastern-rite Catholicism in the United States. Here he'd be correct. Eastern-rite clergy are generally married in their native countries, and this was also true in the US in the early 20th Century. However, American Eastern-rite bishops are now forbidden to ordain married men to the priesthood.

:By the way, I know a number of professional SF writers, and they are as likely to carry out sloppy research as anyone else. You can't use their word as a reliable source. ''[[User:Csernica|TCC]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Csernica|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Csernica|(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:54, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

::Questioning assertions like the one mentioned above plainly imply that I wasn't treating his fiction as a reliable source.  It will be interesting to look back through the book and see whether he explicitly stated that it was an Eastern-rite priest.  Thanks for your quick response.  [[User:MrZaius|&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;'''MrZaius'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:MrZaius|'''&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;''']]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:53, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

:::If it's his &quot;Belisarius&quot; series, then he's almost certainly talking about Eastern Orthodox priests who were, and still are, and will be for the forseeable future, married men. Only bishops are required to be celibate. Priests ''may'' be celibate and may not marry after ordination, and are always celibate if they happen to be monks, but a very large majority of Orthodox priests are married.

==Buddhist Monks are not priests at least in terms of the given definition==
&quot;A priest or priestess is a person having the authority or power to perform and administer religious rites; and in particular, rites of sacrifice to the Deity or Deities&quot;
Unless this is changed I see no reason why I shouldn't delete &quot;Buddhism&quot; from the subsequent list.
Buddhist monks have no more authority or power to perform religious rites than lay people.
Budhhist monks do not worship any deity or deities.
One last thing - there is no mention of the high rates and recent incidents of peadophilia and paedophiles in the christian and particularly Catholic clergy (I know of the US and Australia) which suprises me as there should be a mention here as it is important,  factual, and topical.

Just why someone deleted Judas Priest link on top?

The fans of Judas Priest call them just &quot;Priest&quot; (see Kai Hansen's or Sum 41 interviews, if you do not believe me) - it is a call name, a nick name of the band... Most fans would type in &quot;priest&quot; and would see, that such article does not exist (about the band), and simply quit to another resource of information...

BTW it includes some FAR LESS known ban, called &quot;Priestess&quot;, either delete both and ling to disambiguation page, or leave BOTH BAND links here...

== Anglican theology of priesthood. ==

[[User:HarvardOxon]] insists that the following is accurate:  

&quot;Roman Catholic, Orthodox ''and a small minority of Anglican Christians who reject traditional interpretations of Anglican theology'' [citation needed], therefore, believe that priests and bishops share in the one priesthood of Christ through the sacrament of Holy Orders, and are empowered to offer the one sacrifice of Jesus in the Eucharist which, as Hebrews says, is offered &quot;once for all,&quot; being identical with the very sacrifice of the Cross: the Mass, or Divine Liturgy, as the eucharistic celebration is known, is therefore literally a re-presentation (making present again) of Christ's single sacrifice, according to this theology.&quot;
(emphasis added)

While certainly some Anglicans would reject this understanding of priesthood, would not many, if not most, Anglicans basically accept it?  I would appreciate comments from knowledgeable Anglicans.  --[[User:Midnite Critic|Midnite Critic]] 02:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:In the absence of a poll of Anglicans, it is not possible to accurately conclude how many perceive the sacerdotal role in this manner.  This is definitely an [[Anglo-Catholic]] perspective held by some [[broad church]] Anglicans, and I'm inclined to agree with [[User:HarvardOxon|HarvardOxon]] that it's a minority.  I'm more troubled by the phrase &quot;traditional interpretations of Anglican theology,&quot; since it invites the question, &quot;whose tradition?&quot;  I think a more balanced construction of the sentence would read, &quot;Roman Catholic, Orthodox and &lt;s&gt;a small minority&lt;/s&gt; ''some'' &lt;s&gt;of&lt;/s&gt; Anglican Christians who reject &lt;s&gt;traditional&lt;/s&gt; ''more mainstream'' interpretations of Anglican theology.&quot;  Better? [[User:Fishhead64|Fishhead64]] 03:11, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
::I'm not sure I see the problem with the original phrasing. Does not &quot;traditional interpretation of Anglican theology&quot; strongly imply that the tradition in question is Anglican?

:Part of the problem, on any given issue, is nailing down, &quot;What is the Anglican position?&quot;  Usually, there are multiple answers, and this question is no exception.  An Anglican user has changed the reference to &quot;many Anglicans (especially Anglo-Catholics)...&quot;.  I am comfortable with this and I think it is essentially accurate.  --[[User:Midnite Critic|Midnite Critic]] 05:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

If the &quot;Anglican position&quot; has no relationship to the 39 Articles, why are they printed in the BCP? If they are in no way normative, why do they exist? Why are Old Catholics and the like invited to such ordinations, as some openly state, to &quot;insure&quot; their validity? You demanded a citation for the statement that Anglo-Catholics reject traditioonal interpretations of the Articles, yet you simply accept &quot;MANY Anglicans&quot; because you feel &quot;comfortable&quot;? How many is &quot;many&quot;? The truth is, much as certain Anglicans want to simply cause to be true by stating it that Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican are all pretty much the same thing, it is not the case -- any more, frankly, than it would be true to equate Anglican priests with Lutheran pastors in the other direction. The Anglicans should have their own, separate paragraph -- it is misleading and inaccurate to simply lumnp them in with the Catholics and Orthodox.[[User:HarvardOxon|HarvardOxon]] 05:52, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:I don't think the presence of Old Catholics is to ensure the &quot;validity&quot; of the ordinations in their own eyes, but rather that since the (Roman) Catholic Church does not recognise the validity of the Anglican Apostolic Succession, particularly due to the changes in ordinals in Edward VI's reign, this removes some fo the issues there (since the Old Catholic succession is not disputed). [[User:David Underdown|David Underdown]] 11:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:Harv, the question here is not whether Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy understand the Anglican priesthood to be the same as theirs.  Obviously, Rome denies the validity of Anglican orders, and, in general, the Orthodox position, although stated differently, is pretty much the same as Rome's.  But the question, in this case, has to do with how ANGLICANS see the Anglican priesthood, and the truth is, a large chunk of Anglicanism views the Anglican priesthood in sacerdotal terms, similar or identical to the theologies of priesthood held by Rome and the Orthodox with regard to their own priesthood(s).  --[[User:Midnite Critic|Midnite Critic]] 15:46, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

Traditional Anglican theology, namely that of the BCP and 39 articles, rejects the concept of the &quot;real presence&quot;, and therefore is not the same as Roman Catholic and Orthodox positions. The Anglican theology of priest is based on the New Testament office of presbyter, a pastor or elder of God's church in a locality. The Roman and Orthodox uses of priest are closer to the function of the Aaronic priesthood, namely, the offering of sacrifices for the forgiveness of sins. The [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Sydney Diocese]], of which I'm a part, has recently started using the term Presbyter again to avoid the confusion with the Roman and Orthodox concepts. --[[User:Journeyman|Journeyman]] 23:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:Journeyman, as you must know, the Diocese of Sydney sits squarely at the very bottom of the churchmanship tower and is therefore far from typical of the Anglican Communion as a whole, much of the latter being unwilling, the 39 Articles notwithstanding, to make these distinctions (which are covered in the section of the article dealing with the Anglican Communion and which, in fact, speaks of the use of &quot;presbyter&quot; by some sections of the AC for the reason you cite).  Further, given the role, or lack thereof, of the 39 Articles throughout much of Anglican history in many places, I don't it's quite correct to speak of them in terms of &quot;traditional Anglican theology&quot; and leave it at that.  Newman's attempts to read them in line with Tridentine Roman Catholicism was simply the tip of the iceberg in this regard, and the BCP (1662?), of course, is even more ambiguous.  --[[User:Midnite Critic|Midnite Critic]] 23:52, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:Journeyman, if what you say about the reasoning behind &quot;presbyter&quot; is correct, then it avoids nothing. &quot;Priest&quot; and &quot;presbyter&quot; are the same office for both Romans and Orthodox, and the terms are used interchangeably.

:: Hi guys, yes we realise that us Sydney Anglicans are somewhat unsual in the western Anglican church.

[[User:Midnite Critic|Midnite Critic]] - I don't want to recontest the reformation, suffice to say that I'm saddened that the AC is no longer throughly protestant, as IMU the Anglican church was founded on the principal of there being no priest between God and man, save Jesus Christ. Appologies I didn't see the bit about ''prebyter'' at the end of the paragraph.

:That wasn't a dab notice at all; not all hatnotes are. But it's a misguided complaint. If nothing has been written in this article about pagan priesthoods of either sex, it's simply because no one has done the work. Merely complaining about it as [[User:83d40m]] did, isn't helpful.

== Dress section ==

A lot of speculative and unsupportable claims have been added to this section, some of which are demonstrably false. The earliest documented religions are the Sumerian and Egyptian. For neither of these is there any evidence of development from worship of a &quot;Great Goddess&quot;. Nor can the description of the &quot;transition&quot; to religions dominated by male gods and priests be shown from the available evidence. The evidence for the &quot;Great Goddess&quot; consists solely of the Neolithic &quot;Venus&quot; figurines, the uses of which have not been determined with any certainty, and for which no priest- or shaman-like office can be assumed.

Nor is it clear that the famous serpent-brandishing figure from Crete is a priestess as stated in the caption here. It could well be an image of a goddess, as many sources assert with equally false certainty.

As is, it's more OR than anything else. It needs to be fixed or cut. ''[[User:Csernica|TCC]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Csernica|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Csernica|(contribs)]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:46, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

== Additional Note to This ==

I deleted this section sometime ago but it was added back in. The Great Goddess information, as the person above me mentioned is false. It should be deleted.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|71.227.127.252}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|71.227.127.252}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|71.227.127.252}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|22:15:14, August 19, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==First Image==
I noticed the recent change to the first picture of the article. Shouldn't the primary picture be of a priest performing a priestly duty instead of having a pictures of a sculpture representing a priest? I'm going to change the images back for the reasons, but feel free to discuss it here. [[User:Dgf32|Dgf32]] ([[User talk:Dgf32|talk]]) 12:19, 12 March 2008 (UTC)
: I think that the picture should be of the ordest type of priest, not an actual priest, more neutral, more historic  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/190.21.251.136|190.21.251.136]] ([[User talk:190.21.251.136|talk]]) 23:38, 17 March 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Priests / Priestesses ==

I find that the article, particularly when it comes to the most antique forms of priesthood, places too much emphasis on the role of women. While very interesting, the distinction on whether male or female priests are allowed is not necessarily relevant to understanding the nature, function, and roles of a priest / priestess. If enough people consider it relevant, I suggest considering the creation of a special header at the bottom of the article, in which the gender-related issues of priesthood are discussed, but otherwise, for it to be content-neutral, the article should limit to saying what is the female form of the word 'priest', and perhaps, at most, enlisting the religions that had/have all-male or all-female priests.

:I agree, that struck me as odd. The first time I read through the article I thought, what about ancient religions that didn't have female priests? Are they not important? [[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 19:57, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

== Poorly Written Paragraph ==

I happened upon this article, and it seems to me as if the introduction needs some serious work. There were a number of grammatical and spelling errors, as well as simply unnecessary or odd sentences. For example one entire paragraph digressed about Judaism and Rabbis in the intro, and seemed to be written colloquially. I deleted it, because it also seemed redundant when you look down at the whole separate section on Judaism. Please post here if you disagree, but if you're going to revert then please do a VERY careful reading of it first. The intro as it stood was unacceptable. Here's a copy of the paragraph I deleted:

''[[Judaism]] has male priests, that serve in hereditary positions. They have few but significant religious roles, especially in Orthodox Judaism. However those de-facto officiating in [[Judaism]], both men and women, are called [[Rabbi]]. A [[Rabbi]] is not a priest, he is more of a religious techer or community leader. Rabbi in classical Hebrew means &quot;great&quot;or &quot;distinguished&quot;. In post-Biblical Hebrew it means &quot;master&quot; as opposed to &quot;slave&quot;.''

== &quot;Episcopalian&quot; in subsection title ==

I'm aware that the official title of the church in America is &quot;Episcopal&quot;, used as an adjective, not &quot;Episcopalian&quot;. Hence there is logic in changing the subsection title as someone did. BUT there are cross links to this subsection from CoE / Anglican / Episcopal clergy in many articles. So if you want to change the title, FIX THE LINKS! [[User:Peter coxhead|Peter coxhead]] ([[User talk:Peter coxhead|talk]]) 12:28, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

: I removed &quot;Episcopal&quot; from the subsection title, as &quot;Episcopal&quot; is merely a type of Anglican. Otherwise we might as well say ''Anglican or Church of England&quot;, &quot;Anglican or Church of Ireland&quot;, etc. --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 19:25, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

== removing discussion tag ==

Since it has not attracted any discussion, I am going to remove the tag calling for discussion about separating only Christian priests into a new article. The article is not overly long, therefore, it seems rather inappropriate to elevate only one group to a separate article -- which could be perceived as a cultural bias. It always can be reinstated if editors really want to pursue the topic. _ _ _ _ [[User:83d40m|83d40m]] ([[User talk:83d40m|talk]]) 16:23, 30 December 2010 (UTC)

== question ==

What is the difference between priest and pastor? Someone told me they're different, but I don't quite get it. I figure that priests can be nonchristians, but pastors can't? ([[User:LAz17|LAz17]] ([[User talk:LAz17|talk]]) 06:05, 3 July 2011 (UTC)).

== Feminist article? ==

Yes there was a whole host of female religious leaders in the ancient world but that does that mean that the entire article needs to be feminized?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/107.4.18.85|107.4.18.85]] ([[User talk:107.4.18.85|talk]]) 19:22, 15 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Citation from &quot;International Standard Version&quot; ==

The ISV is a Protestant translation of the Bible, so we would naturally expect their website to espouse a Protestant perspective concerning the Christian priesthood, which most Protestant sects repudiate. My question is, why cite this so obviously biased source when discussing the etymology of &quot;priest&quot; as it appears in the Greek of the New Testament? And why not cite a Catholic or Orthodox source giving their interpretation of the Greek, which would differ? If the most ancient denominations of Christianity have always viewed the term &quot;presbyter&quot; to refer to one who offers the sacrifice of the Eucharist and performs functions similar to those of Levitical priests, is not their understanding also relevant in this section of the article?

There is a violation of neutrality here.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.201.173.75|69.201.173.75]] ([[User talk:69.201.173.75|talk]]) 06:56, 1 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Buddhism ==
In Tibetan Buddhism (as well as a few other flavors, but Tibetan being the most well-known), a Lama is a priest within the context of this article. Is there any reason that this isn't covered? It seems like a big oversight to me, unless there's a specific reason. [[User:Canine virtuoso|Canine virtuoso]] ([[User talk:Canine virtuoso|talk]]) 23:21, 7 June 2012 (UTC)</text>
