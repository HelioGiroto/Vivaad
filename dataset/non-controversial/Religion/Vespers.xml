[[File:BenedictineVespers.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monk]]s singing Vespers on [[Holy Saturday]]]]
'''Vespers''' is the sunset evening [[prayer]] service in the [[Roman Catholic|Western Catholic]], [[Byzantine Catholic|Eastern (Byzantine) Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheran]] [[Liturgy|liturgies]] of the [[canonical hours]].  The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἑσπέρα and the [[Latin]] ''vesper'', meaning &quot;evening.&quot;  It is also referred to in the Anglican tradition as [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] or [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]]. The term is also used in some [[Protestant]] denominations (such as the [[Presbyterian Church]] or [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]) to describe evening services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cathedral.vancouver.bc.ca/worship/evensong.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christchurchdeerpark.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==
===Roman Rite Catholic===
[[File:Adventvespers.jpg|thumb|200px|Incensing During Solemn Advent Vespers]]
The general structure of the [[Roman Rite]] Catholic service of vespers is as follows:

* Vespers opens with the singing or chanting of the words ''Deus, in adiutorium meum intende. Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Alleluia.'' (O God, come to my assistance. O Lord, make haste to help me. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end. Amen. Alleluia.) (&quot;Alleluia&quot; is omitted during Lent.)
* The appointed [[hymn]] (from the [[Liturgical books of the Roman Rite|hymnarium]]) is then sung;
* The [[Latin Psalters#Schemata|appointed psalmody]] is then sung: in the liturgy in general use since 1970 there are two [[psalm]]s and a New Testament [[canticle]], while in the older tradition, five psalms are sung instead. Each psalm (and canticle) concludes with a [[doxology]] (Gloria Patri) and is preceded and followed by an [[antiphon]].
* After the psalms, there is a reading from the Bible.
* Following the reading, there is a short responsory consisting of a verse, a response, the first half only of the [[Gloria Patri]], and then the verse again.
* Then the participants sing the ''[[Magnificat]]'' — the [[canticle]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] from the [[Gospel of Luke]] I:46-55. The ''Magnificat'' is always preceded and followed by an [[antiphon]].
* The preces (prayers) are then said, followed by the Our Father, and then the closing prayer (oratio).
* The office is frequently followed by [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]].

===Eastern Orthodox===&lt;!-- a link from the article [[Phos Hilaron]] points here --&gt;
In the [[Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], there are three forms of Vespers: Great Vespers, Daily Vespers and Small Vespers. Great Vespers is the form served on Sundays and major [[feast day]]s (those of [[Polyeleos]] rank or above) when it may be celebrated alone or as part of an [[All-Night Vigil]], or as the commencement of the [[Divine Liturgy]], or on a few special occasions, ''e.g.'', Good Friday or Pascha afternoon. Daily Vespers is the form served on other days when Great Vespers is not served. Small Vespers is a very abbreviated form of the service which is celebrated only on the afternoon before an All-Night Vigil.

Since the liturgical day begins at sunset, Vespers is the first service of the day, and the hymns of Vespers introduce the themes of the upcoming day.

====Great Vespers====
[[File:Eastern vespers entrance.jpg|200px|thumb|Orthodox [[priest]] and [[deacon]] making the [[Entrance (Liturgical)|Entrance]] with the [[censer]] at Great Vespers.]]

The general structure of the service is as follows (psalm numbers are according to the [[Septuagint]]):
* Vespers opens with a [[blessing]] by the [[priest]] and then &quot;Come, let us worship ...&quot;; when part of an All-Night Vigil, the blessing that normally begins [[matins]] is used; when part of the Divine Liturgy, the blessing that is part thereof is used.
*[[Psalm 104|Proemial Psalm]] (Psalm 103 (104)): &quot;Bless the Lord, O my soul; O Lord my God, Thou hast been magnified exceedingly...&quot;.
* The [[Ektenia|Great Litany]] (also called the &quot;Litany of Peace&quot;)
* A selection of psalms, called a [[kathisma]] is sung. On Saturday evening, it is the First Kathisma (Psalms 1-8).
* &quot;Lord I have Cried&quot; (Psalms 140 (141), 141 (142), 129 (130), and 116 (117)) is chanted in the tone of the week. Starting with the last two verses of Psalm 141 (142), [[stichera]] (stanzas) about the feast day (or Christ's resurrection on a Saturday evening) are chanted alternately with the verses.
* The [[Entrance (Liturgical)|Entrance]] is made with the [[censer]]
* The hymn ''[[Phos Hilaron]]'' (&quot;O Gladsome Light&quot;) is sung.
* The [[Prokeimenon]] is chanted.
* On feast days, there are three or more readings from the [[Old Testament]], called ''Paroemia'' (&quot;Parables&quot;).
* The prayer &quot;[[Vouchsafe, O Lord]]&quot;, is read.
* The Litany of Fervent Supplication
* On major feast days, a [[Litiy]] will be served at this point. The clergy and the cantors will process to the back of the church in front of an [[icon]] of the feast or [[saint]] being commemorated. After the cantors chant hymns pertaining to the feast, the deacon or priest will read a litany with several long peititions, to which the cantors respond with ''[[Kyrie eleison]]'' (&quot;Lord, Have Mercy&quot;) many times. The priest ends with a long prayer invoking the intercessions of the saints and the [[Theotokos]].
* The [[Aposticha]] are chanted. These are verses that teach about the feast day (or on a Saturday evening, Christ's resurrection).
* The ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'', the [[Canticle]] of [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|St. Simeon]] (&quot;Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace...&quot;) ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|2:29-32|KJV}}), is read.
* The [[Apolytikion|Apolytikia]] ([[Troparion|troparia]] of the day) are chanted. If it is an All-Night Vigil on Saturday night, the hymn &quot;Rejoice, O Virgin [[Theotokos]]&quot; is chanted instead.

[[File:Litie1.jpg|thumb|Table set with five loaves, wheat, wine and oil for [[artoklassia]].]]

* On major feast days, the [[artoklasia]] is performed, at which the priest will bless [[artos|five loaves]] of bread which have been prepared in the center of the church, together with [[wheat]], [[wine]] and [[oil]]. These will be distributed to the faithful later in the service (if it is an [[All-Night Vigil]]). Then [[Psalm]] 33 (34) is read up to the verse &quot;O fear the Lord, all ye his saints; for there is no want to them that fear him.&quot; The next verse &quot;Rich men have turned poor and gone hungry, but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good thing&quot; is chanted.
* The [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] is given by the priest. If it is an All-Night Vigil this is a simple blessing by the priest; otherwise, it is the full dismissal sequence.

On strict fast days when food and drink are prohibited before vespers, ''e.g.'', [[Christmas Eve]], the [[Annunciation]] when it falls on a weekday of great lent, or [[Holy Saturday]], Vespers is joined to the [[Divine Liturgy]], functioning in place of the [[typica]] as the framework of the hymns of the [[Liturgy of the Catechumens]]. After the readings from the [[Old Testament]], the [[Trisagion]] is chanted, followed by the [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]], and the [[Divine Liturgy]] proceeds normally from that point. On these occasions, as at other times the Gospel is read at vespers, the Little Entrance is made with the [[Gospel Book]] instead of the censer.

The [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] always is similarly combined with vespers, with the first half of Vespers (up to and including the [[Old Testament]] readings) making up a significant portion of the service.

===Oriental Orthodox===

Also called the Raising of Incense, Vespers is an introduction and preparation for
the Liturgy, consisting of a collection of prayers, praises and
Thanksgiving prayers which request the Lord's blessings
upon the sacramental service. &lt;ref&gt;http://tasbeha.org/content/books/Spirituality_of_Rites_Bishop_Mettaous/#21&lt;/ref&gt;
This is true for the Coptic Orthodox Church; use of the term and order of services are somewhat different in the Ethiopian, Syrian, and the other Oriental Orthodox Churches.

The rites of Vespers in the Coptic Orthodox Church are as follows:

# '''The Thanksgiving Prayer''' - As with all Coptic Orthodox services, Vespers first thanks God &quot;for everything, concerning everything, and in everything&quot;
# The Verses of the Cymbals
# The Prayer for the Departed
# '''The Doxologies''' - commemorating the saints of the church and the liturgical season of the church
# The Creed
# The Prayer for the Gospel
# The Reading of the Psalm and Gospel
# The Absolution, Conclusion, and Blessing

===Vespers in other Christian churches and religious bodies===
Since its inception, the [[Anglican Communion]] has maintained an evening office, which is called [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (or ''Evensong''). There are prescribed forms of the service in Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer|prayer book]]. A similar form of the service is found in the [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]] section of [[The Lutheran Hymnal]]. The [[Anglican Breviary]] contains Vespers in English according to the pre-1970 Roman Rite. For information on that service, see above, as in the Roman Breviary.

Daily office books that conform to the historic structure of Vespers have also been published by the Pilgrim Press ([[The New Century Hymnal|The New Century Psalter]]) and Westminster John Knox Press (Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer). Both publishing houses are affiliated with churches in the [[Reformed]] tradition.

From its traditional usage, the term '''Vespers''' has come to be used more broadly for various evening services of other churches, some of which model their evening services on the traditional Roman Catholic form. [[Presbyterians]] and [[Methodists]], as well as congregationalist religious bodies such as [[Unitarian Universalism]], often include congregational singing, readings, and a period of silent meditation, contemplation, or prayer.  

Some regular community vespers services are completely areligious (or at least are not sponsored by any church) and serve simply as a time for quiet contemplation in the evening hours.

In addition, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, synagogues in the Classical Reform Tradition sometimes referred to their Friday evening worship services as &quot;vespers&quot;.  Nowadays, such services are instead called ''kabbalat shabbat'', which means &quot;welcoming the Sabbath&quot;.

== Historical development of Vespers in the Latin Church before the Second Vatican Council ==
''This section incorporates information from the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1917.  References to [[psalms]] follow the numbering system of the [[Septuagint]], and said in the [[Latin]] of the [[Vulgate]].''

=== Vespers in the 6th century ===
In the sixth century the Office of Vespers in the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]] was almost the same as it has been throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and up to the present day. In a document of unquestionable authority of that period the [[Canonical hours|Office]] is described as follows: The evening hour, or ''vespertina synaxis'', is composed of four [[psalm]]s, a ''capitulum'', a response, a [[hymn]], a versicle, a [[canticle]] from the [[Gospel]], [[litany]] (''[[Kyrie|Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison]]''), ''[[The Lord's Prayer|Pater]]'' with the ordinary finale, ''oratio'', or prayer, and dismissal (''[[Rule of St. Benedict|Regula Sancti Benedicti]]'', xvii). The [[psalm]]s recited are taken from the series of psalms from Pss. 109 to 147 (with the exception of the groups 117 to 127 and 133 to 142); Pss. 138, 143, 144 are each divided into two portions, whilst the Pss. 115 and 116 are united to form one. This disposition is almost the same as that of the &quot;''Ordo Romanus''&quot;, except that the number of psalms recited is five instead of four. They are taken, however, from the series 109 to 147. Here, too, we find the ''capitulum'', versicle, and canticle of the &quot;''[[Magnificat]]''&quot;. The [[hymn]] is a more recent introduction in the Roman Vespers; the finale (litanies, ''Pater'', versicles, prayers) seems all to have existed from this epoch as in the [[Benedictine]] ''cursus''. Like the other hours, therefore, Vespers is divided into two parts; the psalmody, or singing of the psalms, forming the first part, and the ''capitulum'' and ''formulæ'' the second. Vesper time varied according to the season between the tenth hour (4 p.m.) and the twelfth (6 p.m.). As a matter of fact it was no longer the evening hour, but the sunset hour, so that it was celebrated before the day had departed and consequently before there was any necessity for artificial light (''Regula S. Benedicti'', xli). This is a point to be noted, as it was an innovation. Before this epoch this evening ''synaxis'' was celebrated with all the torches alight. The reason of this is that [[St Benedict]] introduced in the cursus, another hour—that of [[Compline]]—which was prescribed to be celebrated in the evening, and which might be considered as a kind of doubling of the Office of Lucernarium.

===Origins===
The [[Rule of St. Benedict]] was written about 530-43 and represents the Office of Vespers drawn up in the manner shown above. Much earlier than this we find an evening Office corresponding to both that of Vespers and that of Compline. Its name varies. In St. Benedict we find the name ''vespera'' which has prevailed, whence the French word ''vêpres'' and the English vespers. [[John Cassian]] calls it ''Vespertina synaxis'', or ''Vespertina solemnitas'' (P. L., XLIX, 88-9). The name, however, by which it was most widely known during that period was ''Lucernalis'' or ''Lucernaria hora'' (l. c., 126). This name is characteristic. It was so called because at this hour a number of candles were lighted, not only to give light, but also for symbolical purposes. The &quot;''Peregrinatio''&quot;, which gives the liturgical order as practised at [[Jerusalem]] and the date of which is probably the 4th century, calls it ''Lichnicon''. This is the [[Latin]] transcription of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''lychnikon'', which corresponds to the word ''Lucernarium'' (''cf.'' [[Ambrosian Rite|AMBROSIAN LITURGY AND RITE]]). The author tells us that this Office took place at the tenth hour (four o'clock in the evening); it is really the ''Office des lumières'', i.e. of the lights; it was celebrated in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]; all the lamps and torches of the church were lighted, making, as the author says, &quot;an infinite light&quot;. The Lucernal psalms were sung, after which followed the recitation of the supplication and commemorations or [[Litany|litanies]], then the prayers, and finally the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] and dismissal. In the &quot;[[Antiphonary of Bangor]]&quot;, an Irish document of the 6th century, Vespers are called ''hora duodecima'', which corresponds to six o'clock in the evening, or ''hora incensi'', or again ''ad cereum benedicendum''. All these names are interesting to note. The ''hora incensi'' recalls the custom of burning incense at this hour, while at the same time the candles were lighted. The term ''ad cereum benedicendum'' presents a still greater interest because it reminds us that the ceremony of the lights at Vespers was symbolic and very solemn. In [[Prudentius]] (4th century) we find a hymn entitled &quot;''Ad incensum lucernæ''&quot; which, according to some critics, would appear to have been composed for the hour of the ''Lucernarium'' (Arevalo, &quot;''Prudenti carmina''&quot;, I, 124, ed. 1788; ''cf.'' also Cabrol, &quot;''Les églises de Jérusalem, la discipline et la liturgie au IVe siècle''&quot;, 47). Others see in this an allusion to the ceremony of the [[paschal candle]]. However, the ''Lucernarium'' may have had, at that time, some analogy with the ceremony of [[Holy Saturday]], and the hymn could thus be adapted to one or the other. In the &quot;Old Gallican Sacramentary&quot; (Thomasi, &quot;''Opera''&quot;, VI, 395) we find for Holy Saturday an ''oratio ad duodecima'', designed to celebrate the light as well as the Resurrection, which would seem thus to favour our hypothesis. [[St. Basil]] also speaks of a hymn being sung at the moment when the torches were lighted, doubtless the famous hymn--&quot;''[[Lumen Hilare Sanctae Gloriae]]''&quot; (''cf.'' Cabrol, l. c., 47-8).

Vespers, then, was the most solemn Office of the day and was composed of the psalms called ''Lucernales'' (Psalm 140 is called ''psalmus lucernalis'' by the [[Apostolic Constitutions]], VIII, xxxv; ''cf.'' II, lix; also Cabrol, l. c.). The &quot;''Peregrinatio''&quot; does not mention the number of psalms sung at this hour, but [[John Cassian|Cassian]], who, a short time after the &quot;''Peregrinatio''&quot;, describes this Office as it was celebrated by the [[monk]]s of [[Egypt]], says they recited twelve psalms as at [[Vigils]] ([[Matins]]). Then two lessons were read as at Vigils, one from the Old, and the other from the [[New Testament]]. Each psalm was followed by a short prayer (P. L., XLIX, 83-4, 88-9). For the rest Cassian agrees with the &quot;''Peregrinatio''&quot;. He says the Office was recited towards five or six o'clock and that all the lights were lighted. This evening ''synaxis'' is looked upon as a souvenir of the evening sacrifice of the Old Law. The use of incense, candles, and other lights would seem to suggest the [[Jewish]] rites which accompanied the evening sacrifice ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 29:39; [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 28:4; Psalm 140:2; [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 9:21; [[1 Chronicles]] 23:30; ''cf.'' Haneberg, &quot;''Die relig. Alterth. der Bibel''&quot;, Munich, 1869, p.&amp;nbsp;362). It may thus be seen that the ''Lucernarium'' was, together with [[Vigils]], the most important part of the Offices of the day, being composed of almost the same elements as the latter, at least in certain regions. Its existence in the fourth century is also confirmed by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose]], [[St. Basil]], [[Ephrem the Syrian|St. Ephraem]], and, a little later, by several councils in [[Gaul]] and [[Spain]], and by the various [[Monastery|monastic]] rules (see texts in Bäumer-Biron, l. c., 78, 80, 118-27, 188-98, 208, ''etc.''). The &quot;[[Apostolic Constitutions]]&quot; (VIII, xxi, 34, 35) describe it in almost the same terms as the &quot;''Peregrinatio''&quot;. Before the fourth century we find allusions to the evening prayer in the earlier Fathers, [[Pope Clement I|Clement I of Rome]] (''Clemens Romanus''), [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], [[Origen]], the Canons of [[Hippolytus (writer)|St. Hippolytus]], [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian]] (for texts see Bäumer-Biron, l. c., I, 20 sqq., 73-4, 76, 78). [[Pliny the Younger]], in his famous letter at the beginning of the 2nd century, speaks of liturgical reunions of the Christians in the morning and in the evening: &quot;''coetus antelucani et vespertini''&quot; (Ep., x, 97). Vespers is, therefore, together with [[Vigils]], the most ancient Office known in the Church.

=== Office of Vespers in the Middle Ages: Variations ===
We have already remarked that the institution of the Office of [[Compline]] transformed the ''Lucernarium'' by taking from it something of its importance and symbolism, the latter at the same time losing its original sense. We have seen that [[St. Benedict]] calls it only ''Vespera'', the name which has prevailed over that of ''Lucernarium'' (''cf.'' Ducange, &quot;''Glossarium med. et inf. lat.''&quot;, ''s.v. Vesperae''). The [[Gallican rite|Gallican Liturgy]], the [[Mozarabic Rite|Mozarabic Liturgy]], and, to a certain extent, the [[Ambrosian rite|Milanese]], have preserved the ''Lucernarium'' (''cf.'' Bäumer-Biron, l. c., 358). The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] retains the &quot;''Lumen hilare''&quot; and some other traces of the ancient ''Lucernarium'' in the Offices of Vespers and Compline (''cf.'' Smith, &quot;Dict. Christ. Antiq.&quot;, ''s.v.'' Office, Divine). In the Rule of [[Columbanus|St. Columbanus]], dated about 590, Vespers still has twelve psalms, amongst which are Pss. cxii and cxiii, the [[Gradual psalms]], Pss. cxix ''sqq.'' (''cf.'' Gougaud, &quot;''Les chrétientés celtiques''&quot;, 309; &quot;''Dict. d'arch. chrét. et de liturgie''&quot;, ''s.v. Celtique'', 3015). The &quot;[[Antiphonary of Bangor]]&quot;, a document of [[Ireland|Irish]] origin, gives for Vespers Ps. cxii and also the &quot;''[[Gloria in Excelsis]]''&quot;. For modifications since the 12th century, ''cf.'' Bäumer-Biron, l. c., II, 54 ''sqq.''

=== Changes as of 1917 ===
The Decree &quot;''Divino afflatu''&quot; (November 1, 1911) involves important changes in the old [[Roman Rite]] Office. There is an entire rearrangement of the [[psalm]]s (see [[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]]) with new ones appointed for each day of the week. These psalms are to be recited with their [[antiphon]]s, not only at the ''Office de tempore'' (Sundays and ''[[Feria|feriæ]]'') but also on [[religious festival|feast]]s of a lesser rite than doubles of the second class, that is to say, on simples, semidoubles (double minors), and double majors. On feasts which are doubles of the second class and a fortiori of the first class, as well as on feasts of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], the Holy Angels, and [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], the psalms are proper to the feast as heretofore. On all feasts, of whatever rite, the second part of Vespers, that is, the ''capitulum'', [[hymn]], [[antiphon]] of the &quot;''[[Magnificat]]''&quot;, is taken from the Sanctorale. On semi-doubles and those of a lesser rite the suffrages are now reduced to a single antiphon and orison which is common to all the saints heretofore commemorated, whilst the preces (&quot;''[[Psalm 51|Miserere]]''&quot; and versicles) formerly imposed on the greater feriæ are now suppressed.

===Structure of Vespers: 1917-1969===
The office of Vespers in general use before 1970 continues to be used today by those adhering to the Roman Rite as in 1962 or to earlier versions. The structure of Vespers prior to 1970 is as follows: 

* Vespers begins with the singing or chanting of the opening versicles ''Deus, in adiutorium meum intende. Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Alleluia.'' (O God, come to my assistance. O Lord, make haste to help me. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, both now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia.) From [[Septuagesima]] until [[Easter]], ''Laus tibi Domine, Rex aeternae gloriae'' (Praise be to Thee O Lord, King of eternal glory) replaces ''Alleluia''.
* Five [[psalms]] are sung, and the [[Gloria Patri]] is sung after each psalm.  Each psalm is preceded and followed with an [[antiphon]].
* The Little Chapter, a short biblical verse, is read.
* The hymn, which varies according to season and feast, is sung, followed by its versicle and response.
* The ''[[Magnificat]]'', preceded and followed with an [[antiphon]], is then sung.
* The preces are then said on certain greater ferias.
* The collect of the day is said, followed by commemorations of any concurring feasts according to the rubrics.
* The office ends with the [[Marian Antiphon]], which varies by season.
* The office is frequently followed by [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]].

=== Symbolism: the Hymns ===
Notwithstanding the changes brought about in the course of time, Vespers still remains the great and important Office of the evening. As already pointed out, it recalls the ''sacrificium vespertinum'' of the [[Torah|Old Law]]. In the same manner as the night is consecrated to God by the Office of the [[Vigils|Vigil]], so also is the end of the day by Vespers. It terminates, as [[Matins]] formerly terminated, and [[Lauds]] at present terminates, by a lection, or reading, from the [[Gospel]], or ''canticum evangelii'', which, for Vespers, is always the &quot;''[[Magnificat]]''&quot;. This is one of the characteristic traits of Vespers, one of the liturgical elements which this particular Office has retained in almost all regions and at all times. There are, however, a few exceptions, as in some liturgies the &quot;''Magnificat''&quot; is sung at Lauds (''cf.'' Cabrol in &quot;''Dict. d'arch. et de liturgie''&quot;, ''s.v. Cantiques évangéliques''). This place of honour accorded so persistently to the [[Magnificat|canticle of Mary]] from such remote antiquity is but one of the many, and of the least striking, proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] in the Church. The psalms used at Vespers have been selected, from time immemorial, from Pss. cix to cxlvii, with the exception of Ps. cxviii, which on account of its unusual length does not square with the others, and is consequently ordinarily divided up into parts and recited at the little hours. Pss. i to cviii are consecrated to Matins and Lauds, whilst the three last psalms, cxlviii to cl, belong invariably to Lauds. The series of hymns consecrated to Vespers in the Roman [[Breviary]] also form a class apart and help to give us some hints as to the symbolism of this [[Canonical hours|hour]]. The hymns are very ancient, dating probably, for the most part, from the 6th century. They have this particular characteristic—they are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the Creation, according to the day of the week, thus: the first, &quot;''Lucis Creator optime''&quot;, on Sunday, to the creation of light; the second, on Monday, to the separation of the earth and the waters; the third, on Tuesday, to the creation of the plants; the fourth, on Wednesday, to the creation of the sun and moon; the fifth, on Thursday, to the creation of the fish; the sixth, on Friday, to the creation of the beasts of the earth; Saturday is an exception, the hymn on that day being in honour of the Blessed [[Trinity]], because of the Office of Sunday then commencing.

=== Importance ===
We can now see the great importance which the Church appears to have attached always to the Office of Vespers. It is the only one which has remained popular (excepting, of course, the [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Sacrifice]] which we do not consider here as an Office) among Roman Catholics up to the present day. [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]], on account of the hour at which they are celebrated, have always been more or less inaccessible to the faithful; likewise the [[Little Hours|little hours]], except, perhaps, [[Terce]], which serves as an introduction to the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Vespers, on the contrary, occupies a privileged place towards the end of the day. On Sundays it is the Office most likely to bring the faithful together in church for the second time and thus becomingly completes the Divine Service for that day. This is why, in the majority of Catholic countries, the custom of Sunday Vespers has been for so long a time, and is still, maintained. It is quite conformable to tradition, moreover, to invest this Office with a particular solemnity. The Vesper [[psalm]]s, as well as the hymns and antiphons, are well calculated to edify the faithful. Lastly, the ancient custom of having a [[lection]] or reading from the Old, or [[New Testament]], or from the homilies of the [[Fathers of the Church|Fathers]], might well in certain cases and to a certain extent be re-adopted, or serve as the subject-matter for the [[sermon]] which is sometimes delivered at this service.

===Solemn Vespers before the Second Vatican Council===
On weekdays that are not major feasts Vespers features hardly any ceremonies and the celebrant wears the usual [[choir dress]]. However, on Sundays and greater feasts Vespers may be solemn. Solemn Vespers differ in that the celebrant wears the [[cope]], he is assisted by assistants also in copes, [[incense]] is used, and two [[acolyte]]s, a [[thurifer]], and at least one master of ceremonies are needed. On ordinary Sundays only two assistants are needed while on greater feasts four or six assistants may be used. The celebrant and assistants vest in the [[surplice]] and the cope, which is of the color of the day. The celebrant sits at the sedile, in front of which is placed a lectern, covered with a cloth in the color of the day. The assistants sit on benches or stools facing the [[altar]], or if there are two assistants, they may sit at the sedile next to the celebrant (the first assistant in the place of the [[deacon]] and the second assistant in place of the [[subdeacon]]).

The celebrant and assistants follow the acolytes into the church wearing the [[biretta]]. Upon arriving in the [[sanctuary]] the acolytes place their candles on the lowest altar step, after which they are extinguished.  The celebrant and assistants kneel on the lowest step and recite the ''Aperi Domine'' silently, after which they go to their places and recite the ''Pater noster'' and ''Ave Maria'' silently. A curious practice which exists from ancient times is the intoning of the [[antiphons]] and [[psalms]] to the celebrant. The rubrics presuppose that the first assistant or cantors will intone all which the celebrant must sing by singing it to him first in a soft voice after which the celebrant sings it again aloud. The five antiphons and psalms are sung with the first assistant intoning the antiphons and the cantors intoning the psalms. During the singing of the psalms all sit. After the psalms, the acolytes relight their candles and carry them to each side of the lectern for the chapter. The assistants follow, standing facing each other in front of the lectern. The celebrant then sings the chapter, after which all return to their places. The first assistant intones the hymn to the celebrant, and all stand while the hymn is sung. The first assistant intones the ''[[Magnificat]]'' to the celebrant, who sings the first line aloud. The celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar, and the altar is then incensed as at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] while the first two assistants hold the ends of the cope.  Other altars in the church may be incensed as well. The first assistant then incenses the celebrant, after which the thurifer incenses the others as at Mass. If there are commemorations, the acolytes and assistants again go to the lectern as described above for the chapter. The choir sings the antiphons, the cantors sing the versicles, and the celebrant sings the [[collect]]s. After all commemorations, the celebrant sings ''Dominus vobiscum'', the cantor sings ''Benedicamus Domino'', and the celebrant sings ''Fidelium animae...''.  The [[Marian antiphon]] is said in the low voice. Especially in English-speaking countries, [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]] often follows Solemn Vespers.

==Musical settings of Vespers==

The psalms and hymns of the Vespers service have attracted the interest of many composers, including [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and [[Anton Bruckner]]. ([[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s &quot;[[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|Vespers]]&quot; is really a setting of the Eastern Orthodox [[all-night vigil]].)
