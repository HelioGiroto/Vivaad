==Comment==
I would strongly recommend to change that picture of (supposedly) Jesus Christ appearing on all topics of Christianity. You would do Christianity a great favor...([[Special:Contributions/76.115.179.116|76.115.179.116]] ([[User talk:76.115.179.116|talk]]) 06:21, 10 March 2012 (UTC))

== Flawed definition ==

&quot;''Any Western Christian who is not an adherent of a Catholic, Anglican, or Eastern Church.''&quot; - IMO this is flawed as it possibly includes [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], neither of which are considered protestant, but both of which are arguably Christian movements (granted, this is debateable, but that's precisely the point: if it's up for debate, we shouldn't leave the text as ambiguous). [[User:Magog the Ogre|Magog the Ogre]] ([[User talk:Magog the Ogre|talk]]) 19:47, 16 April 2012 (UTC)

I have never heard Anglicans (called Episcopalians in US) not referred to as Protestants, they are generally referred to as mainline Protestants. Also &quot;Eastern Church&quot; seems a weak catch-all phrase for a surprisingly large number of denominations that were not answerable to the papacy long before Martin Luther shows up. I also agree that some mention should be made that [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] are often excluded from this term by those using it.

{{Reflist}}

:This list has a number of serious problems. Firstly, it mixed up denominational groupings and denominations - it has [[Presbyterian]] (rather than, e.g.,[[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]]) but then it has ''both'' [[Methodist]] and [[United Methodist]]. The current list is just denominational families, which is better, although the heading probably should be adjusted to reflect this. Secondly, some of the foundings are dubious. I know there is a citation here, but the key thing is that they were not founded in the same way. There is no doubt that Luther can be described as the founder of Lutheranism, but 1517 is a very arbitrary date. But in what sense is Smyth the &quot;founder&quot; of the Baptists? He is merely the first pastor on historical record. Thirdly, in what sense is [[Four Square Gospel]] a &quot;main&quot; denomination? Doesn't it just come under [[Pentecostal]]? Several other groups, like the [[Seventh Day Baptists]], cannot be called &quot;main&quot; either. Fourthly, the list seems to have a particularly American focus (possibly reflecting the source) which is inappropriate here.

== non-Trinitarian groups==

These have been included here as Protestant. I think this is worth some discussion within the article, as they would not be universally regarded as protestant. [[User:Ordinary Person|Ordinary Person]] ([[User talk:Ordinary Person|talk]]) 08:32, 12 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
