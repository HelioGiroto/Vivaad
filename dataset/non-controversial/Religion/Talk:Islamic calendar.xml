==Reason for prohibition of intercalation of months==
Does anyone have a good explanation as to why this was forbidden by Mohammed?  Was it to reduce the importance of the Kalammas?
----
Why would intercalation be necessary?  There doesn't seem to be any particular reason for that.

==Conversions==
What is the present year number in the Islamic calendar? 1379? A sentence in the text like the year 2000 in the Gregorian calendar was 1378 (or what?) in the Islamic might be good. 

Of course, when does the Islamic calendar change years? Certainly this changes in respect to the Gregorian calendar as the Islamic months process in relation to the Gregorian. So maybe a page that said 2000 in the Gregorian was 1378 in the Islamic until Sept. (or whenever) and was 5709 (or whatever) in Hebrew until .... etc. with other calendars. Anyone know what these years are? 
----
The present year (beginning in 2001 AD) is 1422. This is larger than 1378, because the year always has just 12 lunar months and so is about 11 days shorter than the [[:Gregorian Calendar|Gregorian Calendar]] year.
----
The present year is 1430 AH and began in December 2008.  Lunar years are either 354 or 355 days long, which means that they are 10-12 days shorter than the solar year.

This article and the article [[July 16]] both state that the first day of the first year of the Islamic calendar corresponds to July 16, 622. Is that July 16 Julian or Gregorian? (At the time, the Gregorian calendar now in general use had not been developed, and the only contemporaneous &quot;July 16&quot; was actually the Julian one, which would have been a week or so off from the Gregorian count, I think. --[[User:Haruo|Haruo]] ([[User talk:Haruo|talk]]) 05:36, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

Actually the difference would be only 3 days at that time. Dates before 15 October 1582 Gregorian are conventionally given in the Julian Calendar and so this can be assumed unless specified otherwise. The epoch date is thus July 19 in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. [[User:Karl Palmen|Karl]] ([[User talk:Karl Palmen|talk]])
----
The corresponding year that would be 1387-1388 would be from the [[Iranian calendar]]. [[User:ArdClose|ArdClose]] ([[User talk:ArdClose|talk]]) 19:31, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

== Islamic Calendar ==

Islamic Calendar is used only for Ramzan Fasting, Haj pilgrimage and Eid festivities. For all other purposes Gregorian calendar is used.
Quran regards moon and the sun merely as sign for counting time and days
as follows:

002.189 
They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage....

010.005 
It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light 
(of beauty), and measured out stages for her; that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His Signs in detail, for those who understand.

At the dawn of Islam there were no printed calendars, no watches and the concept of hours and minutes developed in some 600 years later. The dates 
were counted by the year of elephants by watching moon and time by the 
movement of sun. According to old traditions the advice of Prophet Mohammed
was as follows:

(1)	Narrated Ibn 'Umar: The Prophet said, &quot;We are an illiterate nation; we neither write, nor know accounts. The month is like this and this, i.e. sometimes of 29 days and sometimes of thirty days.&quot;
(2)	Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet or Abu-l-Qasim said, &quot;Start fasting on seeing the crescent (of Ramadan), and give up fasting on seeing the crescent (of Shawwal), and if the sky is overcast (and you cannot see it), complete thirty days of Sha'ban.&quot;  


Around 9th centuries Muslim astronomers mapped movement of stars, sun and moon and found that the moon is about one fourth of the size of the earth and moves around Earth at an average distance of 238,857 miles, and completes one revolution around Earth in a little more than 27 days. And deep in West of Mecca the moon tends to appear a day earlier and deep in East a day or two later. As Islam had spread in different continents and the means of communications were not swift, it was difficult to determine as to when the 
new moon was sighted at Mecca. Therefore, Fatmid Caliphs and Imam prescribed a calendar in 10th century developed by the great astronomer Albairooni that dispensed with the need for actual moon sighting in order to maintain uniformity in Islamic world. 

That calendar is still used in Egypt, Syria and most Arab world as also Bohra community in India and Pakistan and they do not see any need for sighting moon even for Ramzan. But Saudi bigots insist that the calendar should be adjusted every month based on moon sighting in Mecca. And orthodox Ulemas in India and Pakistan and North America insist that fasting and Eid  must be based on moon sighting in their own country. 

Bigoted Ulemas fail to realize that nowhere in Holy Quran the actual sighting of moon has been made mandatory and the Traditions (Hadiths) do not prescribe a categorical practice for all times to come and that advice was meant for Meccans of that time who used to count time and dates by movement of moon and sun and the calendars and wathces were not available to them. That is why
in many Muslim communities the calendar is adjusted every month and at least
two to three different sets are followed in different countries. The Muslims
who do not believe in the monthly adjustment are in minority.  

Shah N. Khan

:The moon sighting should not be characterized as a misguided notion of &quot;bigoted ulemas&quot; or &quot;saudi bigots&quot;.   Numerous verses in the Qur'an (6:4, 3:32, 3:132, 4:69, 47:33, etc.) command muslims to obey the messenger (Muhammed).  To muslims, the Qur'an mandates that the verbal and practical traditions of Muhammed are executable directives transmitted through Muhammed to the believers.  

:Muslim #2379 states &quot;Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Observe fast on sighting it (the new moon) and break (fast) on sighting it (the new moon), but if the sky is cloudy for you, then complete the number (of thirty).&quot;  Muhammed did not qualify this statement with a time constraint, or say &quot;unless you can calculate it's appearance&quot;.  

:Muslim #2391 states &quot;Kuraib reported that Umm Fadl, daughter of Harith, sent him (Fadl, i. e. her son) to Mu'awiya in Syria. I (Fadl) arrived in Syria, and did the needful for her. It was there in Syria that the month of Ramadan commenced. I saw the new moon (of Ramadan) on Friday. I then came back to Medina at the end of the month. Abdullah b. 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) asked me (about the new moon of Ramadan) and said: When did you see it? I said.: We saw it on the night of Friday. He said: (Did) you see it yourself? -I said: Yes, and the people also saw it and they observed fast and Mu'awiya also observed fast, whereupon he said: But we saw it on Saturday night. So we would continue to observe fast till we complete thirty (lasts) or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal). I said: Is the sighting of the moon by Mu'awiya not valid for you? He said: No; this is how the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has commanded us.&quot;  This practice demonstrates that different localities may begin or end a month based on the actual sighting at that locality.  There is no requirement that all muslim regions are uniform with respect to the calender.  Or, that every nation must adapt to meccan time.

:Abu Dawud #2331 states &quot;Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar: Husayn ibn al-Harith al-Jadli from the tribe of Jadilah Qays said: The governor of Mecca delivered a speech and said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) took a pledge from us that we should perform the rites of hajj after sighting the moon. If we do not sight it and two reliable persons bear witness (that it was sighted), we should perform the rites of hajj on the basis of their witness.&quot;  

:There are no known utterences from Muhammed that prescribe, or support, computational predictions of astronomical events.  Nor are there any prescriptions from Muhammed that moon sightings are only for meccans or Saudis.  Modern dependence on computational methodologies is not consistent with the islamic tradition that religion should be simple, even for an uneducated, illiterate believer.  While many scholars do support the use of computational techniques to ease the practice of the religion, there are no mandates by anyone that requires these techniques to be used.  The same scholars that support computational techniques also support moon sighting.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Abdullah PBA|Abdullah PBA]] ([[User talk:Abdullah PBA|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abdullah PBA|contribs]]) 05:27, 28 June 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Fictional intercalary month==
What's this nonesense about abolishing a fictional intercalary month? There is no historical source that I'm aware of mentioning that Muhammad abolished an intercalary month. For all we know, arabs before Muhammad used a purely lunar calendar. The cited verse has nothing to do with intercalary months. The verse talks about switching holy months. You see, before Muhammad arabs used to switch holy months as often as they liked. So for example they would make the holy month of Muharram a normal month and make a normal month like Jumada holy for that particular year. So why is this versed cited here? I'm deleting the entire paragraph about intercalary month unless someone show me a reliable source which mention abolishing intercalary months (which is highly unlikely).

He states that Arabs originally used a purely lunar calendar, but in 412 CE they adopted a lunisolar calendar containing an intercalary month named ''Nasi'', which Muhammad prohibited in 632 CE. Burnaby's English version of the farewell sermon actually replaces &quot;intercalation&quot; with &quot;the Nasi&quot; indicating that Muhammad used the name of the intercalary month, &quot;Nasi&quot;. — [[User:Joe Kress|Joe Kress]] ([[User talk:Joe Kress|talk]]) 01:56, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

The word &quot;intercalation&quot; is a mistranslation of the verse. The original arabic word in the verse is an-nasi' which means literaly delaying, not intercalation. All the quran commentaries that I'm aware of explain this word as refering to the delaying/switching of holy months, not to intercalation. Check for example the commentary of Ibn Kathir [http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2557&amp;Itemid=64#1]. As for the Remaining Signs of the Past Centuries, I'll check the original arabic text because I don't think it mentions intercalation. Now you mentioned Sherrard Burnaby, this proves that at least one scholar believes in the existense of an intercalary month. But that still doesn't change the fact that the early arabic sources -especially the Quran commentaries- mention nothing about an intercalary month and explain the verse as refering to the switching of holy months. The problem with this article is that it presents the intercalary month as an undisputed fact, even though in reality the very existense of an intercalary month is supported by a small number of scholars.

:In ''E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=9JQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA856,M1 NASI'] is defined as an &quot;intercalary month, intercalation, or man on whose authority an intercalation is undertaken&quot;. However it is also connected to &quot;postpone&quot;. In addition to intercalation it may mean the &quot;transference of the sanctity of one holy month to another, in itself not holy&quot;. The equivalent article in the ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' has almost identical wording. In ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'' article TA'RIKH (chronology) section &quot;Pre-Islamic and agricultural calendars of the Arabian peninsula&quot; these dual meanings are applied to Sura 9:37. One group of Muslim scholars &quot;maintain that ''nasi' '' was a procedure by which an official (the ''nasi' '') connected with the Ka'ba cult at Mecca altered the distribution of 'forbidden' and 'permitted' months within a given year (or within two successive years)&quot;. Others, notably Muslim astronomers and modern scholars, &quot;claim that the 'postponement' of the forbidden months was the result of the fact that the pagan Arabs intercalated a thirteenth month every two years; ''nasi' '' is thus in effect the old Arabic word for 'intercalation' (''kabisa''), a practice wnich was abolished with the revelation of the above-cited verse.&quot; — [[User:Joe Kress|Joe Kress]] ([[User talk:Joe Kress|talk]]) 06:27, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

Thank you Joe for bringing this to my attention. So according to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, Muslim scholars believe that Nasi refers to the delaying of forbidden months while astronomers and western scholars believe it refers to intercalation. This could be a good basis for editing the article. [[User:Sci fi writer|Sci fi writer]] ([[User talk:Sci fi writer|talk]]) 16:29, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

This may be worth some attention: The Quran says there are 12 months in a year Repentance: (9-36):&quot;twelve is the number of months with God.&quot;
Now, this statement is only justified if the number of months used in a year, as used by the Arabs at the time, differed from twelve. Because the Quran didn't use to present evident facts 
to the people, only things which were especially worth a particular mention.
On this basis, I personally would think that the intercalary month did exist at the time, as mentioned by several sources, especially since the Jews living in Arabia had a calendar which used the procedure of intercalation.[[User:Aster77|Aster77]] ([[User talk:Aster77|talk]]) 17:00, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

==Jahiliyya==

:An anonymous editor, [[Special:Contributions/93.32.59.132|93.32.59.132]], just added a direct prohibition of years &quot;before Hijra&quot; to this article as follows: 
::The years preceding the Hijra are not cosidered in this calendar (Muslims regard these times simply as the ''[[Jahiliyyah]]'', ''i.e.'' &quot;the age of ignorance&quot;), and calendars calculating years BH are nonsense [&quot;Christian dates before 622 AD cannot be converted into Islamic dates as no &lt;BEFORE-HIJRA&gt;- chronology exists&quot; ([http://www.lib.umich.edu/area/Near.East/computus.html Computus calendar conversion program]).]
:I am moving this statement to this talk page for discussion because a blanket prohibition makes no sense. According to its article, [[Jahiliyyah]] means the time before the Qu'ran was revealed, which began in 610 CE, hence in 12 BH. Furthermore, Muhammad is said to have been born in 53 BH (570 CE) in [http://www.farmington.ac.uk/documents/new_reports/WR59.pdf]. www.understanding-islam.com uses both before Hijra and Jahiliyyah in [http://www.understanding-islam.com/ri/mi-004.htm]. An Islamic book [http://books.google.com/books?id=lT8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240] and a life of Abu Bakr [http://www.alislam.org/topics/khilafat/Hadhrat-Abu-Bakr-20080304MN.pdf] use before Hijra years.

::Of course, some dates around hijra times are sometimes referred to as &quot;this fact happened NN years before Hijra&quot;, but this is limited to a few decades, less than a century. In no book of history you will find, for instance, Roman Empire dates expressed like, say: &quot;546 BH&quot; or something alike. The problem is also linked with the fact that up to a certain time years were &quot;full years&quot; and not lunar years as in Islamic times, so years before hijra should be calculated in another way. I think that wikipedia calendar calculating such years in this way is quite nonsense. --[[Special:Contributions/93.32.52.197|93.32.52.197]] ([[User talk:93.32.52.197|talk]]) 00:04, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

== Pre-Islamic pilgrimage ==

This line

&lt;blockquote&gt;Other scholars, both Muslim[5][6] and Western,[7][8] concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but about 200 years before the Hijra it was transformed into a lunisolar calendar containing an intercalary month added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant for Bedouin buyers.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

is confusing to me. If the Hijra was Mohamed' move from Mecca to Medina (and presumably the beginning of Islam) then this change in Calendar calculation took place before the existence of Islam (or so it reads). Why then is there a reference to Pilgrimage in the same sentence when none could possibly have existed when this change took place? Did other types of pilgrimages occur prior to the establishment of Islam? If so, shouldn't there be a distinction made between that and the Islamic definition?[[User:Hschlarb|Hschlarb]] ([[User talk:Hschlarb|talk]]) 03:36, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

:The pilgrimage to Mecca or [[Hajj]] existed long before Muhammad. Indeed, according to Islamic tradition, it has existed since the time of [[Abraham]], who built the [[Kaaba]], its main focus, in some form, also according to Islamic tradition. The main purpose of the pilgrimage was to vist the Kaaba, to worship the idols around it, and to attend the annual fair held there to buy merchandise. Muhammad destroyed the idols, but otherwise continued to observe the pilgrimage. Of course, several Islamic elements have been added to pilgrimage, such as a visit to [[Mount Arafat]] in commemoration of Muhammad's [[Farewell Sermon]], the [[Stoning of the Devil]], and circling the Kaaba seven times ([[Tawaf]]). The annual fair now takes the form of [[Eid al-Adha]]. — [[User:Joe Kress|Joe Kress]] ([[User talk:Joe Kress|talk]]) 19:42, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

The [[lunar calendar]] page clearly indicates that the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, so the astronomical considerations section appears to be making a very fine distinction in a confusing manner - since it suggests that 'actual' lunar calendars have an intercalary month, while the lunar calendar page claims that this is actually a feature of lunisolar calendars and that the Islamic calendar is an example of a &lt;i&gt;purely lunar&lt;/i&gt; one.

::Dear Merewyn. the picture is as you say Ilkhanid, but the Ilkhanate, was part of the Mongolian empire, stretching into the Persian territories, perhaps not regarded too muslim in the aftermath. Another point here to consider in regard of the socio-political power of visual representation and propagation, i.e. history of the discourse regarding iconoclasm, is that this is not a particularly islamic featurer. Wars have been fought between christians of challenging points of view. It is not a settle matter between orthodox christians, and catholics. It is a millenia long discourse relating to the second commandment. Christian Protestantism, especially Zwingli and Calvin, has been considered iconoclastic. Hiskia, King of Judah, was an Iconoclast, even destroying the representation of Nehushtan, the brazen snakes on the ark of the covenant. Even Early Buddhism is considered iconoclastic inregard of its Hindu background, until hellenisation of Buddhism that was. In a modern reflection the commandment needs be related to the discourse of ad-busting and propaganda.

==Stimulated disharmonies==
There is an error, I believe, in the weekday table of this article stating that Sabbath is the first day of the week according to Muslims. Such an error is potentially stimulating disharmony between faithfulls. The correct (signified orthodox) view among muslims are not that Yawm Sabbath is the first day of the week, but the last. Similarly secular Christians, and secular western calendars, of phones and computers and so on, keep the erroneous calculation of Sundays as the seventh day of the week. I do not believe any biblical scholar, nor muslim scholar, as no wise Jew would disagree that Yom Sabbath, or Yawm Sawth, (or whatever transliteration) is anything else than the seventh day of the week. In addition: Jews, Christians and Muslims, do all similarly convert the Sabbath with the Roman empirical [[Saturday]] in our time. --[[User:Xact|Xact]] ([[User talk:Xact|talk]]) 03:48, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

: As the Arabic names of the weekdays Sunday to Thursday literally mean 'first day', 'second day', etc., it would seem to be obvious (even for simpletons) that the list should begin with Sunday and that Saturday should placed at the bottom (not at the top) of the table. [[User:Vgent|AstroLynx]] ([[User talk:Vgent|talk]]) 09:07, 7 March 2011 (UTC)

===Why it may be considered of importance===
At least I feel it is of importance. And I feel an urge to elucidate it; since I for years have been mislead to assume that Muslims, Jews and Christians disagree about which day of the week is the Holy Day: Saturday of Jews, Sunday for Christians, And the Muslims keep the Friday.... I've even been thinking that this is a typical sillyness of religion. It surely creates problems in integration-politics, and so on. But! This is not the case! Now I've come to the opposite conclusion: what is held to be the orthodox &amp; scholarly view within all these three denominations of the Abrahamic Religion is that it is the seventh day that is the Sabbath. We all agree. Religion is not the cause of this confusion.

The Christians keep Sundays as congregation day, because the ressurection of Jesus the Messiah was witnessed by Maria the Magdalene on the break of the first day of the week following the second Sabbath of the first month; which was the [[Easter|passover]] of Jews and all of Yisrael (not bound to the Sionist perspective). It seems quite obvious that in the year of the Golgata mystery, the lunar Sabbath and the seventh day of the Romans which was the day of Saturnus (Hebrew [[Remphan|Kiwan]]) was a match, thus the indication is that according to holy Scripture Christ overcame Satan and subdued the [[Nephilim]]s in the netherworld on the Seventh day, Yom Sawt, and ressurected on the first day, on that year a Sunday. That it most probably was on a Sunday is not given for every year. Because the orthodox Jews of the time most probably calculated the seven day week primarily according to the lunar calendar. The Pesakh, passover, and the sacrifice of the Holy Lamb, was/is ritually to be held on the evening before the full-moon day of the first month of spring [[Nisan]]. The following full-moon day was/is evidently a Sabbath. --[[User:Xact|Xact]] ([[User talk:Xact|talk]]) 03:48, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

===Solar or Lunar week?===
The solar-lunar correlations seem to have been somewhat confused during the Babylonian captivity. A theme accounted for in the canonical book of Esther. So, it was not every year a lunar Sabbath happened to be on a Saturday of the Solar Romans. Because The Julian Calendar was as novel as the Roman Empire was young; the Judeans were most probably divided along several lines in regard of what should be correct timekeeping. The western, alledged christian habbit of keeping the Sunday sacred, is actually not so much a christian as it is a pagan tradition, as is in matter of fact the western calendar (in spite being in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church). But still a cause to keep the day in awe and free from business, from a christian-muslim perspective, is that Isa the Messiah rose from death on a first day of the current global calendar, the day of the Sun in the reckoning of the Roman Calendar, There are no reason to believe that the perpetuality of the seven day week has been broken since Julius Ceasar inaugurated the system. --[[User:Xact|Xact]] ([[User talk:Xact|talk]]) 03:48, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

===Spiritual pragmatics of Muhammad (PBUH)===
One needs not much moral phantasy to see the revolutionary Muhammad (PBUH), being very concerned about the importance of calendars in regard of the power politics, e.g. control of the masses. It is easy to imagine him urging the people of the true religion of the prophets and all of Yisrael, to summon the holy assembly for devotional prayers allready on the sixth day, leading up to the holy seventh, on which day in the free nation of Allah, God of the ineffable tetragrammaton, the children of God are awake, giving (offering) everything back to Him; who on the seventh day of creation rests in union with the nature of All, Holy Mother Mercy of the Heavens. Or something like it. It is a matter of economics, or that is, of becoming free from enslavement. From any of these religious perspectives it is a sign of infidelity to trade, make money, to work, or to exploit the earth and the hearts and minds of people on the Sawt. My point is that Muhammad (PBUH) in line with Jesus the Messiah and all the Prophets herolds the view not merely defending the seventh day as sacred, nei, rather expanding the realisation that all of creation is sacred, directing our observation to the waxing and waning of the holy lifeforce in regard of the moon with its seventh day principle perceivable for all on the globe. This last point is of course not the orthodox perspective, since all three denominations are fooled by the calendrics of the Roman empire (probably derived from an ancient etruscan market calendar) binding the seventh day cycle to the strictly solar calendar, and mixed up with the wisdom of the Babylonian Zoroastrian calendars. Muhammad (PBUH) I believe, was aware of the errors of both the Sassanid-Persian and Roman-Byzantian imperialist traditions. When calling out for the Friday prayers, this is a statement not against the holiness of Yawm al-Sabbaoth, but the infringements to spiritual devotion and sacred time caused by the commersial interests of the elites of both the quarrelling powers of his contemporeality. --[[User:Xact|Xact]] ([[User talk:Xact|talk]]) 03:48, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

:2012 1 Jumada I equals 23 March (actual conjunction at Greenwich 22 March)

== Remove the picture of muhammad. ==

You had previously stated that the picture is islamic and it is not. No picture of that nature is islamic. Here is the proof that these pictures have nothing to do with islam. The picture has no relation to islam not even in a general sense. 

Hadith - Bukhari 3:428, Narrated Said bin Abu Al-Hasan 

While I was with Ibn 'Abbas a man came and said, &quot;O father of 'Abbas! My sustenance is from my manual profession and I make these pictures.&quot; Ibn 'Abbas said, &quot;I will tell you only what I heard from Allah's Apostle . I heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be punished by Allah till he puts life in it, and he will never be able to put life in it.' &quot; Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his face turned pale. Ibn 'Abbas said to him, &quot;What a pity! If you insist on making pictures I advise you to make pictures of trees and any other unanimated objects.&quot; 

Hadith -Bukhari 4:47, Narrated 'Aisha   

I stuffed for the Prophet a pillow decorated with pictures (of animals) which looked like a Namruqa (i.e. a small cushion). He came and stood among the people with excitement apparent on his face. I said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! What is wrong?&quot; He said, &quot;What is this pillow?&quot; I said, &quot;I have prepared this pillow for you, so that you may recline on it.&quot; He said, &quot;Don't you know that angels do not enter a house wherein there are pictures; and whoever makes a picture will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked to give life to (what he has created)?&quot; 

Hadith - Muslim, Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib 

AbulHayyaj al-Asadi told that Ali ibn AbuTalib said to him: Should I not send you on the same mission as Allah's Messenger  sent me? Do not leave an image without obliterating it, or a high grave without levelling it. This hadith has been reported by Habib with the same chain of transmitters and he said: (do not leave) a picture without obliterating it.

So whoever invented these pictures are unislamic and so are the pictures.

Motion passed'''15/10/0'''.

The argument by the antis is that removing the images would make writing a neutral encyclopedia impossible.   But the pros aren't asking for them to be removed altogether, only from places where they are not material to the subject being explained.   The subject matter of this article is not the Prophet at all - it's the calendar used by his followers.

: Why do you think that the majority of the readers of this article are Muslims? There are many non-Muslims who are interested in the organization and history of the Islamic calendar (I surely am not the only one). Anyway, deleting the image here would also affect other articles in which the same or similar images are used - see [[Talk:Muhammad]] and [[Talk:Muhammad/images]]. The image in question is a respectful image of Muhammad made by a Muslim artist for a Muslim audience and is relevant for the article as it is linked with the abolition of intercalary months in the early Arabian calendar.

::Did I say that the majority of the readers are Muslims?   Many non-Muslims are appalled that a handful of people deliberately set out to rile members of faiths that they are not (so far as I am aware) members of.   I take the Tube (subway) to my place of worship so therefore you can say that the Tube is relevant to places of worship but you wouldn't therefore expect to see pictures of Tube trains in an article on places of worship.   The picture is not a picture of Muhammad at all - if put in an auction catalogue with the label &quot;Picture of Muhammad&quot; it would contravene the Trade Descriptions Act.   If you disregard the blasphemy argument there is still a consensus of 6 - 3 for removal.   I don't know where you get the idea the picture was painted by a Muslim artist - according to the attribution the author is unknown.

::: I do not see why the Tube is now relevant to this discussion. The (unknown) artist who made (or in this case copied) the image was perhaps not a Muslim but it was made for a work by a well-known Muslim author which was dedicated to a Muslim ruler. Did you actually take the trouble to have a look at the work we are talking about? It is available online in several editions. You will then see that the image is quite relevant for this topic.

:::::::I see that you still have not taken the trouble to do some research yourself. The image in question is found in the second chapter of al-Biruni's ''Chronology of Ancient Nations''.

{{od}}All right, you've made a valid point there.   The picture does have some passing relevance to the subject of the Islamic calendar.   The point is that if every fact which had some passing relevance was included in articles they would all be the size of full - length novels.   This is why the concept of &quot;consensus&quot; was introduced to provide an efficient mechanism for determining what peripheral matters should go into articles and what should stay out.

Although the picture is billed in the article as &quot;Muhammad prohibiting intercalation&quot; that is misleading.   It misrepresents the intention of the artist, which was to depict the Prophet addressing the faithful at the Farewell Pilgrimage.   A number of matters were covered in that discourse, not least the fact that this would be the last time he would be able to speak to them.   So please, in this instance, respect the consensus.

: The consensus is that the picture stays - your statistics (half of which consist of people - like yourself - hiding behind an anonymous IP address) do not convince me. The sources mentioned above make it pretty clear that the image refers to Muhammad's abolition of the intercalary month (al-Biruni's text does not refer to the other topics covered in Muhammad's Farewell Speech). I really don't see the point in discussing this any further and wonder what you are trying to achieve. Even if you would be able to get this image permanently removed from this page (which is not likely to happen), what are you going to do about the other WP pages (and the WP pages in other languages) which have this image? And what about the original manuscripts - how will you make these disappear from the web? [[User:Vgent|AstroLynx]] ([[User talk:Vgent|talk]]) 06:58, 14 October 2011 (UTC)

::They say statistics can be made to prove anything, but no statistics prove nothing - they certainly don't support your claim that most editors support your stance.   An uninvolved reader looking at this talkpage would come to the opposite conclusion.
::You're now trying to smear other editors by insinuating that the vote has been rigged - request CheckUser or withdraw that allegation.
::If you are unable to find a definitive statement from the painter that the picture is Muhammad prohibiting intercalation you are not in a position to say that it is.   It is highly unlikely that painting 600 years after the event he was intending to convey anything more specific than the delivery of the Prophet's farewell message.   Browsing the link you provided, I believe I saw a picture of some men on horse- (or camel) back.   Now don't tell me that has some deep chronological significance as well.
::Finally, don't smear Muslims by suggesting that they want to tear pictures of the Prophet out of ancient manuscripts.   Muslims do not practice censorship as you imply.   The simple issue is that readers come to the article hoping to learn about the Islamic calendar and a picture of the Prophet delivering his homily imparts no information at all.

::: You are clearly grasping at straws now. First you claim that statistics prove that you are right and now you claim that statistics don't prove anything at all. Nor did I say that the vote has been rigged - I would however argue that the votes of people who hide behind an anonymous IP (like youself) and who never have contributed anything useful to the article in the past should not be given the same weight. However, I do not know what the WP rules are in this case. 
::: If you do not understand the other images in the Paris manuscript, why do you not take the trouble to read Sachau's English translation and find this out for yourself? You are really acting like a spoiled child now - too lazy to seek knowledge by yourself?
::: Where do I say that Muslims want to deface ancient manuscripts? I only asked how you intend to prevent the images from appearing on the web. In English there is a very nice phrase about the pot calling the kettle black - recognize anyone?

::::*How does a picture of a homily delivered 1,380 years ago improve the Islamic calendar article?

::::*Sachau's English translation (with which I am familiar) isn't going to aid the understanding of the pictures in the Paris manuscript for the simple reason that it is a faithful rendition of what Al - Biruni wrote a millennium ago, not a commentary on some pictures produced by an unidentifield artist 500 years later.

::::: How do you know for sure that Sachau's edition and translation are a faithful rendition of al-Biruni's original text? One can never be sure as all known manuscripts are later copies. You can perhaps argue that al-Biruni's original manuscript did not contain images but there is no way to prove this. The earliest known manuscript (Edinburgh University Library, ms. Arab. 161), dating from 707 AH [1307/08 AD], is illustrated and there is no reason to doubt that it continues an earlier tradition of illustrating this particular work.

::::::The only consensus which can be taken into account at this article is the one which is manifest on this talk page.   Whether a particular picture is relevant to an article is determined solely by the subject of that article, not other articles.   Presumably the different editions of al - Biruni have different illustrations, so unless the author of a particular illustration added a caption saying it was Muhammad forbidding intercalation you can't assume that it was, and ''your'' caption will fall foul of the rules against original research.   From the picture you have inserted there is no way of telling whether Muhammad is speaking or not, and if he is there is no way of ascertaining what he was discussing at the time.

::As I noted at MohammedBinAbdullah's talkpage, I believe [[WP:COMMONNAME]] applies here, in that Hijri is not commonly understood by English speakers in general and wouldn't be a productive search term.  This is contrasted with [[Hajj]], which is widely understood and which has been incorporated into English vocabulary. I don't see how the present ''status quo'' with a redirect is problematic: Wikipedia generally uses a translated title for foreign terms when there is a satisfactory English equivalent and the foreign-language term is not in widespread use among English speakers. I am open to a rewording of the lead paragraph to provide a better discussion of the Arabic terminology, as the &quot;also called&quot; doesn't seem to do the proper Arabic terminology justice.

:::I'd hate to see such a move even if it were shown that the [[Hijri calendar]] is the one only calendar used by Muslims. This is an English-language encyclopedia. Unless your motivation is to make the &quot;inscrutable&quot; Islamic culture even harder to fathom, I'd suggest that we keep [[Islamic calendar]] where it is.

:::We can always emphasize that the &quot;proper&quot; term for the calendar uses a foreign word. By the way, I don't agree  that [[Hajj]] is either (a) widely understood or (b) incorporated into English vocabulary (not the way [[Sushi]] is, at least). I daresay for every English-speaking Westerner who knows that each Muslim must make a one-in-a-lifetime [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca, less than 1 percent of them know that Muslims call it a ''Hajj'' (let alone what language they are using when they call it this).

:::You still run into people who aren't sure that [[Qu'ran]] means the holy Koran. (On the other hand, the transition from [[Calcutta]] to [[Kolkata]] went rather smoothly, but there were political reasons involved.) 

:::There have been many attempts to de-Westernize the English-language Wikipedia, including a concerted attempt to pretend that many major scientific advances were discovered first by Muslims (or within the Islamic world). It took a lot of trouble to remove all this bias, and I'm not sure it's been completed - or even undone!) so let's not start more trouble. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 18:32, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

English is not just spoken by english people but by many different people so that argument is flawed. Hijri calendar is islamic calendar and islamic calendar is hijri calendar. [[User:MohammedBinAbdullah|MohammedBinAbdullah]] ([[User talk:MohammedBinAbdullah|talk]]) 21:11, 18 May 2012 (UTC)

:This has nothing to do with English people: this is the English language Wikipedia and policy requires that article titles be in English unless the foreign-language term is a recognized English word. Hijri is not used in the English language.

::I have to agree with Acroterion above. So far as I can see, English usage is for &quot;Islamic&quot; (a term which most English speakers understand), as opposed to &quot;Hijri&quot;, a term few if any non-Muslims even recognize. [{WP:COMMONNAME]] would seem to support the use of &quot;Islamic&quot; on that basis. While I could see, if anything, [[Islamic religious year]] might be preferable, as that is the title of the article in the Eliade/Jones &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion&quot;, parallelism would probably support the usage of the word &quot;calendar.&quot; [[User:John Carter|John Carter]] ([[User talk:John Carter|talk]]) 21:46, 18 May 2012 (UTC)

:::Authors who discuss this calendar in the English language use Islamic and Muslim with about the same frequency. Usage of Hijri or Hijra is quite rare. Although Muslim had been present in the first sentence for many years, somewhere among the recent edits by MohammedBinAbdullah and reversions, Muslim was lost. — [[User:Joe Kress|Joe Kress]] ([[User talk:Joe Kress|talk]]) 19:52, 19 May 2012 (UTC)


No, because there is also a [[Solar Hijri calendar]]. [[User:Khestwol|Khestwol]] ([[User talk:Khestwol|talk]]) 11:15, 30 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
