{{Further|Roman Catholic (term)|History of the term Catholic}}

Since the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054, the church that remained in communion with the [[See of Rome]] continued to call itself &quot;Catholic&quot; while the Eastern churches have generally been known as &quot;Orthodox&quot; or &quot;Eastern Orthodox&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBrien&quot;/&gt; Following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, the Church continued to use the term &quot;Catholic&quot; to distinguish itself from the various [[Protestant]] denominations that split off.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBrien&quot;&gt;McBrien, Richard (2008). ''The Church''. Harper Collins. p. xvii. Online version available [http://browseinside.harpercollins.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780061245213 Browseinside.harpercollins.com]. Quote: &quot;[T]he use of the adjective 'Catholic' as a modifier of 'Church' became divisive only after the East-West Schism&amp;nbsp;...and the Protestant Reformation&amp;nbsp;...In the former case, the Western Church claimed for itself the title ''Catholic'' Church, while the East appropriated the name ''Orthodox'' Church. In the latter case, those in communion with the Bishop of Rome retained the adjective &quot;Catholic&quot;, while the churches that broke with the Papacy were called ''Protestant''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Catholic Church&quot; is the most common designation used in official church documents.&lt;ref&gt;''Libreria Editrice Vaticana'' (2003).

In general, each ''sui iuris'' church is headed by a [[patriarch]] or high ranking bishop,&lt;ref&gt;CCEO, Canon 56.

The largest of the particular churches is the [[Latin Church]] which reports over one billion members. It developed in southern Europe and North Africa. Then it spread throughout Western, Central and Northern Europe, before expanding to the rest of the world.

Some Eastern Catholic Churches are governed by a patriarch who is elected by the [[synod]] of the bishops of that church,&lt;ref&gt;CCEO, Canons 55–150.

===Dioceses, parishes and religious orders===
Individual countries, regions, or major cities are served by local [[particular church]]es known as '''[[diocese]]s''' or '''[[eparchy|eparchies]]''', each overseen by a Catholic bishop. Each diocese is united with one of the worldwide &quot;''sui iuris''&quot; particular churches, such as the Latin Church, or one of the many Eastern Catholic Churches. As of 2008, the Catholic Church altogether comprised 2,795 dioceses.&lt;ref name=&quot;sees&quot;&gt;Vatican, ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' 2009, p. 1172.&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops in a particular country or region are often organised into an episcopal conference,&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontifico per l'anno 2010 (Città di Vaticano: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; which aids in maintaining a uniform style of worship and co-ordination of social justice programmes within the areas served by member bishops.

Dioceses are further divided into numerous individual communities called [[parish]]es, each staffed by one or more [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]], [[deacons]] and/or [[lay ecclesial ministers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith52&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Parishes are responsible for the day to day celebration of the sacraments and pastoral care of the Catholic laity.

Ordained Catholics, as well as members of the [[laity]], may enter into [[consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated life]] either on an individual basis, as a [[hermit]] or [[consecrated virgin]], or by joining an [[institute of consecrated life]] (a [[religious institute]] or a [[secular institute]]) in which to take [[Religious vows|vows]] confirming their desire to follow the three [[evangelical counsels]] of chastity, poverty and obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canons573-746&quot;&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Canon Law 573-746] Catholic Church Canon Law.

===Membership statistics===
{{Further|Catholicism by country}}

Total church membership (both lay and clerical) in 2007 was 1.147&amp;nbsp;billion people,&lt;ref name=&quot;cathstats&quot;/&gt; having increased from 437&amp;nbsp;million in 1950 &lt;ref name=&quot;Froehle5&quot;&gt;Froehle, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; and 654&amp;nbsp;million in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazar|first=Emily|title=Immigrants Make Pilgrimage to Pope|work=USA Today|date=16 April 2008|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-04-15-popeimmigrants_N.htm|accessdate=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2011, membership was 1.196&amp;nbsp;billion, an increase of 11.54% over the same date in 2000, which was only slightly greater than the rate of increase of the world population (10.77%). The increase was 33.02% in Africa, but only 1.17% in Europe. It was 15.91% in Asia, 11.39% in Oceania and 10.93% in the Americas. As a result, Catholics were 17.77% of the total population in Africa, 63.10% in the Americas, 3.05% in Asia, 39.97% in Europe, 26.21% in Oceania and 17.09% of the world population.

Of the world's Catholics, the proportion living in Africa grew from 12.44% in 2000 to 14.84% in 2008, while those living in Europe declined from 26.81% to 24.31%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zenit&quot;/&gt;
Membership in the Catholic Church is attained through baptism or [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|reception into the Church]] (for individuals previously baptised in non-Catholic Christian churches).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 11.]. Retrieved 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For some years until 2009, if someone [[actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica|formally left the Church]], that fact was noted in the register of the person's baptism.

At the end of 2007, Vatican records listed 408,024 Catholic priests in the world, 762 more than at the beginning of the year. The main growth areas have been Asia and Africa, with 21.1% and 27.6% growth respectively. In North and South America, numbers have remained approximately the same, while there was a 6.8% decline in Europe and a 5.5% decrease in Oceania from 2000 to 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Vatican: Priest numbers show steady, moderate increase|publisher=Catholic News Service|date=2 March 2009|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/news/newsreport.aspx?id=759|accessdate=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following seems unrelated to membership and should, I think, be deleted:

In Eastern Churches, [[chrismation]] (confirmation) and the Eucharist may be conferred at the same time as baptism for both children and adult converts. Adults who wish to convert to Catholicism can participate in a formation programme such as the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith56&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; For serious violations of ecclesiastical law, a member can be excommunicated, which forbids a member from participation in the sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 1463&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Worship and liturgy==
{{main|Catholic liturgy}}
[[File:St. Mary's Catholic Church altar, Alexandria, VA.jpg|thumbnail|Altar in St Mary's Church in Alexandria, Virginia. The altar is at the centre of Catholic worship because it is there that the &quot;Holy Sacrifice of the Mass&quot; takes place.]]Among the 23 autonomous (''sui iuris'') churches, numerous forms of worship and liturgical traditions exist, called &quot;rites&quot;, which reflect historical and cultural diversity rather than differences in belief.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 1200–1209&lt;/ref&gt; In the definition of the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]], &lt;!--Exact Quote from an Unofficial Translation--&gt;&quot;a rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual, and disciplinary patrimony, culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people, by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each Church ''sui iuris''&quot;&lt;!--end quote--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/__PS.HTM CCEO, canon 28 §1 in an unofficial English translation.] The [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html official text] is &quot;''Ritus est patrimonium liturgicum, theologicum, spirituale et disciplinare cultura ac rerum adiunctis historiae populorum distinctum, quod modo fidei vivendae uniuscuiusque Ecclesiae sui iuris proprio exprimitur''.&quot; (A rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary heritage, differentiated by peoples' culture and historical circumstances, that finds expression in each ''sui iuris'' Church's own way of living the faith).&lt;/ref&gt; but the term is often limited to liturgical patrimony. The most commonly used liturgy is the [[Roman Rite]] in its [[Mass of Paul VI|ordinary form]], but other rites are in use in the Eastern Catholic Churches and even in the Latin Church.

===Celebration of the Eucharist===
In all rites the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], or [[Divine Liturgy]], is the centre of Catholic worship. The Catholic Church teaches that at each Mass the bread and wine become the [[Real Presence|body and blood of Christ]] by the [[Words of Institution|words of consecration]] spoken by the priest. The Church teaches that this happens through [[transubstantiation]], in which the &quot;accidents&quot; (perceptible aspects) of the sacramental bread and wine remain, but the underlying substance is transmuted into the body, blood, soul and divinity of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 1324–1331&lt;/ref&gt; The words of consecration are drawn from the three [[synoptic Gospels]] and a [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Pauline letter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wordsinstit&quot;&gt;See {{bibleverse||Luke|22:19}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:27–28}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|14:22–24}}, {{bibleverse||1Corinthians|11:24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church teaches that Christ established a [[New Covenant]] with humanity through the institution of the Eucharist at the [[Last Supper]], as described in these biblical verses.

Because the Church teaches that Christ is present in the Eucharist,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft326&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; there are strict rules about who may celebrate and who may receive the Eucharist in the Catholic Church. The sacrament can only be celebrated by an ordained Catholic priest. Those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the [[sacrament of Reconciliation]] (Penance).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft331&quot;/&gt; Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft331&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholics, even if they were in danger of death and unable to approach a Catholic minister, may not ask for the sacraments of the Eucharist, penance or anointing of the sick from someone, such as a Protestant minister, who is not known to be validly ordained in line with Catholic teaching on ordination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/general-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19930325_directory_en.html Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms of Ecumenism, 132]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1400 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, even in grave and pressing need, Catholic ministers may not administer these sacraments to those who do not manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament. In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See, the Catholic Church is less restrictive, declaring that &quot;a certain ''communion in sacris'', and so in the Eucharist, given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1399 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Rite is the most common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, spread by missionary activity originating in European Catholic nations throughout Christian history.&lt;ref name=AFAC&gt;{{cite book|last=Stuard-will|first=Kelly|title=A Faraway Ancient Country.|year=2007|publisher=Gardners Books|location=United States|isbn=978-0-615-15801-3|page=216|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q469xc7mbksC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Emissary|editor=Karitas Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two forms of the Roman Rite are authorised at present: the ordinary form, celebrated mostly in the vernacular, corresponding to the post-1969 editions of the [[Roman Missal]] ([[Mass of Paul VI]]),  and the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|extraordinary form]], corresponding to the 1962 edition, formerly known as the [[Tridentine Mass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft326&quot;&gt;Kreeft, pp. 326–327&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Tridentine Mass so called because standardised by [[Pope Pius V]] after the [[Council of Trent]] in the 16th century, was the ordinary form of the Roman-Rite Mass until superseded in 1969 by the Roman Missal of Paul VI; its continued use, in the version found in the 1962 edition of the Missal, is authorized by the 2007 motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.|group=note}} An outline of the major liturgical elements of Roman Rite Mass can be found in the side bar.

Retrieved 31 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Western liturgical rites (non-Roman) include the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]].

===Eastern liturgical rites===
[[File:Kanjirappally Bishop Mathew Arackal at Tomb of Varghese Payapilly Palakkappilly.jpg|thumb|left|An Eastern Catholic bishop of the [[Syro-Malabar|Syro-Malabar Church]] holding the Mar Thoma Cross which symbolises the heritage and identity of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of [[Christianity in India|India]]]]
The liturgical rites of the Eastern Catholic Churches are very similar to, and often identical with, the rites used by the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and other Eastern Christian churches which historically developed in Russia, Caucasus and the Balkans, North Eastern Africa and the Middle East, but are no longer in communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope. The Eastern Catholic Churches are either groups of faithful which have restored full communion with the Bishop of Rome, while preserving their identity as Eastern Christians, or groups with which full communion has never been broken.

The rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches include the [[Byzantine rite]], in its Antiochian, Greek and Slavonic varieties, the [[Alexandrian Rite|Alexandrian]] rite, the [[West Syrian Rite|Syriac rite]], the [[Armenian rite]], the [[Maronite]] rite and the [[Chaldean rite]]. In the past some of the rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches were subject to some degree of [[liturgical Latinisation]]. However, in recent years Eastern Catholic Churches have returned to traditional Eastern practices in accord with the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] decree ''[[Orientalium Ecclesiarum]]''. Each church has its own [[liturgical calendar]].

The fundamental beliefs of the Christian religion are summarised in the [[Nicene Creed]].

Sacred Scripture consists of the 73 book [[Bible#Christian canons|Catholic Bible]].

===Catholic social teaching===
The social Gospel espoused by Jesus and [[Catholic social teaching]] place a heavy emphasis on the [[corporal works of mercy]] and the [[spiritual works of mercy]], namely the support and concern for the sick, the poor and the afflicted. Church teaching calls for a preferential [[option for the poor]] while canon law prescribes that &quot;The Christian faithful are also obliged to promote [[social justice]] and, mindful of the precept of the Lord, to assist the poor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1983 CIC, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PU.HTM canon 222 §2].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Church enumerates  &quot;corporal works of mercy&quot; and &quot;spiritual works of mercy&quot; as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10198d.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church is the largest non-governmental provider of health services in the world. In 2010, the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers said that the Church manages 26% of health care facilities in the world, including hospitals, clinics, orphanages, pharmacies and centres for those with leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council/ |title=Catholic hospitals comprise one quarter of world's healthcare, council reports :: Catholic News Agency (CNA) |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Religious institutes for women have played a particularly prominent role in the provision of health and education services, as with orders such as the [[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Little Sisters of the Poor]], the [[Missionaries of Charity]], the [[Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart]], the [[Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament]] and the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]].

The Church is also actively engaged in international aid and development through organisations such as [[Catholic Relief Services]], [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas International]], [[Aid to the Church in Need]], refugee advocacy groups such as the [[Jesuit Refugee Service]] and community aid groups such as the [[Saint Vincent de Paul Society]].

===Trinity===
[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Crucifixion of Christ'' featuring [[Saint Dismas]] and criminal [[Gestas]] by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1526]]
The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God, who exists as a [[perichoresis|mutual indwelling]] of three persons: [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]]; [[God the Son]]; and [[Holy Spirit|God the Holy Spirit]], which make up the [[Trinity]].

Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity, God the Son. In an event known as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], through the power of the Holy Spirit, God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. Christ therefore is both fully divine and fully human. It is taught that Christ's mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath&quot;&gt;McGrath, pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church teaches that through the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] (suffering) of Christ and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] as described in the Gospels, all people have an opportunity for forgiveness and freedom from sin and so can be [[Atonement in Christianity|reconciled to God]].&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 608&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Resurrection of Jesus]] gained for humans a possible spiritual immortality previously denied to them because of original sin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck113&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; By reconciling with God and following Christ's words and deeds, an individual can enter the [[Kingdom of God]], which is the &quot;...&amp;nbsp;reign of God over people's hearts and lives&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith26&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term &quot;Christ&quot; and the Hebrew &quot;Messiah&quot; both mean &quot;anointed one&quot;, referring to the Christian belief that Jesus' death and resurrection are the fulfillment of the Old Testament's [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Messianic prophecies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft71&quot;&gt;Kreeft, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostolicity===
According to the Catechism, the Catholic Church professes to be the &quot;sole Church of Christ&quot;, which is described in the Nicene Creed as the [[Four Marks of the Church|one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P29.HTM 811].&lt;/ref&gt; The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ, who appointed the [[twelve Apostles]] to continue his work as the Church's earliest bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft98&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 98, quote &quot;The fundamental reason for being a Catholic is the historical fact that the Catholic Church was founded by Christ, was God's invention, not man's&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;As the Father gave authority to Christ (Jn 5:22; Mt 28:18–20), Christ passed it on to his apostles (Lk 10:16), and they passed it on to the successors they appointed as bishops.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic belief holds that the Church &quot;is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck131&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and that all duly consecrated bishops have a lineal [[Apostolic Succession|succession]] from the apostles.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith46&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), is considered the successor to the apostle [[Simon Peter]], from whom the Pope derives his [[papal supremacy|supremacy]] over the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm 880]. Accessed 20 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Church is further described in the papal encyclical ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi]]'' as the [[Mystical Body of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Encyclical ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi_en.html Mystici Corporis Christi]'', Vatican City, 1943.

The Church teaches that the fullness of the &quot;means of salvation&quot; exists only in the Catholic Church, but the Church acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to &quot;impel towards Catholic unity&quot; and thus bring people to salvation. It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Church but that people can be saved [[baptism of desire|ex voto]] and by [[baptism of blood|pre-baptismal martyrdom]] as well as when conditions of [[Invincible ignorance (Catholic theology)|invincible ignorance]] are present,&lt;ref name=&quot;LumenG3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul VI|first=Pope|title=Lumen Gentium chapter 2|publisher=Vatican|year=1964|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|accessdate=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation.

[[File:Battesimi0113.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Catholic priest]] during the Sacrament of [[Baptism]], [[Italy]]]]
According to the [[Council of Trent]], Christ instituted [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]] and entrusted them to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 1113–1114, 1117&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], the [[Eucharist]], Reconciliation ([[Penance]]), [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (formerly called Extreme Unction, one of the &quot;[[Last Rites]]&quot;), [[Holy Orders]] and [[Catholic marriage|Holy Matrimony]]. Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] to all those who receive them with the proper disposition (''[[ex opere operato]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorises the sacraments into three groups, the &quot;sacraments of Christian initiation&quot;, &quot;sacraments of healing&quot; and &quot;sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful&quot;. These groups broadly reflect the stages of people's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1210–1211 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sacraments of Christian initiation====
{{Main|Sacraments of Initiation}}

=====Baptism=====
As viewed by the Catholic Church, Baptism is the first of three sacraments of initiation as a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3O.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1275 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It washes away all sins, both [[original sin]] and personal actual sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3N.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1263 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes a person a member of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3N.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1267 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit on the part of the person who is baptised, it is [[infant baptism|conferred even on children]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3O.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1282 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3K.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1250 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone – be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent – may baptise the child {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3N.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1272 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise (&quot;to do what the Church does when she baptises&quot;) and that they use the [[Trinitarian formula#Use in baptism|Trinitarian baptismal formula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3L.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1256 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Confirmation=====
The Catholic Church sees the sacrament of confirmation as required to complete the grace given in baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3P.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1285 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P31.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 883 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice followed even for infants in the [[Eastern Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html |title=Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 695 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Latin Church|West]] confirmation of children is delayed until they are old enough to understand or even until they are in their teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P33.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 891 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Christianity, particularly [[Catholicism]], the sacrament is called ''confirmation'', because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Church, it is called ''chrismation'', because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with [[chrism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Seven%20Sacraments%20of%20the%20Church |title=Compendium of the CCC, 267 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mixture of [[olive oil]] and some perfumed substance, usually [[Oleoresin|balsam]], blessed by a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/florence.htm#3 |title=Council of Florence: Bull of union with the Armenians |publisher=Ewtn.com |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the [[age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]] means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by the sacrament of Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3T.HTM ''CCC'', 1310] and [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3V.HTM 1319]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eucharist=====
For Catholics, the Eucharist is the sacrament which completes Christian initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3W.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1322 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the perpetuation of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1365–1372 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a banquet in which Christ himself is consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1382–1384 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eucharistic sacrifice always includes prayers, readings from the [[Bible]], consecration of wheat bread and grape wine and communion by at least some of the participants (in particular the priest) in the consecrated elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P44.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1408 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by the consecration become, in a way surpassing understanding, the body and blood of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1333 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a change known as [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1376 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony in which a Catholic first receives the Eucharist is known as [[First Communion]].

====Sacraments of healing====
The two sacraments of healing are the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Penance]] and [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]].

=====Penance=====
The Sacrament of Penance (also called Reconciliation, Forgiveness, Confession, and Conversion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 296 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) exists for the conversion of those who, after baptism, separate themselves from Christ by sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 297 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essential to this sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and [[absolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 302–303 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious sins ([[mortal sin]]s) must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of [[venial sin]]s also is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 304–306 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priest is bound under the severest penalties to maintain the &quot;[[seal of confession]]&quot;, absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 309 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Anointing of the Sick=====
While chrism is used only for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated (baptism, confirmation, ordination), a different oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, has begun to be in danger of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 316 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 319 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not reserved for those in proximate danger of death, it is often administered as one of the Last Rites.

====Sacraments at the service of communion====
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church there are two sacraments of [[Koinonia|communion]] directed towards the salvation of others: priesthood and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;CCC 1534&lt;/ref&gt; Within the general vocation to be a Christian, these two sacraments ''consecrate'' to specific mission or [[vocation]] among the people of God. Men receive the holy orders ''to feed the Church by the word and [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]''. Spouses marry so that their love may be fortified to fulfil duties of their state.&lt;ref&gt;CCC&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ordination=====
[[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]] is a sacrament in three degrees or orders, episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons), which consecrates and deputes some Christians to serve the whole body by these specific titles.&lt;ref&gt;Canons 1008–1009 of the Code of Canon Law as modified by the 2009 [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_letters/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apl_20091026_codex-iuris-canonici_en.html motu proprio ''[[Omnium in mentem]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Rite, the priesthood and diaconate are generally restricted to celibate men.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCL1031&quot;&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Q.HTM Canon 1031] Catholic Church Canon Law.

But after becoming a Roman Catholic priest, a man may not get married (see [[Clerical celibacy]]) unless he is later formally laicised.

All [[clergy]], whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness marriages and conduct funeral liturgies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Deacons|url=http://www.usccb.org/deacon/faqs.shtml|author=Committee on the Diaconate|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only bishops and priests can administer the sacraments of the Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing of the Sick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P16.HTM Canon 42] Catholic Church Canon Law.

=====Matrimony=====
Marriage, understood as an indissoluble union between a man and a woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P54.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1638 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; if entered into validly by any baptised man and baptised woman, is considered a sacrament by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1625 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state recognised divorce only as a means of protecting children or property, without allowing remarriage following such a divorce. Apart from the requirements, such as freedom of consent, that it sees as applicable to all, the church has established certain specific requirements for the validity of marriages by Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1631 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to observe the Church's regulations, as well as defects applicable to all marriages, may be grounds for a church declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an [[annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1629 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgment after death===
The Church teaches that, immediately after death, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] of each person will receive a [[particular judgment]] from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1021–22, 1051&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in a universal judgment of all mankind. This [[Last Judgment|final judgment]], according to Church teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1038–41&lt;/ref&gt; The basis on which each person's soul is judged is detailed in the Gospel of Matthew, which lists [[Works of Mercy|works of mercy]] to be performed even to people considered &quot;the least of Christ's brothers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew25&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|25:35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis is upon Christ's words that &quot;Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck397&quot;/&gt;

According to the Catechism, &quot;The Last Judgement will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has done or failed to do during his earthly life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck397&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the judgement rendered, a soul may enter one of three states of afterlife:
* [[Heaven#In Roman Catholicism|Heaven]] is a time of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1023–29, 1042–50&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Purgatory]] is a temporary condition for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1030–32, 1054&lt;/ref&gt; Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the [[intercession of saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/Library/Liturgy/zlitur215.htm |title=Saints' Prayers for Souls in Purgatory |publisher=Ewtn.com |date=|accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hell in Christian beliefs#Roman Catholicism|Final Damnation]]: Finally, those who persist in living in a state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject themselves to hell, an everlasting separation from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1033–37, 1057&lt;/ref&gt; The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1058&lt;/ref&gt; No one is [[predestination|predestined]] to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death and be saved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luke23&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants who die in original sin are assigned to [[limbo]] although this is not an official doctrine of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7529&amp;CFID=32422018&amp;CFTOKEN=46037657 |title=Library : The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptized |publisher=Catholic Culture |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virgin Mary===
[[File:LaPurisimaInmaculadaConcepciondeRibera.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] is highly regarded in the Catholic Church, proclaiming her as [[Theotokos|Mother of God]], [[Immaculate Conception|free from original sin]] and an [[intercessor]].]]
{{main|Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Roman Catholic Mariology}}
{{see also|Mary (mother of Jesus)}}

[[Catholic devotions|Devotions]] to [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Mary]] are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God.&lt;ref&gt;Schreck, p. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; The Church holds Mary, as [[Perpetual virginity|Perpetual Virgin]] and [[Theotokos|Mother of God]], in special regard. [[Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church|Catholic beliefs concerning Mary]] include her [[Immaculate Conception]] without the stain of original sin and bodily [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]] into heaven at the end of her life, both of which have been [[papal infallibility|infallibly]] defined as [[dogma]], by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854 and [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry, p. 106&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]] deals not only with her life but also her veneration in daily life, prayer and [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian art]], [[Roman Catholic Marian music|music]] and [[Roman Catholic Marian architecture|architecture]]. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as [[Queen of Heaven]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] called her [[Mother of the Church]] because, by giving birth to Christ, she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the [[Body of Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry, p. 106&quot;/&gt; Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the [[Hail Mary]], the [[Rosary]], the [[Salve Regina]] and the [[Memorare]] are common Catholic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has affirmed certain [[Marian apparitions]], such as at [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Lourdes]], [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fátima]], and [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]].&lt;ref&gt;Schreck, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrimages to these sites are popular Catholic devotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baedeker |first=Rob |title=World's most-visited religious destinations |work=USA Today |date=21 December 2007 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-12-21-most-visited-religious-spots-forbes_N.htm |accessdate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostolic period===
Catholic tradition and doctrine hold that the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD in [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judea]] within the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[New Testament]] records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the [[twelve Apostles]] and [[Great Commission|his instructions to them to continue his work]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft98O&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bokenkotter30&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

It interprets the [[Confession of Peter]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] as Christ's designation of [[Peter the Apostle|Saint Peter]] the Apostle and his successors, the [[bishop of Rome|Bishops of Rome]] to be the temporal head of his Church, a doctrine known as [[apostolic succession]].&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Church recognizes as legitimate the episcopal consecrations of a number of other churches. However, it still insists that those churches are obligated to defer to the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeographic281&quot;&gt;Hitchcock, ''Geography of Religion'' (2004), p. 281, quote: &quot;Some (Christian communities) had been founded by Peter, the disciple Jesus designated as the founder of his church.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Once the position was institutionalized, historians looked back and recognized Peter as the first pope of the Christian church in Rome&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman11&quot;&gt;Norman, ''The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History'' (2007), pp. 11, 14, quote: &quot;The Church was founded by Jesus himself in his earthly lifetime.&quot;, &quot;The apostolate was established in Rome, the world's capital when the church was inaugurated; it was there that the universality of the Christian teaching most obviously took its central directive–it was the bishops of Rome who very early on began to receive requests for adjudication on disputed points from other bishops.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temporini |first=Hildegard |coauthors=Wolfgang Haase |title=[[Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt]] Principat.: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im Spiegel der neueren Forschung |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1982 |page=480 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kNPV4P5h1qgC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;dq=The+church+was+founded+by+jesus |accessdate=26 June 2008 |isbn=3-11-008700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread throughout the Roman Empire===
Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's well-defined network of roads and waterways allowed for easier travel, while the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' made it safe to travel from one region to another. The government had encouraged inhabitants, especially those in urban areas, to learn Greek as the common language, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.&lt;ref name=bokenkotter24&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see [[Idolatry]]). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.&lt;ref name=macculloch155and164&gt;MacCulloch, ''Christianity'', pp. 155–159, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- is this entire para cited to McCullough only from 3 pages? --&gt;

In 313, the struggles of the [[Early Church]] were lessened by the [[Edict of Milan|legalisation of Christianity]] by the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]]. In 380, Christianity became the [[state religion]] of the Roman Empire by the [[Edict of Thessalonica|decree of the Emperor]], which would persist until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and, later, with the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] until the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. During this time (the period of the [[Seven Ecumenical Councils]]) there were considered five primary sees according to [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]: Rome, [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], known as the [[Pentarchy]].

===Late Antiquity===
In the centuries after the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, [[Western Christianity]] was a major factor in the preservation of [[Classical antiquity|classical civilisation]], especially classical art and literacy (see [[Illuminated manuscript]]).&lt;ref&gt;How The Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe by Thomas Cahill, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Rule]], [[Benedict of Nursia]] (c.480–543), the founder of [[Western monasticism]] exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture.  During this period, monastic [[Ireland]] became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as [[Columbanus|St Columbanus]] and [[St Columba]] spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Thomas. ''How the Irish Saved Civilization''. Hodder and Stoughton, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Christianity]], the Byzantine Empire preserved [[Orthodoxy]] well after the massive invasions of [[Islam]] in the [[Christianity in the 7th century|mid-7th century]]. The invasions of Islam devastated three of the five [[Patriarchal see]]s, capturing Jerusalem first, then Alexandria and then, finally, in the [[Christianity in the 8th century|mid-8th century]], Antioch. The whole period of the next five centuries was dominated by the struggle between [[Christianity and Islam]] throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The battles of Poitiers and Toulouse preserved the Catholic tradition even though Rome itself was ravaged in 850 and Constantinople was besieged.&lt;!-- this summary isn't cited, won't tag it, but needs sources --&gt;

===Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods===
The Catholic Church was the dominant influence on [[Western civilisation]] from late antiquity to the dawn of the modern age.  It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, pp. 115–27&lt;/ref&gt; Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Tintoretto, Titian, Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guido of Arezzo]] (992 c. – 1050), a monk of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] is regarded as the inventor of modern musical staff notation.  Catholic monks employed this musical notation in order to standardise liturgy throughout the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; An enormous body of religious music has been composed for the Church through the ages including compositions recognized as among the greatest productions of the [[Classical music]]. This church sponsored tradition led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music and its many derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 13th century [[mendicant orders]] were founded by [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzmán]].  In contrast to the monastic orders of the Church in the Benedictine tradition the mendicants brought consecrated religious life and ministry into urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;Le Goff, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''studia conventuale'' and ''[[studium generale|studia generale]]'' of the mendicant orders played a large role in the transformation of Church sponsored [[cathedral school]]s and palace schools, such as that of [[Charlemagne]] at [[Aachen]], into the prominent universities of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, pp. 44–48&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest [[Thomas Aquinas]] studied and taught at ''studia'' such as the Convent of St Jacques in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couvent_des_Jacobins_(rue_Saint-Jacques) Accessed June 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually become the Order's first ''[[studium generale]]''.  Aquinas' ''Summa Theologica'', which was begun at the ''studium provinciale'' at the Roman convent of [[Santa Sabina]] was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkotter, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt;

The Counter Reformation, the period of Catholic revival beginning with the Council of Trent (1545– 1563), saw the rise of religious orders such as the [[Society of Jesus]], better known as the Jesuits.

===Doctrinal disputes and schisms===
{{seealso2|[[Criticism of the Catholic Church#Criticism of Catholic actions in history|Criticism of Catholic actions in history]]}}
In the [[Christianity in the 11th century|11th century]], already strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the [[Latin]] church separated them into the [[East-West Schism|Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity]] respectively, partially due to conflicts over [[Papal authority]]. The fourth [[crusade]] and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach.&lt;!-- 2 sentence to cover 500 years? Also, needs a source --&gt; In the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th century]], in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Catholic Church engaged in a process of substantial reform and renewal, known as the [[Counter-Reformation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman81&quot;&gt;Norman 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Unsure if this is the correct reference--&gt; &lt;!-- you have to read the book, will check my sources --&gt; In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of [[religious scepticism]] during and after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

In 1854 Pope Pius IX with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html |title=John Paul II, General Audience, March 24, 1993 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=24 March 1993 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] affirmed the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]] when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leith&quot;&gt;Leith, ''Creeds of the Churches'' (1963), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy232&quot;&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the [[Old Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahlbusch&quot;&gt;Fahlbusch, ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'' (2001), p. 729&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Vatican Council===
The [[Second Vatican Council]] in the 1960s introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the [[Council of Trent]] four centuries before. Initiated by [[Pope John XXIII]], this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the [[vernacular]] (local language) and encouraging &quot;fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html |title=CONSTITUTION ON THE SACRED LITURGY SACROSANCTUM CONCILIUM |publisher=Vatican.va |date=4 December 1963 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It intended to engage the Church more closely with the present world (''[[aggiornamento]]''), which was described by its advocates as an &quot;opening of the windows&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy272&quot;&gt;Duffy, pp. 270–276&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the Church's approach to [[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenism]],&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 272, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially [[Judaism]], in its document ''[[Nostra Aetate]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOSTRA AETATE&quot;&gt;Pope Paul VI. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html ''Nostra Aetate'': Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions]. 28 October 1965. Retrieved 2011-06-16. According to Section 4: &quot;True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms; proponents of the &quot;[[Spirit of Vatican II]]&quot; such as [[Switzerland|Swiss]] theologian [[Hans Küng]] claimed Vatican II had &quot;not gone far enough&quot; to change church policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traditionalist Catholics]], such as [[Archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]], however, strongly criticised the council, arguing that the council's liturgical reforms led &quot;to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments,&quot; among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neel, Brian.

===New evangelisation===
[[File:President and Mrs. Reagan meet Pope John Paul II 1982.jpg|thumb|[[Pope John Paul II]] with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]].]]

[[Pope John Paul II]] recognised the need to [[evangelise]] an increasingly [[secular]] world and used new means to reach the faithful. He instituted [[World Youth Day]], a &quot;worldwide encounter with the Pope&quot;, for young people from all over the world which is celebrated every two to three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madrid11.com/en/what-is-wyd |title=WYD 2011 Madrid – Official Site – What is WYD? |publisher=Madrid11.com |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled more than any other pope, visiting 129 countries and preaching the Gospel in nearly every part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P.G. (2006). Chronicle of the Popes: Trying to Come Full Circle. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 234. ISBN 978-0-500-28608-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He also used television and radio as means of spreading the Gospel. In 2012, on the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, the Church called a new [[Synod]] to address the &quot;New Evangelization&quot; and the task of re-evangelizing the many lapsed Catholics in the developed world.

===Sexuality and gender issues===
{{see also|Catholic Church and women|Catholic teachings on sexual morality|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic ordination of women}}
Soon after the close of the Second Vatican Council, Church teachings about sexuality became an issue of increasing controversy due to changing cultural attitudes in the [[Western world]] (see the [[Sexual Revolution]]). 

The Church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a married man and woman, and should be without the use [[artificial birth control]] or [[contraception]].  In his encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;humanae&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul VI|first=Pope|title=Humanae Vitae|publisher=Vatican|year=1968|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html|accessdate=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1968), Pope [[Paul VI]] firmly rejected all artificial contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the [[birth control pill]] as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of [[natural family planning]].  This teaching was continued especially by [[John Paul II]] in his encyclical ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'', where he clarified the Church's position on [[contraception]], [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] by condemning them as part of a &quot;culture of death&quot; and calling instead for a &quot;culture of life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter493&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 27, p. 154, pp. 493–494&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church teaches that homosexual inclinations are &quot;objectively disordered&quot; &lt;ref&gt;CCC,No. 2358, http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html#fn9&lt;/ref&gt; and so homosexual behavior is &quot;contrary to the natural law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#-2E5 |title=CCC, 2357 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church teaches that people who have homosexual tendencies are called to live chastely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#-2E5 |title=CCC, 2359 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, it offers help to those who wish to overcome their tendency towards their own sex. Because of these teachings, as well as its teaching that marriage is between one man and one woman,&lt;ref&gt;CCC 1601–1605&lt;/ref&gt; the Catholic Church firmly opposes [[same-sex marriage]]. However this position, as well as its [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|position on homosexuality]] in general, has [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism#Dissent from official Church position|generated criticism]] from non-Catholics as well as a number of Catholics.

In religious vocations, Catholic women and men are ascribed different roles—men serve as [[deacon]]s, [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]], [[friar]]s, [[monk]]s, [[Brother (Catholic)|brothers]], [[abbott]]s or in [[Bishop|episcopal]] positions while women serve as nuns, religious sisters or abbesses. Monks and brothers often house together in [[monastery|monasteries]] while nuns and sisters may house themselves in convents – though an [[abbey]] may host a religious community of men or women. In other roles, the Church does not distinguish between men and women, who may be equally recognised as [[saint]]s, [[doctor of the church|doctors of the church]], [[catechist]]s in schools, [[altar server]]s, [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]] at Mass, or as readers (lectors) during the liturgy. 

While [[Holy Orders]] are reserved for men,  [[Catholic Church and women|Catholic women]] have played diverse roles in the life of the church, with [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institutes]] providing a formal space for their participation and [[convent]]s providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the Church's worldwide health and education service networks.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  

Efforts in support of the [[Catholic ordination of women|ordination of women]] led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or Popes against the proposal, as in ''[[Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood]]'' (1976), ''[[Mulieris Dignitatem]]'' (1988) and ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]'' (1994). According to the latest ruling, found in ''Ordinatio Sacerdotalis'', Pope John Paul II concluded, &quot;I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_22051994_ordinatio-sacerdotalis_en.html ''Apostolic Letter ''Ordinatio Sacerdotalis'' of John Paul II to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone''] Copyright ©1994 Libreria Editrice Vaticana.

===Sex abuse cases===
{{Main|Catholic sex abuse cases}}
In the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy became the subject of media coverage and public debate in [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country|countries around the world]]. The Church was criticised for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences. In response to the scandal, the Church has established formal procedures to prevent abuse, encourage reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Willey |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10645748 |title=Vatican 'speeds up' abuse cases |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
