[[Native American religion]] in Canada was largely [[animist]]ic. This included an intense reverence for [[spirit]]s and nature.&lt;ref&gt; Native North American Religious Traditions: Dancing for Life - Page 5, Jordan D. Paper - 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[French colonization of the Americas|French settlement]] beginning in the 17th century established a Roman Catholic francophone population in [[Lower Canada]], now [[Quebec]], followed by [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlement]] that brought [[Anglicans]] and other [[Protestants]] to [[Upper Canada]], now [[Ontario]]. The [[Quebec nationalism|religious, cultural, and political antagonism]] between Canadian Protestants and Catholics remains a central theme of [[Canadian history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown1&quot;/&gt;

It has been suggested that Canada is a [[secularity|secular]] state, where practice of religion is declining, and [[irreligion]] is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mennoworld.org/2012/8/20/religion-canada-way-out/ Is religion in Canada on the way out?] – Retrieved 2012-10-06&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://life.nationalpost.com/2012/04/07/religion-not-important-to-most-canadians-although-majority-believe-in-god-poll/ Poll: Most Canadians say religion not important] retrieved 2012-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{seealso|History of freedom of religion in Canada}}

===To 1800===
[[File:Le Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons 1632 Gabriel Sagard.jpg|thumb|''Le Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons'', [[Gabriel Sagard]], 1632.]]
By 1667 the Jesuits had established a station near present-day [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. Before the arrival of Europeans, the [[First Nations]] followed a wide array of mostly [[animistic]] religions. See also [[Native American mythology]]. The first Europeans to settle in great numbers in Canada were [[France|French]] [[Latin Rite|Latin rite]] [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]s, including a large number of [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuits]] dedicated to converting the natives; an effort that eventually proved successful.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Guthrie Marquis, ''Jesuit missions: A chronicle of the cross in the wilderness'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after they were conquered by the British. Unable to convince enough British immigrants to go to the region, the government decided to import continental Protestants from [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] to populate the region and counterbalance the Roman Catholic [[Acadians]]. This group was known as the [[Foreign Protestants]]. This effort proved successful and today the [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]] region of [[Nova Scotia]] is still largely Lutheran.  After the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]] a large number of [[New England Planters]] settled on the vacated lands bringing with them their [[Congregationalist]] belief. During the 1770s, guided by [[Henry Alline]], the [[New Light]] movement of the [[Great Awakening]] swept through the Atlantic region converting many of the Congregationalist to the new theology. After Alline's death many of these Newlights eventually became Baptists, thus making Maritime Canada the heartland of the Baptist movement in Canada.&lt;ref&gt; Beverley, James and Barry Moody, Editors. The Journal of Henry Alline. Lancelot Press for the Acadia Divinity School and the Baptist Historical Committee. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bumsted, J. M.  Henry Alline.  Lancelot Press, Hantsport, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rawlyk, George.  The Sermons of Henry Alline. Lancelot Press for Acadia Divinity College and The Baptist Historical Committee of the United Baptist Convention of the Atlantic Provinces.  1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 acknowledged the rights of the Roman Catholic Church throughout [[Lower Canada]] in order to keep the French-Canadians loyal to Britain.

The American Revolution brought about a large influx of Protestants to Canada. [[United Empire Loyalists]], fleeing the rebellious United States, moved in large numbers to [[Upper Canada]] and the [[Maritime provinces|Maritimes]]. They comprised a mix of Christian groups with a large number of [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglicans]], but also many [[Presbyterians]] and [[Methodists]].

===19th century===
While Anglicans consolidated their hold on the upper classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the Methodist revivals, often sponsored by visiting preachers from America. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Church]] from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851-53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a clear call for personal commitment, coupled with followup action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in Christian perfection. Caughey successfully bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bush, &quot;The Reverend James Caughey and Wesleyan Methodist Revivalism in Canada West, 1851-1856,&quot; ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1987, Vol. 79 Issue 3, pp 231-250&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:St Pauls, Halifax.JPG|thumb| [[St. Paul's Church (Halifax)|St. Paul's Church]], Halifax. The oldest Anglican Church in Canada still standing, built in 1750]]

In the early nineteenth century in the Maritimes and Upper Canada, the Anglican Church held the same official position it did in England. This caused tension within English Canada, as much of the populace was not Anglican. Increasing immigration from Scotland created a very large Presbyterian community and they and other groups demanded equal rights. This was an important cause of the [[1837 Rebellion in Upper Canada]]. With the arrival of [[responsible government]], the Anglican monopoly was ended.&lt;ref&gt;George Rawlyk,  ''The Contribution of Presbyterianism to the Maritime Provinces'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lower Canada, the Roman Catholic Church was officially pre-eminent and had a central role in the colony's culture and politics.  Unlike English Canada, French-Canadian nationalism became very closely associated with Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}} See drop-down essay on &quot;Early European Settlement and the Formation of the Modern State&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Roman Catholic Church in the region became one of the most reactionary in the world. Known as [[Ultramontane]] Catholicism, the church adopted positions condemning all manifestations of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond J. Lahey, ''The First Thousand Years: A Brief History of the Catholic Church in Canada'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics, those aligned with the Roman Catholic clergy in Quebec were known as ''[[parti bleu|les bleus]]'' (the blues). They formed a curious alliance with the staunchly monarchist and pro-British Anglicans of English Canada (often members of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]) to form the basis of the Canadian [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]]. The Reform Party, which later became the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], was largely composed of the anti-clerical French-Canadians, known as ''[[parti rouge|les rouges]]'' (the reds) and the non-Anglican Protestant groups. In those times, right before elections, parish priests would give sermons to their flock where they said things like ''Le ciel est bleu et l'enfer est rouge''. This translates as &quot;Heaven/the sky is blue and hell is red&quot;.

By the late nineteenth century, Protestant pluralism had taken hold in English Canada. While much of the elite were still Anglican, other groups had become very prominent as well. [[Toronto]] had become home to the world's single largest [[Methodist]] community and it became known as the &quot;Methodist Rome&quot;. The schools and universities created at this time reflected this pluralism with major centres of learning being established for each faith. One, King's College, later the [[University of Toronto]], was set up as a non-denominational school.  The influence of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] was strong, especially among Irish Protestant immigrants, and comprised a powerful anti-Catholic force in Ontario politics; its influence faded away after 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil J. Houston,  and William J.  Smyth, ''The sash Canada wore: A historical geography of the Orange Order in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The late nineteenth century also saw the beginning of a large shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] and Southern European immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada. The population of the west brought significant [[Eastern Orthodox]] immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] immigrants from the United States and Ireland

===20th century===
In 1919-20 Canada's five major Protestant denominations (Anglican, Baptist, Congregational, Methodist, and Presbyterian) cooperatively undertook the &quot;Forward Movement.&quot; The goal was to raise funds and to strengthen Christian spirituality in Canada. The movement invoked Anglophone nationalism by linking donations with the Victory Loan campaigns of the First World War I, and stressed the need for funds to Canadianize immigrants. Centred in Ontario, the campaign was a clear financial success, raising over $11 million. However the campaign exposed deep divisions among Protestants, with the traditional evangelists speaking of a personal relationship with God and the more liberal denominations emphasizing the [[Social Gospel]] and good works.&lt;ref&gt;Daryl Baswick, &quot;Social Evangelism, the Canadian Churches, and the Forward Movement, 1919-1920,&quot; ''Ontario History'' vol 12#1 1997, pp 303-319&lt;/ref&gt; Both factions (apart from the Anglicans) agreed on prohibition, which was demanded by the [[WCTU]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Anne Cook, &quot;'Earnest Christian Women, Bent on Saving our Canadian Youth': The Ontario Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Scientific Temperance Instruction, 1881-1930,&quot; ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1994, Vol. 86 Issue 3, pp 249-267&lt;/ref&gt; 

Domination of Canadian society by Protestant and Roman Catholic elements continued until well into the 20th century, however. Until the 1960s, most parts of Canada still had extensive [[Blue law|Lord's Day]] laws that limited what one could do on a Sunday. The English-Canadian elite were still dominated by Protestants, and Jews and Roman Catholics were often excluded. A slow process of liberalization began after the [[Second World War]] in English-Canada. Overtly Christian laws were expunged, including those against [[homosexuality]].  Policies favouring Christian immigration were also abolished.

The most overwhelming change occurred in the [[Quiet Revolution]] Quebec in the 1960s. In 1950, the province was one of the most traditional Roman Catholic areas in the world. Church attendance rates were high, and the school system was largely controlled by the church. In the 1960s, the Catholic Church lost most of its influence in Quebec, and religiosity declined sharply.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}} See drop-down essay on &quot;History Since 1960&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of Québécois are still professed Latin rite Roman Catholics, rates of church attendance are today extremely low, in fact, they are the lowest of any region in North America today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Common law]] relationships, [[abortion]], and support for [[same-sex marriage]] are more common in Quebec than in the rest of Canada.

[[File:United Church of Canada inauguration 1925.jpg||right|thumb|Inauguration of United Church at Mutual Street Arena, Toronto, on June 10, 1925]]

English Canada also underwent secularization. The [[United Church of Canada]], the country's largest Protestant denomination, became one of the most liberal major Protestant churches in the world. It is committed to gay rights including marriage and ordination, and to the ordination of women. The United Church has seen its membership decline substantially since the 1990s, and other mainline churches have seen similar declines, while overall church attendance has increased in the 2000s.

In addition, a strong current of evangelical Protestantism exists outside of Quebec. The largest groups are found in the Atlantic Provinces and [[Western Canada]], particularly in [[Alberta]], southern [[Manitoba]] and the southern interior and Fraser Valley region of [[British Columbia]], also known as the &quot;Canadian Bible Belt&quot;. There is also a significant evangelical population in southern Ontario. In these areas, particularly outside the Greater Toronto Area, the culture is more conservative, somewhat more in line with that of the Midwestern and southern United States, and same-sex marriage, abortion, and common-law relationships are less popular. This movement has grown considerably in the past few years (primarily in those areas listed above) due to strong influences on public policy and stark divides, not unlike those in the United States, although the overall proportion of evangelicals in Canada remains considerably lower and the polarization much less intense. There are very few evangelicals in Quebec and in the largest urban areas, which are generally secular, although there are several congregations above 1000 in most large cities.&lt;ref&gt;George A. Rawlyk, ''Aspects of the Canadian Evangelical Experience'' (McGill-Queen's, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Census results===
In the [[Canada 2001 Census]], 72% of the Canadian population list [[Roman Catholicism]] or [[Protestantism]] as their religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;census2001&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=55822&amp;APATH=3&amp;GID=431515&amp;METH=1&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=56&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;AID=0&amp;PLACENAME=0&amp;PROVINCE=0&amp;SEARCH=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30c-eng.htm |title=Summary Tables |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrahamic religions==
===Bahai Faith===
The Canadian community is one of the earliest western communities, at one point sharing a joint National Spiritual Assembly with the United States, and is a co-recipient of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The first North American woman to declare herself a Bahá'í was Mrs. [[Kate C. Ives]], of Canadian ancestry, though not living in Canada at the time. [[Moojan Momen]], in reviewing &quot;The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of Canada, 1898–1948&quot; notes that &quot;the Magee family... are credited with bringing the Bahá'í Faith to Canada. [[Edith Magee]] became a Bahá'í in 1898 in Chicago and returned to her home in London, Ontario, where four other female members of her family became Bahá'ís. This predominance of women converts became a feature of the Canadian Bahá'í community...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_hoonaard_origins_bahai |title=Origins of the Baha'i Community of Canada 1898-1948, The, by Will C. van den Hoonaard |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Denominations of Canada}}
The majority of Canadian Christians attend [[Church service|church]] infrequently.  Cross-national surveys of religiosity rates such as the Pew Global Attitudes Project indicate that, on average, Canadian Christians are less observant than those of the [[United States]] but are still more overtly religious than their counterparts in Western Europe. In 2002, 30% of Canadians reported to Pew researchers that religion was &quot;very important&quot; to them. A 2005 Gallup poll showed that 28% of Canadians consider religion to be &quot;very important&quot; (55% of Americans and 19% of Britons say the same).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/20986/Can-Reagan-Revolution-Happen-Canada.aspx |title=Can a &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; Happen in Canada? |publisher=Gallup.com |date=Jan 20, 2006 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional differences within Canada exist, however, with [[British Columbia]] and [[Quebec]] reporting especially low metrics of traditional religious observance, as well as a significant urban-rural divide, while [[Alberta]] and rural [[Ontario]] saw high rates of religious attendance. The rates for weekly church attendance are contested, with estimates running as low as 11% as per the latest Ipsos-Reid poll and as high as 25% as per ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine. This American magazine reported that three polls conducted by [[Focus on the Family]], Time Canada and the Vanier Institute of the Family showed church attendance increasing for the first time in a generation, with weekly attendance at 25 per cent. This number is similar to the statistics reported by premier Canadian sociologist of religion, Prof. [[Reginald Bibby]] of the [[University of Lethbridge]], who has been studying Canadian religious patterns since 1975. Although lower than in the US, which has reported weekly church attendance at about 40% since the Second World War, weekly church attendance rates are higher than those in Northern Europe.

As well as the large churches — Roman Catholic, United, and Anglican, which together count more than half of the Canadian population as nominal adherents — Canada also has many smaller Christian groups, including [[Orthodox Christianity]]. The [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] population in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] ([[Greater Toronto]] in particular) has seen a large influx of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] population in just a few decades. The relatively large [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] population of [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] has produced many followers of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] and [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]]es, while southern Manitoba has been settled largely by Mennonites. The concentration of these smaller groups often varies greatly across the country.  Baptists are especially numerous in the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]]. The Maritimes, prairie provinces, and [[southwestern Ontario]] have significant numbers of [[Lutherans]]. Southwest [[Ontario]] has seen large numbers of German and Russian immigrants, including many [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]], as well as a significant contingent of Dutch Reformed. [[Alberta]] has seen considerable immigration from the American plains, creating a significant [[Mormon]] minority in that province. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] claims 178,102 members (74,377 of that is in Alberta) as of year-end 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/canada-alberta Alberta]. LDS Newsroom.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] year report there are 111,963 active members (members who actively preach) in Canada.

Canada as a nation is becoming increasingly religiously diverse, especially in large urban centres such as [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Montreal]], where minority groups and new immigrants who make up the growth in most religious groups congregate. Two significant trends become clear when we examine the current religious landscape closely. One is the loss of ‘secularized’ Canadians as active and regular participants in the churches and denominations they grew up in, which were overwhelmingly [[Christian]], while these churches remain a part of Canadians cultural identity. The other is the increasing presence of ethnically diverse immigration within the religious makeup of the country.

[[File:Notre Dame Basilica Montreal.jpg|left|thumb|[[Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal)|Notre-Dame Basilica]], a Roman Catholic church in [[Old Montreal]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. On its completion in 1888, it was the largest church in North America.]]

As Mainline [[Protestant]]s and [[Roman Catholic]]s have experienced drastic losses over the past 30 years, others have been expanding rapidly: overall by 144% in ‘Eastern’ religions during the 1981-1991 decade.&lt;ref&gt;Roger O’Toole, “Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation” In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars’ Press, 2006), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering Canada’s increasing reliance on immigration to bolster a low birth rate, the situation is only likely to continue to diversify. This increased influx of ethnic immigrants not only affects the types of religions represented in the Canadian context but also the increasingly multicultural and multilingual makeup of individual Christian denominations. From [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Anglican]] or [[South Korea|Korean]] [[United Church]] communities, to the [[Lutheran]] focus on providing much needed services to immigrants new to the Canadian context and [[English language]], immigration is making changes.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Hillis, “Outsiders Becoming Mainstream: The Theology, History and Ethnicity of Being Luthern in Canada” In P. Bramadat &amp; D. Seljak, Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada. (Toronto: Pearson Longman, 2005), 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, adapting to a new [[secular]] context has meant adjusting to their non-institutional roles in society by increasingly focusing on [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger O’Toole, “Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation” In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars’ Press, 2006), 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the pull between conservative religious members and the more radical among the church members is complicated by the numbers of immigrant communities who may desire a church that fulfills a more ‘institutionally complete’ role as a buffer in this new country over the current tension filled debates over [[same-sex marriage]], [[ordination]] of women and homosexuals, or the role of women in the church. This of course will depend on the background of the immigrant population, as in the [[Hong Kong]] context where [[ordination]] of Florence Li Tim Oi happened long before women’s ordination was ever raised on the Canadian [[Anglican]] church level.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Fletcher, “Canadian Anglicanism and Ethnicity” In P. Bramadat &amp; D. Seljak, Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada. (Toronto: Pearson Longman, 2005.), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well a [[multicultural]] focus on the churches part may include non-Christian elements (such as the inclusion of a [[Buddhist]] priest in one incident) which are unwelcome to the transplanted religious community.&lt;ref&gt;Greer Anne Wenh-In Ng, “The United Church of Canada: A Church Fittingly National” In P. Bramadat &amp; D. Seljak, Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada. (Toronto: Pearson Longman, 2005), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Serving the needs and desires of different aspects of the Canadian and newly Canadian populations makes a difficult balancing act for the various mainline churches which are starved for money and active parishioners in a time where 16% of Canadians identify as non-religious and up to two-thirds of those who do identify with a denomination use the church only for it’s life-cycle rituals governing birth, marriage, and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Analytic/companion/rel/canada.cfm |title=96F0030XIE2001015 - Religions in Canada |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church retains that hold in their [[parishioner]]’s lives but not the commitment of time and energy necessary to support an aging institution.

A loud portion of the [[evangelical]] and [[sectarian]] [[Protestant]] groups proclaim their growth as well but as Roger O’Tool notes they make up 7% of the Canadian population and seem to gain most of their growth from a higher birthrate.&lt;ref&gt;Roger O’Toole, “Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation” In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars’ Press, 2006), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  What is significant is the higher participation of their members in contrast to Mainline [[Protestant]]s and [[Roman Catholic]]s. This high commitment would seem to translate into the kind of political power evangelicals in the United States enjoy but despite Canada's historically [[Christian]] background as Lori Beaman notes neatly “...[forming] the backdrop for social process”&lt;ref&gt;Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars’ Press, 2006), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; explicit religiosity appears to have not effectively moved the government towards legal discrimination against gay marriage. Much as many Roman Catholics in [[Quebec]] ignore the Church’s stance on [[birth control]], [[abortion]], or [[premarital sex]], the churches do not dictate much of the daily lives of regular Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Roger O’Toole, “Religion in Canada: Its Development and Contemporary Situation” In Lori Beaman, ed., Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars’ Press, 2006), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Christianity remains a [[social justice]] and community force within Canada but its cultural loss of active and engaged participants has not been supplanted by the gains in immigrant numbers, thus Canada’s religious landscape has become increasingly diverse.

===Islam===
{{See|Islam in Canada}}
Four years after Canada's founding in 1867, the 1871 Canadian Census found 13 Muslims among the population.&lt;ref&gt;1871 Census of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The first Canadian [[mosque]] was constructed in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in 1938, when there were approximately 700 Muslims in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Aramco World: Canada's Pioneer Mosque: http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199804/canada.s.pioneer.mosque.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This building is now part of the museum at [[Fort Edmonton Park]]. The years after [[World War II]] saw a small increase in the Muslim population. However, Muslims were still a distinct minority. It was only with the removal of European immigration preferences in the late 1960s that Muslims began to arrive in significant numbers.

According to [[Canada 2001 Census|Canada's 2001 census]], there were 579,740 [[Muslim]]s in Canada, just under 2% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a-eng.htm?sdi=religion |title=Population by religion, by province and territory (2001 Census) |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Muslim population was estimated to be 0.8 million or about 2.6%. In 2010, the Pew Research Centre estimates there were about 0.9 million Muslims in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/muslim-population/?sort=Pop2010 |title=World Muslim Population Data Tables - Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |publisher=Features.pewforum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 65% were Sunni, while 15% were Shia.&lt;ref name=environics&gt;http://www.environicsinstitute.org/PDF-MuslimsandMulticulturalisminCanada-LiftingtheVeil.pdf -- Muslims and Multiculturalism in Canada.

In 2007, the [[CBC Television|CBC]] introduced a popular television sitcom called ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'', a contemporary reflection and critical commentary on attitudes towards [[Islam]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/littlemosque/ |title=CBC Television - Little Mosque on the Prairie |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Prime Minister of Canada, [[Stephen Harper]], visited the [[Baitun Nur]] Mosque, the largest mosque in Canada for its inaugural session with the Head of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]].&lt;ref name=&quot;canada1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=c1ce5c3b-de23-4093-85b8-36162ac636a6|title=Politicians and faithful open Canada's largest mosque|last=Morton|first=Graeme|work=Canada.com|publisher=Canwest News Service|date=Jul 5, 2008|accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See|Judaism in Canada|Antisemitism in Canada}}
[[File:AaronHart.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Aaron Ezekiel Hart|Aaron Hart]] is considered to be the father of Canadian Jewry]]
[[File:Holy Blossom Temple.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The [[Holy Blossom Temple]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]]]]
The [[Jewish]] community in Canada is almost as old as the nation itself. The earliest documentation of [[Jew]]s in Canada are British Army records from the [[French and Indian War]] from 1754. In 1760, General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst]] attacked and won [[Montreal]] for the British. In his regiment there were several Jews, including four among his officer corps, most notably Lieutenant [[Aaron Hart (businessman)|Aaron Hart]] who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shalomquebec.org/members.aspx?mid=349|title=Hart, Aaron|accessdate=2009-03-25|work=Exposition Shalom Québec}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807, [[Ezekiel Hart]] was elected to the legislature of [[Lower Canada]], becoming the first Jew in the [[British Empire]] to hold an [[official position]]. Hart was sworn in on a [[Hebrew Bible]] as opposed to a [[Christian Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Beginning of Jewish Emancipation in Canada: The Hart Affair|publisher=''Michael'', vol. 10|first=Michael|last=Brown|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=One a Day: An Anthology of Jewish Historical Anniversaries for Every Day of the Year|first=Abraham P.|last=Bloch|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc|year=1987|page=31|isbn=0-88125-108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day an objection was raised that Hart had not taken the oath in the manner required for sitting in the assembly — an oath of abjuration, which would have required Hart to swear &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Jewish Mosaic|last=Weinfeld|first=Morton|coauthors=Shaffir, William; [[Irwin Cotler|Cotler, Irwin]]|year=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-79929-7|pages=262, 385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was expelled from the assembly, only to be re-elected two more times. In 1768, the first synagogue in Canada was built in Montreal, the [[Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal]]. In 1832, partly because of the work of Ezekiel Hart, a law was passed that guaranteed Jews the same political rights and freedoms as Christians.

The Jewish population saw a growth during the 1880s due to the [[pogroms]] of [[Russia]] and growing [[anti-Semitism]]. Between the years of 1880 and 1930 the Jewish population grew to 155,000. In 1872, [[Henry Nathan, Jr.]] became the first Jewish [[Member of Parliament]], representing the [[Victoria, BC]] area in the newly created [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The First World War halted the flow of immigrants into Canada, and after the War there was a change in Canada's immigration policy to limit the immigration of people from &quot;non-preferred nations&quot;, i.e., those not from the United Kingdom or otherwise [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] nations. In June 1939 Canada and the United States were the last hope for 907 Jewish refugees aboard the steamship [[SS St. Louis]] which had been denied to land in Havana  although the passengers had entry visas. The Canadian government ignored the protests of Canadian Jewish organizations. King said the crisis was not a &quot;Canadian problem&quot; and Blair added in a letter to O.D. Skelton, Undersecretary of State for External Affairs, dated June 16, 1939, &quot;No country could open its doors wide enough to take in the hundreds of thousands of Jewish people who want to leave Europe: the line must be drawn somewhere.&quot; The ship finally had to return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/canada.html |title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour - Canada |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]] almost twenty thousand Canadian Jews volunteered to fight overseas. Nearly 40,000 [[Holocaust]] survivors moved to Canada in the late 1940s to rebuild their lives.

Today the Canadian Jewish community is the sixth largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] of 1901-1906 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/table.jsp?table_id=427&amp;volid=11&amp;title=STATISTICS]&lt;/ref&gt; and practices in both of the official languages of Canada. There is an increase in the number of people that use [[Hebrew]], other than religious ceremonies, while there is a decline in the [[Yiddish]] language. Most of Canada's Jews live in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], with [[Toronto]] having the largest Jewish population centre. Recently, anti-Semitism has been a growing concern in Canada. In 2009, anti-Semitic incidents jumped a fivefold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/immigration/article/793643--anti-semitism-incidents-jump-five-fold-in-canada |title=Anti-semitism incidents jump five-fold in Canada |publisher=thestar.com |date=Apr 11, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=Toronto |first=Nicholas |last=Keung}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with over 113 incidents, and some reports listing 479 in Toronto alone.

==Dhamic religions==
===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism in Canada}}
Hindus in Canada generally come from one of three groups. The first is primarily made up of [[India]]n [[immigrants]] who began arriving in [[British Columbia]] about 100 years ago and continue to immigrate today (Hindus from all over India immigrate to Canada today, but the largest Indian subgroups are the [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]s and [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s).  The second major group of Hindus immigrated from [[Sri Lanka]], going back to the 1940s, when a few hundred [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] migrated to Canada. The 1983 communal riots in [[Sri Lanka]] precipitated the mass exodus of [[Tamils]].  A third group is made up of Canadian converts to the various sects of [[Hinduism]] through the efforts of the [[Hare Krishna movement]], the [[Gurus]] during the last 50 years, and other organizations.

According to the 2001 [[Census]] of Canada, there were 297,200 practitioners of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 2004| url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/highlight/Religion/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;View=1a&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=1&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=2&amp;B1=01&amp;B2=All| title =Selected Religions, for Canada, Provinces and Territories - 20% Sample Data| work =Religions in Canada: Highlight Tables, 2001 Census| publisher =[[Statistics Canada]]| accessdate =2006-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[non-profit]] organization ''Association for Canadian Studies'' estimates the Hindu population grew to 372,500 by 2006, or just under 1.2% of the population of Canada. The vast majority of Hindus reside in [[Ontario]] (primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]], Brampton, Hamilton, Windsor &amp; [[Ottawa]]), [[Quebec]] (primarily around the [[Montreal]] area) &amp; [[British Columbia]], (primarily around the [[Vancouver]] area). Have significant populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats&quot;/&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism in Canada}}
There is a small, rapidly growing [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] community in Canada. As of the 2001 count, 300,346 Canadians identified their religion as Buddhist&lt;ref name=&quot;www40.statcan.gc.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo30a-eng.htm |title=Population by religion, by province and territory (2001 Census) |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (about 1% of the population).

Buddhism has been practiced in Canada for more than a century and in recent years has grown dramatically. Buddhism arrived in Canada with the arrival of Chinese laborers in the territories during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=A.W.

==Other religions==
===Wicca===
{{main|Odyssean Wicca}}
'''Odyssean Wicca''' is a [[Wicca]]n tradition created in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in the late 1970s. Its principal founders were  Tamarra and Richard James. Most of its practitioners today live in Ontario, but it also has members in the United States.{{Ref|DFW}} The tradition differs from other [[initiation|initiatory]] Wiccan traditions in its emphasis on preparation of its members for public priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Pagan Studies - Page 131, Barbara Jane Davy - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Wiccan Dictionary - Page 89, Charles Arnold - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Druidry===
In [[Neo-Druidism|Neo-Druid]] history a notable community was the [[Reformed Druids of North America]], one of whose four Founders was a Canadian, which was served the US Druid community as well as the Canadian Druid community. Neo-Druidism largely spread in Canada through the Ancient Order of the Druids during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia - Volumes 1-5 - Page 1353, John T. Koch - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitarian Universalism===
[[Unitarian Universalism]] is a religion characterized by support for a &quot;free and responsible search for [[truth]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(The 4th principle of Unitarian Universalism)[http://www.uua.org/visitors/6798.shtml UUA.org Seven principles]&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists do not share a [[creed]]; rather, they are unified by their shared search for [[spiritual growth]] and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not obedience to an authoritarian requirement.

== Unaffiliated (Irreligion)==
{{See|Irreligion in Canada}}
Irreligious Canadians include [[atheists]], [[agnostics]], and [[humanists]]. The surveys '''may''' also include those who are [[spirtuality|spiritual]], [[deists]], and [[pantheists]]. In 1991, they made up 12.3 percent which, according to the 2001 census, increased to 16.2 percent. Some non-religious Canadians have formed associations, such as the [[Humanist Association of Canada]], [[Toronto Secular Alliance]] or the [[Centre for Inquiry Canada]], as well as a number of University Campus Groups.

===Agnostics and atheists===
In 2011, a survey conducted by [[Ipsos-Reid]] shows that 47% believed religion does more harm in the world than good, while 64% believed that religion provides more questions than answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5328 |title=Canadians Split On Whether Religion Does More Harm in the World than Good |date=Sep 12, 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 Canadian Press Harris-Decima telephone survey of just over 1,000 Canadians found 23% were willing to state they do not believe in any god.&lt;ref&gt;

A sample of the same size has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Ipsos Reid poll released September 12, 2011 entitled &quot;Canadians Split On Whether Religion Does More Harm in the World than Good,&quot; sampled 1,129 Canadian adults and came up 30% who do not believe in a god. Interestingly, the same poll found that 33% of respondents who identified themselves as Catholics and 28% Protestants said they didn't believe in a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5328 |title=Canadians Split On Whether Religion Does More Harm in the World than Good &amp;#124; Ipsos |publisher=Ipsos-na.com |date=Sep 12, 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 80-question mail-in survey of 420 Canadians by Carleton University Survey Centre and the Montreal-based Association for Canadian Studies found 30% agreed with the statement &quot;I know God really exists and I have no doubts&quot;, 20% acknowledged they &quot;have doubts&quot; but &quot;feel that I do believe in God&quot;, 10% answered they believe in God &quot;sometimes&quot;, 20% said they don't believe in a &quot;personal God&quot; but &quot;do believe in a higher power&quot;, 12% adopted the classic agnostic position and said they &quot;don't know whether there is a God and don't believe there is a way to find out&quot;, and 7% said no god exists. Slightly more than half believed in heaven, while less than a third believed in hell, with 53.5% saying they believed in life after death. About 27% said they believe in reincarnation, and 50% expressed belief in religious miracles.&lt;ref&gt;
The results of this survey are considered accurate to within 4.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

Both the [[preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and the national anthem in both languages refer to God. Nevertheless the rise of irreligion within the country  and influx of non-Christan peoples has led to a greater separation of government and religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertsClifton2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lance W.

Canada is a [[Commonwealth realm]] in which the [[head of state]] is shared with 15 other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]]. The UK's succession laws bar Roman Catholics or those who marry Catholics from inheriting the throne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/28/uk-royal-succession-rules_n_1064062.html | work=Huffington Post | title=U.K. Royal Succession Rules To Change | date=Oct 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reigning monarch is also ''ex officio'' [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. Within Canada, the Queen's title includes the phrases &quot;By the Grace of God&quot; and &quot;[[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]].&quot;

[[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] are nationwide holidays, and while Jews, Muslims, and other groups are allowed to take their holy days off work they do not share the same official recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Boyle|title=Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MFUZkWWgOtMC&amp;pg=PA103|date=Aug 5, 1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-15978-4|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Parliament declared [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] &quot;a day of general thanksgiving to almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/thanksgiving/holiday.html]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of the country [[Sunday shopping]] is still banned, but this is steadily becoming less common. There was an ongoing battle in the late 20th century to have religious garb accepted throughout Canadian society, mostly focused on [[Sikh]] [[turban]]s.
