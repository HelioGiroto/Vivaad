The '''Witch of Endor''', sometimes called the [[Mediumship|medium]] of [[Endor (village)|Endor]], was a woman who apparently called up the [[ghost]] of the recently deceased [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], at the demand of King [[Saul the King|Saul]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united kingdom)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the [[Books of Samuel|First Book of Samuel]], chapter {{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|28:3–25|HE}}. The witch is absent from the version of that event recounted in the [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] Book of [[Sirach]] (47:19–20).

==Story==
After Samuel had died, he was buried in [[Ramathaim-Zophim|Ramah]]. After Samuel's death Saul received no answer from God from [[dream]]s, prophets, or the [[Urim and Thummim]] as to his best course of action against the assembled forces of the [[Philistines]]. Consequently Saul, who has earlier driven out all [[necromancer]]s and [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]] from Israel, seeks out a medium, anonymously and in disguise. Following the instruction of her visitor, the woman claims that she sees the ghost of Samuel rising from the abode of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geza Vermes]] (2008)'' The Resurrection''. London, Penguin: 25–6&lt;/ref&gt; The voice of the prophet's ghost, after complaining of being disturbed, berates Saul for disobeying God, and predicts Saul's downfall, with his whole army, in battle the next day, then adds that Saul and his sons will join him, then, in the abode of the dead. Saul is shocked and afraid, and following the encounter his army is defeated and Saul commits suicide after being wounded.

The woman is described as &quot;a woman with an ob&quot; (אוֹב, a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil G. Hirsch]] [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] 1911 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=366&amp;letter=E Endor, the witch of]&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps [[Bota bag|wineskin]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H178&amp;t=KJV Blueletterbible.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in Hebrew, which may be a reference to [[ventriloquism]],&lt;ref&gt;The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia p307  ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley – 1959 &quot;... of 'ob (RSV &quot;medium&quot;). According to one view it is the same word that means a &quot;bottle made out of skins&quot; (&quot;wineskin,&quot; Job 32:19). The term would then refer to the technique of ventriloquism or, more accurately, &quot;belly-talking&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to see &quot;[[elohim]] arising&quot; (plural verb) from the ground.

==Interpretations==
===Judaism===
In the [[Septuagint]] (2nd century BCE) the woman is described as a &quot;[[ventriloquist]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Josef Klauck, Brian McNeil ''Magic and paganism in early Christianity: the world of the Acts of the Apostles'' p66 2003 &quot;A classical example is King Saul's visit to the 'witch' of Endor. The Septuagint says once that the seer engages in 'soothsaying' and three times that she engages in 'ventriloquism' (1 Sam 28:6–9).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; possibly reflecting the consistent view of the Alexandrian translators concerning &quot;demons... which exist not&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Milian Lauritz Andreasen '' Isaiah the gospel prophet: a preacher of righteousness''  2001 p345&quot;The Septuagint translates: They &quot;burn incense on bricks to devils which exist not.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Josephus]] (1st century) appears to find the story completely credible (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 6,14).
[[File:Witch_of_Endor_(Nikolay_Ge).jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Witch of Endor'' by [[Nikolai Ge]], 1857.]]
The [[Yalkut Shimoni]] (11th century) identifies the anonymous witch as the mother of Abner.&lt;ref&gt;Yalḳ, Sam. 140, from Pirḳe R. El.&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the witch's claim to have seen something, and Saul having heard a disembodied voice, the Yalkut suggests that necromancers are able to see the spirits of the dead but are unable to hear their speech, while the person for whom the person was summoned hears the voice but fails to see anything.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil G. Hirsch]] [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] 1911 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=366&amp;letter=E Endor, the witch of]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The [[Church Fathers]] and some modern Christian writers have debated the [[Theology|theological]] issues raised by this text. The story of King Saul and the Witch of Endor would appear at first sight to affirm that it is possible for humans to summon the spirits of the dead by [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. 

Medieval [[glosses to the Bible]] suggested that what the witch actually summoned was not the ghost of Samuel, but a [[demon]] taking his shape or an illusion crafted by the witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10735a.htm|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Necromancy|accessdate=05-Sep-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]], who believed that the dead were unconscious, read that it was &quot;the Devil's ghost&quot;, whereas [[John Calvin]], who did believe in the immortal soul, read that &quot;it was not the real Samuel, but a spectre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Buckley – ''Faith Healing, Christian Science and Kindred Phenomena'' p221 2003, &quot;The witch of Endor – The account of the &quot;Witch of Endor is the only instance in the Bible where a description of the processes and ... Luther held that it was &quot;the Devil's ghost&quot;; Calvin that &quot;it was not the real Samuel, but a spectre. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Christian author [[Hank Hanegraaff]] argues that although it is impossible for humans to summon the dead, Samuel did appear before Saul and the witch by a sovereign act of God.  Hanegraaff interprets the passage to mean that the witch was surprised by these events.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

[[Christian mortalism|Mortalist]] denominations such as [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] generally teach that the story is but one example of ancient witchcraft or sorcery in the bible, which is founded on an unholy belief that people can communicate with the dead. Adventists believe that the bible teaches repeatedly, but most specifically in Ecclessiastes 9:5,6, &quot;For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.&quot; Seventh-day Adventists believe that communication with the dead is a form of magic, divination, sorcery, necromancy, and spiritualism which are all condemned in scripture. Adventists assert that since the scriptures teach that the dead know not anything, Saul was not communicating with the prophet Samuel, but with Satan.&lt;ref&gt;White, E. G. (1999). Patriarchs and Prophets. Napa, Idaho: Pacific Press Publishing Association, p. 683.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, E. G. (1999). Acts of the Apostles. Napa, Idaho: Pacific Press Publishing Association, pp. 288–290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, E. G. (1858). The Great Controversy Between Christ and Satan. Napa, Idaho: Pacific Press Publishing Association, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The witch appears as a character in [[oratorio]]s (including ''Mors Saulis et Jonathae'' (c.1682) by [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]], ''In Guilty Night: Saul and the Witch of Endor'' (1691) by [[Henry Purcell]], and ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'' (1738) by [[Handel]] on the death of Saul) and operas (''[[David et Jonathas]]'' (1688) by the afore-mentioned Charpentier and ''[[Saul og David]]'' (1902) by [[Carl Nielsen]]).

A year after the death of his son at Loos, [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote a poem called [[Wikisource:En-Dor|En-Dor]] (1916), about [[Séance|communicating with the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Tonie Holt, Valmai Holt ''My boy Jack: the search for Kipling's only son'' – 1998 p. 234 &quot;Desperate as they were, there is no evidence that Rudyard and Carrie ever contemplated trying to reach John in this way and Rudyard's scorn for those who did was expressed in the poem En-dor, written the following year.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes,
{{cquote|Oh the road to En-dor is the oldest road&lt;br&gt;And the craziest road of all!&lt;br&gt;Straight it runs to the Witch’s abode,&lt;br&gt;As it did in the days of Saul,&lt;br&gt;And nothing has changed of the sorrow in store&lt;br&gt;For such as go down on the road to En-dor!}}

A British [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] with the name The Witch of Endor is commandeered by Captain Horatio Hornblower during his escape from France in ''[[Flying Colours (novel)|Flying Colours]]'' (1938), a novel by [[C.S. Forester]] set in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The poet [[Howard Nemerov]] wrote a one act drama entitled &quot;Endor&quot; (1961) in which Saul visits the Witch of Endor.

The mother of the witch Samantha on the TV sitcom [[Bewitched]] was named Endora.

In the book series [[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]], the Witch of Endor is a secondary character.

''&quot;In Endor&quot;'' by [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]], describing [[Saul the King|King Saul]]'s encounter with the Witch of Endor, is considered a major work of modern Hebrew poetry. Tchernichovsky particularly identified with the character of Saul, perhaps due to his own name, and the poem expresses considerable empathy to this King's tragic fate.  

The Israeli [[Kibbutz]] [[Ein Dor]] derives its name from the Biblical witch's place of residence.

[[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] is a fictional planet in the Star Wars universe, and is referenced in the sixth film ''[[The Return of the Jedi]]''

The Witch of Endor is the title of a song by artist ''[[Moondog]]''
