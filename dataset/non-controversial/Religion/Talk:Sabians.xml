== Questions on Sabis==
No one ever called Muhammad a Sabian and there is no evidence that ablution or the movements in the Muslim prayers of worship were taken from the Sabians.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.225.142.150|71.225.142.150]] ([[User talk:71.225.142.150|talk]]) 09:59, 22 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

This article is confusing.

IS this a religious group or a ethnic group? the article gives the impression that we don'T know much about these people. It also seems strange that they occasionally seem to come from the greek region, yet all their beliefs are semitic and so is their language? Like I said - very confusing.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.57.98.33|74.57.98.33]] ([[User talk:74.57.98.33|talk]]) 05:39, 13 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

the answer:
''&quot;The pastor asked, Muslim students say&quot;'' book

''They have seven prayers, which correspond to five times of prayer of the Muslims, the sixth is the Duha prayer, which is also available on the Muslims. The different of this ruling voluntary prayers in the Muslims. The seventh time was just six o'clock at night. They also have a corpse in prayer, without bowing and prostration. Their fasting month of the year, like the Muslims, but time is from the tribe last night until sunset. Such fasting is quite similar to the fasting Muslims.''

In the book ''&quot;History of the Muslim New edition of the writings and research [[Hamka|Prof. Dr.Hamka]]&quot;'' under the heading of nations before the birth of Muhammad pages 83;

''told it's true this group is a group of Arabs in the community. This group have called 'Sabi'ah. Their belief that the star pocket and space, is confident that this something seala, movements and silence, walking and cessation of all the stringed instruments and related to the course of the stars. That's why the face of each star is no name, no dignity, and there are homes that are determined for each performance.To sun is home, for months there is his house, so also Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury and other -other, and every star that is idol the like. Venus or Venus, the god of beauty, so he still found the idol of Venus was the Roman state, too bad the broken hand side, is a very beautiful woman. From there the religion Sabi'ah apparently taking it. But there is more to enlarge the group of states Sabi'ah Mecca, pilgrimage, sacred game ban, do not like to eat pork, and do not want marriage of kinship; similar to the beliefs of Muslims.''  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/113.23.132.206|113.23.132.206]] ([[User talk:113.23.132.206|talk]]) 10:05, 16 May 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Why does the search string &quot;Hekal Tiamat&quot; redirect here?==

Why?

:Good question. Just for neats, I'm going to redirect it to [[Acheron (band)]] instead, since that's the only reference to the phrase Google turns up. It's metal's problem now. (And for extra tidy, I'm  going to slip in a subheading down here to lop off the I-presume-unconnected ravings below.

===Anonymous drive-by silliness===
- This Wikipedian article is pure JEWISH OCCULT... term &quot;Sabeans&quot; were originally members of the cult of Shiba - Shiva, before &quot;Noah&quot;. Other names were also &quot;Sabeani&quot;, Saviani or Slaviani (old Slavs, before arrival of Semites)

also &quot;Tiamat&quot; was derived from &quot;Dia or Djiva or Jiiva or Zhiva Maat - which means &quot;living mother&quot; Shiva (Hathor) in Slavic and Sanskrit, as old Aryan kingdom, before this OCCULT Wikipedian nonsense

:{{huh}}??{{fact}}?? [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit. ([[User talk:Rursus|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; background: #FFFF80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;bork&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]!) 19:37, 15 March 2011 (UTC)

== Do they still exist? ==

Just watched some interviews with Iraqi refugees on the redacted DVD, and several of them say they are of the Sab'i sect, which would be this one I assume So why is it all in past tense? [[User:FunkMonk|FunkMonk]] ([[User talk:FunkMonk|talk]]) 19:57, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
:I'd also like some detail on this. It's impossible to tell, from the article as it stands, what happened to the Sabians and whether any still exist. [[Special:Contributions/86.143.50.243|86.143.50.243]] ([[User talk:86.143.50.243|talk]]) 17:12, 24 February 2011 (UTC)

== Subjective Mess ==

This article is riddled with highly subjective material and conclusions without reference- a heavy edit for encyclopedic content is needed; I will endeavor to do so- with the informed aid of the peer group.[[User:Mavigogun|Mavigogun]] ([[User talk:Mavigogun|talk]]) 06:29, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I have discovered that all of the Arabic source quotes given are published in Chowolson's 2 volume German work on the subject.[[Special:Contributions/82.6.30.147|82.6.30.147]] ([[User talk:82.6.30.147|talk]]) 21:30, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

=== Subjective Mess II ===
For me the &quot;information&quot; of the article is non-digestible, like f.ex. wax, and as tasteless as well. What's the relevancy of a statement like this:
:''Sabian in Hebrew also means drunk or drunkard.''
? Also it seems like the Sabians are/were:
* general apostates from X to Y,
* Greek,
* a crossbreed betw Jews and Babylonians,
* Mandeans,
* monotheists,
* no polytheists,
* ...
I would rather like that they were a people mentioned in various sources, f.ex. S, T and U, known to be located at L, M and N. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit. ([[User talk:Rursus|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; background: #FFFF80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;bork&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]!) 18:29, 15 March 2011 (UTC)

:Now how come that the article claims:
:*the Ṣabians read from a holy book called &quot;Zaboor&quot;/&quot;Zabur&quot; and similar,
:*the Ṣabians have nothing whatsoever to do with the Sabeans&lt;sup&gt;''[citation verily needed, by '''High Jove!''']''&lt;/sup&gt; because of Ṣad/Sin
:but
:*the [[Sabaeans]] write in an alphabet called &quot;Zabur&quot;,
:*and the article of [[Sabaeans]] only have a Roman Emperor source, and in the roman alphabet, there is neither Ṣad nor Sin, but just an 'S' [ɛss]??
:I think the distinction between &quot;Ṣabians&quot; and &quot;Sabaeans&quot; is unsupported this far. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] dixit. ([[User talk:Rursus|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red; background: #FFFF80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;bork&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]!) 19:36, 15 March 2011 (UTC)

==Mandaean OR section moved to Talk==
Seems to be 100% [[WP:OR]] [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 02:57, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
START
:'''Mandaeans'''
{{main|Mandaeism}}
Some scholars{{Who|date=July 2011}} hold that the Sabians mentioned in the Qur'an are those currently referred to as [[Mandaeans]], while others contend that the [[etymology]] of the root word 'Sabi'un' points to origins either in the [[Syriac]] or [[Mandaic]] word 'Sabian', and suggest that the Mandaean religion originated with Sabeans who came under the influence of early Hellenic Sabian [[missionaries]], but preferred their own priesthood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

After the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], [[Harran]] came to be a center of [[intellectual]] and [[religious]] activity, which evolved into a [[philosophical]] tradition centered on [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. The Harranians were heavily influenced by other religious groups, including those of the baptizing sects, and in this way the Mandaean Nasaraean Sabians would come into existence. They followed the Nasr (a white eagle lord) and called their community Miryai.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mandaeans/Miriai3.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:10:20&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1st century AD they were heavily influenced by the [[Christian]]s but reacted against Pauline Christianity, possibly absorbing the Ebionites.

Various religious groups holding some Gnostic Harranian beliefs (like the Mandaeans) have sought to justify application of the term to themselves in the hopes of avoiding persecution. Thus Mandaeans have become known as Subi (Sabian) by their Muslim neighbors in both Iraq and Iran. However, they could just have equally applied to come under the category of Nasaari because the application of this title to them predated the earliest Christians by at least a century.

== Jews Christians and Sabians ? ==
&quot;mentioned three times in the Quran with the people of the Book, &quot;the Jews, the Sabians, and the Christians.&quot;&quot; 

Here is the thing. The Quran doesn't explicitly say that these three are &quot;the people of the book&quot; !!
