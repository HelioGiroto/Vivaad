&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew Name|שָׂרָה|Sara|Śārā}} &lt;small&gt;[[ISO 259-3]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Śarra''; {{lang-la|Sara}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|سارة}} ''Sārah''; [[Persian language|Persian]]: {{lang|fa|سارا}} ''Sārā'') was the wife of [[Abraham]] and the mother of [[Isaac]] as described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Quran]]. Her name was originally '''Sarai'''. According to ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' 17:15 God changed her name to Sarah as part of a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] after [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] bore Abraham his first son, [[Ishmael]].

The Hebrew name ''Sarah'' indicates a woman of high rank and is translated as &quot;[[princess]].&quot;

==In the Hebrew Bible==
[[File:Tissot Abram's Counsel to Sarai.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Abram’s Counsel to Sarai (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
Sarah was the wife of Abraham, as well as being his half-sister, the daughter of his father [[Terah]] (Genesis 20:12). The Talmud &lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 69B&lt;/ref&gt; identifies Sarai with [[Iscah]], daughter of Abraham's deceased brother [[Haran]] (Genesis 11:29), so that Sarah turns out to be the niece of Abraham and the sister of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] and [[Milcah]]. She was also the mother-in-law of [[Rebecca]], her successor. She was considered beautiful to the point that Abraham feared that when they were near more powerful rulers she would be taken away and given to another man. Twice he purposefully identified her as being only his sister so that he would be &quot;treated well&quot; for her sake.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 12:12-13, 20:2&lt;/ref&gt; It is apparent that she remained attractive into her later years. Despite her great beauty, she was barren for an unknown reason.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 11:30&lt;/ref&gt; She was originally called &quot;Sarai&quot; which is translated &quot;my princess.&quot; Later she was called &quot;Sarah&quot; i.e., princess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 17:15&lt;/ref&gt; In Biblical times, the changing of one's name was significant and used to symbolize the binding of a covenant. In this case, God promised to put an end to her barrenness and give her a child (Isaac).&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 17:16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Henry]]'s Commentary suggests that Sarai=&quot;my princess&quot; would refer to a single family and Sarah=&quot;a princess&quot; signified one of many, ie many families, in parallel to the change from Abram to Abraham&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departure from Ur ===
Terah, with Abram, Sarai and Lot, departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named [[Haran (Biblical place)|Haran]], where Terah died at the age of 205. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:27–11:32|HE}}) God then told Abram to leave his country and his father's house for a land that He would show him, promising to make of him a great nation, [[blessing|bless]] him, make his name great, bless those who blessed him, and curse those who cursed him. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:1–3|HE}}) Following God's command Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the wealth and persons that they had acquired, and traveled to [[Shechem]] in [[Canaan]]. Abram was 75 and Sarai was 65 at this time.

===Pharaoh's harem===
[[File:Tissot Sarai Is Taken to Pharaoh's Palace.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Sarai Is Taken to Pharaoh's Palace'' by [[James Tissot]].]]
There was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, travelled south to &lt;!-- northern --&gt;[[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. On the journey to Egypt, Abraham instructed Sarai&lt;ref&gt;Sarah is the sister of Abram by another mother and wife of Abraham as described in the Hebrew Bible (the Book of Genesis) and the Quran. In Genesis:17:15 God changes her name to Sarah (princess) &quot;a woman of high rank&quot;) as part of the covenant with El Shaddai after Hagar bears Abram his first born son Ishmael. (Hebrew: שָׂרָה, Standard Sara Tiberian Śārāh ; Arabic: 'سارة, Sārah; The name Sarai uses the semitic root Šarai or law and like El has the sense of power, authority, lord, deity, natural law, law as might be expected for the lady of the house. The Hebrew name Sarah indicates a woman of high rank (less than that of 1st wife) and is sometimes translated as &quot;princess.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; to identify herself only as his sister, fearing that Pharaoh would kill him in order to take his wife, saying, &quot;I know what a beautiful woman you are. When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'this is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live. Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 12:11-13, NIV&lt;/ref&gt; When brought before Pharaoh, Sarai said that Abraham was her brother, and the king thereupon took her into his palace and bestowed upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. It is likely that Sarai acquired her Egyptian maidservant Hagar during this stay. However, God afflicted Pharaoh's household with great plagues.({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:14–17|HE}}) He then realized that Sarai was also Abram's wife and demanded that they leave Egypt immediately.({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:18–20|HE}})

===Hagar and Ishmael===
[[File:Abraham renvoyant Agar.jpg|thumb|215px|right|''Banishment of Hagar'', Etching. À Paris chez Fr. Fanet, Éditeur, Rue des Saints Pères n° 10. 18th century. Sarah is seen on the left side, looking]]After having lived in Canaan for ten years and still childless, Sarai suggested that Abram have a child with her servant Hagar, to which Abram agreed. This resulted in tension between Sarai and Hagar, and Sarai complained to Abram that the latter no longer respected her. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:1–6|HE}}) At one point, Hagar fled toward [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]] but returned after being instructed to by an angel. She gave birth to Abram's son Ishmael when Abram was eighty-six years old. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:7–16|HE}})

=== Isaac ===
{{Bibleverse||Genesis|17|HE}} records the inauguration of Abram into God's covenant that was initiated thirteen years ago, as was stated in Genesis 15. When Abram was ninety-nine, God declared Abram's new name: “Abraham, a father of many nations.” Abram then received the instructions to circumcise every male in his household for the inauguration rite into God's covenant because the time was approaching for him to have a son by his wife, Sarai. Then God declared Sarai's new name: “Sarah” and blessed her. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:1–27|HE}})

Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired to Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child for her age as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.

As had been prophesied in the previous year ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis18_sml.htm#genesis_18:14 Genesis 18:14]), Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, now a hundred years old, named the child &quot;[[Isaac]]&quot; (Hewbrew yitschaq, laughter) and circumcised him when he was eight days old. ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:4 Genesis 21:4]) For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, &quot;God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me.&quot; ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:6 Genesis 21:6]-[http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:7 7]) Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 21:9&lt;/ref&gt; and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 21:10&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:12|HE}})

=== Abimelech ===
[[File:Sara-filia Aran.jpg|thumb|left|Sarah, as depicted on ''[[Guillaume Rouillé|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]'']]
After being visited by the three men, Abraham and Sarah settled between [[Kadesh (South of Israel)|Kadesh]] and [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]] in the land of the [[Philistine]]s. While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham again claimed that Sarah was his sister. King [[Abimelech]] subsequently had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman. Abimelech, who had not laid hands on her, inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that was why he continued to exist. However, if he did not return Sarah to Abraham, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.({{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:1–7|HE}})

Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham replied that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: &quot;And yet indeed ''she is'' my sister; she ''is'' the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Gen.|20:12|9|Genesis 20:12}}) Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all. Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since the {{LORD}} had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:8–18|HE}})

===Death===
Sarah, who died at the age of 127, is the only woman in Hebrew scriptures whose age is given.&lt;ref&gt;The ages of some other women can be deduced or approximated. Eve was created the same day as Adam, so when Seth was born when Adam had lived 130 years, Eve had lived as long also, short a number of hours.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham buried her in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] (also called the Cave of Machpelah), near [[Hebron]] which he had purchased, along with the adjoining field, from Ephron the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] and laid her to rest in the cave. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|23|9|Genesis 23:1&amp;ndash;20}})

== In rabbinic literature ==

===Pharaoh's harem===
When brought before Pharaoh, Sarah said that Abraham was her brother, and the king thereupon bestowed upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction.&lt;ref name=Yashar&gt;[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]] (Book of Jasher), section &quot;Lek Leka&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a token of his love for Sarai the king deeded his entire property to her, and gave her the land of Goshen as her hereditary possession: for this reason the Israelites subsequently lived in that land.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pirḳe R. El.]] xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarai prayed to God to deliver her from the king, and He thereupon sent an angel, who struck Pharaoh whenever he attempted to touch her. Pharaoh was so astonished at these blows that he spoke kindly to Sarai, who confessed that she was Abraham's wife. The king then ceased to annoy her.&lt;ref name=Yashar/&gt; According to another version, Pharaoh persisted in annoying her after she had told him that she was a married woman; thereupon the angel struck him so violently that he became ill, and was thereby prevented from continuing to trouble her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Genesis Rabbah]] xli. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one tradition it was when Pharaoh saw these miracles wrought in Sarai's behalf that he gave her his daughter Hagar as slave, saying: &quot;It is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house.&quot; Abimelech acted likewise.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah xlv. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Hagar===
[[File:Foster Bible Pictures 0032-1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Abraham]], Sarah and [[Hagar]]'', imagined here in a Bible [[illustration]] from 1897.]]
Sarai treated Hagar well, and induced women who came to visit her to visit Hagar also. Hagar, when pregnant by Abraham, began to act superciliously toward Sarai, provoking the latter to treat her harshly, to impose heavy work upon her, and even to strike her &lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah xlv. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe Sarai was originally destined to reach the age of 175 years, but forty-eight years of this span of life were taken away from her because she complained of Abraham, blaming him as though the cause that Hagar no longer respected her.&lt;ref name=RH16b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah xlv. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah was sterile; but a miracle was granted to her&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah xlvii. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; after her name was changed from &quot;Sarai&quot; to &quot;Sarah&quot;.&lt;ref name=RH16b&gt;[[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] 16b.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one myth, when her fertility had been restored and she had given birth to [[Isaac]], the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notabilities to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, also, who brought their infants with them; and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the strange children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bava Metzia]] 87a; comp. Gen. R. liii. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Legends connect Sarah's death with the attempted sacrifice of Isaac,&lt;ref&gt;Gen. R. lviii. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; there being two versions of the story. According to one, Samael came to her and said: &quot;Your old husband seized the boy and sacrificed him. The boy wailed and wept; but he could not escape from his father.&quot; Sarah began to cry bitterly, and ultimately died of her grief.&lt;ref&gt;Pirḳe de Rabbi Eliezer xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the other legend, Satan came to Sarah disguised as an old man, and told her that Isaac had been sacrificed. Believing it to be true, she cried bitterly, but soon comforted herself with the thought that the sacrifice had been offered at the command of God. She started from Beer-sheba to Hebron, asking everyone she met if he knew in which direction Abraham had gone. Then Satan came again in human shape and told her that it was not true that Isaac had been sacrificed, but that he was living and would soon return with his father. Sarah, on hearing this, died of joy at Hebron. Abraham and Isaac returned to their home at Beer-sheba, and, not finding Sarah there, went to Hebron, where they discovered her dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]], section &quot;Wayera&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Genesis Rabbah]], during Sarah's lifetime her house was always hospitably open, the dough was miraculously increased, a light burned from Saturday evening to Saturday evening, and a pillar of cloud rested upon the entrance to her tent.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah lx. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament references==
The [[First Epistle of Peter]] praises Sarah for obeying her husband.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 3:6, cited in {{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is named in the Hebrews &quot;hall of faith&quot; alongside a number of other Biblical figures.&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 11:11&lt;/ref&gt; Other New Testament references to Sarah are in Romans&lt;ref&gt;Romans 4:19 and 9:9, cited in {{CathEncy|wstitle=Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Galatians&lt;ref&gt;Gal 4:22-23&lt;/ref&gt; In Galatians 4, she and Hagar are used as an allegory of the old and new covenants:

''&quot;For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise. These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother...Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise...Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Galatians 4:22-26, 28, 31, NIV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Mausoleum Sayyeda Sarah bint Nabi Ibrahim.JPG|thumb|right|Mausoleum of Sarah, Abraham's wife in the Mosque of Abraham]]
Sarah ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: سارة, ''Sara''), the wife of the [[patriarch]] and [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Islamic view of Abraham|Abraham]] and the mother of the [[prophet]] [[Islamic view of Isaac|Isaac]], is an honoured woman in the [[Islam]]ic faith. According to [[Muslim]] belief, she was Abraham's first wife. Although not mentioned by name in the [[Qur'an]], she is referenced and alluded to via the story of her husband. She lived with Abraham throughout her life and, although she was barren, [[God in Islam|God]] promised her the birth of a prophetic son, [[Isaac]].
Muslim [[tradition]] holds that Sarah and Abraham had no children. Abraham, however, prayed constantly to God for a son. Sarah, being barren, subsequently gave him her [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[handmaiden]],&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad'', Martin Lings, Chapter 1. ''The House of God'', Suhail Academy Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic view of Hagar|Hājar]] ([[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]]), to wed as his second wife. Hagar bore [[Islamic view of Ishmael|Ismā'īl]] ([[Ishmael]]), when Abraham was 86,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:16}}: &quot;And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; who too would become a prophet of God like his father. Thirteen years later, God announced to Abraham, now a hundred,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:5}}: &quot;And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that barren Sarah would give birth to a second son, Isaac, who would also be a prophet of the Lord. Although the Qur'an does not mention Sarah by name, it mentions the annunciation of the birth of Isaac. The Qur'an mentions that Sarah laughed when the angels gave her the glad tidings of Isaac, which is perhaps why the name Isaac has the root meaning of 'laughter'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Isaac Isaac - name meaning, origin]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, 'Peace!' He answered, 'Peace!' and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.&lt;br&gt;But when he saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: &quot;Fear not: We have been sent against the people of [[Islamic view of Lot|Lut]].&lt;br&gt;And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;She said: &quot;Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!&quot;|Qur'an, [[Sura]] 11 ([[Hud (sura)|Hud]]), [[Ayah|ayat]] 69-72&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|11|69|e=72|s=ns}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}
There is a necessary clarification that Sarah was not annoyed with Hagar but it was only the order from Allah that Abraham bring them in the Arab Desert. According to Islamic teachings, it was Ishmael, not Isaac, whom God ordered Abraham to sacrifice to test him.

==Tomb of Sarah==
[[File:Tomb of Sara.jpg|thumb|right|Mausoleum of Sarah, 1911.]]
Sarah is believed to be buried in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] (known by Muslims as the ''Sanctuary of Abraham''). The compound, located in the ancient city of [[Hebron]], is the second holiest site for [[Jews]] (after the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]]), and is also venerated by [[Christian]]s and Muslims, both of whom have traditions which maintain that the site is the burial place of three Biblical couples: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and [[Rebecca]], and Jacob and [[Leah]]. According to the book of Genesis, Abraham purchased the plot of land for her tomb from a man named Ephron the Hittite.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 23&lt;/ref&gt; Although some Jews alternatively also believe this to be the burial place for [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], this is a view not usually adopted by Christians or Muslims.

== Contemporary works and analysis ==
[[File:OSCsarah.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Sarah has been featured in several novels, and she is the central character in ''[[Sarah (Women of Genesis series)|Sarah]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]] in [[the Women of Genesis series]], ''Sarai: A Novel'' by Jill Eileen Smith, and ''Sarah: A Novel'' by [[Marek Halter]]. In the [[Christian fiction]] novel ''[[Redeeming Love]]'' by [[Francine Rivers]], the protagonist, called &quot;Angel&quot; throughout the duration of the story, is barren. At the end of the book, she reveals that her birth name is &quot;Sarah&quot; to her husband, who takes the revelation as a promise from God that they will one day be able to have children.

In the 1994 movie [[Abraham (film)|Abraham]], Sarah is portrayed by [[Barbara Hershey]].

Sarah is also a subject discussed in nonfiction books. In ''Twelve Extraordinary Women'' by Pastor [[John F. MacArthur]], her life and story is analyzed along with that of [[Eve]], [[Rahab]], [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary the mother of Jesus]], [[Anna (Bible)|Anna]], [[Samaritan woman at the well|the Samaritan woman]], [[Mary of Bethany]], [[Martha of Bethany]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and [[Lydia (Bible)|Lydia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Twelve Extraordinary Women: How God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You'' (2008) ISBN 1-4002-8028-1&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah appears in ''Slightly Bad Girls of the Bible: Flawed Women Loved by a Flawless God'' by Liz Curtis Higgs alongside several other Biblical women.&lt;ref&gt;Higgs, Liz, ''Slightly Bad Girls of the Bible: Flawed Women Loved by a Flawless God''. 978-1400072125&lt;/ref&gt;

Some classical and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. [[Rashi]] argued that when a stranger comes to town, the proper thing to do would be to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham to the fact that ''there is no fear of God in this place'', and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable tp Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery. On the other hand, commentators such as Allan Turner, in his essay &quot;Lying: Is It Ever Right?&quot;, takes the standpoint that the patriarchal individuals did not actually lie, but merely concealed part of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;&quot; http://allanturner.com/lying.html &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have questioned Sarah's status as Abraham's sister, notably [[biblical archaeology|biblical archaeologists]]. According to Emanuel Feldman (1965), basing his argument on [[William F. Albright|Albright]]'s interpretation of the archaeology of [[Nuzu]], a wife could legally be awarded the title &quot;sister&quot;, and that this was the most sacred form of marriage, and hence Abraham and Isaac referred to their wives as &quot;sisters&quot; for this reason. Most archaeologists however dispute that view, instead arguing the opposite - that sisters in the region were often awarded the title &quot;wife&quot; in order to give them much greater status in society.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuel Feldman. Changing patterns in Biblical criticism.
