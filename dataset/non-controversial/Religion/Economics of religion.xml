The '''economics of [[religion]]''' or, especially in [[sociology]], '''religious economy'''  applies [[social economics|socio-]][[Economics|economic]] theory and [[economic methodology|methods]] to explain the religious behavioral patterns of individuals, groups or [[cultural economics|cultures]] and the social consequences of such behavior. An example of the first is [[Adam Smith]]'s analysis of the effect of [[competition (economics)|competition]] and government regulation (or support) for religious denominations on the quantity and quality of religious services.&lt;ref&gt;• Adam Smith, 1776 1904.

==Development==
The ''theory of religious economy'' arises from the application of fundamental principles of economics to the analysis of religious organizations. Just as commercial economies consist of a market in which different firms compete, religious economies consist of a market (the aggregate demand for religion) and firms (different religious organizations) seeking to attract and hold clients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt; The theory of religious economy was developed to explain why and how religions change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt;

==Market situation==
According to the theory, [[religious pluralism]] gives the population a wide variety of choices in religion and leads to a religious economy in which different [[religious organizations]] compete for followers, much the way businesses compete for consumers in a commercial [[economy]]. The Theory of Religious Economy takes into account a wide spectrum of issues (e.g., the differences between competitive religious markets and religious [[monopoly|monopolies]]), making this theory one of the most significant developments in the social scientific study of religion during the past thirty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion |year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory  focuses attention on religious suppliers and whether religious firms have the ability to increase the demand for religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 1997&quot;/&gt;

In a free market, or [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]] religious market, many religious organizations exist and seek to appeal to certain segments of the market. Organizations in a free market cannot rely on the state for resources so they must compete for participation of the religious consumer. Contest among religious firms results in the specialization of products so that consumers are able to distinguish different organization from others(Chesnut). Pluralistic religions operate on a personal scale, marketing more to individual demands as opposed to public. As the majority of the consumer market, organizations market more to women than men. Pluralism is only possible through lack of favoritism by the state.(Chesnut) A competitive and pluralistic religious economy has a positive effect on levels of participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

A [[microeconomic]] theory of the [[household production function]] and time allocation is associated with the work of [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago]] economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;• Gary S. Becker, 1965. “A Theory of the Allocation of Time,” ''Economic Journal'' 75 (299), [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2228949 p. 493]-517.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • _____, 1973. &quot;A Theory of Marriage: Part I.&quot; ''Journal of Political Economy'', 81(4), pp. [http://www.fep.up.pt/docentes/pcosme/micro-g102/beckerJPE1973.pdf 813-846.]&lt;/ref&gt; An influential approach dating from the 1970s adapts that theory to explain religious participation and a resulting formation of norms. It postulates stable preferences and [[rational choice]] constrained by limited [[human capital|human]] and [[social capital]] to explain behavior.&lt;ref&gt;• Corry Azzi and [[Ronald Ehrenberg]],  1975. &quot;Household Allocation of Time and Church Attendance,&quot; ''Journal of Political Economy'', 83(1), pp. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1833272 27]-56.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Ronald G.

As in economics, the market situation can be described with concepts about monopoly, prohibition, and pluralism. Monopolies in religion are only made possible through state enforcement and often function on a public scale. When the government establishes a set religion and all other competition is drowned out then &quot;believers are culturally connected but not necessarily spiritually&quot;(Andrew Chesnut) to the religion enforced by the state. Since participation in a religious monopoly is not as important because the church does not have to rely on members for resources they are not forced to provide adequate or marketable &quot;religious products&quot;(Chesnut), due to lack of competition. The ability of a religious organization to monopolize a religious economy is entirely dependent on the extent to which the state governs the religious economy. A monopolized religious economy tends to have lower levels of participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states may categorically ban religious observances, and attempt to sanction those who persist in displaying religious conviction. [[Disestablishmentarianism]] results from state withdrawal from an organization that was originally established under the state.

Theorists{{Who|date=June 2008}} argue that, much as a grocery store sells food, religious groups attempt to &quot;sell&quot; [[belief]]s and [[idea]]s. They attempt to influence the religious 'consumer' to choose their product. Two important ways to influence believers are [[morals]] and fear.

Morals are the concepts of right and wrong. Moral communities are groups within the religious communities in which there is a very high agreement on [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and strong bonds of attachment among members. Moral behaviors of individuals are influenced by their religious commitments only in societies where the dominant organizations give clear and consistent expression to divine moral imperatives.

Religious markets are similar to other markets in that they are social creations. The exchanges that take place in a religious market are regulated by social factors. Elements of social interactions such as norms and morals influence the individual choices and preferences of the religious consumer. Therefore, elements of social interactions influence the types of religious goods offered to consumers in the marketplace and the changes in consumer demands over a span of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

According to [[W. Robertson Smith]], &quot;The fear of the gods was a motive to enforce the laws of society which were also the laws of morality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson Smith, W.: Religion of the Semites; with a new introduction by Robert A. Segal., New Brunswick, N.J. : Transaction Publishers, c2002.&lt;/ref&gt; People are taught that those who believe will gain rewards or avoid punishment in the afterlife, and non-believers will miss out on the rewards or receive punishment.

==Major debates==
The idea of religious economy frames religion as a product and as those who practice or identify with any particular religion as a consumer. But when the idea of belief is brought in to the equation, this definition expands, and [[ideology]] affects the &quot;product&quot; and who &quot;consumes&quot; it. When examining depictions of religious identity in a global world, it is easy to see how ideology affects religious economy.

[[Carl L. Bankston]] III refers to religions and religious groups as &quot;…competing firms [that vie for] customers who make rational choices among available products…&quot; (311). Using a liberal economic (see [[Economic liberalism]]) framework for analysis, Bankston is claiming that religions and religious groups’ popularity is dependent on the laws of supply and demand. As a marketplace, religious consumers are subject to things such as marketing, availability of product, resources, brand recognition, etc. But unlike some actual commodity such as a computer, these commodities speak to an individual’s beliefs. Bankston poses the idea that belief deals with ideology and extends beyond what one would typically define as a market good by stating &quot;…belief is produced and resides in communicated thoughts, (and) the consumers of goods of faith can only become consumers by becoming producers, by participating in interactions of belief…&quot; (322).

===Secularization and religious economy===
{{Main|secularization}}
Prior to the emergence of the theory of religious economy some scholars of religion, such as Steve Bruce,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Steve|title=Choice and Religion: A Critique of Rational Choice|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed that [[modernization]] would lead inevitably to the erosion of religiosity. These sociologists have predicted the disappearance of religion from [[Earth]], based on the decline in religious belief and observance in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 1997&quot;/&gt; According to the theory of religious economy, societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed state religious monopoly or through state sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more [[religion]]s a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt; This is refuted in the orthodox view by stating that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then they are less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context. If nothing is shared, then nothing is shunned, and there is thus a loss in observance of modern liberal traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce 1999&quot;/&gt;

====Revival====
According to [[Rodney Stark]], revival is another aspect of religious change which coincides with [[secularization]].  Over time established religious groups will spawn smaller and less worldly sub groups of the faith.  This trend of revival provides a plausible explanation why religion never seems to fade away and to why previously prominent religious organizations have dissipated.  Revival produces a shift in which religious groups a population will follow and proves effective against the demise of religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt;

====Cults====
Unlike a sect which follows traditions from its parent religion a cult presents completely new religious traditions.  Cult is simply another word for a new religion and all current religions at one point could have been considered cult movements.  The negative connotations on the word cult have led to hostility between these movements and their social environments. [[Rodney Stark]] defines the two reactions from [[secularization]] being revival and cult formation. As old faiths eventually weaken the rise of different religious sects and cults will prevail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt;

====Growth of strict religions====
A set of famous papers {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} in religious economy have spurred debate on how and why new religious groups might be differentially growing depending on the strictness of the [[doctrine]] to which adherents are obligated. Why are strict groups growing in popularity in US and around the world? Are less strict groups in decline, or are they simply later in their organizational and demographic life cycles?

====Strict regulations to enforce strong ties====
Strict Churches are prevalent in the US and around the world and while people still question and debate their ascent, their ties are characteristically defined as being strong within the group with few weak ties branching outside to other groups. Strict churches arise from strict doctrines and can be in many forms such as large churches, sects, or cults but are not limited to these. Churches are most often known for their “cosmopolitan networks, while sects tend to consist of intense local networks,”&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, 2007. ''Sociology''. Tenth Edition. Thomas Wadsworth. ISBN 0-495-09344-0./&lt;/ref&gt; while this may be true for “unstrict” doctrines this is not always the case for strict doctrines. Strong doctrines can arise from certain sects as various religions have done such as [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Islam]], certain denominations of [[Christianity]], or can include rather smaller cults or small sects. What all strong doctrines employ though, are formal controls to discourage [[Free rider problem|free riding]] within the group and to keep the church strong and together.&lt;ref&gt;Hechter, Michael. Principles of Group Solidarity. University of California Press. ISBN 0-520-06462-3&lt;/ref&gt; These controls can vary from church to church but all serve the same purpose of keeping group solidarity.

As commonly seen strict churches employ various means of keeping their ties in their church strong while limiting excessive access to other groups such as dress code, eating habits, and rituals that prevent mixing with other groups. The implication of these, “strict demands ‘strengthen’ a church in three ways; they raise overall levels of commitment, they increase average rates of participation, and they enhance the net benefits of membership.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211&quot;&gt;Laurence R. Iannaccone, 1994. &quot;Why Strict Churches Are Strong,&quot;  ''American Journal of Sociology'', 99(5), pp. [http://religionomics.com/iannaccone/papers/Iannaccone%20-%20Strict%20Churches.pdf 1180-1211.]&lt;/ref&gt; Complying with these demands prevent the members of a church from free loading within the group and promote group solidarity. The strict rules that govern and regulate a church actually help and promote the strength of the ties within the group. Those who don’t comply with these strictures are screened out leaving only those who do comply and comply earnestly.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211&quot;/&gt; These strict doctrines and regulations serve to keep the church strong and together while screening out members that may actually harm the church unintentionally by be free loaders within the group.

===Church-sect theory===
&lt;!-- Not sure this section belongs in this article, as it seems off-topic. --&gt;
Originally proposed by [[H. Richard Niebuhr]] in his book ''The Social Sources of Denominationalism'', the theory discusses the difference between churches and [[sects]]. Niebuhr proposed that there is a cycle which [[sects]] and churches follow. Religions originate as [[sects]] designed to serve the needs of the deprived. If they flourish, they increasingly serve the interests of the middle and upper classes and are transformed into churches. Once the sects have become churches they become less effective in satisfying the needs of the lower class and the formation of a sect is re-created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt;

In 1963 Benton Johnson revised the church-sect theory into its current state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt; Church and sect form opposite poles on an  axis representing the amount of &quot;tension&quot; between religious organizations and their social environments.  Tension, as defined by Benton Johnson, is &quot;a manifestation of deviance.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt; The tension is described to be between the groups members and the outside world.  Churches are described as religious bodies having low tension, whereas, [[sects]] have high tension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark 2007&quot;/&gt;

==Religion in the U.S. compared to other nations==
Different nations vary in religious makeup and fervency. Most people in the world are religious. People don't consider themselves as religious if they are not fully involved in the church by contributing money or attending service every Sunday.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} On the other hand, it is more rare to claim to be an atheist. A country in which atheism is common is China. About 24 percent of the Chinese population claim to be “convinced atheists.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark, Rodney 2007&quot;&gt;^ Stark, Rodney (2007). Sociology, 10th Edition, Thomson Wadsworth. ISBN 0-495-09344-0./&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism in China is researched to be a result from Communism which stresses atheism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} But, one can not put a title on China as the “atheist country.”

Moral behaviors of individuals are suggested by religious loyalties only in societies where the dominant religious congregations give clear rules to follow moral actions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  In US and Europe, the gods are conceived as powerful and judgmental whereas in Japan and China, they are conceived as many, small, and not particularly interested in moral behavior.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Therefore, in Japan and China, religion is unrelated to moral actions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The United States is extremely diverse {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} with high levels of religious participation. The United States maintains a high degree of religious pluralism. Americans tend to contribute more money to their churches compared to other countries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} There are an estimated 15,000 denominations in the United States—an extremely free religious economy. Church membership and attendance in the Western United States is lower than the other states.

The United States is much more religiously diverse than other countries, though comparable to Canada.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Church membership is relatively high in both countries. Canada is estimated about 61 percent and the United States reported 63 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark, Rodney 2007&quot;/&gt; Canada does not have as much religious pluralism as the United States with only a little over 200 denominations existing compared to the 15,000 in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark, Rodney 2007&quot;/&gt;  The United States continues to grow{{Who|date=June 2008}} at a faster rate than Canada. Compared to the U.S., church attendance in Europe is far lower. For example, in Iceland and Denmark weekly church turnout is less than 4 percent of the population and only 6 percent in Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark, Rodney 2007&quot;/&gt;

Latin America is becoming increasingly more Protestant. 22 percent of the population belongs to Protestant congregations in Chile, 20 percent in Guatemala, and 16 percent in Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark, Rodney 2007&quot;/&gt; With this rapid growth, it is estimated that Protestantism will be the majority in Latin America within the next twenty years.  Governments{{Who|date=June 2008}} has not been moving against non-Catholics anymore which leaves an open door for religious pluralism to build in Latin America.

==Ex-Communist countries==
Russia and Eastern European{{Who|date=June 2008}} countries have collectively been moving towards atheism. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The cause of this may be the collapse of the Soviet Union as well as the communist government imposed by the Russian army at the end of WWII. The communists tried to wipe out all traces of religions in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.{{Dubious|date=June 2008}} As a result of this effort, there are only about 5,000 religious congregations of all faiths still in the Soviet Union{{Clarify|post-text=(Soviet Union non extant)|date=April 2011}}. This is roughly the same number as currently exist in the state of Kentucky.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark, Rodney 2007&quot;/&gt; Even though the communist government{{Who|date=June 2008}} thought they had succeeded in destroying religion in their nation,{{Dubious|date=June 2008}} research and data have concluded that atheists are few and far in between in Russia and Eastern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Research conducted by Paul Froese at [[Baylor University]], examines the prevalence and dynamics of religious beliefs and monopolies [[post-communism]] in the former [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PF1&quot;&gt;[[Paul Froese|Froese, Paul]], 'After atheism: An analysis of religious monopolies in the post-communist world' from [[Baylor University]] in [[Sociology of Religion journal]] 2004: 65 I 57-75 http://www.jstor.org/pss/3712507&lt;/ref&gt;  This study is one area of research of interest to sociologists researching religious economic theory because it observes governmental influence on religious beliefs and affiliations. Prior to the 1980s, the Soviet government imposed religious restrictions on its citizens in hopes that they would come to hold the beliefs of [[Atheism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PF1&quot;/&gt;  The government's intentions were to free its people from the psychological bondage of religion, encouraging the formation of a fully industrialized society.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF1&quot;/&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] remained fairly intact until the 1990s, however, religious restrictions gradually loosened and the people of the Soviet Union began to abandon [[Atheism]] in large numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF1&quot;/&gt;  According to this study, since the 1970s, 100 million people living in the former Soviet Union have come to affiliate themselves with some religious group for the first time in their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF1&quot;/&gt;

Ex Soviet states have widely divergent levels of religious affiliation. For example, [[irreligion]] in [[Lithuania]] is 19.4%, while for [[Estonia]] this is 75.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Dentsu Communication Institute Inc, Japan Research Center, 2006. http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html&lt;/ref&gt;
