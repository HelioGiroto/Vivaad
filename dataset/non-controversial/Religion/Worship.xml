[[File:Religion-Pearce-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|350px|Detail from ''Religion'' by [[Charles Sprague Pearce]] (1896)]]

'''Worship''' is an act of [[religion|religious]] devotion usually directed towards a [[deity]]. The word is derived from the [[Old English]]  ''worthscipe'', meaning ''worthiness''  or ''worth-ship'' &amp;mdash; to give, at its simplest, worth to something.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, William K., ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=vKeM9CZj1ywC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=isbn:0852444257&amp;q=worship+worth-ship&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;f=false Religion in education]'', Gracewing Publishing, 1997, 372 pages, ISBN 0-85244-425-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Evelyn Underhill]] (2001) defines worship thus: &quot;The absolute acknowledgment of all that lies beyond us&amp;mdash;the glory that fills heaven and earth. It is the response that conscious beings make to their [[Creator deity|Creator]], to the Eternal Reality from which they came forth; to [[God]], however they may think of Him or recognize Him, and whether He be realized through religion, through nature, through history, through science, art, or human life and character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Evelyn, ''Education and the Spirit of Worship'', in Collected Papers, p.193, London, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Worship asserts the reality of its object and defines its meaning by reference to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Beyond Theology: Toward an Anthropology of &quot;Fundamentalism&quot; | journal = American Anthropologist | date = Jun 2001 | first = Judith | last = Nagata | volume = 103 | issue = 2| id = | accessdate = 2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An act of worship may be performed individually, in an informal or formal group, or by a designated leader.

Worship in [[Buddha Dharma]] may take innumerable forms given the doctrine of [[skillful means]]. Worship is evident in Buddhism in such forms as: [[guru yoga]], [[mandala]], [[thanka]], [[yantra yoga]], the discipline of the fighting monks of [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]], [[panchamrita]], mantra recitation, tea ceremony, [[ganacakra]], amongst others.

====Adoration versus veneration====
In the [[New Testament]] various words are used for worship. The word ''proskuneo'' &quot;to worship&quot; means to bow down to Gods or kings.&lt;ref&gt;Called to Worship: The Biblical Foundations of Our Response  Vernon Whaley - 2009 - In the Greek, the word for worship, proskuneo, means to express deep respect or adoration—by kissing, with words, or by bowing down. Associated words include epaineo, “to commend or applaud”; aineo, “to praise God”; and sebomai,&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] make a technical distinction between ''[[adoration]]'' or ''[[latria]]'' (Latin ''adoratio'', Greek ''latreia'', ''[λατρεια]''), which is due to God alone, and ''[[veneration]]'' or ''[[dulia]]'' (Latin ''veneratio'', Greek ''douleia'' ''[δουλεια]''), which may be lawfully offered to the [[saint]]s.  The external acts of veneration resemble those of worship, but differ in their object and intent.  Protestant Christians, who reject the veneration of saints, question whether such a distinction is always maintained in actual devotional practice, especially at the level of [[folk religion]].  

According to [[Mark Miravalle]] the English word &quot;worship&quot; is equivocal, in that it has been used in Catholic writing, at any rate, to denote both adoration/''latria'' and veneration/''dulia'', and in some cases even as a synonym for veneration as distinct from adoration: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Adoration, which is known as ''latria'' in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the acknowledgement of excellence and perfection of an uncreated, divine person. It is the worship of the Creator that God alone deserves.

Veneration, known as ''dulia'' in classical theology, is the honor due to the excellence of a created person. This refers to the excellence exhibited by the created being who likewise deserves recognition and honor. We see a general example of veneration in events like the awarding of academic awards for excellence in school, or the awarding of the Olympic medals for excellence in sports. There is nothing contrary to the proper adoration of God when we offer the appropriate honor and recognition that created persons deserve based on achievement in excellence.

Here a further clarification should be made regarding the use of the term &quot;worship&quot; in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration. Some schools of theology use the term &quot;worship&quot; to introduce both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between &quot;worship of adoration&quot; and &quot;worship of veneration.&quot; The word &quot;worship&quot; (in the same way the theological term &quot;cult&quot; is traditionally used) in these classical definitions was not at all synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic writers will sometimes use the term &quot;worship&quot; not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Miravalle, S.T.D, [http://www.chnetwork.org/journals/mary/mary_4.htm What is Devotion to Mary?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orthodox [[Judaism]] and orthodox [[Sunni Islam]] hold that for all practical purposes veneration should be considered the same as prayer; Orthodox Judaism (arguably with the exception of some [[chasidism|Chasidic]] practices), orthodox Sunni Islam, and most kinds of [[Protestantism]] forbid veneration of saints or [[angel]]s, classifying these actions as akin to [[idolatry]].

Similarly, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] assert that many actions classified as [[Patriotism|patriotic]] by Protestant groups, such as saluting a [[flag]], are equivalent to worship and are therefore considered idolatrous as well.

===Worship in Islam===
{{Main|Ibadah}}
[[File:Muslim men praying in Afghanistan-2010.jpg|thumb|180px|Muslim men praying in [[Afghanistan]].]]
In [[Islam]], worship refers to ritualistic devotion which is ordained by and pleasing to [[Allah]] (God). Worship is included in the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], primarily that of ''[[salat]]'', which is the practice of ritual prayer five times daily.

According to [[Muhammad Asad]], on his notes in [[The Message of the Qur'an]] translation on 51:26,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the innermost purpose of the creation of all rational beings is their cognition of the existence of Allah and, hence, their conscious willingness to conform their own existence to whatever they may perceive of His will and plan: and it is this twofold concept of cognition and willingness that gives the deepest meaning to what the Quran describes as &quot;worship&quot;.  As the next verse shows, this spiritual call does not arise from any supposed &quot;need&quot; on the part of the Creator, who is self-sufficient and infinite in His power, but is designed as an instrument for the inner development of the worshiper, who, by the act of his conscious self-surrender to the all-pervading Creative Will, may hope to come closer to an understanding of that Will and, thus closer to Allah Himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Message of the Quran | author = Muhammed Asad (Leopold Weiss). p918, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Worship in Hinduism===
{{further|Puja (Hinduism)|Yajna|Bhajan|fast|kirtan}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Worship in [[Hinduism]] involves invoking higher forces to assist in spiritual and material progress and is simultaneously both a science and an art. A sense of ''[[bhakti]]'' or devotional love is generally invoked. This term is probably a central one in Hinduism. A direct translation from the Sanskrit to English is problematic. Worship takes a multitude of forms depending on community groups, geography and language. There is a flavour of loving and being in love with whatever object or focus of devotion. Worship is not confined to any place of worship, it also incorporates personal reflection, art forms and group. People usually perform worship to achieve some specific end or to integrate the body, the mind and the spirit in order to help the performer evolve into a higher being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Worship &quot;Worship&quot;], Krishna Maheshwari, Hindupedia, the online Hindu Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worship in Sikhism ===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
In [[Sikhism]], worship takes place after the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], which is the work of the 10 Sikh Gurus all in one. Sikhs worship God and only one God, known as &quot;One Creator&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Teacher&quot; ([[Waheguru]]), or &quot;Destroyer of Darkness&quot;.

=== Worship in Wicca ===
Wiccan worship commonly takes place during a full moon or a new moon. Such rituals are called an [[Esbat]] and may involve a [[magic circle]] which practitioners believe will contain energy and form a sacred space, or will provide them a form of magical protection.&lt;ref&gt;Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner - Page 114, Scott Cunningham - 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
