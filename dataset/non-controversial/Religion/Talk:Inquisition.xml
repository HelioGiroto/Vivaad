== Death Toll ==

Is it possible to provide an entimated range of deaths from the whole series of historical Inquisitions added together?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.190.69.81|70.190.69.81]] ([[User talk:70.190.69.81|talk]]) 00:08, 8 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

No it isn't since the actual death toll was much smaller than we might imagine. Of course the Inquisition was a pretty reprehensible institution but that was just a result of the age it was living in. The death toll for killing heretics was much bigger if you consider the actions of the various states, kings, dukes and other lords than if you just look at the Inquisition because basically in those times heresy was regarded as a crime against the STATE, as treson towards your lord, pretty much as terrorism is today. That was the general opinion at the time. Of course it's stupid but that's what people used to believe back then. As you might imagine, the various kings and lords had little concern if a particular heretic or somebody who was just accused of heresy recanted or not or if he was actually guilty or not. Just as it would happen with an accusation of terrorism today, one you're suspected, it's over. Of course the Church didn't really like that. Anyway you might want to listen to the lectures of Thomas F. Madden from the University of Missouri, St. Louis, or really read any SCIENTIFIC historical work by a modern historian (but I really mean a scientific historical work nut just something written for purposes of popularisation of science you know, not something written for everyone, because those things are afraid to challange popular views today, sometimes at the expense of the truth.)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Omulurimaru|Omulurimaru]] ([[User talk:Omulurimaru|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Omulurimaru|contribs]]) 22:36, 27 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Secular courts administered punishment==
An editor has deleted without comment this statement &quot;In practice, the Inquisition would not pronounce sentence, but handed over convicted heretics to secular authorities.&quot; Since it was not footnoted, I didn't revert it. But it is true, of course, and needs reinsertion whenever someone can come up with a footnote. Thanks. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 12:49, 15 September 2009 (UTC)


It is emphatically correct that it was the secular courts who administered the (more vile of) the punishments. The Inquisition Tribunal, IF they found someone guilty of heresy, they could only excommunicate that person. Which didn't really mean much. I mean various kings were excommunicated all the time without much consequence. The thing is that the decision of an Inquisition Tribunal was regarded as full conclusive evidence in a criminal court (run by the king, duke or another lord). And in those times the various states and their rulers (kings, dukes, counts, other lords) regarded heresy as treason against them, as a crime against the state. And also the popular opinion was really geared against it, it was almost considered as dangerous as we view terrorism today. Of course it sounds silly and it actually is kind of really stupid but that used to be the consensus at the time. As you might imagine for a king or lord, once someone was suspected of heresy they would have loved to burn them without any further fuss (pretty much as it happens with terrorism today) and they didn't really like the Inquisition since they could actually establish that the guy wasn't guilty. In any case the death penalty was a punishmnent pronounced by the criminal courts of the crown/state/lords for heresy and the punishment was then administered by the state/lord.

==Wording==
One paragraph says that the church felt threatened by what it '''perceived''' as the schism of the church. I'm not sure that the Protestants did not perceive this in a similar fashion. Luther felt (probably correctly at the time) that he had to take true believers away from the pollution of Rome. Henry VIII was just doing it for political reasons. In the case of the latter, he never thought of the result as any more than &quot;The Catholic Church of England&quot;, a straight derivative of the RC Church. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 18:28, 8 November 2009 (UTC)

Quite true, the Protestants perceived it in quite a similar fashion and in fact many Protestants had their own Inquision in order to find those who held the heresy of Papism. But arguably there were other Protestants who simply dismantled the Inquisitions in thier areas. This was getting much more on the side of a political struggle rather than an inquest by a State or Church authority.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Omulurimaru|Omulurimaru]] ([[User talk:Omulurimaru|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Omulurimaru|contribs]]) 01:34, 28 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:The Catholic Encyclopedia 1913 says, &quot;How many victims were handed over to the civil power cannot be stated with even approximate accuracy. We have nevertheless some valuable information about a few of the Inquisition tribunals, and their statistics are not without interest. At Pamiers, from 1318 to 1324, out of twenty-four persons convicted but five were delivered to the civil power, and at Toulouse from 1308 to 1323, only forty-two out of nine hundred and thirty bear the ominous note &quot;relictus culiae saeculari&quot;. Thus, at Pamiers one in thirteen, and at Toulouse one in forty-two seem to have been burnt for heresy although these places were hotbeds of heresy and therefore principal centres of the Inquisition. We may add, also, that this was the most active period of the institution.&quot;

==Three questions==
1. Estimated number of victims. Why is that information not on this page?
In this link http://www.christianityandhumanrights.com/_witches.html it is said that the estimate for Europe as a whole is 2,000,000 million victims.
2. That 'Trivia' section with references to Monty Python or films, etc., is absolutely irrelevant.
3. Shouldn't these mass murders be considered genocide?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.59.12.149|80.59.12.149]] ([[User talk:80.59.12.149|talk]]) 23:37, 15 December 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Facts and Number in this link ąre unfounded and unreliable. Total number of the burned witches is less than fifty thousand, not 2 millions or so (see e.g. Brian Levack: ''The Witch-Hunt in the Early Modern Europe'', 2006 or Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark (ed.) ''Witchcraft and Magic in Europe'', Philadelphia 2002, p. 12-16, and other academic publications on the topic). Besides, it concerns [[Witch hunt]], not Inquisition, which had burned merely few percent of the all witches burned in Europe.

And by the way, why is the very first external link to a page that tries to justify the Inquisition 'because it was the morality of the time?'. I find that extremely offensive.

Particularly one of the so-called Myths caught my attention:
''Myth: The hideous procedures of the Inquisition were unjust, cruel, inhumane, and barbaric. The Inquisition roasted their victims' feet over fire, bricked them up into walls to languish for all eternity, smashed their joints with hammers, and flayed them on wheels.''

''Reality: Despite the compelling Gothic fictions, the evidence leads us to a wholly different conclusion. The procedures of the Inquisition are well known through a whole series of papal bulls and other authoritative documents, but mainly through such formularies and manuals as were prepared by St. Raymond Peñaforte (c1180-1275), the great Spanish canonist, and Bernard Gui (1261-1331), one of the most celebrated inquisitors of the early 14th Century. The Inquisitors were certainly interrogators, but they were theological experts who followed the rules and instructiones meticulously, and were dismissed and punished when they showed too little regard for justice. When, for example, in 1223 Robert of Bourger gleefully announced his aim to burn heretics, not to convert them, he was immediately suspended and imprisoned for life by Gregory IX.16 ''

'''The inquisitorial procedures were surprisingly just and even lenient. In contrast with other tribunals throughout Europe at the time, they appear as almost enlightened. '''

I mean, seriously. This is just blatant lying. The people were burnt alive at stakes. And if you ever visit certain museums all over Europe you'll find examples of the wonderful torture devices that were used, such as Catherine Wheels, racks and whatnot.

I mean, adding such ridiculous link as the first one (or just adding it) is an insult to the readers. And it's a lie. Go grab a History book.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.59.12.149|80.59.12.149]] ([[User talk:80.59.12.149|talk]]) 01:22, 24 December 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Thats not an attempt at justification.  It's just true.  The kind of things they were doing during the inquisition, while reprehensible today, were relatively normal back then.  We need to be clear on that to people.  Not doing so would suggest that the Inquisition was this shocking and reprehesible thing even by the standards of that time even though it was relatively mild in comparison to what what happening elsewhere in the world.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 11:42, 27 December 2009 (UTC)

:: In fact, it was as bad as any legal inquisitorial procedures used elsewhere. And if the standard is bad, it don't excuse the church for using it. Let's say the 1st christians started crucifying people because it was a common legal practice by the Romans. Would that (crucifying) be an acceptable practice, then? '''[[User:sspecter|&lt;font style=&quot;padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #809EF5; color: #77a2FF&quot;&gt;SSPecter&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:sspecter|Talk]]|[[Special:Emailuser/Sspecter|E-Mail]]&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/small&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&amp;#9670;&lt;/font&gt;''' &lt;sub&gt;07:25, 4 January 2010 ([[w:UTC|UTC]])&lt;/sub&gt;.

We could go on and on and never be in accordance. These people were Christians, with the exact same morality that you have now if you are a Christian. Saying that it was normal back then is like saying it would be normal right now. It amazes me that we think that people of other eras were dumb and that we are the very best people that have ever existed, fairer and better than anyone before us. 
In fact, secular ethics came a long time before Christianity thanks to the Greek thinkers, and some of them seem pretty pacifistic and logical even today. I don't think it's the morality of the time as much as just the corrupted morality of those who were in power at the time: the Church and the State.

Plus, following that simple logic, you would be saying that the Holocaust was okay, because it was also the morality of the people of the time. Terrorist attacks are also okay because they are the morality of those who commit them, and so on. You know, because these things are relatively normal and acceptable nowadays, as we all know. I accept them as perfectly valid.

:I just have to be blunt - what planet are you living on?  Their doctrines are the same, but the morals are not.  What was morally acceptable then is not now.  That's the whole point!  And then you contradict yourself with &quot;it amazes me that we think that people of other eras were dumb and that we are the very best people that have ever existed&quot;.  You're the one promoting that idea by trying to minimalize the fact that such behavior was normal centuries ago.  Vilifying their actions makes ours look better by comparison, which is exactly the kind of thing you seemed to just have problems with.  By clarifying that such behavior was normal then, we actually prevent people from getting the impression that we think ourselves superior.

Look, guys, no one is trying to excuse the inquisition here. But as historians, using the scientific method, we have to get to the truth disregarding all other factors. What we have to do is go read the original historical sources (that were written at the time) or scientific material based on those (which is arguably boring since it's scientific; but the stuff written by popular writers for purposes of popularising history is based on secondary or tertiary sources and therefore is bound to get some facts wrong). First of all there was no such thing as one inquisition. The Inquisition was firstly a legal practice equivalent to what we would call today an inquiry or inquest. Over time this practice gave birth to 3 types of institutions that dealt with finding out heresy. These institutions did not pronounce punishments other than excommunication. 
:These institutions were: the local Ecclesiastical Inquisitions of the local bishops, the Papal Inquisition answerable to the pope and the local secular Inquisitions answerable to the local lord or to the state authority which were, nevertheless, while under the control of the state, religious inquisitions, not criminal courts. Again it was only the criminal courts, which were always under state control, that could pronounce death sentences. The various inquisitions' practiced differed wildly over time and place. For example the Papal Inquisition of the middle ages was regarded in its time as &quot;too lenient&quot; because they were scrupulous about 1) rules of evidence; 2)returning the heretics to the church and declaring them guilty only as a last resort. On the other hand the Spanish Inquisition of the 2 monarchs (Ferdinand and Isabella, who united Spain) was famous for not respecting any rules of evidence (in its first stages) and for being part of basically a mass hysteria. That was because the Spanish Inquisition was formed basically when king Ferdinand started buying into a conspiracy theory that was circulating at the time in Spain, which claimed that the many converts from Judaism to Catholicism, some of whom were very powrful and rich (including some very proeminent Bishops of the Church) were part of a grand Jewish plot to destroy the Church and Spain from within. 
Thus the Spanish Inquisitions went wildly against the converts with the aim of basically confiscating their property. They could not go against the Jews since Jews were not Christian. So it all ended when Ferdinand decided to expell all the Jews (roughly half of which decided that it was better to convert than be expelled - of course a large number of those lived as Crypto-Jews, in secret). So you see the truth is much more complex than common belief today, since history is not just a story. 
:Complicating this complexity is the fact that the state - i.e. kings. dukes, various other lords throughout the Middle Ages viewed heresy as treason against them, treason against the state. So while the Church was really all about returning the heretics to the flock or otherwise, if they didn't want to recant, excommunicating them, the various lords (and also the various local Church authorities) wanted to burn every single person that was even suspected of heresy because even the popular opinion was at the time that heresy is something very dangerous. It was regarded pretty much as we regard terrorism today: a suspicion of it was enough for the state authority to get worried. Of course this opinion looks pretty stupid. In fact it is a very stupid opinion but it was the consensus amongst the European population at the time. We can't realy blame &quot;that Jewish ideology&quot; (i.e. Christianity) for what was the general opinion of most Europeans at the time. And remember that this was going on for a very long time. The Roman Empire had persecuted Christians because there was a general opinion amongst pagan Romans that being a Christian was treasonous to the Roman Empire. I mean one is just blind if they don't see the analogy here. In any case most modern historians will tell you that while the various Inquistions were by no means something &quot;good&quot;, and they were by all accounts something that for us today is quite reprehensible, they were a logical and forseeable development in their time, because of the social and political and ideological environment in Europe in the Middle Ages. 
Of course for various reasons the Inquisition today is viewed by most of the people in a different way: most people believe that is was this monstruous intitution. And again it wasn't something &quot;good&quot; but then again it was by no account what most people today believe it was. Unfortunately most people today are not historians. Historians, just like any other scientists must apply the scientific method of research when they study history. And for understanding any phenomenon in history we apply the same basic questions: why? how? where? when? And we go to the original sources written in those times. We're sorry the truth is different than the popularly held myth. But the popular opinion about the Inquisition, like any myth, is based upon some core truth but which is blown out of proportion becasue most people don't want to hear boring science, they want to hear an entertaining story.
:For more information one could at least start with Prof. Thomas F. Madden's (Univ. of St. Louis Missoury) course on it, which is also available as an audiobook: &quot;Heaven or Heresy: A History of the Inquisition&quot;. Again this is not about trying to absolve anyone of any guilt. We don't deal in guilt, we deal in facts and we learn facts by sticking to the science and to the primary sources, not to popularly held opinions. Just as sports, the Inquisition is something that everyone knows about. But just as not everyone can win the World Cup or be a successful sports coach, popular opinion on some widely known historical subjects might be quite different than the truth. Which is ironical since popular opinion on matters of faith were one of the reasons that got the Inquisitions started.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Omulurimaru|Omulurimaru]] ([[User talk:Omulurimaru|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Omulurimaru|contribs]]) 01:25, 28 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Another point that should be made is that most of us really have no notion about just how bloody and cruel those times really were. For example torture had been used in criminal proceedings - ANY kind of criminal proceeding, be it about theft, murder, treason or heresy - since basically the Ancient world. It was part of the (originally pagan) Roman justice system. Of course it wasn't applied indefinitely it could be applied only twice and for short periods of time (like 5-15 minutes). And it wasn't a punishment it wasn't something done to punish someone. Rather it was a part of the investigation technique used in any crime -- remember they didn't have forensics back then. Anyways someone said here that we cannot judge that society, back then, by our standards. That's not really true: the correct, scientific attitude here should be that we can't judge that society at all since it's not our job. As historians we should reasearch and relate the truth in a scientific manner and leave the morality judgements to journalists and priests and atheism appologists and the like. We're just here to relate the facts. And this is probably what this Wiki article ought to be about.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Omulurimaru|Omulurimaru]] ([[User talk:Omulurimaru|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Omulurimaru|contribs]]) 01:47, 28 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I have to admit the beginning of this article has me confused a little bit by its emphasis on torture. It seems to be presenting it as something unique or new that was championed by the Inquisition, when this was certainly not the case. Perhaps this should be changed.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/149.43.185.150|149.43.185.150]] ([[User talk:149.43.185.150|talk]]) 18:09, 19 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:OK, here it is, for the IP questioner. Torture was and still remains to be considered as valuable in extracting confessions, regardless of validity or fact. If it wasn't, waterboarding would be abandoned. People eventually will end up confessing to pretty much ANYTHING to make the torture stop. As torture during inquisition times was FAR more harmful to the person and body, as in being eventually lethal, some confessed, others refused, rather than taint their name, others on other principles. Any way you slice it, it ended up, at the end of the day, the same way. The accused was dead, save for the majority that had popular support.[[User:Wzrd1|Wzrd1]] ([[User talk:Wzrd1|talk]]) 05:45, 25 February 2012 (UTC)

==Foxe Book of Martyrs==
Yes Foxe wrote a book, sort of accurate by modern day standards and very pov in order to inflame public opinion against Catholics. The English business was more of a power struggle between factions as England often had up until about William and Mary or so. Putting a religious tinge on it, was simply their way of saying that the incumbent king was great or a louse. Easier if you can decide based on what church you attend instead of more complex factors! Neither side paid much attention to religious leaders abroad, much less the pope, or Martin Luther or anybody else. Not sure it should be featured here. More of a canard IMO. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 21:35, 2 September 2010 (UTC)

:Revisionism at its best. If NEITHER side paid any attention to Martin Luther OR the Roman Catholic Church, England would t be overwhelmingly PROTESTANT. Pretty much ANYTHING written that survives today was POV, one way or the other. Neutrality wasn't rewarded, but condemned by BOTH sides. Indeed, at the time, condemning a sitting monarch was a death sentence, if one were in the same nation and probably even when abroad.[[User:Wzrd1|Wzrd1]] ([[User talk:Wzrd1|talk]]) 05:49, 25 February 2012 (UTC)

== Comparison to Protestants == 

Saying &quot;although similar institutions existed in the Protestant church&quot; is wholly inaccurate.

Nothing comparable existed. Wars between Protestant and Catholic states in the age of chivalry are not comparable to religious violence.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.57.219.109|71.57.219.109]] ([[User talk:71.57.219.109|talk]]) 18:38, 25 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Well, there was the [[Star Chamber]] which was smaller in scope. [[Witch-hunt]]s were quite large and not quite as focused since they were essentially run by lay people, but mostly Protestant, I think. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 02:59, 28 May 2011 (UTC)

::The Inquisition was a ''religious'' inquiry, under Catholic authority, to identify spiritual heresy.  That's not the same as a civil inquiry by &quot;lay people&quot; to identify civil misconduct such as orgy sex, cannibalism, or infanticide.  You're trying to equate apples and oranges. [[User:Santamoly|Santamoly]] ([[User talk:Santamoly|talk]]) 17:03, 28 May 2011 (UTC)

:::Witch hunts were spiritual in nature. Witches, empowered by the devil, were believed to be able to influence others from a distance (spiritually). They were believed (as the Catholics believed heretics) to be minions of the devil. They are almost exactly the same, though the witch hunts were not as well focused, having multiple directions and leadership.

::::Having said that, Catholics did not believe that a heretic could make your goat sick. Catholics were more interested in the soul of the heretic and the effect he might have on the souls of others. The witch hunters seemed more concerned with material effects. Making goats sick, for example. I find witch hunts a bit sloppier for lack of lucid direction. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 18:27, 30 May 2011 (UTC)

Student7,, keep on studying. Your view is highly POV and incorrect, according to the nuns that educated ME! People believed in curses and evil spirits that could be conjured, which would afflict the victim or more commonly, the victim's goats, sheep, fowl or groin or any permutation thereof, hence the witchcraft trials, which were LOCAL. Hence, underrepresented in Vatican archives until far later.[[User:Wzrd1|Wzrd1]] ([[User talk:Wzrd1|talk]]) 05:52, 25 February 2012 (UTC)

== Inquisitions of the 4th century ==

The statement in the article that &quot;It started in the 12th century, with the introduction of torture in the persecution of heresy&quot; is actually erroneous.

The history of Ammianus Marcellinus attests the existence of Christian state inquisitions during the rule of Constantius II, c.350 CE, at the city of Scythopolis.  See specifically Chapter XII and XIII-XIV of the Book XIX of Ammianus' Res Gestae:

[quote]...as accusations extended more widely, involving numbers without end in their snares, many perished; some with their bodies mangled on the rack; others were condemned to death and confiscation of their goods; while Paulus kept on inventing groundless accusations, as if he had a store of lies on which to draw, and suggesting various pretences for injuring people, so that on his nod, it may he said, the safety of every one in the place depended. For if any one wore on his neck a charm against the quartan ague or any other disease, or if by any information laid by his ill-wishers he was accused of having passed by a sepulchre at nightfall, and therefore of being a sorcerer, and one who dealt in the horrors of tombs and the vain mockeries of the shades which haunt them, he was found guilty and condemned to death. [/quote]

:http://www.tektonics.org/af/crimeline.htm tends to refute the theory of religious motivation. The Emperors did a lot of unpleasant things, before and after becoming Christian. The Christians had just &quot;taken over.&quot; This implies a large cadre of &quot;inquisitors&quot; which, a few years earlier, had been hiding in the cellar, as it were. Doesn't seem quite plausible. And anyway, Marcellinus, a pagan, doesn't associate the activities with Christianity, which he would have every motive to do, if the accusation were true.

== Book by Benzion Netanyahu ==

I've just read the NY Times obituary of Benzion Netanyahu. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/world/middleeast/benzion-netanyahu-dies-at-102.html?hp . It references his book &quot;The Origins of the Inquisition in 15th Century France&quot; - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679410651/ref=kinw_rke_rti_1 . From the obituary and from the book reviews quoted on Amazon, it looks like this is a major scholarly study of the Spanish Inquisition, though its thesis is apparently controversial. Shouldn't this book be mentioned in the Bibliography section here? I'm inclined to add it. Is there any reason not to? [[User:Omc|Omc]] ([[User talk:Omc|talk]]) 07:34, 30 April 2012 (UTC)
:Well, you are right to point out that he is a notable scholar in this area. On the other hand, it would be nice to keep the list to ten or so. There have to be, literally, a hundred thousand books on the Inquisition. The problem is not discovering them for this article. The problem is limiting them to &quot;the best of the best.&quot; A criteria(on) to do just that would be even more appreciated.
