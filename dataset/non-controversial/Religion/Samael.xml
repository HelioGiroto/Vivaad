[[File:Mort.jpg|thumb|300px|A Western depiction of Death as a [[skeleton]] carrying a [[scythe]].]]
'''Samael''' ({{lang-he|סמאל}}) (also '''Sammael''' and '''Samil''') is an important [[archangel]] in [[Talmud]]ic and post-Talmudic lore, a figure who is accuser, [[seducer]] and destroyer, and has been regarded as both good and evil. It is said that he was the guardian angel of [[Esau]] and a patron of the [[Roman empire]].

He is considered in [[legend]] a member of the [[heavenly host]] (with often grim and destructive duties), in the [[New Testament]] named [[Satan]] and the chief of the [[evil]] spirits. One of Samael's greatest roles in Jewish lore is that of the [[Death (personification)|angel of death]]. He remains one of the Lord's servants even though he appears to want men to do [[evil]]. As a [[angel|good angel]], Samael resides in the [[Seven Heavens|seventh heaven]], although he is declared to be the [[archangel|chief angel]] of the [[heaven|fifth heaven]].

==In Judaism==
[[File:Tree of life kircher hebrew.png|thumb|right|40|[[Kabbalah]] the [[Tree of life]] ]]
In [[Judaism|Jewish]] lore, Samael is said to be the angel of death, the chief ruler of the [[Fifth Heaven]] and one of the [[continent|seven regents of the world]] served by two million angels; he resides in the [[Seven Heavens|Heaven]]. ''[[Yalkut]]{{disambiguation needed|date=January 2012}} I, 110'' of the [[Talmud]] speaks of Samael as Esau's guardian angel.  In ''[[Sotah]] 10b'', Samael is Esau's guardian angel, and in the ''Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer'', he is charged with being the one who tempted [[Eve]], then seduced and impregnated her with [[Cain]]. Though some sources identify [[Azazel|Gadreel]] as the angel that seduced Eve, other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve in the guise of the Serpent. Samael is also sometimes identified as being the angelic antagonist who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of [[Abraham]] as he was about to sacrifice his son.

According to &quot;The Ascension of Moses&quot; (Chapter IV - Aggadah - The Legend of The Jews - By [[Louis Ginzberg]]) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:

{{quote|In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred [[parasang]]s in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, &quot;Anger,&quot; and Hemah, &quot;Wrath,&quot; whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. [[Moses]] was disquieted when he looked upon them, but [[Metatron]] embraced him, and said, &quot;Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,&quot; and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. &quot;This one,&quot; said Metatron, addressing Moses, &quot;is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.&quot; &quot;Whither goes he now?&quot; asked Moses, and Metatron replied, &quot;To fetch the soul of Job the pious.&quot; Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, &quot;O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.}}

In ''The Holy [[Kabbalah]]'' (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the &quot;severity of God&quot;, and is listed as fifth of the [[archangels|archangel]] of the world of [[Beri'ah|Briah]]. Samael is said to have taken [[Lilith]] as his bride after she left [[Adam]]. According to Zoharistic cabala{{Citation needed|reason=ambiguous reference no trackable source|date=May 2012}}, Samael was also mated with [[Eisheth|Eisheth Zenunim]], [[Naamah (demon)|Na'amah]], and [[Agrat Bat Mahlat]] — all angels of  ''[[sacred prostitution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(Erika D. Johnson) [http://www.rosetta.bham.ac.uk/issue5/myth-of-sacred-prostitution-in-antiquity/ rosetta.bham.ac.uk] citing ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' definition [Retrieved 2012-12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Samael is sometimes confused in some books with [[Camael]], an archangel of God, whose name means &quot;He who sees God&quot;.Also &quot; He who is like God &quot; . Kemo (Like), (El),God. Aramaic/Hebrew.

It is also said that the [[Baal Shem]] once summoned Samael, to make him do his bidding. (''Tales of the Hasidim'', by Martin Buber. Book 1, page 77.)

== In Gnosticism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]  --&gt;
In the [[Apocryphon of John]], found in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], Samael is the third name of the [[demiurge]], whose other names are '''[[Yaldabaoth]]''' and '''[[Saklas]]'''. In this context, Samael means &quot;the blind god&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_17378.html |title=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theme of blindness running throughout gnostic works{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.  His appearance is that of a lion-faced serpent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn.html |title=The Apocryphon of John |publisher=Gnosis.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[On the Origin of the World (Nag Hammadi)|On the Origin of the World]] in the [[Nag Hammadi library]] texts, he is also referred to as '''Ariael'''.

== In anthroposophy ==
To [[anthroposophist]]s, Samael is known as one of the seven [[archangels]]:
[[Saint Gregory]] gives the seven archangels as [[Anael]], [[Gabriel]], [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Oriphiel]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]], Samael and [[Zachariel]]. They are all imagined to have a special assignment to act as a global ''[[zeitgeist]]'' (&quot;time-spirit&quot;), each for periods of about 380 years. Since 1879, anthroposophists posit, Michael has been the leading time spirit. Four important archangels are also supposed to display periodic spiritual activity over the seasons: Raphael during the [[spring (season)|spring]], Uriel during the [[summer]], Michael during the [[autumn]], and Gabriel during the [[winter]]. In anthroposophy, archangels may be good or evil; in particular, some of their rank are collaborators of [[Ahriman]], whose purpose (anthroposophists believe) is to alienate humanity from the spiritual world and promote materialism and heartless technical control.
