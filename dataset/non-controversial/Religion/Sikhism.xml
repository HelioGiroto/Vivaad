'''Sikhism'''{{#tag:ref|''Sikhism'' (indigenously known as ''Sikhī'') originated from the word ''Sikh'', which comes from the [[Sanskrit]] root ''{{IAST|[[śiṣya]]}}'' meaning &quot;disciple&quot;, or ''{{IAST|śikṣa}}'' meaning &quot;instruction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|authorlink=Khushwant Singh|year=2006|title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=India|isbn=978-0-19-567747-8|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pa icon}} {{cite book|last=Nabha|first=Kahan.

The Sikhs. Alfred A Knopf Publishing. Pages 17. ISBN 0-375-40728-6.&lt;/ref&gt; which continued to progress with ten successive [[Sikh gurus]] (the last teaching being the holy scripture ''[[Guru Granth Sahib|Gurū Granth Sāhib Ji]]''). It is the [[Major religious groups|fifth-largest]] organized [[religion]] in the world, with approximately 30 million Sikhs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Adherents.com|url=http://adherents.com/misc/rel_by_adh_CSM.html|title=Religions by adherents|accessdate=2003337-02-09|format=PHP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally 'wisdom of the Gurū'). [[Punjab, India]] is the only region in the world with a majority Sikh population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_sikh.html adherents.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sikh]]s are expected to embody the qualities of a &quot;Sant-Sipāhī&quot;—a saint-soldier. One must have control over one's internal vices and be able to be constantly immersed in virtues clarified in the Guru Granth Sahib.

The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''{{unicode|[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]}}'', meaning one God, along with a praxis in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings. Sikhi advocates the pursuit of salvation in a social context through the congregational practice of meditation on the name and message of God. The followers of Sikhi are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten Sikh gurus, or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''Gurū Granth Sāhib Ji'', which, along with the writings of six of the ten Sikh Gurus, includes selected works of many devotees from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds. [[Guru Gobind Singh|Guru Gobind Singh Ji]], the tenth guru, conferred the leadership of the Sikh community to the Gurū Granth Sāhib and the corporate body of the [[Khālsā Panth]] (the Granth and the Panth). Sikhi's traditions and teachings are associated with the history, society and culture of Punjab. Adherents of Sikhī are known as [[Sikh]]s (''students'' or ''disciples'') and number over 30 million across the world.

Most Sikhs live in Punjab, India, although there is a significant [[Sikh diaspora]]. Until the [[Partition of India]] with the division of Punjab and the subsequent independence of Pakistan and later India, millions of Sikhs lived in what is now [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Axel|first=Brian Keith |authorlink=|year=2001|title=The Nation's Tortured Body: Violence, Representation, and the Formation |publisher=Duke University Press|location=|isbn=978-0-8223-2615-1|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy and teachings ==
{{Main|Sikh religious philosophy|Sikhism primary beliefs and principles}}
[[File:Amritsar-golden-temple-00.JPG|thumb|The [[Harimandir Sahib]], known popularly as the Golden Temple, is a sacred shrine for Sikhs.]]
The origins of Sikhi lie in the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and his successors. The essence of Sikh teaching is summed up by [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] in these words: &quot;Realization of Truth is higher than all else. Higher still is truthful living&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teece|first=Geoff|authorlink=|hear=2004|title=Sikhi:Religion in focus|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|location=|isbn=978-1-58340-469-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh teaching emphasizes the principle of equality of all humans and rejects discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, and gender. Sikh principles encourage living life as a householder.

Sikhi is a [[monotheistic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mark Juergensmeyer|first=Gurinder Singh Mann|authorlink=|year=2006|title=The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=US|isbn=978-0-19-513798-9|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ardinger|first=Barbara|authorlink=|year=2006|title=Pagan Every Day: Finding the Extraordinary in Our Ordinary Lives|publisher=Weisfer|location=|isbn=978-1-57863-332-6|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[revealed religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nesbitt|first=Eleanor M.|title=Sikhi: a very short introduction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fvTK_CfkeasC&amp;pg=PP6|accessdate=19 July 2010|date=15 November 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280601-7|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sikhi, God—termed ''[[Waheguru|Vāhigurū]]''—is [[Nirankar|shapeless]], [[akaal|timeless]], and [[Alakh Niranjan|sightless]] (i.e., unable to be seen with the physical eye): ''{{unicode|niraṅkār}}'', ''akaal'', and ''alakh''. The beginning of the first composition of Sikh scripture is the figure &quot;[[1 (number)|1]]&quot;—signifying the universality of God. It states that God is [[omnipresent]] and infinite with power over everything, and is signified by the term ''[[Ek Onkar|ēk ōaṅkār]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;p252&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=|year=1971|title=World Religions:From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group|location=USA|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that before creation, all that existed was God and God's ''[[hukam]]'' (will or order).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dev|first=Guru Nanak Dev|authorlink=Guru Nanak |title=Guru Granth Sāhib ji |url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1035&amp;punjabi=t#l44288 | accessdate=15 June 2006|page=1035|quote=For endless eons, there was only utter darkness. There was no earth or sky; there was only the &lt;s&gt;infinite&lt;/s&gt; Command of His Hukam.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When God willed, the entire cosmos was created. From these beginnings, God nurtured &quot;enticement and attachment&quot; to ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', or the human perception of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dev|first=Nanak|authorlink=Guru Nanak Dev Ji|title=Gurū Granth Sāhib Ji|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1036&amp;punjabi=t#l44327|accessdate=15 June 2006|page=1036|quote=When He so willed, He created the world. Without any supporting power, He sustained the universe. He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; He fostered enticement and attachment to Maya.|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name=&quot;p252&quot;/&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable. God is omnipresent (''[[sarav viāpak]]'') in all creation and visible everywhere to the spiritually awakened. Nanak stressed that God must be seen from &quot;the inward eye&quot;, or the &quot;heart&quot;, of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment. Guru Nanak Dev emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p252&quot;/&gt; God has no gender in Sikhi (though translations may incorrectly present a male God); indeed Sikhi teaches that God is &quot;Akaal Purkh&quot; with characteristic of &quot;Nirankar&quot; (Niran meaning &quot;without&quot; and kar meaning &quot;form&quot;, hence &quot;without form&quot;). In addition, Nanak wrote that there are many worlds on which God has created life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dev|first=Nanak |authorlink=Guru Nanak|title=Gurū Granth Sāhib |url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=15&amp;punjabi=t&amp;id=632#l632 |accessdate=15 June 2006 |page=15 |quote=You are the One True Lord and Master of all the other beings, of so many worlds. |unused_data=|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pursuing salvation and Khalsa ===
[[File:Sikh.man.at.the.Golden.Temple.jpg|thumb|210px|A Sikh man at [[Golden Temple, Amritsar]] ([[Harmandir Sahib]])]]
[[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]]'s teachings are founded not on a final destination of [[heaven]] or [[hell]], but on a spiritual union with God which results in [[salvation]]. The official [[Khalsa#Khalsa_code_of_conduct|Khalsa Code of Conduct]] laid out by the tenth guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], makes it clear that human birth is obtained with great fortune, therefore one needs to be able to make the most of this chance. The Sikhs believe in living &quot;Chakar Vati&quot;—roaming free as freedom, not as slaves or be oppressed.

''[[Maya (illusion)|Māyā]]''—defined as illusion or &quot;unreality&quot;—is one of the core deviations from the pursuit of God and salvation: people are distracted from devotion by worldly attractions which give only illusory satisfaction. However, Nanak emphasised māyā as not a reference to the unreality of the world, but of its values. In Sikhi, the influences of [[ahankar|ego]], [[krodh|anger]], [[lobh|greed]], [[moh|attachment]], and [[kam|lust]]—known as the ''Five Evils''—are believed to be particularly pernicious. The fate of people vulnerable to the Five Evils is separation from God, and the situation may be remedied only after intensive and relentless devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |year=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Shabd#Sikhism|Nśabad]]'' (the divine Word) emphasizes the totality of the revelation. Nanak designated the word ''guru'' (meaning ''teacher'') as the voice of God and the source and guide for knowledge and salvation.&lt;ref name=&quot;p254&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salvation can be reached only through rigorous and disciplined devotion to God. Nanak distinctly emphasised the irrelevance of outward observations such as rites, pilgrimages, or [[asceticism]]. He stressed that devotion must take place through the heart, with the spirit and the soul. According to Gurbani the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with Truth. However, our Ego is the biggest disease in the reunion with Truth / God and the solution to this disease also lies within human ego (mind and body). With Guru's grace the seeker meditates honestly on &quot;Word&quot; which leads to the end of ego. Guru is indistinguishable from God and are one and same thing as God which cannot be found with thousands of wisdoms. One gets connected with Guru only with accumulation of selfless search of truth. Ultimately the seeker realizes that it is the consciousness within the body which is seeker / follower and Word is true Guru. Human body is just a means to achieve the reunion with Truth. Truth is a form of matter which lies within human body but is beyond the realm of time / death. Once truth starts to shine in a person’s heart, the essence of current and past holy books of all religions is understood by the person.

A key practice to be pursued is ''{{unicode|[[Nām Japō|nām]]}}'': remembrance of the divine Name. The verbal repetition of the name of God or a sacred syllable is an established practice in religious traditions in India, but Nanak's interpretation emphasized inward, personal observance. Nanak's ideal is the total exposure of one's being to the divine Name and a total conforming to [[Dharma]] or the &quot;Divine Order&quot;. Nanak described the result of the disciplined application of ''{{unicode|nām simraṇ}}'' as a &quot;growing towards and into God&quot; through a gradual process of five stages. The last of these is ''{{unicode|[[Sach Khand|sach khaṇḍ]]}}'' (''The Realm of Truth'')—the final union of the spirit with God.&lt;ref name=&quot;p254&quot;/&gt;

Guru Nanak stressed now ''[[kirat karō]]'': that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''{{unicode|[[chaṛdī kalā]]}}'', or ''optimistic'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—''{{unicode|[[vaṇḍ chakkō]]}}''—through the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''{{unicode|[[Langar (Sikhism)|laṅgar]]}}''), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (''sēvā'').

Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead in prayers.

== Ten gurus and religious authority ==
{{Main|Sikh gurus}}
[[File:Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana.jpg|thumb|upright|A rare [[Tanjore painting|Tanjore]]-style painting from the late 19th century depicting the ten Sikh Gurus with [[Bhai Bala]] and [[Bhai Mardana]].]]
The term [[guru]] comes from the [[Sanskrit]] ''gurū'', meaning teacher, guide, or mentor. The traditions and philosophy of Sikhi were established by ten specific gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous, resulting in the creation of the Sikh religion. [[Guru Nanak Dev]] was the first guru and appointed a disciple as successor. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] was the final guru in human form. Before his death, Guru Gobind Singh decreed that the [[Gurū Granth Sāhib]] would be the final and perpetual guru of the Sikhs.&lt;ref name=&quot;granthfinalguru&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Gurinder Singh|year=2001|title=The Making of Sikh Scripture|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0-19-513024-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Angad Dev succeeded Guru Nanak. Later, an important phase in the development of Sikhi came with the third successor, Guru Amar Das. Guru Nanak's teachings emphasised the pursuit of salvation; Guru Amar Das began building a cohesive community of followers with initiatives such as sanctioning distinctive ceremonies for birth, marriage, and death. Amar Das also established the ''manji'' (comparable to a [[diocese]]) system of clerical supervision.&lt;ref name=&quot;p254&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Interior of Akal Takht.jpg|thumb|The interior of the [[Akal Takht]]]]
[[Guru Amar Das]]'s successor and son-in-law [[Guru Ram Das]] founded the city of [[Amritsar]], which is home of the [[Harimandir Sahib]] and regarded widely as the holiest city for all Sikhs. When Guru Ram Das's youngest son Arjan succeeded him, the line of male gurus from the ''Sodhi Khatri'' family was established: all succeeding gurus were direct descendants of this line. [[Guru Arjan Dev]] was captured by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] authorities who were suspicious and hostile to the religious order he was developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Parrinder | first=Geoffrey | authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder | year=1971 | title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present | publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited | location=United States | isbn = 978-0-87196-129-7 | page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; His persecution and death inspired his successors to promote a military and political organization of Sikh communities to defend themselves against the attacks of Mughal forces.

The Sikh gurus established a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react as a community to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, [[Guru Har Gobind|Guru Hargobind]], was responsible for the creation of the concept of [[Akal Takht]] (''throne of the timeless one''), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhi and sits opposite the Darbar Sahib. The ''{{unicode|[[Sarbat Khalsa|Sarbat Ḵẖālsā]]}}'' (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Hola Mohalla and when there is a need to discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A ''[[gurmata|gurmatā]]'' (literally, ''guru's intention'') is an order passed by the {{unicode|Sarbat Ḵẖālsā}} in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sgpc.net/sikhism/tankah.asp | title=Sikh Reht Maryada&amp;nbsp;— Method of Adopting Gurmatta | accessdate=9 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Hukamnama|hukamnāmā]]'' (literally, ''edict'' or ''royal order'') is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā. However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which is a given order to Sikhs.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Sikhism}}
[[Guru Nanak]] (1469–1539), the founder of Sikhism, was born in the village of ''Rāi Bhōi dī Talwandī'', now called [[Nankana Sahib]] (in present-day [[Pakistan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh|year=2006|title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=India|isbn = 978-0-19-567747-8|pages=12–13}} According to the Purātan Janamsākhī (the birth stories of Nanak)&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Khatri]] [[Hindu]]s of the [[Bedi clan|Bedi]] clan. As a boy, Nanak was fascinated by God and religion. He would not partake in religious rituals or customs and oddly meditated alone. His desire to explore the mysteries of life eventually led him to leave home and take missionary journeys.

In his early teens, Nanak caught the attention of the local landlord [[Rai Bular Bhatti]], who was moved by his amazing intellect and divine qualities. [[Rai Bular Bhatti]] was witness to many incidents in which Nanak enchanted him and as a result [[Rai Bular Bhatti]] and Nanak's sister [[Bibi Nanki]], became the first persons to recognise the divine qualities in Nanak. Both of them then encouraged and supported Nanak to study and travel. At the age of thirty, Nanak went missing and was presumed to have drowned after going for one of his morning baths to a local stream called the ''Kali Bein''. On the day he arrived, he declared: &quot;There is no [[Hindu]], there is no [[Muslim]]&quot; (in Punjabi, &quot;''nā kōi hindū nā kōi musalmān''&quot;). It was from this moment that Nanak would begin to spread the teachings of what was then the beginning of Sikhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shackle|first=Christopher|coauthors=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh|year=2005|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures|publisher=Routledge |location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-415-26604-8|page=xiii–xiv|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact account of his itinerary is disputed, he is widely acknowledged to have made five major journeys, spanning thousands of miles, the first tour being east towards [[Bengal]] and [[Assam]], the second south towards [[Andhra]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], the third north towards [[Kashmir]], [[Ladakh]], and [[Tibet]], and the fourth tour west towards [[Baghdad]] and [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Harjinder Singh Dilgeer|year=2008|title=Sikh Twareekh|publisher=The Sikh University Press|location=Belgium &amp; India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last and final tour, he returned to the banks of the Ravi River to end his days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finegan|first=Jack|title=The Archeology of World Religions; the Background of Primitivism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto, Islam, and Sikhi|year=1952|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth of Sikhism and rise of Khalsa ===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
[[File:Maharaj Ranjit Singh.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of the King of the Sikh Kingdom of Lahore, ca. 1830, [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]].]]
The tenth guru of Sikhism, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], created the Khalsa in the year 1699, which means &quot;Akal Purakh de fauj&quot; – the Army of God.

The Sikh Khalsa rise to power began in the 17th century during a time of growing militancy against Muslim rule. The creation of a [[Sikh Empire]] began when Guru Gobind Singh sent his brave Sikh general, [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] along with some hundred Singhs to punish those who had committed atrocities against Pir Buddhu Shah and avenge the murder of his youngest sons. Banda Singh, with a large group of Sikhs, advanced towards the main Muslim Mughal city of Sirhind and, following the instructions of the guru, punished all the culprits. Soon after the invasion of Sirhind, Guru Gobind Singh was stabbed by a [[Pathan]] assassin hired by [[Mughals]], Jamshed Khan stabbed the Guru in the left side below the heart while he was resting in his chamber after the Rehras prayer. Guru Gobind Singh killed the attacker with his sword, while the assassin's companion tried to flee but was killed by some Sikhs who had rushed in upon hearing the noise. A European surgeon stitched the Guru's wound. However, the wound re-opened as the Guru tugged at a hard strong bow after a few days, and caused profuse bleeding.

The death of the Guru reached Banda Singh and Sikhs all over Punjab. After this the Sikhs took over many Muslim and Mughal lands, establishing a Sikh Empire. Other existing Muslim Emperors proclaimed a jihad or a holy war against Banda Singh and the Khalsa. However, many Muslim armies and their generals fled in dismay and despair after [[Wazir Khan]]'s head was stuck up on a spear and lifted high up by a Sikh who took his seat at Sirhind in 1710, Muslim troops on beholding the head took alarm. Many Muslims embraced Sikhism and joined the Khalsa. Banda Singh at this time also married the daughter of a Muslim general. Banda Singh's mission played an important development of the [[Dal Khalsa]] and the Sikh [[Misl]]s, which eventually led to a new king, [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] capturing Lahore in 1799 and establishing the Sikh Kingdom of Punjab. The new king and the Sikh Misls rose to power in a series of sweeping military and diplomatic victories. Increasing the number of Sikhs and spreading the Empire further. His vast empire comprised almost {{convert|200000|mi2|km2|abbr=off}} of what is now Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India.
The empire of the Sikhs was widely feared by many natives including Afghans, Persians and many Asian countries. Even many Pathans who had previously lived there during the Islamic rule, attempted many times to attack the Empire with over 20,000 troops, in which case Maharaja Ranjit Singh sent his bravest Sikh warrior, named Akali [[Phula Singh]] Nihang (at the age of 65) and a few hundred Singhs to deal with the invading Pathans and bring them under control.
The Sikhs retained control of the Sikh Empire. However, another challenge was yet to come. In the East, the [[British Empire]] took over thousands of square miles of land, including eastern parts of India and many Asian countries, soon reaching the Sikh Empire where the British would also meet their biggest challenge during their Conquest. Both British and Sikh sides lost many troops and heavy number of materials in various battles, such as the [[Anglo-Sikh wars]]. The British was claimed to be unbeatable, but Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the Sikhs were the only people who could stand toe to toe with the British forces. For the first time during the British conquest the British were unable to invade and resulted in both sides having to stop and come to terms.
This led to further Anglo-Sikh wars and further loss on both sides. In 1839, the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Empire fell on the shoulders of his son, [[Maharaja Duleep Singh]] (at the age of 11). The Empire then gradually fell into the hands of the British.

=== Political advancement ===
[[Guru Hargobind|Hargobind]], became the sixth guru of the Sikhs. He carried two swords—one for [[spirituality|spiritual]] and the other for [[secularism|temporal]] reasons (known as ''mīrī'' and ''pīrī'' in Sikhi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahmood|first=Cynthia|year=2002|title=A Sea of Orange|publisher=Xlibris|location=United States|isbn = 978-1-4010-2856-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs grew as an organized community and under the 10th Guru the Sikhs developed a trained fighting force to defend their independence. In 1644, [[Guru Har Rai|Har Rai]] became guru followed by [[Guru Harkrishan|Harkrishan]], the boy guru, in 1661. No hymns composed by these three gurus are included in the Guru Granth Sahib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shackle|first=Christopher|coauthors= Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh|year=2005|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures|publisher=Routledge |location=United Kingdom|isbn = 978-0-415-26604-8|page=xvi|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guru Tegh Bahadur|Tegh Bahadur]] became guru in 1665 and led the Sikhs until 1675. Tegh Bahadur was [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar|executed]] by [[Aurangzeb]] for helping to protect the faith of Hindus, after a delegation of [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s came to him for help when the Emperor was killing those who refused to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rama|first=Swami|year=1986|title=Celestial Song/Gobind Geet: The Dramatic Dialogue Between Guru Gobind Singh and Banda Singh Bahadur|publisher=Himalayan Institute Press|isbn = 978-0-89389-103-9|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his son, Gobind Rai who was just nine years old at the time of his father's death. Gobind Rai further militarised his followers, and was baptised by the ''{{unicode|[[Panj Piare|Pañj Piārē]]}}'' when he formed the [[Khalsa]] on 30 March 1699. From here on in he was known as [[Guru Gobind Singh|Gobind Singh]]. this was done as a defense.

From the time of Nanak the Sikhs had significantly transformed. Even though the core Sikh spiritual philosophy was never affected, the followers now began to develop a political identity. Conflict with Mughal authorities escalated during the lifetime of Teg Bahadur and Gobind Singh. The latter founded the Khalsa in 1699. The Khalsa is a disciplined community that combines its spiritual purpose and goals with political and military duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrinderp259&quot;/&gt; After Aurangzeb killed four of his sons, Gobind Singh sent Aurangzeb the [[Zafarnamah]] (''Notification/Epistle of Victory'').

Shortly before his death, Gobind Singh ordered that the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Gurū Granth Sāhib]] (the Sikh Holy Scripture), would be the ultimate spiritual authority for the Sikhs and temporal authority would be vested in the [[Khalsa]]—the Sikh Nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;granthfinalguru&quot;/&gt;

A former ascetic was charged by Gobind Singh with the duty of punishing those who had persecuted the innocents in Punjab. After the Guru's death, Baba [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] became the commander-in-chief of the [[Khalsa]] and was responsible for several attacks on the Mughal empire. He was executed by the emperor [[Farukh Siyar]] after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|authorlink=Khushwant Singh|year=2006|title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=India|isbn = 978-0-19-567747-8|pages=47–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh nation's embrace of military and political organisation made it a considerable regional force in medieval India and it continued to evolve after the demise of the gurus. After the death of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, [[Sikh Confederacy]] of Sikh warrior bands known as ''[[misls]]'' were formed. With the decline of the Mughal empire, a [[Sikh Empire]] arose in the Punjab under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], with its capital in [[Lahore]] and limits reaching the [[Khyber Pass]] and the borders of [[China]]. The order, traditions and discipline developed over centuries culminated at the time of Ranjit Singh to give rise to the common religious and social identity that the term &quot;Sikhi&quot; describes.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrinderp256&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn = 978-0-87196-129-7|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Ranjit Singh, the Sikh Empire fell into disorder and was eventually annexed by the [[United Kingdom]] after the hard-fought [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars. This brought the Punjab under the [[British Raj]]. Sikhs formed the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] and the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] to preserve Sikhs' religious and political organization a quarter of a century later. With the [[partition of India]] in 1947, thousands of Sikhs were killed in violence and millions were forced to leave their ancestral homes in [[West Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandey|first=Gyanendra|year=2001|title=Remembering Partition: Violence, Nationalism and History in India|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn = 978-0-521-00250-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs faced initial opposition from the Government in forming a linguistic state that other states in India were afforded. The [[Akali Dal]] started a non-violence movement for Sikh and Punjabi rights. [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] emerged as a leader of the [[Damdami Taksal]] in 1977 and promoted a more militant solution to the problem. In June 1984, Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] ordered the Indian army to launch [[Operation Blue Star]] to remove Bhindranwale and his followers from the Darbar Sahib. Bhindranwale and his accompanying followers were killed during the army's operations. In October, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. The assassination was followed by the [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Donald L.|year=2003|title=The Deadly Ethnic Riot|publisher=University of California Press|isbn = 978-978-0-520-23642-4|pages=482–485}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hindu-Sikh conflicts in Punjab, as a reaction to Operation Blue Star and the assassin.

== Scripture ==

There is one primary source of scripture for the Sikhs: the Gurū Granth Sāhib. The Gurū Granth Sāhib may be referred to as the Ādi Granth—literally, ''The First Volume''—and the two terms are often used synonymously. Here, however, the Ādi Granth refers to the version of the scripture created by [[Guru Arjan Dev|Arjan Dev]] in 1604. The Gurū Granth Sāhib is the final version of the scripture created by [[Guru Gobind Singh|Gobind Singh]].

There are other sources of scriptures such as the [[Dasam Granth]] and so called [[Janamsakhis]]. These however, have been the subject of controversial debate amongst the Sikh community.

=== Adi Granth ===
{{Main|Ādi Granth}}
The Ādi Granth was compiled primarily by [[Bhai Gurdas]] under the supervision of [[Guru Arjan Dev]] between the years 1603 and 1604.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Trumpp | first=Ernest | year=2004 | origyear=1877 | title=The Ādi Granth or the Holy Scriptures of the Sikhs | publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers | location=India | isbn = 978-81-215-0244-3 | page=1xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in the [[Gurmukhi|Gurmukhī]] script, which is a descendant of the {{unicode|[[Laṇḍā]]}} script used in the Punjab at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Grierson | first=George Abraham | authorlink=George Abraham Grierson | year=1967 | origyear=1927 | title=The Linguistic Survey of India | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | location=India | isbn = 978-81-85395-27-2 | page=624}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gurmukhi|Gurmukhī]] script was standardised by Angad Dev, the second guru of the Sikhs, for use in the Sikh scriptures and is thought to have been influenced by the [[Śāradā script|Śāradā]] and [[Devanāgarī]] scripts. An authoritative scripture was created to protect the integrity of hymns and teachings of the Sikh gurus and fifteen bhagats. These fifteen bhagats are Namdev, Ravidas, Jaidev, Trilocan, Beni, Ramanand, Sainu, Dhanna, Sadhna, Pipa, Sur, Bhikhan, Paramanand, Farid, and Kabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|year=2002|title=Songs of the Saints from the Adi Granth|publisher=Journal Of The American Oriental Society|page=924,925}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Arjan Sahib tried to prevent undue influence from the followers of Prithi Chand, the guru's older brother and rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mann | first=Gurinder Singh | year=2001 | title=The Making of Sikh Scripture | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=United States | isbn = 978-0-19-513024-9 | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guru Granth Sahib ===
[[File:Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan.jpg|thumb|upright                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |Gurū Granth Sāhib folio with [[Mul Mantra|Mūl Mantra]]]]
{{Main|Gurū Granth Sāhib}}
The final version of the [[Gurū Granth Sāhib]] was compiled by Guru [[Guru Gobind Singh|Gobind Singh]] in 1678. It consists of the original Ādi Granth with the addition of [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]]'s hymns. The Guru Granth Sahib is considered the Eleventh and final spiritual authority of the Sikhs.

:[[Transliteration]]: {{unicode|Sabb sikkhaṇ kō hukam hai [[Guru Maneyo Granth|gurū mānyō granth]].}}
:{{lang-en|All Sikhs are commanded to take the Granth as Guru}}.

It contains compositions by the first five Gurus, [[Guru Teg Bahadur]] and just one ''{{unicode|[[Shloka|śalōk]]}}'' (''couplet'') from Guru Gobind Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Brar | first=Sandeep Singh | year=1998 | title=The Sikhism Homepage: Sri Guru Granth Sahib&amp;nbsp;— Authors &amp; Contributors | url=http://sikhs.org/granth2.htm | accessdate=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains the traditions and teachings of ''sants'' (''saints'') such as [[Kabir]], [[Namdev]], [[Ravidas]], and [[Sheikh Farid]] along with several others.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrinderp256&quot;/&gt;

The bulk of the scripture is classified into ''[[raga|rāgs]]'', with each rāg subdivided according to length and author. There are 31 main rāgs within the Gurū Granth Sāhib. In addition to the rāgs, there are clear references to the folk music of Punjab. The main language used in the scripture is known as ''{{unicode|[[Sant Bhasha|Sant Bhāṣā]]}}'', a language related to both Punjabi and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and used extensively across medieval northern India by proponents of popular devotional religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrinderp259&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the name &quot;Gurmukhi&quot;, it is not merely a script but it is the language which came out of Guru's mouth – by using this definition, all words in Guru Granth Sahib constitute &quot;Gurbani&quot; words, thus making Gurmukhi language which then constitute two components – spoken Gurmukhi words (in form of Gurbani which originated from different languages (like world's different languages have similar roots) and Gurmukhi script. The text further comprises over 5000 ''[[shabhad|śabads]]'', or hymns, which are poetically constructed and set to classical form of music rendition, can be set to predetermined musical ''[[Tala (music)|tāl]]'', or rhythmic beats.
[[File:Sikh musicians.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A group of [[Sikh music]]ians at the Golden Temple complex]]

The Granth begins with the ''[[Mul Mantra|Mūl Mantra]]'', an iconic verse created by Nanak:

:{{lang-pa|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥}}
:[[ISO 15919]] [[transliteration]]: ''{{unicode|Ika ōaṅkāra sati nāmu karatā purakhu nirabha'u niravairu akāla mūrati ajūnī saibhaṅ gura prasādi.}}''
:Simplified transliteration: {{unicode|Ik ōaṅgkār sat nām kartā purkh nirbha'u nirvair akāl mūrat ajūnī saibhaṅ gur prasād.}}
:{{lang-en|The One of which everything is and continuous}}, the ever existing, creator being personified, without fear, without hatred, image Of the timeless being, beyond birth, self existent, by Guru's Grace.

All text within the Granth is known as ''[[gurbani|gurbānī]]''. And Gurbani is the Guru &quot;Baani Guru Guru hai Baani&quot; (The word is the Guru and Guru is the word) and &quot;Shabd Guru Surat Dhun Chaylaa&quot; (The Shabad is the Guru, upon whom I lovingly focus my consciousness; I am the disciple.). Therefore, as evident from the message of the Guru Nanak (first Guru) Shabad (or word) was always the Guru (the enlightener); however, as Sikhism stand on the dual strands of Miri-Piri, the Guru in Sikhism is a combination of teacher-leader. Therefore, the lineage from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh was of the teacher-leaders eventually wherein the temporal authority was passed on to the [[Khalsa]] and spiritual authority, which always was with, passed to [[Adi Granth]](thence the Guru Granth Sahib).

Therefore, Guru Granth Sahib and its 11th body -the [[Khalsa]] is the Guru, teacher-leader, of the Sikhs till eternity.

=== Dasam Granth ===
{{Main|Dasam Granth}}
[[File:Dasam.Granth.Frontispiece.BL.Manuscript.1825-1850.jpg|thumb|A [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to the [[Dasam Granth]]]]
The Dasam Granth is a scripture of Sikhs which contains texts attributed to the [[Guru Gobind Singh|Tenth Guru]]. The Dasam Granth holds a significance of great amount for Sikhs, however it doesn't have the same authority as [[Adi Granth]]. Some compositions of the Dasam Granth like [[Jaap Sahib]], ([[Amrit Savaiye]]), and [[Benti Chaupai]] are part of the daily prayers/lessons ([[Nitnem]]) of/for Sikhs.

=== Janamsakhis ===
{{Main|Janamsākhīs}}

The Janamsākhīs (literally ''birth stories''), are writings which profess to be biographies of Nanak. Although not scripture in the strictest sense, they provide an interesting look at Nanak's life and the early start of Sikhism. There are several—often contradictory and sometimes unreliable—Janamsākhīs and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.

== Observances ==
Observant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation from memory of specific passages from the Gurū Granth Sāhib, especially the ''Japu'' (or ''Japjī'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurduārā'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.

Worship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ardās]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ardās recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;p260&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh faith also participates in the custom of &quot;Langar&quot; or the community meal. All gurdwaras are open to anyone of any faith for a free meal. People can enter and eat together and are served by faithful members of the community. This is the main cost associated with gurdwaras and where monetary donations are primarily spent.

=== Sikh festivals/events ===
Technically, there are no festivals in Sikhism. However, the events mostly centred around the lives of the Gurus and Sikh martyrs are commemorated. The [[SGPC]], the Sikh organisation in charge of upkeep of the historical gurdwaras of Punjab, organises celebrations based on the new [[Nanakshahi]] calendar. This calendar is highly controversial among Sikhs and is not universally accepted. Sikh festivals include the following:
* [[Gurpurab]]s are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom. All ten Gurus have Gurpurabs on the Nanakshahi calendar, but it is Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh who have a gurpurab that is widely celebrated in Gurdwaras and Sikh homes. The martyrdoms are also known as a shaheedi Gurpurabs, which mark the martyrdom anniversary of [[Guru Arjan Dev]] and [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]].
* [[Visakhi]] occurs on 13 April. Sikhs celebrate it because on this day which fell on 30 March 1699, the tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, inaugurated the [[Khalsa]], the 11th body of Guru Granth Sahib and leader of Sikhs till eternity.
* [[Bandi Chhor Divas|Bandi Chhor]] celebrates Guru Hargobind's release from the [[Gwalior Fort]], with several innocent Hindu kings who were also imprisoned by [[Jahangir]], on 26 October 1619. This day usually commemorated on the same day of Hindu festival of [[Diwali]].
* [[Hola Mohalla]] occurs the day after [[Holi]] and is when the [[Khalsa]] gather at Anandpur and display their individual and team warrior skills, including fighting and riding. Cannabis or [[Bhang]] is also pounded by the Sikhs on this day.

=== Ceremonies and customs ===
[[File:Sikh wedding.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sikh wedding]]]]
Guru Nanak Dev Ji taught that rituals, religious ceremonies, or idol worship are of little use and Sikhs are discouraged from fasting or going on pilgrimages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahib|first=Nanak|authorlink=Guru Nanak|title=Guru Granth Sāhib|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=75&amp;english=t&amp;id=3063#l3063|accessdate=30 June 2006 | page=75 | quote=Pilgrimages, fasts, purification and self-discipline are of no use, nor are rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs do not believe in converting people but converts to Sikhi by choice are welcomed. The morning and evening prayers take about two hours a day, starting in the very early morning hours. The first morning prayer is Guru Nanak's ''Jap Ji''. Jap, meaning &quot;recitation&quot;, refers to the use of sound, as the best way of approaching the divine. Like combing hair, hearing and reciting the sacred word is used as a way to comb all negative thoughts out of the mind. The second morning prayer is Guru Gobind Singh's universal Jaap Sahib. The Guru addresses God as having no form, no country, and no religion but as the seed of seeds, sun of suns, and the song of songs. The Jaap Sahib asserts that God is the cause of conflict as well as peace, and of destruction as well as creation. Devotees learn that there is nothing outside of God's presence, nothing outside of God's control. Devout Sikhs are encouraged to begin the day with private meditations on the name of God.

Upon a child's birth, the Guru Granth Sahib is opened at a random point and the child is named using the first letter on the top left hand corner of the left page. All boys are given the last name [[Singh]], and all girls are given the last name [[Kaur]] (this was once a title which was conferred on an individual upon joining the [[Khalsa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loehlin|first=Clinton Herbert|year=1964|origyear=1958|edition=Second edition|title=The Sikhs and Their Scriptures|publisher=Lucknow Publishing House|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs are joined in wedlock through the ''[[Anand Karaj|anand kāraj]]'' ceremony. Sikhs are required to marry when they are of a sufficient age (child marriage is taboo), and without regard for the future spouse's caste or descent. The marriage ceremony is performed in the company of the Guru Granth Sahib; around which the couple circles four times. After the ceremony is complete, the husband and wife are considered &quot;a single soul in two bodies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgpc.net/sikhism/anand-sanskar.html|title=Sikh Reht Maryada&amp;nbsp;— Anand Sanskar: (Sikh Matrimonial Ceremony and Conventions)|accessdate=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sikh religious rites, neither husband nor wife is permitted to divorce unless special circumstances arise. A Sikh couple that wishes to divorce may be able to do so in a civil court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansukhani|first=Gobind Singh|year=1977|title=Introduction to Sikhism|url=http://allaboutsikhs.com/mansukh/123.htm|publisher=Hemkunt Press|location=India|accessdate=11 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon death, the body of a Sikh is usually cremated. If this is not possible, any means of disposing the body may be employed. The ''kīrtan sōhilā'' and ''ardās'' prayers are performed during the funeral ceremony (known as ''[[Antam Sanskar|antim sanskār]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgpc.net/sikhism/antam-sanskar.asp|title=Sikh Reht Maryada&amp;nbsp;— Funeral Ceremonies (Antam Sanskar)|accessdate=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baptism and the Khalsa ===

[[Khalsa]] (meaning &quot;Sovereign&quot;) is the collective name given by Gobind Singh to all Sikhs, male or female, who have been baptised or initiated by taking ''[[amrita|ammrit]]'' in a ceremony called ''[[ammrit sañcār]]''. The first time that this ceremony took place was on [[Visakhi]], which fell on 30 March 1699 at [[Anandpur Sahib]] in Punjab. It was on that occasion that Gobind Singh baptised the [[Panj Piare|Pañj Piārē]]—the five beloved ones, who in turn baptised Gobind Singh himself. The last name, Singh, meaning lion,  is given to baptized Sikh males, and the last name Kaur, meaning princess/lioness,  is given to baptized Sikh females.
Baptised [[Sikhs]] are bound to wear the [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as ''pañj kakkē'' or ''pañj kakār''), or articles of faith, at all times. The 5 items are: ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kēs]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|{{unicode|kaṅghā}}]]'' (small wooden comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|{{unicode|kaṛā}}]]'' (circular steel or iron bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirpān]]'' (sword/dagger), and ''[[kaccha|kacchera]]'' (special undergarment). The Five Ks have both practical and symbolic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Simmonds|first=David|year=1992|title=Believers All: A Book of Six World Religions|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn = 978-0-17-437057-4|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, there are 25.8 million Sikhs, which make up only 0.39% of the world's population. Approximately 75% of Sikhs live in the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], where they constitute about 60% of the state's population. Large communities of Sikhs live in the neighboring states such as Indian State of Haryana which is home to the second largest Sikh population in India with 1.1 million Sikhs as per 2001 census, and large communities of Sikhs can be found across India. However, Sikhs only make up about 2% of the Indian population.

Sikh migration beginning from the 19th century led to the creation of significant communities in [[Canada]] (predominantly in [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]], along with  [[British Columbia]]), [[East Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[United Kingdom]] as well as [[United States]] and [[Australia]]. These communities developed as Sikhs migrated out of Punjab to fill in gaps in imperial labour markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ballantyne|first=Tony|year=2006|title=Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn = 978-978-0-8223-3824-6|pages=69–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century a significant community began to take shape on the west coast of the [[United States]]. Smaller populations of Sikhs are found in within many countries in [[Western Europe]], [[Mauritius]], [[Malaysia]], [[Fiji]], [[Nepal]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Singapore]], [[Mexico]], the [[United States]] and many other countries.

Beginning in 1968, [[Yogi Bhajan]] (later of the [[3HO]] movement) began to teach classes kundalini yoga, resulting in a number of non-Punjabi converts to Sikhism (known as ''gora'' [&quot;white&quot;] Sikhs) in the United States. Since then, thousands of non-Punjabis have taken up the Sikh belief and lifestyle primarily in the United States, Canada, Latin America, the Far East and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sikh Identity: An Exploration of Groups among Sikhs |first= Opinderjit Kaur|last=Takhar |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Aldershot, Hants, England |year=2005 |isbn=9780754652021 |pages=159 |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aeKWQzesOc4C&amp;pg=PA158#v=twopage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
