{{ESp|?}} Anthropomorphism is a [[Literary device]], but is it a Poetic device What's the difference? (sorry, not an English major.) &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.25pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font:9px Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 23:03, 2 May 2012 (UTC)

:Personification is a well used poetic device. It is in no way related to anthropomorphism. I work with poets and am a poet and this has been a major point of contention trying to give them a good definition and examples when there is no page for it and it redirects to something unrelated. Personification is the attribution of human traits to inanimate objects. This has nothing to do with animals whatsoever! Please remove the redirect so those who know what personification is can create a proper page for it.

:Personification can be used for any entity, and anthropomorphism is used for animals. I don't think anthropomorphism could be considered a poetic device. Also, consensus should have been gained for this. Closing request.

[[:File:Lyo and Merly in Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|[[Lyo and Merly]], [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]] in Hong Kong.]]

Please change &quot;Hong Kong&quot; to Singapore. Lyo and Merly were mascots of the first Youth Olympic Games 2010 held in Singapore, not Hong Kong.

Also, the photo looks photoshopped in a way that Lyo and Merly were simply pasted onto a photo of the Hong Kong skyline. Please get an official original photo of Lyo and Merly taken in Singapore.

I can testify that I have seen God, In A &quot;Anthropothesim&quot; State. This happened twice, in Dry Fork Canyon, Utah, in the year 1995.

== Robots ==

Are robots and other artificial intelligence programs considered to be anthropomorphic? I always thought that robots are considered to be a different category because robots are define as being human like and I always thought that anthropomorphism ony applies to things that do not normally have human like characteristics. In the past, robots have not been categorized under anthropomorphic, but now, [[User:Niemti|Niemti]] has started to categorize robots as anthropomorphic. What do other people feel about this? [[User:JDDJS|JDDJS]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|talk]]) 18:39, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

Of course. Like, literally, everything else. Robots &quot;are define as being human like&quot; - nope, take a look at a production robot in a car factory, or a Predator drone, or almost every robot in existence really. (I think you thought of [[android]]s.) An example of a video game robot that is NOT anthromorphic looks like that: [[D0g]]. --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 18:51, 26 October 2012 (UTC)
:If you are defining anthropomorphic by appearance alone, why is [[GLaDOS]] considered anthropomorphic? Additionally, if robots are so clearly considered to be anthropomorphic, why are you the only person on Wikipedia, as of now, who has categorized any robot as such? [[User:JDDJS|JDDJS]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|talk]]) 19:00, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

&quot;by appearance alone&quot;? [[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphism or personification is '''any''' attribution of human characteristics]]. Not &quot;robots&quot;, but &quot;some robots&quot;, specifically androids (I told you already). Like Dog from my example is a robot gorilla &quot;by appearance alone&quot; and a dog by program. I am &quot;the only person on Wikipedia&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Anthropomorphic_characters_in_video_games&amp;action=history who created this category], maybe that's why. --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 19:08, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

Also, go and take a look at the illustration at [http://anthropomorphism.org/ anthropomorphism.org]. --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 19:12, 26 October 2012 (UTC)
:I would really like some more opinions here. Do you know of any editors who know about anthropomorphism? If you do please ask them to join this discussion because it is currently just my opinion versus your opinion here. If more editors come here and agree with your categorization of anthropomorphism, then I will gladly admit that I am wrong. [[User:JDDJS|JDDJS]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|talk]]) 15:04, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anthropomorphism Hey, it's not &quot;my opinion&quot;.] It's not really what [[Furry fandom|sexual deviants]] think it is, you know? And it's not even a subject of anyone's &quot;opinion&quot;, beyond you being confused about what [[anthropomorphism]] is (and what is a [[robot]], too, and how does it relate to [[humanoid robot]]s). --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 15:19, 27 October 2012 (UTC)
:I understand completely what anthropomorphism is. But would you consider things like aliens anthropomorphic? According to link that you provided, anthropomorphism is defined as &quot;Attribution of human motivation, characteristics, or behavior to inanimate objects, animals, or natural phenomena&quot; Which of those categories do robots fall under? They are defiantly not natural phenomena or animals, and I really do not feel that they are inanimate objects because robots are made to animate. To my knowledge, no editor besides you has ever categorized robots as anthropomorphic, so that makes me think that you are the only editor who feels that way. But as I said before, if editors come here and agree with you, I'll gladly admit that I am wrong, and will let this issue go. But as of now, it simply just the two of us, leaving us at a stalemate. [[User:JDDJS|JDDJS]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|talk]]) 15:53, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

Frankly speaking, I don't care about &quot;your knowledge of editors categorizing&quot; and other original research. But since you asked, robots are &quot;etc.&quot; (&quot;deity, animal, etc.&quot;, &quot;gods, animals, etc.&quot;), &quot;etc.&quot; being anything. And if you want to educate yourself about [https://www.google.pl/search?q=android+Anthropomorphism&amp;oq=android+Anthropomorphism&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=anthropomorphic+robot&amp;oq=anthropomorphic+robot&amp;gs_l=serp.3...11711.11711.3.11865.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0.cfrsh..0.0...1.1.uA1g0DU5avc&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=aee7e57049eb931c&amp;bpcl=35466521&amp;biw=1527&amp;bih=830 anthropomorphic robots], you can start now. Bye. --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 16:13, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

And &quot;things like aliens&quot; can only be anthropomorphic when they are in fact anthropomorphic. The Blob from the film [[The Blob (1988 film)|The Blob]] sure isn't. --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 16:21, 27 October 2012 (UTC)
:Can you stop being so rude to me? All I want is some other editors opinions. If robots can so clearly be anthropomorphic like you say, it should not be so hard for you to find other editors who agree with you. [[User:JDDJS|JDDJS]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|talk]]) 17:55, 28 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
