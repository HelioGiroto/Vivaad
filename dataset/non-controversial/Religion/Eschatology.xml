{{Eschatology}}
[[Image:Durer Revelation Four Riders.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'', by [[Albrecht Dürer]].]]

'''Eschatology''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-eschatology.ogg|ˌ|ɛ|s|k|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἔσχατος|ἔσχατος/ἐσχάτη/ἔσχατον]]}}, eschatos/eschatē/eschaton'' meaning &quot;last&quot; and ''[[-logy]]'' meaning &quot;the study of&quot;, first used in English around 1550)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/es/eschatology.html Dictionary - Definition of Eschatology] Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; is a part of [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and [[futurology]] concerned with what are believed to be the final events of [[history of the world|history]], the [[Destiny|ultimate destiny]] of humanity — commonly referred to as the &quot;end of the world&quot; or &quot;[[end time]]&quot;.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines eschatology as &quot;The department of theological science concerned with ‘the four last things: [[death]], [[Divine judgment|judgement]], [[heaven]], and [[hell]]’.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Eschatology, ''n.''&quot;, def. a, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed 2012-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of  [[mysticism]], the phrase refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine. In many [[religion]]s it is taught as an existing future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or [[folklore]]. More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the [[Messiah]] or [[Messianic Age]], the [[end time]], and the end of days.

History is often divided into &quot;ages&quot; (Gk. [[aeons]]), an age being a period when certain realities are present. One age comes to an end and a new age, where different realities are present, begins. When such transitions from one age to another are the subject of eschatological discussion, the phrase, &quot;end of the world&quot;, is replaced by &quot;end of the age&quot;, &quot;end of an era&quot;, or &quot;end of life as we know it&quot;. Much [[apocalyptic fiction]] does not deal with the &quot;end of time&quot; but rather with the end of a certain period of time, the end of life as it is now, and the beginning of a new period of time. It is usually a crisis that brings an end to current reality and ushers in a new way of living / thinking / being. This crisis may take the form of the intervention of a deity in history, a war, a change in the environment or the reaching of a new level of consciousness.

Most modern eschatology and [[apocalypticism]], both religious and secular, involves the violent disruption or destruction of the world, whereas Christian and Jewish eschatologies view the end times as the consummation or perfection of God's creation of the world. For example, according to ancient Hebrew belief, life takes a linear (and not cyclical) path; the world began with God and is constantly headed toward God’s final goal for creation.

Eschatologies vary as to their degree of optimism or pessimism about the future (and in some eschatologies, conditions are better for some and worse for others, e.g. &quot;heaven and hell&quot;).

==In philosophy==
Eschatology has also been a study shared and theorized on by [[philosophers]]. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] stressed the allegorical method of interpretation. He was greatly influenced by [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Things to Come| author =J. Dwight Pentecost| publisher =Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49506| copyright =1958| isbn =-10: 0310308909 and ISBN 978-0-310-30890-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by [[Ibn al-Nafis]]&lt;ref name=Roubi&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi, [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibnul-Nafees As a Philosopher], ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hegel]] with their [[philosophy of history]], and, some such as the author [[Albert Camus]] in 'The Rebel' and [[José Guilherme Merquior|J.G. Merquior]], have argued, [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[B]esides sharing with the pessimist [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] the historicization of the economy, by dint of categories such as scarcity and production as well as the labor theory of value, Marx the revolutionary shared also with his century, as we have seen, the unholy alliance between [[positivism]] and eschatology. There are worse ways of grasping the philosophical gist of Marxism.&quot; [[José Guilherme Merquior|J.G. Merquior]] (1985).

==Eschatology in religions==
===Bahá'í eschatology===
{{Main|Bahá'í teachings}}
In [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] belief, creation has neither a beginning nor an end.  Instead the eschatology of other religions is viewed as symbolic.  In Bahá'í belief, human time is marked by a series of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]]s in which successive [[Manifestation of God|messengers]] or prophets come from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Eschatology |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coming of each of these messengers is seen as the day of judgement to the adherents of the previous religion, who may choose to accept the new messenger and enter the 'heaven' of belief, or denounce the new messenger and enter the 'hell' of denial.  In this view the terms heaven and hell are seen as symbolic terms for the person's spiritual progress and their nearness to or distance from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith&quot;/&gt;  In Bahá'í belief, the coming of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, signals the fulfilment of previous eschatological expectations of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and other major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Studies in Modern Religions, Religious Movements and the Bābī-Bahā'ī Faiths | editor = Sharon, Moshe | chapter = The eschatology of Globalization: The multiple-messiahship of Bahā'u'llāh revisited | first = Christopher | last = Buck | isbn = 90-04-13904-4 | pages = 143–178 | location = Boston | publisher = Brill | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist eschatology===
{{Main|Buddhist eschatology}}
Some forms of Buddhism hold belief in cycles in which life span of human beings changes according to human nature. In Cakkavati sutta the Buddha explained the relationship between life span of human being and behaviour. As per this sutta, in the past unskillful behavior was unknown among the human race. As a result, people lived for an immensely long time — 80,000 years — endowed with great beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength. Over the course of time, though, they began behaving in various unskillful ways. This caused the human life span gradually to shorten, to the point where it now stands at 100 years, with human beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength decreasing proportionately. In the future, as morality continues to degenerate, human life will continue to shorten to the point where the normal life span is 10 years, with people reaching sexual maturity at five{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Ultimately, conditions will deteriorate to the point of a &quot;sword-interval,&quot; in which swords appear in the hands of all human beings, and they hunt one another like game. A few people, however, will take shelter in the wilderness to escape the carnage, and when the slaughter is over, they will come out of hiding and resolve to take up a life of skillful and virtuous action again. With the recovery of virtue, the human life span will gradually increase again until it reaches 80,000 years, with people attaining sexual maturity at 500.

According to Tibetan Buddhist literature, the age of first Buddha was 1,000,000 years and height was 100 cubits while 28th Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama (563BC–483BC) lived 80 years and his height was 20 cubits.

===Christian eschatology===
{{Christian Eschatology}}
{{Main|Christian eschatology}}
Christian eschatology is concerned with death, an [[intermediate state]], [[Heaven]], [[hell]], the [[Second Coming|return of Jesus]], the [[resurrection of the dead]], for several evangelical denominations,  a [[rapture]], a [[tribulation|great tribulation]], the [[Millennialism|Millennium]], [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]], the [[last judgment]], a new heaven and a [[The New Earth|new earth]] (the [[World to Come]]), and the ultimate consummation of all of God's purposes. Eschatological passages are found in many places, esp. ''Isaiah'', ''Daniel'', ''[[Matthew 24]]'', ''[[The Sheep and the Goats]]'', and the ''[[Book of Revelation]]'', but ''Revelation'' often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.

The [[Second Coming of Christ]] is the central event in Christian eschatology. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.

The book of ''Revelation'' is at the core of Christian eschatology. The study of ''Revelation'' is usually divided into four approaches. In the [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]] approach, ''Revelation'' is chiefly seen as referring to events which as yet have not come to pass, but which will come to pass at the end of the age, and the end of the world. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies. In the [[Preterism|Preterist]] approach, ''Revelation'' chiefly refers to the events of the first century, such as the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, and the desecration of the temple in the same year. In the [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]] approach, ''Revelation'' provides a broad view of history, and passages in ''Revelation'' are identified with major historical people and events. In the [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]] (or Spiritualist or Symbolic) approach, the events of ''Revelation'' are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.

===Hindu eschatology===
{{Main|Hindu eschatology}}
Contemporary Hindu eschatology is linked in the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition to the figure of [[Kalki]], or the tenth and last [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] before the age draws to a close, and [[Shiva]] simultaneously dissolves and regenerates the universe.

Most Hindus believe that the current period is the [[Kali Yuga]], the last of four periods (''Yuga'') that make up the current age. Each period has seen a successive degeneration in the moral order and character of human beings, to the point that in the Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are prevalent. Often, the invocation of Kali Yuga denotes a certain helplessness in the face of the horrors and suffering of the human condition and a nostalgia for a golden past or a future salvation.

However, Hindu conceptions of time, like those found in other non-Western traditions, are cyclical in that one age may end but another will always begin. As such, the cycle of birth, growth, decay, death, and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order of all things, yet affected by the vagaries of the comings and goings of divine interventions in the Vaishnavite belief.

Most Hindus believe that Shiva will destroy the world at the end of the [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]. Some Shaivites hold the view that he is incessantly destroying and creating the world.

===Islamic eschatology===
{{Main|Islamic eschatology}}
[[Islamic eschatology]] is documented in the [[Hadith|sayings]] of the [[Prophet of Islam|Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], regarding the Signs of the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]]. The Prophet's sayings on the subject have been traditionally divided into Major and Minor Signs. He spoke about several Minor Signs of the approach of the Day of Judgment, including:
* [[Abu Hurairah]] reported that [[Muhammad]] said: &quot;If you survive for a time you would certainly see people who would have whips in their hands like the tail of an ox. They would get up in the morning under the wrath of God and they would go into the evening with the anger of God.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim&quot;&gt;Muslim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Imam Ahmed&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that Muhammad said, &quot;When honesty is lost, then wait for the Day of Judgment.&quot; It was asked, &quot;How will honesty be lost, O Messenger of God?&quot; He said, &quot;When authority is given to those who do not deserve it, then wait for the Day of Judgment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bukhari&quot;&gt;Bukhari&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], in a long narration, relating to the questions of the angel [[Gabriel#Islamic references|Gabriel]], reported: &quot;Inform me when the Day of Judgment will be.&quot; He [the Prophet Muhammad] remarked: &quot;The one who is being asked knows no more than the inquirer.&quot; He [the inquirer] said: &quot;Tell me about its indications.&quot; He [the Prophet Muhammad] said: &quot;That the slave-girl gives birth to her mistress and master, and that you would find barefooted, destitute shepherds of goats vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bukhari&quot;/&gt;
* &quot;Before the Day of Judgment there will be great liars, so beware of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bukhari&quot;/&gt;
* &quot;When the most wicked member of a tribe becomes its ruler, and the most worthless member of a community becomes its leader, and a man is respected through fear of the evil he may do, and leadership is given to people who are unworthy of it, expect the Day of Judgment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bukhari&quot;/&gt;

Regarding the Major Signs, a [[Sahaba|Companion of the Prophet]] narrated: &quot;Once we were sitting together and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked us what it was we were discussing. We said it was the Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, [[Dajjal]] [the [[Antichrist]]], the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the [[Second Coming#Islam|Second Coming]] of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], the emergence of [[Gog and Magog#Qur'an|Gog and Magog]], and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].'&quot; (note: the previous events were not listed in the chronological order of appearance)

===Jewish eschatology===
{{Main|Jewish eschatology}}
[[Judaism]] addresses the [[end time]]s in the [[Book of Daniel]] and numerous other prophetic passages in the Hebrew scriptures, and also in the [[Talmud]], particularly Tractate [[Avodah Zarah]].
