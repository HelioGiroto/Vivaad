In [[epistemology]] and in its modern sense, '''rationalism''' is &quot;any view appealing to [[reason]] as a source of knowledge or justification&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacey 286&quot;&gt;Lacey, A.R. (1996), A Dictionary of Philosophy, 1st edition, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1976. 2nd edition, 1986. 3rd edition, Routledge, London, UK, 1996. page 286&lt;/ref&gt; In more technical terms, it is a method or a [[theory]] &quot;in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and [[deductive]]&quot;.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bourke 263&quot;&gt;Bourke, Vernon J., &quot;Rationalism&quot;, p. 263 in Runes (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Different degrees of emphasis on this method or theory lead to a range of rationalist standpoints, from the moderate position &quot;that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge&quot; to the more extreme position that reason is &quot;the unique path to knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi 771&quot;&gt;Audi, Robert, The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1995. 2nd edition, 1999, page 771.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a pre-modern understanding of reason, rationalism is identical to [[philosophy]], the [[Socrates|Socratic]] life of inquiry, or the zetetic (skeptical) clear interpretation of authority (open to the underlying or essential cause of things as they appear to our sense of certainty). In recent decades, [[Leo Strauss]] sought to revive &quot;Classical Political Rationalism&quot; as a discipline that understands the task of reasoning, not as foundational, but as [[Maieutics|maieutic]]. Rationalism should not be confused with [[rationality]], nor with [[rationalization (disambiguation)|rationalization]].

In [[politics]], rationalism since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] historically emphasized a &quot;politics of reason&quot; centered upon [[rational choice]], [[utilitarianism]], [[secularism]], and [[irreligion]] — the [[antitheism|antitheistic]] tendencies of this last aspect since having been partly ameliorated by [[millennials]]' more tolerant and utilitarian adoption of methodological, [[Pluralistic Rationalism|pluralistic rationalist]] practices applicable irrespective of religious or political affiliation.

==Background==
Since the Enlightenment, rationalism is usually associated with the introduction of mathematical methods into philosophy, as in [[Descartes]], [[Leibniz]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Bourke 263&quot;/&gt; This is commonly called '''continental rationalism''', because it was predominant in the continental schools of Europe, whereas in Britain [[empiricism]] dominated.

Rationalism is often contrasted with [[empiricism]]. Taken very broadly these views are not mutually exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacey 286&quot;/&gt;  Taken to extremes the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us through experience, either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification, and thus that knowledge is essentially based on or derived from experience.  At issue is the fundamental source of human knowledge, and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know (see [[Epistemology]]).

Proponents of some varieties of rationalism argue that, starting with foundational basic principles, like the axioms of [[geometry]], one could [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] derive the rest of all possible knowledge.  The philosophers who held this view most clearly were [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], whose attempts to grapple with the epistemological and metaphysical problems raised by Descartes led to a development of the fundamental approach of rationalism.  Both Spinoza and Leibniz asserted that, ''in principle'', all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, could be gained through the use of reason alone, though they both observed that this was not possible ''in practice'' for human beings except in specific areas such as [[mathematics]].  On the other hand, Leibniz admitted in his book ''[[Monadology]]'' that &quot;we are all mere [[Empirics]] in three fourths of our actions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi 771&quot;/&gt; Rationalism is predicting and explaining behavior based on logic.

==Philosophical usage==
The distinction between rationalists and empiricists was drawn at a later period, and would not have been recognized by the philosophers involved.  Also, the distinction was not as clear-cut as is sometimes suggested;  for example, Descartes and Locke have similar views about the nature of human ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Rationalism vs. Empiricism]
First published Thu Aug 19, 2004; substantive revision Wed Aug 6, 2008; cited on 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists were all committed to the importance of empirical science, and in many respects the empiricists were closer to Descartes in their methods and metaphysical theories than were Spinoza and Leibniz.{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

==History==
===René Descartes (1596&amp;ndash;1650)===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
Descartes thought that only knowledge of eternal truths{{spaced ndash}} including the truths of mathematics, and the epistemological and metaphysical foundations of the sciences{{spaced ndash}} could be attained by reason alone; other knowledge, the knowledge of physics, required experience of the world, aided by the [[scientific method]]. He also argued that although [[dream]]s appear as real as sense experience, these dreams cannot provide persons with knowledge. Also, since conscious sense experience can be the cause of illusions, then sense experience itself can be doubtable. As a result, Descartes deduced that a rational pursuit of truth should doubt every belief about reality. He elaborated these beliefs in such works as ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''. Descartes developed a method to attain truths according to which nothing that cannot be recognised by the intellect (or [[reason]]) can be classified as knowledge. These truths are gained &quot;without any sensory experience&quot;, according to Descartes. Truths that are attained by reason are broken down into elements that intuition can grasp, which, through a purely deductive process, will result in clear truths about reality.

Descartes therefore argued, as a result of his method, that reason alone determined knowledge, and that this could be done independently of the senses. For instance, his famous dictum, ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'', is a conclusion reached [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] i.e. not through an inference from experience. This was, for Descartes, an irrefutable principle upon which to ground all forms of other knowledge. Descartes posited a metaphysical [[Cartesian dualism|dualism]], distinguishing between the substances of the human body (&quot;''res extensa''&quot;) and the [[mind]] or soul (&quot;''res cogitans''&quot;). This crucial distinction would be left unresolved and lead to what is known as the [[mind-body problem]], since the two substances in the Cartesian system are independent of each other and irreducible.

===Gottfried Leibniz (1646&amp;ndash;1716)===
{{Main|Gottfried Leibniz}}
Leibniz was the last of the great Rationalists who contributed heavily to other fields such as [[mathematics]].  He did not develop his system, however, independently of these advances.  Leibniz rejected Cartesian dualism and denied the existence of a material world.  In Leibniz's view there are infinitely many simple substances, which he called &quot;[[Monadology|monads]]&quot; (possibly taking the term from the work of [[Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway|Anne Conway]]).

Leibniz developed his theory of monads in response to both Descartes and [[Spinoza]].  In rejecting this response he was forced to arrive at his own solution.  Monads are the fundamental unit of reality, according to Leibniz, constituting both inanimate and animate things.  These units of reality represent the universe, though they are not subject to the laws of causality or space (which he called &quot;[[well-founded phenomenon|well-founded phenomena]]&quot;).  Leibniz, therefore, introduced his principle of [[pre-established harmony]] to account for apparent causality in the world.

===Immanuel Kant (1724&amp;ndash;1804)===
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
Immanuel Kant started as a traditional rationalist, having studied the rationalists Leibniz and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], but after studying [[David Hume|David Hume's]] works, which &quot;awoke [him] from [his] dogmatic slumbers&quot;, he developed a distinctive and very influential rationalism of his own, which attempted to synthesize the traditional rationalist and empiricist traditions.

Kant named his branch of epistemology [[Transcendental Idealism]], and he first laid out these views in his famous work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason|The Critique of Pure Reason]]''.  In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma.  To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to know those things that are necessarily beyond the realm of all possible experience: the existence of God, free will, and the immortality of the human soul.  Kant referred to these objects as &quot;The Thing in Itself&quot; and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them.  To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought.  He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge.
