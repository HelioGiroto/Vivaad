== Second class citizens ==

To me, the cited sources are either clearly [[WP:FRINGE]] (Gisele Littman/Bat Ye'Or), or should be discussed for reliability (1950s Lebanese Christian writing on Muslims).
Best regards, [[User:benjamil|benjamil]] ([[User talk:benjamil|talk]]) 21:58, 11 July 2012 (UTC)

Lebanese Christians don't know about Islam? Wow, what an outrageously ignorant statement.

Check out http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Dhimmitude_(definition) which quotes Antoine Fattal states that dhimmis were second class citizens. Do you deny that they were prohibited from carrying arms? Or do you just delete posts that don't whitewash things to your satifsaction?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whatdafuq|contribs]]) 22:33, 11 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Lebanese Christians may be knowledgeable, but for good reasons may be prone to have a strong point of view (see [[WP:NPOV]]). The source is also rather obscure, but is being checked out.

That same Lebanese Christian was being quoted on wikiislam.net. And stating that Lebanese Christians might be prone to a strong point of view is implying motives to their statements.

:There is no problem in discussing the reliability of sources. Surely you see the difference between implying that someone dishonest to their face ([[WP:CIVIL]]) and discussing whether an environment that sparked civil war might have clouded the academic judgment of sources that are 50 years old. I've taken a brief look at wikiislam.net, and from their [http://wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam:Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_is_the_purpose_of_WikiIslam.3F FAQ] it is obvious that they are a source with an inherent POV and a rather conspiratorical mind set, e.g. using select cases to &quot;prove&quot; censorship on Wikipedia. The site might well be mined for sources, but cannot be used as a source in itself. Also, it does not seem to have a secondary source policy[http://wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam:Policies_and_Guidelines#Sources], meaning that there is no guarantee that analyses are not subject to quality control by anyone else than the users subscribing to wikiislam's worldview (or even a minority thereof) [http://wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam:Policies_and_Guidelines#Viewpoint]. Seems like a nice recipe for an echo chamber, and an environment that doesn't really foster a mentality of source criticism. --[[User:benjamil|benjamil]] ([[User talk:benjamil|talk]]) 08:45, 12 July 2012 (UTC)

So you are summarily dismissing Antoine Fattal as a source because he was referenced on a site which you take issue with. What is your impression of teachislam.com? I invite you to read this:

http://www.teachislam.com/dmdocuments/73-4/The%20Ottomans/Government/The%20Status%20of%20Jews%20and%20Christians%20in%20Muslim%20Lands,%201772%20CE.pdf

which has a response by Sheikh Hasan al Kafrawi, an 18th century Muslim scholar in Cairo, to the question of how Christians and Jews should be treated? So please, tell me what is wrong with using this as a source on how Christians were treated (e.g. can't be allowed to ride horses because horses are noble animals). --[[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]]) 15:38, 12 July 2012 (UTC)

:No, I'm not summarily dismissing anyone. I'm just saying that it's not obvious that he's a reliable source. He might be. But it might also be difficult to find out. The book is available at my university library, but not in a meaningful format, as far as I've been able to find, on Google books.[http://books.google.no/books/about/Le_statut_l%C3%A9gal_des_non_musulmans_en_pa.html?id=I8liAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y] Based on my very poor French, he gets an excellent review here,[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ridc_0035-3337_1960_num_12_2_12601] and a rather critical one here.[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=6391368] Crucially, the last review (the public part of which I'm actually able to review), points at important aspects that have largely been left out in recent edits on this article: Context, and variations in time and space. The last review also suggests that the information the book was used to source is more nuanced in the original. Then again, the quote at Wikiislam contains elements of intellectual rubbish, unless interpreted without connection to historical reality (e.g. in terms of abstract jurisprudence).

The &quot;rather critical&quot; review is not really so critical. It notes the impressive work of Fattal in his research on both the historical and legal aspects of the subject. The criticism, as it is, is that the reviewer felt there was a gap that needed filling between the two. So, I believe we can agree that Fattal is not some crazy Phalangist with an axe to grind and that your comment on his reliability is completely wrong. While Fattal did/does not get universal acclaim he did scholarly work and the body of it is impressive and valuable. So what is your excuse you will now use for removing quotes from Fattal on the dhimmi page?--[[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]]) 06:29, 14 July 2012 (UTC)

:&lt;blockquote&gt; No social relationship, no fellowship is possible between Muslims and dhimmis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:The counterexamples to this are legion. As for the other stuff, I'll have to look into that another time.

:--[[User:benjamil|benjamil]] ([[User talk:benjamil|talk]]) 00:03, 13 July 2012 (UTC)

I missed that quote but these sort of statements are made all the time-- &quot;Americans are ignorant of geography&quot;, &quot;Russia is corrupt&quot;, etc. The counterexamples to those statements are legion but statements are frequently made with this sort of absolutist wording. The Koran instructs believers to not take Jews and Christians as friends so there is some truth to a statement like that. Granted not all believers follow that just like not all Americans are ignorant of geography (or are obese for that matter) yet one cannot object to these statements whenever and wherever they are made simply because a counterexample exists.--[[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]]) 06:29, 14 July 2012 (UTC)

:These sort of statements are also commonly indicative of a polemic as opposed to disinterested mind set. As for the degree of criticism in the review: Yes, for an academic review, this is quite harsh criticism. It says &quot;But while the way in which the author deals individually with both the legal and historical sources is eminently satisfactory, '''the all-important question of the relationship between the two is left largely unanswered.'''&quot; (my emphasis) This however, is not very important, seeing that Itsmejudith has interceded with knowledge superior to mine. My issue was simply that I didn't accept this rather inaccessible source, mined from an inherently-pov site as reliable without checking it out. It would probably save you some heartbeats if you got used to such minor scepticism.

That book &quot;tells the story of Jews of Lebanon in the twentieth century.&quot; Which is not really the time that Antoine Fattal was talking about. And &quot;a much better source&quot;... why? Fattal's book is, according to wikiislam, &quot;the benchmark analysis of non-Muslims (especially Christians and Jews) living under Sharia.&quot; Another of his books &quot;is a seminal work&quot; on the legal status of non-Muslims living under Sharia.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whatdafuq|contribs]]) 05:37, 12 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Well, atleast [[Majid Khadduri]] describes dhimmi as a &quot;second-class citizen status&quot; too. (''War and peace in the law of Islam'', page 198). --[[User:Pudeo|Pudeo]][[User talk:Pudeo|']] 20:17, 13 July 2012 (UTC)

== Direct Quotes ==

There is nothing interpretive in a quote of the Koran on the Jizya. In fact, the section below &quot;Qur'anic verses as a basis for Islamic policies toward dhimmis&quot; mentions the Jizya! It just does so in reference to Hadiths. So it is established on the dhimmi page that the Jizya is an appropriate topic. Therefore a Koranic quote regarding the Jizya should be under the &quot;Qur'anic verses&quot; section. 

To quote, &quot;The prohibition against OR means that all material added to articles must be attributable to a reliable published source, even if not actually attributed.&quot; So raising a WP:OR objection is incorrect.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whatdafuq|contribs]]) 23:43, 11 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: The relationship between what is written in a holy book and what is done by the believers of the book is a very complex one.

Would somebody care to explain why my edits keep getting reverted? I acknowledged that my edit suggested a relationship that was not documented but now I have documented it. All of the other verses in the Koranic verses section relate to tolerance. It should be noted that tolerance of &quot;the other&quot; would be to not treat him differently, that is, not apply a state of dhimmitude to him. In the interest of balance it should be noted that there are some who believe that there is a Koranic justification for asserting that dhimmis are subjugated. In fact, it says &quot;pay the Jizya and feel themselves subdued.&quot; Subdued is not tolerance.--[[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]]) 06:12, 12 July 2012 (UTC)

:Because the paragraph that you're pulling this quote out of, is in fact about clarifying the fact that ''dhimmi'' status applies to non-Muslims living in Muslim ruled societies, rather than non-Muslims living in non-Muslim societies, and not about Jizya or tolerance or whatever. You're cherry picking quotes (again?).[[User:Volunteer Marek|&lt;font color=&quot;Orange&quot;&gt;Volunteer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Blue&quot;&gt;Marek&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:57, 12 July 2012 (UTC)

Uhm, no. I'm not cherry picking but you are engaging in a straw man argument (again?). That is where one misrepresents a position for the purpose of creating the impression that you have refuted it. I never said anything about it applying to &quot;non-Muslims in non-Muslim societies&quot;. The paragraph specifically mentions the jizya and the paying the jizya (&quot;in submission&quot;) was a hallmark of being a dhimmi. So it is quite relevant. You're willfully misrepresenting things (again?).--[[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]]) 06:13, 14 July 2012 (UTC)

::&quot;Antoine Fattal's ''Le statut legal des non-Musulmans en pays d'Islam'', a general survey, retains its value as an entry point into the study of this subject. It has been supplemented and often surpassed by a variety of more focussed studies, of which Yohanan Friedmann's ''Tolerance and Coercion in Islam'' deserves particular mention. A number of works, including Fattals' and especially Mark Cohen's ''Under crescent and cross'', devote considerable attention to comparing medieval Islamic laws governing non-Muslims with their counterparts in Roman, Sasanid and Christian sources. Placed in this context rather than viewed against the backdrop of twenty-first century Western norms, the laws expressed in medieval Islamic sources appear commonplace and even relatively benign; non-Muslims subject to these laws, of course, surely did not see them as such.&quot; David M. Freidenreich, &quot;Christians in early and Classical Sunni law&quot;, in David Thomas and Barbara Roggema (eds.), ''Christian-Muslim Relations: A Bibliographical History''. Brill. 2009.   
::Therefore, we should generally treat as superseded. We are currently underusing Mark Cohen. The last sentence I have taken from Freidenreich is an excellent summary of the current academic consensus, and we ought to make sure we reflect it. [[User:Itsmejudith|Itsmejudith]] ([[User talk:Itsmejudith|talk]]) 16:09, 12 July 2012 (UTC)

No we should not treat it as superseded. See the reviews for his work above. You even quote that Fattal &quot;devote[s] considerable attention to comparing medieval Islamic laws governing non-Muslims with their counterparts in Roman, Sasanid and Christian sources.&quot; which seems quite important to you for some strange reason. It's fascinating that you will quote something that says &quot;non-Musims subject to these [dhimmi] laws, of course, surely did not see them as [relatively benign].&quot; Really? Why would that be? The dhimmi page is all about how wonderfully tolerant the whole experience was. The non-muslim's rights were ensured!  He didn't have to serve in the army! What a glorious experience it must've been...oh wait, you're now admitting that people subject to this tolerance and respect were not happy with it? Wow. When one reads the dhimmi page and then the end of this quote of yours there's an obvious disconnect. And furthermore, the page is about what it meant to be a dhimmi. It is not a page on comparing and contrasting medieval laws in Christian lands and Muslim lands or trying to place behavior that might be viewed as hostile in a 21st century backdrop in context. This kind of moral equivalence has no place in the dhimmi page. --[[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]]) 06:40, 14 July 2012 (UTC)

:::exactly. compared to western democracies the dhimmi-status was indeed brutal and unacceptable. however, compared to other medieval (christian) regimes it was a step forwards. as noted by bernard lewis: &quot;muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in christendom, until the rise of secularism in the 17th century&quot;. as a start, why don't you quote freidenreich in the text? --&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;background:blue;&quot;&gt;[[User:Altetendekrabbe|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;background:red;font-family:sans-serif;&quot;&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;altetendekrabbe&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 16:21, 12 July 2012 (UTC)

No it's not. What the Christians were doing to Jews in Europe is not the subject of the page. It's what dhimmitude was all about. It doesn't matter how dhimmitude &quot;compared to other medieval (Christian) regimes&quot;. The only purpose of the sort of moral relativism that you wish to engage in is to justify the unjustifiable. &quot;But the Christians did it too!&quot; is not an excuse and it's not the topic at hand.--[[User:Whatdafuq|Whatdafuq]] ([[User talk:Whatdafuq|talk]]) 06:49, 14 July 2012 (UTC)

:The point is that the text should be specific about when, where, how, and possibly also why the dhimmi regulations have been practised as they have. In some cases, for example relating to the exodus of sephardic Jews from Spain, discussion of other regimes is definitely in order. Not because it makes the history less grim, but because it helps in understanding the phenomenon and its dynamics. I guess that's the essential word: dynamics. In space and time.

RSN thread opened now, with a number of questions. While we wait for uninvolved editors to comment there, I think it should be obvious that the &quot;disabilities&quot; wording is supported by the text, but only in relation to certain specific legal areas.

:::::::::::...And once again, you are misrepresenting the source.

''The paragraph is discussing a particular aspect of ''Shari'a'' law - that relating to fornication''


# The paragraph states, ''&quot;Shari'a penal law discriminates among citizens according to gender and religion&quot;''. Why is this not a general statement?
# The paragraph states, ''&quot;The reputation of a dhimmi is not valued the same way as the reputation of a Muslim&quot;''. Why is this not a general statement?
# Since you declare the paragraph is discussing a specific aspect, what is this aspect being cited as an example of? 
# The paragraph refers to  ''&quot;discriminatory implications of the distinction&quot;''. What is this &quot;distinction&quot; and is it being cited as an example of a wider concept as is seemingly indicated by ''&quot;Thus...&quot;''.

''It also points out that Muslim women were similarly sometimes discriminated against, and on that basis, it is misleading to imply that An-Na`im is writing about discrimination against ''dhimmi's'' alone.'' 

# Why does mentioning one group preclude the discrimination against others?
# Would you state the same if they were in seperate sentences, different chapters or even different books, as the underlying principle of 'An-Na`im did not write about discrimination alone' would similarly apply. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:AnkhMorpork|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;Ankh&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]'''.'''[[User talk:AnkhMorpork|&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;Morpork&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 20:11, 29 July 2012 (UTC)

:I am not interested in debating your endless circular arguments. '''The source given does not support the statement you are citing it for'''. You are cherry-picking. If the general statement is unequivocally true, find a source that says so, without referring to &quot;discretion of the authorities&quot;, or to &quot;differences of opinion among the various jurists and schools of jurisprudence over the precise scope of these and other discriminatory principles and rules of Shari'a&quot; - except of course that this source can then be cited for just that - an assertion that discrimination against ''dhimmis'' (and women) under Shari'a was not universally applied. Then again, the source could also be cited for the way Shari'a discriminates ''against Muslims'' (or against people it recognises as Muslims) - most specifically in relation to apostasy (see p. 86 and on). You are selectively reading text about a general subject (discrimination under Shari'a law) to 'prove' that ''dhimmi's'' were a specific target of discrimination. Then again, the book isn't even about discrimination - the next chapter is entitled &quot;Criminal justice&quot;, and right at the start (P.101 2nd paragraph, in a section entitled &quot;criminal justice in the modern nation state&quot;) says that &quot;The state seeks to maintain law and order and preserve security through the power to impose criminal punishments affecting the life, liberty, and property of the individual. The imposition of criminal punishment involves not only the possible loss of life, liberty and property for the individual but also severe social stigma and psychological pain and suffering...&quot; And note this isn't ''Shari'a law'' that is being referred to, but ''the modern nation-state''. On this basis, to suggest that the fact that discrimination against ''dhimmis'' may have caused &quot;psychological and social consequences&quot; would be seen by the author as something unique in law is somewhat questionable, to say the least.

== Current Dhimmi situations ==

I would suggest that dhimmi is alive and well and enjoying something of a resurgence today. Instead of messy edit warring, I would suggest that if a number of islamic states or organizations either directly refer to establishing a dhimma contract or much more likely refer to paying the tax required by this contract, the [[jizya]] then the populations that pay are modern dhimmi and should be listed. After a suitable number of examples are gathered, perhaps in a sandbox, the section would be elevated to the actual article. I'm looking for commentary as to how many communities need to have paid and how many organizations need to be seeking to get communities to pay the jizya in order for a legitimate modern dhimmi section to be justified? Let us leave aside whether such communities exist, I'm just looking to avoid the tiresome discussions about who or what is fringe and the edit war pattern by laying out the ground rules in advance. Any takers? [[User:TMLutas|TMLutas]] ([[User talk:TMLutas|talk]]) 00:44, 22 September 2012 (UTC)
