[[File:papal.bull.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Papal bull of [[Pope Urban VIII]], 1637, sealed with a leaden [[bulla (seal)|bulla]].]]
A '''papal bull''' is a particular type of [[letters patent]] or charter issued by a [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. It is named after the lead seal ([[bulla (seal)|bulla]]) that was appended to the end in order to authenticate it.

Papal bulls were originally issued by the pope for many kinds of communication of a public nature, but by the thirteenth century, papal bulls were only used for the most formal or solemn of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84314/bull-papal |title=Papal bull|publisher= Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the twelfth century, papal bulls have carried a lead seal with the heads of the apostles [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]] on one side and the pope’s signature on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84314/bull-papal |title=Papal bull|publisher= Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars have retroactively used the term &quot;Bull&quot; to describe any elaborate papal document issued in the form of a [[decree]] or [[privilege]] (solemn or simple), and to some less elaborate ones issued in the form of a letter. Popularly, the name is used for any papal document that contains a metal seal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Papal bulls have been in use at least since the sixth century, but the term was not first used until around the middle of the thirteenth century and then only for internal un-official papal record keeping purposes; the term had become official by the fifteenth century, when one of the offices of the Papal [[Apostolic Chancery|chancery]] was named the &quot;register of bulls&quot; (''registrum bullarum'').

Today, the bull is the only written communication in which the Pope will refer to himself as ''[[Servus Servorum Dei|episcopus servus servorum Dei]]'', meaning &quot;Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God.&quot;  For instance, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], when he issues a decree in bull form, will begin the document with ''Benedictus, Episcopus, Servus Servorum Dei''. While it used to always bear a metal seal, it now does so only on the most solemn occasions.  It is today the most formal type of [[letters patent]] issued by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] Chancery in the name of the Pope.

==Format==
A bull's format began with one line in tall elongated letters containing three elements: the Pope's name, the Papal title ''episcopus servus servorum Dei,'' meaning 'bishop, servant of the servants of God', and the few Latin words that constituted the [[incipit]] from which the bull would also take its name for record keeping purposes, but which might not be directly indicative of the bull's purpose.

The body of the text had no specific conventions for its formatting; it was often very simple in layout. The closing section consisted of a short ''datum'', mentioning the place it was issued, the day of the month and the year of the pope's pontificate and signatures, near which was attached the seal.

For the most solemn bulls, the Pope would sign the document himself, in which case he used the formula ''Ego N. Catholicae Ecclesiae Episcopus'' (I, N., Bishop of the Catholic Church). Following the signature in this case would be an elaborate [[monogram]], the signatures of any witnesses, and then the seal. Nowadays, a member of the [[Roman Curia]] signs the document on behalf of the Pope, usually the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], and thus the monogram is omitted.

==Seal==
The most distinctive characteristic of a bull was the metal seal, which was usually made of [[lead]], but on very solemn occasions was made of [[gold]] (as Byzantine imperial deeds often were). It depicted the founders of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]], the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], identified by the letters '''S'''anctus '''PA'''ulus and '''S'''anctus '''PE'''trus. The name of the issuing pope is on the reverse side. This was then attached to the document either by cords of [[hemp]] (in the case of letters of justice, and executory) or by red and yellow [[silk]] (in the case of letters of grace) that was looped through slits in the [[vellum]] of the document. ''Bulla'' is the name of this seal, because whether of wax, lead, or gold, the material making the seal had to be melted to soften it and take on an impression: Latin ''bullire'', &quot;to boil&quot;.

Since the late eighteenth century, the lead bulla has been replaced with a red ink stamp of Saints Peter and Paul with the reigning Pope's name encircling the picture, though very formal letters, e.g. the bull of [[Pope John XXIII]] convoking the [[Second Vatican Council]], still receive the lead seal.

Original papal bulls exist in quantity only after the eleventh century onward when the transition from fragile [[papyrus]] to the more durable [[parchment]] was made. None survives in entirety from before 819. Some original leaden seals, however, still survive from as early as the 6th century.

==Content==
In terms of content, the bull is simply the format in which a decree of the Pope appears.  Any subject may be treated in a bull, and many were and are, including statutory decrees, episcopal appointments, [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensations]], [[excommunication]]s, [[apostolic constitution]]s, [[canonization]]s and [[convocation]]s. The bull was the exclusive letter format from the Vatican until the fourteenth century, when the [[papal brief]] began to appear. The brief is the less formal form of papal communication and is authenticated with a wax impression (now a red ink impression) of the [[Ring of the Fisherman]]. There has never been an exact distinction of usage between a bull and a brief, but nowadays most letters, including [[encyclical]]s, are issued as briefs.
