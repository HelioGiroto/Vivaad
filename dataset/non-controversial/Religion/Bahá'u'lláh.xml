'''Bahá'u'lláh''' ({{IPA-en|bɑːhɑːˈʊlə}}; {{lang-ar|بهاء الله}}, &quot;Glory of God&quot;; 12 November 1817&amp;nbsp;– 29 May 1892), born '''{{transl|Bahai|Mírzá Ḥusayn-`Alí Núrí}}''' ({{lang-fa|میرزا حسینعلی نوری}}), was the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].  He claimed to be the prophetic fulfilment of [[Bábism]], a 19th-century outgrowth of [[Shia Islam|Shí‘ism]], but in a broader sense claimed to be a [[Manifestation of God|messenger from God]] referring to the fulfilment of the [[eschatology|eschatological]] expectations of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and other major religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Buck|2004|pp=143–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh taught that humanity is one single race and that the age has come for its unification in a global society. His claim to divine revelation resulted in [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution]] and imprisonment by the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities, and his eventual 24-year confinement in the prison city of [[Acre, Israel|`Akka]], [[Palestine]] (present day [[Israel]]), where he died.  He wrote many religious works, most notably the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' and the ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]''.

There are two known [[#Photographs and imagery|photographs]] of Bahá'u'lláh.  Outside of pilgrimage, Bahá'ís prefer not to view his photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes.

==Early and family life==
{{Bahá'í}}
{{Main|Bahá'u'lláh's family}}
Bahá'u'lláh was born on 12 November 1817, in [[Tehran]], the capital of [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]], present-day Iran. Bahá'í authors state that his ancestry can be traced back to [[Abraham]] through Abraham's wife [[Keturah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=130-131}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Zoroaster]] and to [[Yazdgerd III|Yazdigird III]], the last king of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|1985|pp=309–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to [[Jesse]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Khadíjih Khánum and his father was [[Mírzá `Abbás Núrí|Mírzá Buzurg]].  Bahá'u'lláh's father, Mírzá Buzurg, served as [[vizier]] to Imám-Virdi Mírzá, the twelfth son of [[Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar]]. Mírzá Buzurg was later appointed governor of [[Borujerd|Burujird]] and [[Lorestan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Balyuzi11&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when [[Mohammad Shah Qajar|Muhammad Shah]] came to power. After the death of his father, Bahá'u'lláh was asked to take a government post by the new vizier [[Haji Mirza Aqasi]], but declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = A Brief Biography of Baha'u'llah | last = Cole| first = Juan| accessdate=2006-06-22 | url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060710185629/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm| archivedate= 10 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh was married three times. He married his first wife [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the daughter of a nobleman, in Tehran in 1835, when he was 18 and she was 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriages&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given the title of ''The Most Exalted Leaf'' and ''Navváb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1976|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second marriage was to his widowed cousin Fátimih Khánum, in Tehran in 1849 when she was 21 and he was 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriages&quot;/&gt; She was known as ''Mahd-i-`Ulyá''. His third marriage to Gawhar Khánum occurred in Baghdad sometime before 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;marriages&quot;/&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh declared Ásíyih Khánum his &quot;perpetual consort in all the worlds of God&quot;, and her son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] as his vicar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|14 children]], four daughters and ten sons, five of whom he outlived.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís regard Ásíyih Khánum and her children [[Mírzá Mihdí]], [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] and `Abdu'l-Bahá' to be the Bahá'í holy family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bábí movement==
{{Main|Bábism}}
In 1844, a 25 year-old man from [[Shiraz]], {{transl|Bahai|Siyyid Mírzá `Alí-Muḥammad}} claimed to be the promised redeemer (or [[Mahdi]]) of Islam, taking the title of the [[Báb]], or the &quot;Gate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bāb, Sayyed `Ali Mohammad Sirazi | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting Bábí movement quickly spread across the [[Persian Empire]] and received widespread opposition from the Islamic clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt; The Báb himself was executed in 1850 by a firing squad in the public square of Tabriz at the age of 30 and the community was almost entirely exterminated in 1852–3.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt;

While the Báb claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation.&lt;ref name=&quot;browne339&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1889|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of his prominent writings, the Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as &quot;[[Him whom God shall make manifest]]&quot;. According to the Báb, this personage, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions, would establish the kingdom of God on the Earth;&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bab&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;farah&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Farah|1970|pp=242–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; several of the Báb's writings state the coming of ''Him Whom God shall make manifest'' would be imminent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saiedi344&quot;/&gt; In the books written by the Báb he constantly entreats his believers to follow ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' when he arrives.&lt;ref name=&quot;browne339&quot; /&gt; The Báb also eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' would appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saiedi344&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|p=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance of the Báb===
Bahá'u'lláh first heard of the [[Báb]] when he was 27, and received a visitor sent by the [[Báb]], [[Mullá Husayn]], telling him of the Báb and his claims. Bahá'u'lláh accepted the Báb's claims, becoming a Bábí and helping to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of [[Noor, Iran|Núr]], where he became recognized as one of its most influential believers.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Balyuzi35&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with success, even among some of the religious class.  He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as [[Táhirih]], for which he was temporarily imprisoned in [[Tehran]] and punished with [[bastinado]] or foot whipping.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], where 81 prominent Bábís met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Bábís who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispensation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Bahá'u'lláh took on the name Bahá.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt;

When violence started between the Bábís and the Qajar government in the later part of 1848, Bahá'u'lláh tried to reach the besieged Bábís at the [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi|Shaykh Tabarsi]] in [[Mazandaran]], but was arrested and imprisoned before he could get there.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt; The following years until 1850 saw the Bábís being massacred in various provinces after the Báb made his claim of being [[Manifestation of God]] more public.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt;

===Síyáh-Chál===
After the Báb was executed in 1850, a group of Tehran Bábís, headed by a Bábí known as Azim, who was previously a [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]] cleric, plotted an assassination plan against the Shah [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]], in retaliation for the Báb's execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith14&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was opposed by Bahá'u'lláh, and he condemned the plan, however, any moderating influence that he may have had was diminished since in June 1851 he went into exile to [[Baghdad]] at the chief minister's request, returning only after [[Amir Kabir|Amir Kabir's]] fall from power.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith14&quot;/&gt; On 15 August 1852, the radical group of Bábís attempted to carry out the assassination of the Shah and failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt; The group of Bábís linked with the plan, were rounded up and killed, and, notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, precipitating [[pogrom|violent riots]] against the Bábí community by the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith14&quot;/&gt; During this time many Bábís were killed, and many of the Bábís who were not killed, including Bahá'u'lláh, were imprisoned in the [[Síyáh-Chál]] (black pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | pages = p737–740| isbn = 0-02-865733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bahá'u'lláh, it was during his imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a [[Maid of Heaven|maiden from God]], through whom he received his mission as a messenger of God and as the one whose coming the Báb had prophesied.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt; After four months in the Síyáh-Chál, owing to the insistent demands of the ambassador of Russia, and after the person who tried to kill the Shah confessed and exonerated the Bábí leaders, the authorities released him from prison, but the government exiled him from Iran.  Bahá'u'lláh, instead of accepting the offer of refuge from Russia, chose to go to Iraq in the [[Ottoman Empire]]; in 1853 Bahá'u'lláh and his family travelled from [[Persian Empire|Persia]] arriving in [[Baghdad]] on 8 April 1853.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_bahaullah&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baghdad==
[[File:Bahaullah-passport.jpg|thumb|right|Bahá'u'lláh's passport, dated January 1853]]

The Báb had eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and had stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until Him Whom God shall make manifest would appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saiedi344&quot;/&gt; He did, however, appoint Mírzá Yahyá (later known as [[Subh-i-Azal]]) as a nominal leader after himself.  Mírzá Yahyá had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on the Shah, and after Bahá'u'lláh's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his brother there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith16&quot;/&gt; At the same time, an increasing number of Bábís considered Baghdad the new center for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow of [[pilgrim]]s started coming there from Persia.

Mírzá Yahyá's leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_azali&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Azali Babism | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Barrett p. 246&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrett|2001|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the Bábís who started to give their alliance to other claimants.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_azali&quot;/&gt; During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of the Bábí affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot;/&gt; In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was increasingly resented by Mírzá Yahyá, who began trying to discredit Bahá'u'lláh,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt; which resulted in driving many people away from the religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot; /&gt; Tensions in the community mounted, and thus in 1854 Bahá'u'lláh decided to leave the city to pursue a solitary life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt;

===Kurdistan===
On 10 April 1854, Bahá'u'lláh left his family to the care of his brother Mirza Musa and traveled with one companion to the mountains of [[Kurdistan]], northeast of Baghdad, near the city of [[Sulaymaniyah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt; He later wrote that he left so as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Bábí community, and that his &quot;withdrawal contemplated no return&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iqan160&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|2003|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For two years, Bahá'u'lláh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt; He originally lived as a [[hermit]], dressed like a [[dervish]] and using the name ''Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Balyuzi116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot; /&gt; As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the [[Naqshbandi|Naqshbandíyyih]], [[Qadiriyyah|Qádiríyyih]], and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balyuzi118&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to the second of these that the ''[[Four Valleys (Bahá'í)|Four Valleys]]'' was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot; /&gt;

In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot; /&gt; Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot; /&gt; On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt;

===Return to Baghdad===
[[File:Map iran ottoman empire banishment.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Bahá'u'lláh's banishments]]
When Bahá'u'lláh returned to Baghdad he saw that the Bábí community had become disheartened and divided.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt; During Bahá'u'lláh's absence, it had become alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued his policy of militancy and been unable to provide effective leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt; Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the Báb against the Báb's clear instructions;&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot; /&gt; dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the [[Shah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1987|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instigated violence against prominent Bábís who had challenged his leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt;

After his return to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing extensively to give the Bábís a new understanding of the Bábí religion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt; while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a [[Manifestation of God]] hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was a growing number of people joining the Bábí movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt;  He also gained sympathy from government officials and [[Sunni]] clerics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt; Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in [[Islamic]] clergy and the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1988 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannica | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-85229-486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Persian government asked the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive border region to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;/&gt;

===Declaration in the Garden of Ridvan===
On 21 April 1863, Bahá'u'lláh left Baghdad and entered the Najibiyyih gardens, now known to Bahá'ís as the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]], near Baghdad. Bahá'u'lláh and those accompanying him stayed in the garden for twelve days before departing for Constantinople.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyRidvan&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Ridvan |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 296–297 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Bahá'u'lláh declared to a small group of his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor &quot;/&gt; Bahá'ís regard this period with great significance and celebrate the twelve days that Bahá'u'lláh spent in this Garden as the festival of [[Ridván]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encyRidvan&quot;/&gt; He referred to the period of messianic secrecy between when he claimed to have seen the Maiden of Heaven in the Síyáh-Chál and his declaration as the ''ayyam-i butun'' (&quot;Days of Concealment&quot;). Bahá'u'lláh stated that this period was a &quot;set time of concealment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_iqan&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Buck|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The declaration in the Garden of Ridván was the beginning of a new phase in the Bábí community which led to the emergence of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as a distinctive movement separate from Bábísm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith23&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
Bahá'u'lláh was given an order to relocate to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from [[Baghdad]] was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually to the penal colony of Akká, Palestine (now [[Acre, Israel]]).

===Constantinople===
Bahá'u'lláh travelled from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, accompanied by a large group including family members and followers.  During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he was treated as a government guest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith23&quot;/&gt;  Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear.  The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. However, Bahá'u'lláh refused to work with the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith23&quot;/&gt;  After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for [[Adrianople]]. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith23&quot;/&gt;

===Adrianople===

From 1–12 December 1863, Bahá'u'lláh and [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|his family]] traveled to [[Adrianople]].  Unlike his travel to Constantinople, this journey was in the nature of an exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith23&quot;/&gt; Bahá'u'lláh stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years, and was the clear leader of the newly established Bábí community there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Anthony A.

The barber, Muhammad `Alí of Isfahán, apparently refused and spread word of the danger around the community. Bahá'u'lláh is reported to have counseled &quot;on all patience, quietude and gentleness&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Browne (1918) p. 17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|p=17}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/msbrtoc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern was repeated when, according to the personal account of Ustád Muhammad-`Alíy-i Salmání, Mirza Yahya attempted to persuade him likewise to murder Bahá'u'lláh in the bath.&lt;ref name = &quot;Salmání (1982) p. 51&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Salmání|1982|p=51}} [http://bahai-library.com/salmani_memories_bahaullah]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Mirza Yahya attempted to poison Bahá'u'lláh, an act that left him gravely ill for a time, and left him with a shaking hand for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|p=16}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Cole, J.R.I. |authorlink = Juan Cole |title = Bahá'u'lláh's Surah of God: Text, Translation, Commentary |journal = Translations of Shaykhi, Babi and Bahá'í Texts |year = 2002 |volume =  6 |issue =  1 |url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/vol6/surall.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland'', Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland p.296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Holy People of the World'', Phyllis G. Jestice p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

After this event in 1866, Bahá'u'lláh made his claim to be &quot;Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest public&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_azali&quot; /&gt; as well as making a formal written announcement to Mirza Yahya referring to his followers for the first time as the &quot;''people of Bahá''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith24&quot;/&gt; After his public announcement, Bahá'u'lláh secluded himself in his house and instructed the Bábís to choose between himself and Mirza Yahya.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith24&quot;/&gt; Bahá'u'lláh's claims threatened Mirza Yahya's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the Bábís if &quot;Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest&quot; were to appear and start a new religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot;/&gt; Mirza Yahya responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional Bábísm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_azali&quot; /&gt;

In 1867, Mirza Yahya challenged Bahá'u'lláh to a test of the divine will in a local [[mosque]] in Adrianople,&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith24&quot;/&gt; such that &quot;God would strike down the impostor.&quot;  Bahá'u'lláh agreed, and went to the Sultan Selim mosque at the appointed time, but Mirza Yahya lost face and lost credibility when he refused to show up.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Browne (1918) p. 18&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|p=18}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmání (1982) pp. 94-95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Salmání|1982|pp=94–95}} [http://bahai-library.com/salmani_memories_bahaullah]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Bahá'u'lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot; and his followers began calling themselves [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cole_bahabio&quot;/&gt;

===Writings and letters to the leaders of the world===
[[File:House-Bahaullah-Edirne.jpg|thumb|The house where Bahá'u'lláh stayed in [[Edirne|Adrianople]]]]
During his time in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the proclamation of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith25&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.

Also, while in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed the [[Bahá'í Faith]] further by addressing [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] to the kings and rulers of the world asking them to accept his revelation, renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour toward the betterment of the world and its peoples. His first letter was sent to Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] of the Ottoman Empire and his ministers, which was followed by the [[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Súriy-i-Mulúk (Tablet of the Kings)|Tablet of the Kings]] which was a general address to all rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith25&quot;/&gt;  In that latter letter the rulers of the earth were asked to listen to Bahá'u'lláh's call, and cast away their material possessions, and since they were given the reins of government that they should rule with [[justice]] and protect the rights of the downtrodden.  He also told the rulers to reduce their [[armaments]] and reconcile their differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith25&quot;/&gt;  The Christian monarchs were also asked to be faithful to Jesus' call to follow the promised &quot;Spirit of Truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith25&quot;/&gt;

Later when Bahá'u'lláh was in Akka, he continued writing letters to the leaders of the world including:&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith28&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Pope Pius IX]]
* Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]]
* Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia]]
* King [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] of Prussia
* [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] of Great Britain and Ireland

* [[Sultan ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz of the Ottoman Empire]]
* [[Nasser al-Din Shah|Násiri’d-Dín Sháh]] of the Persian Empire
* Rulers of [[Americas|America]] and the Presidents of the republics therein

===`Akká===
[[File:AkkaPrison.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Prison in Akká in which Bahá'u'lláh was imprisoned]]
With the Bábí community now irrevocably divided, the followers of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Bahá'u'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith26&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an investigation cleared Bahá'u'lláh, it did bring to the attention of the government that Bahá'u'lláh and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'Bábí' leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith26&quot;/&gt; A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire&amp;nbsp;— [[Famagusta]], [[Cyprus]] for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and [[Acre, Israel|`Akká]], in Ottoman [[Palestine]], for Bahá'u'lláh and his followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith26&quot;/&gt;

The Bahá'ís, including Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after a journey by land and sea through [[Gallipoli]] and [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]], arrived in [[Akko|`Akká]] on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith26&quot;/&gt;  The inhabitants of `Akká were told that the new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden.  The first years in `Akká imposed very harsh conditions with everyone becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith26&quot;/&gt;  It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh: [[Mirzá Mihdí]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and [[meditation]]. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bahá'u'lláh, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of [[Mazra'a|Mazra'ih]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith26&quot;/&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Bahji.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Mansion of Bahjí]]
[[File:Bahai gardens in Acre.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The shrine near [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where Bahá'u'lláh is buried]]
The final years of Bahá'u'lláh's life (1879–1892) were spent in the [[Mansion of Bahjí]], just outside `Akká, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in `Akká and Bahjí, since [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], his eldest son, had taken care of the organizational work, Bahá'u'lláh was able to devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], his book of laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other works included letters outlining his vision for a united world, as well as the need for ethical action; he also composed many [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith27&quot;/&gt;

In 1890, the [[Cambridge]] [[Orientalism|orientalist]] [[Edward Granville Browne]] had an interview with Bahá'u'lláh in this house. After this meeting he wrote his famous pen-portrait of Bahá'u'lláh:

{{quote|&quot;In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the kind called táj by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne]] in the introduction to {{Cite web| title=A Traveller's Narrative | publisher=Cambridge | year=1891 | url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnfrnt.htm | accessdate=2006-06-22 }}, p.XXXIX-XL.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 9 May 1892, Bahá'u'lláh contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his life on 29 May 1892. He was buried in the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh|shrine]] located next to the Mansion of Bahjí.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==
Bahá'u'lláh stated that he was a messenger of God, and he used the term [[Manifestation of God]] to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smith109&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smith107&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt;

In Bahá'u'lláh's writings he writes in many styles including cases were he speaks as if he was instructed by God to bring a message; in other cases he writes as though he is speaking as God directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings, Bahá'u'lláh's style changes frequently, where in some cases he is speaking as the messenger of God, and then it changes to as if he were speaking as God.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=July 2012}} have interpreted Bahá'u'lláh's writing style to conclude that Bahá'u'lláh had claimed [[divinity]].  Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt; Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant that he is not actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh declared, as the most recent Manifestation of God, that he was the &quot;Promised One&quot; of all religions, fulfilling the [[Messiah|messianic]] prophecies found in world religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;/&gt; He stated that his claims to being several messiahs converging in one person were the symbolic, rather than literal, fulfilment of the messianic and [[Eschatology|eschatological]] prophecies found in the literature of the major religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;/&gt;  Bahá'u'lláh's eschatological claims constitute six distinctive messianic identifications: from [[Judaism]], the incarnation of the &quot;Everlasting Father&quot; from the ''Yuletide prophecy'' of Isaiah 9:6, the &quot;Lord of Hosts&quot;; from [[Christianity]],  the &quot;Spirit of Truth&quot; or Comforter predicted by Jesus in his farewell discourse of John 14-17 and the return of [[Christ]] &quot;in the glory of the Father&quot;; from [[Zoroastrianism]], the return of [[Shah Bahram Varjavand]], a Zoroastrian messiah predicted in various late [[Parthian language|Pahlavi]] texts;  from [[Shi'a Islam]] the return of the Third Imam, [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husayn]]; from [[Sunni Islam]], the return of Jesus ([[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2000|pp=32–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Bábism]], [[He whom God shall make manifest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;/&gt;

While Bahá'u'lláh did not himself directly claim to be either the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] messiah, he did so in principle through his writings.&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;/&gt;  Later, `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that Bahá'u'lláh was the [[Kalki avatar]], who in the classical Hindu [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]] tradition is the tenth and final [[Avatar]] (great incarnation) of [[Vishnu]] who will come to end [[Kali Yuga|The Age of Darkness and Destruction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buck_eschatologic&quot;/&gt; Bahá'ís also believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the fulfilment of the prophecy of appearance of the [[Maitreya]] Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma.&lt;ref name=&quot;momenbook&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1995|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fozdar|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya  will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;momenbook&quot; /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh is believed to be a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through [[Yazdgerd III]], the last monarch of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian Dynasty]];&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; he also asserted to be a descendant of [[Abraham]] through his third wife [[Keturah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sears|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Succession==
After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will and Testament]] of Bahá'u'lláh named his son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] as [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh|Centre of the Covenant]], successor and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings,&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=‘Abd-al-Bahā’ : Life and work | first = Alessandro | last = Bausani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;holy97&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2004|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the appointment was readily accepted by almost all Bahá'ís, since the appointment was written and unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bahá had proved himself a capable and devoted assistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith43&quot;/&gt; However, the appointment given to `Abdu'l-Bahá was a cause of jealousy within [[Bahá'u'lláh's family]]. Bahá'u'lláh had also stated that another one of his sons [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]] was to be subordinate and second in rank after `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{transl|Bahai|Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí}}, however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bahá was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit `Abdu'l-Bahá.  {{transl|Bahai|Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí}}'s actions, however, were rejected by the majority of the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith43&quot;/&gt; Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bahá later ex-communicated his brother as a [[covenant-breaker]]. The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bahá'í community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful of followers.

==Works==
{{Main|List of writings of Bahá'u'lláh}}
Bahá'u'lláh wrote many books, [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] and prayers, of which only a fraction have been translated into English.&lt;ref name=&quot;oneworld&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Bahá'u'lláh, writings of |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 79–80 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been 15,000 works written by him identified; many of these are in the form of short letters, or tablets, to Bahá'ís,&lt;ref name=&quot;oneworld&quot; /&gt;  but he also wrote larger pieces including the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán|Book of Certitude]], the [[Hidden Words]] and the [[Gems of Divine Mysteries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot; /&gt; The total volume of his works are more than 70 times the size of the Qur'an and more than 15 times the size of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = A new volume of Bahá'í sacred writings, recently translated and comprising Bahá'u'lláh's call to world leaders, is published| last = BWNS| accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story.cfm?storyid=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Bahá'í Archives&amp;nbsp;— Preserving and safeguarding the Sacred Texts| last = Archives Office at the Bahá'í World Centre, Haifa, Israel| accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/arjen.nandita2/bahai-archives.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts| last = Universal House of Justice| accessdate=2006-11-24 | url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bahaullah from miller.jpg|thumb|150px|Bahá'u'lláh. Persian inscription reads ''Mírzá Ḥusayn-`Alí Núrí'']]
There are two known photographs of Bahá'u'lláh.  This photo was taken for passport purposes while he was in [[Adrianople]] (present day [[Edirne]]) and is reproduced in [[William McElwee Miller|William Miller]]'s book on the Bahá'í Faith.  Copies of both pictures are at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]], and one is on display in the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#International Archives|International Archives]] building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized [[pilgrimage]].  Outside of this experience Bahá'ís prefer not to view this photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes,&lt;ref name=&quot;opi&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_photographs_bahaullah_miller | title = Letter from the Office of Public Information regarding the photograph of Bahá'u'lláh | author = Office of Public Information | accessdate = 2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bahá'í institutions have requested the press not to publish the image in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.bahai.us/system/files/PublicationPhotosV8.pdf | title = Publication of Bahá'í Photos | accessdate = 2008-12-20 |  publisher = bahai.us | author = United States Bahá'í Office of Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh's image is not in itself offensive to Bahá'ís.  However, Bahá'ís are expected to treat the image of any [[Manifestation of God]] with extreme reverence. According to this practice, they avoid depictions  [[Depiction of Jesus|of Jesus]] or [[depictions of Muhammad|of Muhammad]], and refrain from portraying any of them in [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[drama]]. Copies of the photographs are displayed on highly significant occasions, such as six conferences held in October 1967 commemorating the hundredth anniversary of Bahá'u'lláh's writing of the ''[[Suriy-i-Mulúk]]'' (Tablet to the Kings), which [[Shoghi Effendi]] describes as &quot;the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bahá'u'lláh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a meeting in Adrianople, the [[Hands of the Cause]] traveled to the conferences, 'each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the Blessed Beauty, which it will be the privilege of those attending the Conferences to view.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Universal House of Justice|1996|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official Bahá'í position on displaying the photograph of Bahá'u'lláh is:

{{quote|There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bahá'u'lláh, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes. |From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, 6 December 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hornby|1983|p=540}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the above passage clarifies that it is considered disrespectful to display his photograph to the public, regarding postings on other websites the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] has written:

{{quote|For Bahá'ís, the photograph of Bahá'u'lláh is very precious and it should not only be viewed but also handled with due reverence and respect, which is not the case here [on a non-Bahá'í web site]. Thus, it is indeed disturbing to Bahá'ís to have the image of Bahá'u'lláh treated in such a disrespectful way. However, as the creator of the site is not a Bahá'í, there is little, if anything, that can be done to address this matter. We hope these comments have been of assistance.&quot;|Office for Public Information, 4 September 1999, Photo of Bahá'u'lláh on Web Site&lt;ref name=&quot;opi&quot;/&gt;}}
