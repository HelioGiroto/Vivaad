'''Mount Holyoke College''' is a [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|college for women]] in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. It was the first member of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges, and served as a model for some of the others.  Mount Holyoke is part of the [[Pioneer Valley]]'s [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five College Consortium]], along with [[Amherst College]], [[Smith College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].

The school was originally founded in 1837 by [[Mary Lyon]] as Mount Holyoke Female Seminary. It received its collegiate charter in 1888 as Mount Holyoke Seminary and College and became Mount Holyoke College in 1893. Mount Holyoke's chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa#History|Phi Beta Kappa]] was established in 1905.

Mount Holyoke's buildings were designed between 1896 and 1960.  It has a [[Donald Ross (golfer)|Donald Ross]]-designed 18-hole golf course, ''The Orchards'', which served as host to the [[U.S. Women's Open]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David| last=Shefter| url=http://www.uswomensopen.com/2004/press/course-ideal.html | title= Location Ideal For 2004 Women’s Open: Championship Course Was Built For A Woman, Owned By All-Female College| publisher=uswomensopen.com| date= | accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;   U.S. News &amp; World Report lists Mount Holyoke as the 29th best liberal arts college in the [[United States]] in its 2011 rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/liberal-arts-rankings/page+2|title = Best Colleges: Liberal Arts Rankings|page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Holyoke was also ranked #1 in the nation for Best Classroom Experience in the [[Princeton Review]] 2010–2011 rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeRankings.aspx?iid=1023734|title = College Rankings|publisher = princetonreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011–2012, Mount Holyoke is one of the nation's top producers of [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholars]], ranking fourth among bachelor's institutions according to the ''Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Producers of U.S. Fulbright Students by Type of Institution, 2011–12|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Top-Producers-of-US/129452/|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mount Holyoke Seminary and Ground 1887.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Mount Holyoke in 1887]]

Mount Holyoke's founder, [[Mary Lyon]], is considered by many scholars to be an innovator in the area of women's education.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3qWLyDZ8PsC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22alma+mater%22+%22mary+lyon%22&amp;lr= |title=Alma Mater: Design and Experience in the Women's Colleges from Their ... – Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz – Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her establishment of ''Mount Holyoke Female Seminary'' was part of a larger movement to create institutions of higher education for young women during the early half of the 19th century. Lyon's contemporaries include  [[Sarah Pierce]] ([[Litchfield Female Academy]], 1792);  [[Catharine Beecher]] ([[Hartford Female Seminary]], 1823); [[Zilpah P. Grant Banister]] ([[Ipswich Female Seminary]], 1828); [[George Washington Doane]] (St. Mary's Hall, 1837 now called [[Doane Academy]]). Prior to founding Mount Holyoke, Lyon contributed to the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of ''Wheaton Female Seminary'' (now [[Wheaton College, Massachusetts]]) in 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; ''Mount Holyoke Female Seminary'' was originally chartered as a [[Seminary#Teaching seminaries|teaching seminary]] in 1836&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3iW2K-IknGYC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=mount+holyoke+chartered+1836 |title=First Charter of Mount Holyoke |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened its doors to students on 8 November 1837. Both [[Vassar College]] and [[Wellesley College]] were patterned after Mount Holyoke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crispen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dean.sbc.edu/crispen.html|title=Seven Sisters and a Country Cousin|author=Jennifer L. Crispen| coauthors=| publisher=sbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding in 1837, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary &quot;had no religious affiliation&quot;. However, &quot;students were required to attend church services, chapel talks, prayer meetings, and Bible study groups. Twice a day teachers and students spent time in private devotions. Every dorm room had two large lighted closets to give roommates privacy during their devotions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/marylyon/life.html |title= Daily Life at Mount Holyoke |publisher=mtholyoke.edu |accessdate=2006-09-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was the sister school to [[Andover Theological Seminary|Andover Seminary]]. Some Andover graduates looked to marry students from the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before becoming missionaries because the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM) required its missionaries to be married before starting their missions. By 1859 there were more than 60 missionary alumnae; by 1887 the school's alumnae comprised one-fifth of all female American missionaries for the ABCFM; and by the end of the century, 248 of its alumnae had entered the mission field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Did You Know? | journal=Christian History &amp; Biography | year=Spring 2006 | volume=90 | pages=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Holyoke Female Seminary received its collegiate charter in 1888, becoming Mount Holyoke Seminary and College. In 1893 it became Mount Holyoke College. Mount Holyoke's chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa#History|Phi Beta Kappa]] was established in 1905. It has been a sister school to [[Women's Christian College, Chennai|Women's Christian College]] in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] since 1920. In the early 1970s Mount Holyoke had a long debate under the presidency of [[David Truman]] over the issue of coeducation. On 6 November 1971 the board of trustees voted to remain a women's college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml| title=Mount Holyoke:A Detailed History| publisher=mtholyoke.edu| date= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 1987, the [[United States Postal Service]]'s [[Great Americans Series]] issued a [[postage stamp]] featuring [[Mary Lyon]], in honor of Mount Holyoke's ''Sesquicentennial'' (Mount Holyoke's 150th anniversary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AP |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DB1239F932A15751C1A960948260 |title=Stamp for Holyoke Founder |publisher=New York Times |date=1986-12-21 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/%7Edalbino/fdcs/mlyon.html | title=  The Mary Lyon Stamp |publisher=mtholyoke.edu| date= | accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art and media==
Mount Holyoke is referenced in works of theater, film, and popular culture. [[Wendy Wasserstein]]'s 1977 play, ''[[Uncommon Women and Others]]'', is based upon Wasserstein's experiences at Mount Holyoke of the early 1970s. The play explores the lives of the fictional characters Carter, Holly, Kate, Leilah, Rita, Muffet, Samantha, and Susie.

Two feature films reference Mount Holyoke of the 1960s. The first is the 1987 film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' which is set at a summer resort in the Catskills in the summer of 1963. The [[protagonist]] Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (named after Mount Holyoke graduate [[Frances Perkins]]) plans to attend Mount Holyoke in the fall to study economics of underdeveloped countries and then to later enter the [[Peace Corps]]. The second is the 1978 film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' which is set in 1962. It satirizes a common practice up until the mid-1970s, when women attending [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sister colleges]] were connected with or to students at [[Ivy League]] schools. In the film, fraternity brothers from Delta house of the fictional [[List of fictional schools#Fictional colleges and universities|Faber College]] (based on [[Dartmouth College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview| last=Landis| first=John| subjectlink=John Landis| interviewer=Soledad O'Brien| url=http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0308/29/se.09.html| date=2003-08-29| program=Live from the Headlines| callsign=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;) take a road trip to the fictional [[List of fictional schools#Fictional colleges and universities|Emily Dickinson College]] (Mount Holyoke College)--in real life, Mount Holyoke and Dartmouth are unofficial brother-sister schools.

Mount Holyoke was mentioned more recently in the 2002 film [[National Lampoon's Van Wilder]], when the title character gives a half-time pep talk to his school basketball team, offering them a party with Mount Holyoke students should the team win.

The Mount Holyoke amphitheater was also featured in an episode of the Comedy Central sitcom ''Stella'' during a graduation ceremony in the episode &quot;Paper Route&quot;.

Mount Holyoke also featured in &quot;[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]&quot;, an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'': &quot;The Seven Sisters were immortalized in popular culture in a [[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can|2003 episode]] of ''The Simpsons.'' Having won local and state spelling bees, [[Lisa Simpson]] advances to the national finals. However, the moderator, concerned about the contest’s low television ratings, offers Lisa free tuition ('and a hot plate') at the Seven Sisters college of her choice if she will allow a more popular contestant (who happens to be a boy) to win. Lisa refuses, but has a dream in which students from each of the Seven Sisters appear to her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/12812.shtml |title=The Seven Sisters &amp;#124; Mount Holyoke College |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mount Holyoke student in Lisa's dream invites Lisa to &quot;Come party with me!&quot; before passing out drunk.

Additional characters in popular culture include &quot;Emily&quot; from the television series ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'', &quot;Donna,&quot; from the television series ''[[Judging Amy]],'' &quot;Judy Maxwell,&quot; from the film, ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]],'' &quot;Brooke,&quot; from ''[[The L Word]],'' Season 4, &quot;Catherine,&quot; the serial bride in the [[film noir]] release, ''[[Black Widow (1987 film)|Black Widow]]'' and &quot;Helen Bishop&quot;, the divorcee neighbor from ''[[Mad Men]]''.

In the episode of ''[[Law and Order Criminal Intent|Law and Order: Criminal Intent]]'' &quot;Consumed&quot;, the husband of suspect Beth Landau (Karen Sillas) states in reference to the 3 murders she was accused of, &quot;How could she do that? She went to Holyoke for Gods sake!&quot;

In the first episode of season 4, the television show the L Word referenced Mount Holyoke as the college the daughter of Max/Moira's boss attends.

References to Mount Holyoke also occur in other works.  Mount Holyoke was mentioned in television series, ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', in the second episode from Season 4, &quot;The Right Stuff.&quot; In David Liss's 2006 novel, ''[[The Ethical Assassin]]'', Chitra—the love interest of the protagonist Lem Altick—is saving money so that she may attend Mount Holyoke. [[Alan Arkin]], the father of the bride in the 1979 film ''[[The In-Laws (1979 film)|The In-Laws]]'', mutters when he sees the squalor-filled office of  [[Peter Falk]] (the father of the groom), &quot;Four years at Mount Holyoke so she could marry into this.&quot; Mount Holyoke is mentioned frequently in [[Neil Simon]]'s play, ''[[Broadway Bound]]''. Recently, Mt. Holyoke was mentioned as one of Julie Taylor's college options on the TV show ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]''.
