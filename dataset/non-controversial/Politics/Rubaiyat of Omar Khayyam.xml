{{Italic title}}
'''''The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám''''' ({{lang-fa|رباعیات عمر خیام}}) is the title that [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in [[Persian language|Persian]] and of which there are about a thousand, attributed to [[Omar Khayyám]] (1048–1131), a [[Persian literature|Persian poet]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematician]] and [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomer]]. A ''[[ruba'i]]'' is a two-line stanza with two parts (or [[hemistich]]s) per line, hence the word ''rubáiyát'' (derived from the [[Arabic language]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] for &quot;four&quot;), meaning &quot;[[quatrain]]s&quot;.

==Translations==
The nature of a translation very much depends on what interpretation one places on Khayyam's philosophy. The fact that the rubaiyat are a collection of quatrains - and may be selected and rearranged subjectively to support one interpretation or another - has led to widely differing versions. [[J.B. Nicolas|Nicolas]] took the view that Khayyam himself clearly was a [[Sufism|Sufi]]. Others have seen signs of [[mysticism]], even [[atheism]], or conversely devout and orthodox [[Islam]]. FitzGerald gave the Rubaiyat a distinct [[fatalism|fatalistic]] spin, although it has been claimed that he softened the impact of Khayyam's nihilism and his preoccupation with the mortality and transience of all things. Even such a question as to whether Khayyam was pro- or anti-alcohol gives rise to more discussion than might at first glance have seemed plausible.

===Edward FitzGerald versions===

[[File:Arthur Szyk02.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Illustration by [[Arthur Szyk]] for 1940 edition&lt;/center&gt;]]
The translations best known in English are those by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] (1809–1883).

* 1st edition – 1859  [75 quatrains]
* 2nd edition – 1868  [110 quatrains]
* 3rd edition – 1872  [101 quatrains]
* 4th edition – 1879  [101 quatrains]
* 5th edition – 1889  [101 quatrains]

Of the five editions published, four were published under the authorial control of FitzGerald. The fifth edition, which contained only minor changes from the fourth, was edited after his death on the basis of manuscript revisions FitzGerald had left.

FitzGerald also produced Latin translations of certain rubaiyat.

As a work of English literature FitzGerald's version is a high point of the 19th century and has been greatly influential. Indeed, the term &quot;[[Ruba'i|Rubaiyat]]&quot; by itself has come to be used to describe the quatrain rhyme scheme that FitzGerald used in his translations: AABA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, as a translation of Omar Khayyam's quatrains, it is not noted for its fidelity. Many of the verses are paraphrased, and some of them cannot be confidently traced to any one of Khayyam's quatrains at all. Some critics informally refer to the FitzGerald's English versions as &quot;''The Rubaiyat of FitzOmar''&quot;, a nickname that both recognizes the liberties FitzGerald inflicted on his purported source and also credits FitzGerald for the considerable portion of the &quot;translation&quot; that is his own creation.

In fact, FitzGerald himself referred to his work as &quot;transmogrification&quot;. &quot;My translation will interest you from its form, and also in many respects in its detail: very un-literal as it is. Many quatrains are mashed together: and something lost, I doubt, of Omar's simplicity, which is so much a virtue in him&quot; (letter to  E. B. Cowell, 9/3/58). And,  &quot;I suppose very few People have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: though certainly not to be literal.  But at all Cost, a Thing must live: with a transfusion of one’s own worse Life if one can’t retain the Original’s better.  Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle&quot; (letter to E. B. Cowell, 4/27/59).

Perhaps the most famous of FitzGerald's verses is this one, of which the final version is much beloved:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Quatrain XI in his 1st edition:
&lt;poem&gt;
Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,
A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse - and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness -
And Wilderness is Paradise enow.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Quatrain XII in his 5th edition:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabiannights.org/rubaiyat/rubaiyat.php3?display?5??9?0?4?3????1? Arabiannights.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread--and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness--
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The following are several samples of Fitzgerald's translation, concluding with another
well-known verse (FitzGerald's quatrain LI in his 1st edition):

[[File:Edmund J Sullivan Illustrations to The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam First Version Quatrain-051.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Illustration by [[Edmund Joseph Sullivan]] for Quatrain 51 of Fitzgerard's First Version.&lt;/center&gt;]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;

Some for the pleasures here below
Others yearn for The Prophet's Paradise to come;
Ah, take the cash and let the credit go,
Nor heed the rumble of a distant drum

And much as Wine has played the Infidel
And robbed me of my robe of Honour, well ...
I often wonder what the vintners buy
One half so precious as the stuff they sell

For some we loved, the loveliest and best
That from His rolling vintage Time has pressed,
Have drunk their glass a round or two before,
And one by one crept silently to rest

But helpless pieces in the game He plays
Upon this chequer-board of Nights and Days
He hither and thither moves, and checks ... and slays
Then one by one, back in the Closet lays

&quot;The Moving Finger writes: and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Graf von Schack===
Adolf Friedrich von Schack (1815–1894) published a German translation in 1878.

Quatrain 151 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Gönnt mir, mit dem Liebchen im Gartenrund
Zu weilen bei süßem Rebengetränke,
Und nennt mich schlimmer als einen Hund,
Wenn ferner an’s Paradies ich denke!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Omar Kayyim'

===Friedrich von Bodenstedt===
[[Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt|Friedrich Martinus von Bodenstedt]] (1819–1892) published a German translation in 1881. The translation eventually consisted of 395 quatrains.

Quatrain IX, 59 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Im Frühling mag ich gern im Grüne weilen
Und Einsamkeit mit einer Freundin teilen
Und einem Kruge Wein. Mag man mich schelten:
Ich lasse keinen andern Himmel gelten.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Edward Henry Whinfield===
Two English editions by Whinfield (1836-?) consisted of 253 quatrains in 1882 and 500 in 1883.

Quatrain 84 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In the sweet spring a grassy bank I sought
And thither wine and a fair Houri brought;
And, though the people called me graceless dog,
Gave not to Paradise another thought!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===J.B. Nicolas===
The first French translation, of 464 quatrains in prose, was made by J.B. Nicolas, chief interpreter at the French Embassy in Persia in 1867.

Prose stanza (equivalent of Fitzgerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
: Au printemps j’aime à m’asseoir au bord d’une prairie, avec une idole semblable à une houri et une cruche de vin, s’il y en a, et bien que tout cela soit généralement blâmé, je veux être pire qu’un chien si jamais je songe au paradis.

===John Leslie Garner===
An English translation of 152 quatrains, published in 1888.

Quatrain I. 20 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Yes, Loved One, when the Laughing Spring is blowing,
With Thee beside me and the Cup o’erflowing,
I pass the day upon this Waving Meadow,
And dream the while, no thought on Heaven bestowing.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Justin Huntly McCarthy===
[[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] (1859–1936) (Member of Parliament for [[Newry (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry]]) published prose translations of 466 quatrains in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Omar Khayyam, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', translated by [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] MP. [London] : D. Nutt, 1889. (Source: [http://library.catalogue.tcd.ie/record=b13332609~S9 Trinity College Dublin Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Quatrain 177 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In Spring time I love to sit in the meadow with a paramour
perfect as a Houri and goodly jar of wine, and though
I may be blamed for this, yet hold me lower
than a dog if ever I dream of Paradise.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Richard Le Gallienne===
[[Richard Le Gallienne]] (1866–1947) produced a verse translation, subtitled &quot;a paraphrase from several literal translations&quot;, in 1897. In his introductory note to the reader, Le Gallienne cites [[Justin Huntly McCarthy|McCarthy]]'s &quot;charming prose&quot; as the chief influence on his version. Some example quatrains follow:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Look not above, there is no answer there;
Pray not, for no one listens to your prayer;
Near is as near to God as any Far,
And Here is just the same deceit as There. 
''(#78, on p. 44)''

And do you think that unto such as you;
A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew:
God gave the secret, and denied it me?--
Well, well, what matters it! Believe that, too. 
''(#85, p. 47)''

&quot;Did God set grapes a-growing, do you think,
And at the same time make it sin to drink?
Give thanks to Him who foreordained it thus--
Surely He loves to hear the glasses clink!&quot;
''(#91, p. 48)''
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Edward Heron-Allen===
Edward Heron-Allen (1861–1943) published a prose translation in 1898. He also wrote an introduction to an edition of [[Frederick Rolfe]] (Baron Corvo) ’s translation into English of Nicolas’s French translation.

Example quatrain (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I desire a little ruby wine and a book of verses,
Just enough to keep me alive, and half a loaf is needful;
And then, that I and thou should sit in a desolate place
Is better than the kingdom of a sultan.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Franz Toussaint===
The best-known version in French is the free verse edition by Franz Toussaint (1879–1955) published in 1924. This translation consisting of 170 quatrains was done from the original Persian text, while most of the other French translations were themselves translations of FitzGerald's work. The ''Éditions d'art Henri Piazza'' published the book almost unchanged between 1924 and 1979. Toussaint's translation has served as the basis of subsequent translations into other languages, but Toussaint did not live to witness the influence his translation has had.

===A. J. Arberry===
In 1959, Professor A. J. Arberry, a distinguished scholar of Persian and Arabic, attempted to produce a scholarly edition of Khayyam, based on thirteenth-century manuscripts. However, his manuscripts were subsequently exposed as twentieth-century forgeries.&lt;ref name=TLS&gt;{{cite web

===Robert Graves and Omar Ali-Shah===
While Arberry’s work had been misguided, it was published in good faith. The 1967 translation of the Rubáiyat by [[Robert Graves]] and [[Omar Ali-Shah]], however, created a scandal. The authors claimed it was based on a twelfth-century manuscript located in Afghanistan, where it was allegedly utilized as a Sufi teaching document. But the manuscript was never produced, and British experts in Persian literature were easily able to prove that the translation was in fact based on Edward Heron Allen's analysis of possible sources for FitzGerald’s work.&lt;ref name=TLS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aminrazavi, Mehdi: ''The Wine of Wisdom''. Oneworld 2005, ISBN 1-85168-355-0, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Quatrains 11 and 12 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Should our day's portion be one mancel loaf,
A haunch of mutton and a gourd of wine
Set for us two alone on the wide plain,
No Sultan's bounty could evoke such joy.

A gourd of red wine and a sheaf of poems —
A bare subsistence, half a loaf, not more —
Supplied us two alone in the free desert:
What Sultan could we envy on his throne?
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Peter Avery and John Heath-Stubbs===
A modern version of 235 quatrains, claiming to be &quot;as literal an English version of the Persian originals as readability and intelligibility permit&quot;, published in 1979. Their edition provides two versions of the thematic quatrain, the first (98) considered by the Persian writer [[Sadeq Hedayat]] to be a spurious attribution.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
98.
I need a jug of wine and a book of poetry,
Half a loaf for a bite to eat,
Then you and I, seated in a deserted spot,
Will have more wealth than a Sultan's realm.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
234.
If chance supplied a loaf of white bread,
Two casks of wine and a leg of mutton,
In the corner of a garden with a tulip-cheeked girl,
There'd be enjoyment no Sultan could outdo.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Karim Emami===
In 1988, the Rubaiyat were translated by a Persian translator for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Azarang|first=Abd-al Hussein|title=Emami, Karim|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/emami-karim-translator-editor|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|publisher=iranicaonline.org|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karim Emami]]'s translation of the Rubaiyat was published under the title ''The Wine of Nishapour'' in Paris. ''The Wine of Nishapour'' is the collection of Khayyam's poetry by Shahrokh Golestan, including Golestan's pictures in front of each poem.&lt;ref&gt;Emami, Karim. ''Ups and Downs of Translation'', Tehran, 1988, pp. 134-169&lt;/ref&gt; Emami was an outstanding translator of English in Iran, who had also translated many contemporary Persian poems.

Example from Emami's work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
It's early dawn, my love, open your eyes and arise
Gently imbibing and playing the lyre;
For those who are here will not tarry long, 
And those who are gone will not return.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Example quatrain 160 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In spring if a houri-like sweetheart
Gives me a cup of wine on the edge of a green cornfield,
Though to the vulgar this would be blasphemy,
If I mentioned any other Paradise, I'd be worse than a dog.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ahmed Rami===
[[Ahmed Rami (poet)|Ahmed Rami]], a famous late Egyptian poet, translated the work into Arabic. His translation was sung by [[Umm Kulthum]].

===Ahmad Saidi===
In 1991 Ahmad Saidi (1904-1994) produced an English translation of 165 quatrains grouped into 10 themes.  Born and raised in Iran, Saidi went to the United States in 1931 and attended college there.  He served as the head of the Persian Publication Desk at the U.S. Office of War Information during World War II, inaugurated the Voice of America to Iran, and prepared an English-[[Persian language|Persian]] military dictionary for the Department of Defense.  His quatrains include the original Persian verses for reference alongside his English translations.  His focus was to faithfully convey, with less poetic license, Khayyam’s original religious, mystical, and historic Persian themes, through the verses as well as his extensive annotations.  Two example quatrains follow:

Quatrain 16 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XII in his 5th edition, as above):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah, would there were a loaf of bread as fare,
A joint of lamb, a jug of vintage rare,
And you and I in wilderness encamped—
No Sultan’s pleasure could with ours compare.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quatrain 75:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The sphere upon which mortals come and go,
Has no end nor beginning that we know;
And none there is to tell us in plain truth:
Whence do we come and whither do we go.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Folio Society===

Printed in 2012, this edition is based off of the first edition translation done by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] . However, adding to this english translation is an introduction done by A.S. Byatt and small emendations throughout the text. These emendations have, arguably, created the best english translation of Omar Khayyam to date &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.foliosociety.com/book/RUB/rubaiyat-omar-khayyam] &lt;/ref&gt; .

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night
Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:
And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultán’s Turret in a Noose of Light.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other languages===
*Many [[Russian language]] translations have been undertaken, reflecting the popularity of the ''Rubaiyat'' in [[Russia]] since the late 19th century and the increasingly popular tradition of using it for the purposes of [[bibliomancy]]. The earliest verse translation (by [[V.L. Velichko]]) was published in 1891. The version by Osip Rumer published in 1914 is a translation of FitzGerald's version. Rumer later published a version of 304 rubaiyat translated directly from Persian.

* In [[Japan]], until 1949, more than 10 poets and/or scholars made translations into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ogawa&quot;&gt;Omar Khayyam. ''Rubaiyat''. Translated by {{Nihongo|Ryosaku Ogawa|小川亮作|Ogawa Ryosaku}}. [[Iwanami Shoten]], 1949 (revised ed. in 1979), pp. 167-173. ISBN 978-4003278314.&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete translation from Persian into the modern Japanese language was made by Ryosaku Ogawa in 1949, which is still popular and has been published from [[Iwanami Shoten]] (it is now under public domain and also freely available from [[Aozora Bunko]] [http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000288/card1760.html]). Historically, the first attempt is 6 poems translated by [[Kambara Ariake]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;ogawa&quot; /&gt; In 1910, Kakise Hikozo translated 110 poems from the 5th edition of FitzGerald's translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ogawa&quot; /&gt; The first translation from Persian into the [[classical Japanese language]] was made by a linguist Shigeru Araki in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;ogawa&quot; /&gt; Among other various translations, Ogawa highly evaluates Ryo Mori ([[:ja:森亮]])'s one produced in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;ogawa&quot; /&gt;
* [[Naum Faiq]], A prominent [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] journalist and author translated the quatrains into [[Syriac]]. The translation exist in its manuscript form and remains unpublished.

==Authenticity and analysis==
The number of quatrains attributed to Khayyam varies from about 1,200 (according to [[Saeed Nafisi]]) to over 2,000. Many scholars believe that not all the attributed quatrains are authentic and some have been added to Khayyam's [[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan]] in later years for various reasons. A few literary researchers, for example, [[Mohammad-Ali Foroughi]] and [[Farzaneh Aghaeipour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afarzaneh.com/khayyam.pdf|format = PDF| title=Omar Khayam (in Persian)|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; have selected and published a subset of the quatrains believed to be original using various research methods.

==Mystical interpretation==
&quot;Wine of the Mystic&quot; by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], is an illustrated interpretation of the FitzGerald translation. Each quatrain is accompanied with Persian text, a glossary of terms, Yoganada's spiritual interpretation, and practical interpretation. It won the 1994 Benjamin Franklin Award in the field of Religion. Yogananda makes an argument for the mystical basis of Khayyam's Rubaiyat.

In ''Who is the Potter? '',&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Dougan [http://www.gnosticpress.co.nz/?page_id=149 Who is the Potter?] Gnostic Press 1991 ISBN 0-473-01064-X&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdullah Dougan]], a Naqshbandi Sufi, provides a verse-by-verse commentary of the Rubaiyat. Dougan says that while Omar is a minor Sufi teacher compared to the giants – Rumi, Attar and Sana’i, for us he is a marvelous man because we can feel for him and understand his approach. The work is much more accessible than Sana’i’s for instance; &quot;Every line of the Rubaiyat has more meaning than almost anything you could read in Sufi literature&quot;. Dougan says that the many critics of Fitzgerald miss the point as he is only an instrument for what Allah wanted to happen – there have been many more literally correct translations, but Fitzgerald’s is divine inspiration, something far superior, a miracle. In Dougan’s opinion, while many read the Rubaiyat literally and hence see Omar as a [[Materialism|materialist]], he is in fact a spiritual teacher and is much maligned because people do not understand him. Abdullah Dougan says the work is deeply esoteric and &quot;if you approach the quatrains with that in mind, the poem will have a tremendous impact on you as you try to understand it.&quot;

Religious beliefs were deeply instilled in the people of the time, which gave much influence to the clergy, and the prosecution of poets who made statements contradictory to religious messages were prevalent, as was the case with [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] (whose house was raided several times, and was forced to burn some of his more liberal poems) and [[Ferdowsi]] (who was branded a heretic and was not permitted to be buried in the Muslims graveyard).

The mystic interpretation of themes in poetry which were contrary to Islamic teachings became popular after the [[Safavid dynasty]] rise to power and the establishing of [[Twelver]] school of Shi'a Islam as the official religion of Iran. At this time poets such as Ferdowsi (who glorified the pre-Islamic Iran and patriotism), Hafiz (with his Epicurean view on life) and Khayyam (with openly agnostic themed poetry) had already found their roots among Iranian culture and their works were looked upon as masterpieces of Persian literature. In order to justify their popularity and lay “credence” to their messages, many Haram themes were interpreted as having hidden mystical meanings and parallels were drawn between verses and Shi'a themes and traditions. Some religious hardliners however repudiated Khayyam and the like altogether (and to a lesser extent still do today).

Putting aside all this Khayyam never identified himself as a [[Sufi]] nor did anyone in his time. In fact on several occasions he mocks the devoutly religious who criticize the non religious.

==Influence==
Like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works, Omar Khayyám's verses have provided later authors with quotations to use as titles:
* The title of [[Rex Stout]]'s [[Nero Wolfe]] novel ''[[Some Buried Caesar]]'' comes from one of the Tentmaker's quatrains (FitzGerald's XVIII), for example.
* [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s drama ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' derives its title from the first quoted quatrain above.
* [[Agatha Christie]] used ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' as a story title, as did [[Stephen King]]. See also ''[[And Having Writ…]]''.
* [[Lan Wright]] used ''[[Dawn's Left Hand]]'' as the title of a science fiction story serialized in ''[[New Worlds Science Fiction]]'' (January–March 1963).

Equally noteworthy are these works likewise influenced:
*The British composer [[Granville Bantock]] produced a choral setting of FitzGerald's translation 1906-1909.
*The American author [[O. Henry]] humorously referred to a book by &quot;Homer KM&quot; with the character &quot;Ruby Ott&quot; in his short story &quot;The Handbook of Hymen.[http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/o_henry/66/]&quot;  O. Henry also quoted a quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam in &quot;The Rubaiyat of a Scotch Highball.&quot;
*Using FitzGerald's translation, the Armenian-American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] set a dozen of the quatrains to music. This work, ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', Op. 308, calls for narrator, orchestra, and solo [[accordion]].
*The American horror author [[H P Lovecraft]] created an Arab poet [[Abdul Alhazred]] to whom was attributed a couplet:
:That is not dead which can eternal lie
:And with strange aeons even death may die.
Lovecraft was obsessed with the [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] and had no doubt read the Fitzgerald translation - the couplet follows Fitzgerald's [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhyme pattern for the first half of a Khayyam quatrain.
*The artist/illustrator [[Edmund Dulac]] produced some much-beloved illustrations [http://www.oldfineart.com/albums/rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-illustrated-by-edmund-dulac/pages/1/] for the Rubaiyat, 1909.
*Filmmaker [[D.W. Griffith]] planned a film based on the poems as a follow-up to ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' in 1916.  It was to star [[Miriam Cooper]], but when she left the Griffith company the plans were dropped;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Lady of the Silents |last=Cooper |first=Miriam |year=1973 |publisher=Bobbs Merrill |isbn=0-672-51725-6 |pages=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he would ultimately film ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' instead.
*The Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] discusses ''The Rubaiyat'' and its history in an essay, &quot;The Enigma of Edward FitzGerald&quot; (&quot;El Enigma de Edward FitzGerald&quot;) in his book &quot;Other Inquisitions&quot; (&quot;Otras Inquisiciones&quot;, 1952). He also references it in some of his poems, including &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; in &quot;The Praise of the Shadow&quot; (&quot;Elogio de la Sombra&quot;, 1969), and &quot;Chess&quot; (&quot;Ajedrez&quot;) in &quot;The Maker&quot; (&quot;El Hacedor&quot;, 1960). Borges' father [[Jorge Guillermo Borges]] was the author of a translation to Spanish of the FitzGerald version of The Rubaiyat.
*The Lebanese writer [[Amin Maalouf]] based his novel ''[[Samarkand (novel)|Samarkand]]'' on the life of [[Omar Khayyam]], and the creation of the Rubaiyat. It details the [[Hashshashin|Assassin]] sect as well, and includes a fictional telling of how the (non-existent) original manuscript came to be on the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.
*Science fiction author [[Paul Marlowe]]'s story &quot;Resurrection and Life&quot; featured a character who could only communicate using lines from the Rubaiyat.
*The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], through a unanimous opinion penned in 2005 by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] [[Leonardo Quisumbing]], quoted ''The Moving Finger'' when it ruled that the widow of defeated presidential candidate [[Fernando Poe Jr.]] could not substitute her late husband in his pending election protest against Philippine president [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], thus leading to the dismissal of the protest.
*In [[Cyberflix]]'s PC game, ''[[Titanic: Adventure Out of Time]]'', the object is to save three important items, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s paintings, and a notebook that proves German officials were attempting to gain geo-political advantage by instigating communist [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]]. Two passages from the book are also included in the game as clues to progress the narrative.
*The Rubaiyat was quoted in the 1946 [[King Vidor]] Western film ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', which starred [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Jennifer Jones]]: &quot;Oh threats of hell and hopes of paradise! One thing at least is certain: This life flies. One thing is certain and the rest is Lies; The Flower that once is blown for ever dies.&quot;
*A canto was quoted and used as an underlying theme of the 1945 screen adaptation of ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'': &quot;I sent my soul through the invisible, some letters of that after-life to spell, and by and by my soul did return, and answered, 'I myself am Heaven and Hell.'&quot;
*[[Coldcut]] produced an album with a song called &quot;Rubyaiyat&quot; on their album ''Let us Play!'' This song contains what appears to be some words from the English translation. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003S7Z/ See album] This was probably influenced by the ambitious 1970 album by jazz-soul harpist [[Dorothy Ashby]], &quot;The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby,&quot; which has become something of a cult classic. The lyrics quote from several of the poem's verses, and the tracks' highly stylized and heavily reverberated production values and pop mysticism have made it a favorite of samplers, beat-diggers, and fans of psychedelic jazz and R&amp;B.
*In one 6-episode story arc of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', Bullwinkle finds the &quot;[[Ruby]] [[Yacht]] of Omar Khayyam&quot; in the town of Frostbite Falls (on the shores of [[Veronica Lake]], no less).
*[[Woody Guthrie]] recorded an excerpt of the Rubaiyat set to music that was released on ''[[Hard Travelin' (The Asch Recordings Vol. 3)]]''.
*In the film ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'' (based on the 1957 [[The Music Man|musical]]), town librarian Marian Paroo draws down the wrath of the mayor's wife for encouraging the woman's daughter to read a book of &quot;dirty Persian poetry.&quot; Summarizing what she calls the &quot;Ruby Hat,&quot; the mayor's wife paraphrases FitzGerald's Quatrain XII from his 5th edition: &quot;People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches, and drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls.&quot;
*The satirist and short story writer Hector Hugh Monro took his pen name of '[[Saki]]' from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat.
*The Rubaiyat have also influenced Arabic music. Indeed, [[Oum Koulthoum]], a legend of Arabic music, has sung one of those poems and made her song &quot;robaaiyet el khayam&quot; become one of her most beautiful songs.
*A copy of the ''Rubaiyat'' plays a role in an episode of the TV series ''[[New Amsterdam (TV series)|New Amsterdam]]'' and is shown to be the inspiration for the name of one of the lead character's children, Omar York.
*The famed &quot;skull and roses&quot; poster for a [[Grateful Dead]] show at the Avalon Ballroom done by Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse was adapted from Edmund J. Sullivan's illustrations for ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Selvin|Selvin, Joel]]. &quot;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/03/BAQS111UJ4.DTL Alton Kelley, psychedelic poster creator, dies]&quot;. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. 2008-06-03. Retrieved 2008-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The play ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' by [[Sean O'Casey]] contains a reference to the ''Rubaiyat'' as the character Donal Davoren quotes &quot;grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, and mould life nearer to the heart's desire.&quot;
*[[Wendy Cope]]'s poem &quot;Strugnell's Rubiyat&quot; is a close parody of the FitzGerald translation, relocated to modern day [[Tulse Hill]].

* [[Oliver Herford]] released a parody of the Rubaiyat called &quot;The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten&quot; in 1904, which is notable for its charming illustrations of the kitten in question on his philosophical adventures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldfashionedamericanhumor.com/the-rubaiyat-of-a-persian-kitten.html Old Fashioned American Humor]&lt;/ref&gt;

* One of the title pages of ''[[Principia Discordia]],'' a co-author of which went by the pen-name [[Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]], features its own spin on the quatrain most quoted above:
: A jug of wine,
: A leg of lamb
:: And thou!
: Beside me,
:: Whistling in
::: the darkness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/5.php Principia Discordia, the book of Chaos, Discord and Confusion]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the opening chapter of his book ''[[God is Not Great]]'', [[Christopher Hitchens]] quotes from [[Richard Le Gallienne]]'s translation of Khayyam's famous quatrain:
:And do you think that unto such as you
:A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew
:God gave the secret, and denied it me?
:Well, well-what matters it? Believe that, too!
*The work influenced the 2004 concept album ''The Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayyam'' by the Italian group [[Milargo Acustico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valley-entertainment.com/the-rubaiyyat-of-omar-khayyam.html |title=The Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayyam |work=Valley Entertainment-Hearts of Space Records |accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The final words of the work, Tamam Shud (which translates to 'Ended'), were at the center of the rather bizarre [[Taman Shud Case]] along with other connections to the Rubaiyat.
*[[Elektra Records]] released a complication album named [[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary|Rubáiyát]] in 1990 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Elektra Records record label.
