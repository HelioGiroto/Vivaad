'''Deductive reasoning''', also called '''deductive logic''', is the process of [[reasoning]] from one or more general [[argument (logic)|statement]]s regarding what is known to reach a logically certain conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=R. J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deductive reasoning involves using given true premises to reach a conclusion that is also true. Deductive reasoning contrasts with [[inductive reasoning]] in that a specific conclusion is arrived at from a general principle. If the rules and logic of deduction are followed, this procedure ensures an accurate conclusion. 

An example of a deductive argument:
#All men are mortal.
#John is a man.
#Therefore, John is mortal.

The first premise states that all objects classified as &quot;men&quot; have the attribute &quot;mortal&quot;. The second premise states that &quot;John&quot; is classified as a &quot;man&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a member of the set &quot;men&quot;. The conclusion then states that &quot;John&quot; must be &quot;mortal&quot; because he inherits this attribute from his classification as a &quot;man&quot;.

Deductive reasoning (also known as logical deduction) links [[premise]]s with [[conclusion]]s. If both premises are true, the terms are [[unambiguous|clear]] and the rules of deductive [[logic]] are followed, then the conclusion of the [[argument]] follows by [[logical necessity]].

==Law of Detachment==
{{Main |Modus ponens }}

The law of detachment (also known as '''affirming the antecedent''' and '''Modus ponens''') is the first form of deductive reasoning. A single [[Material conditional|conditional statement]] is made, and a hypothesis (P) is stated. The conclusion (Q) is then deduced from the statement and the hypothesis. The most basic form is listed below:
#P→Q (conditional statement)
#P (hypothesis stated)
#Q (conclusion deduced)

In deductive reasoning, we can conclude Q from P by using the law of detachment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgsee.kmutt.ac.th/exell/Logic/Logic12.htm#25 Guide to Logic]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the conclusion (Q) is given instead of the hypothesis (P) then there is no valid conclusion.

The following is an example of an argument using the law of detachment in the form of an if-then statement:
#If an angle A&gt;90°, then A is an obtuse angle.
#A=120°
#A is an obtuse angle.

Since the measurement of angle A is greater than 90°, we can deduce that A is an obtuse angle.

==Law of Syllogism==
The law of [[syllogism]] takes two conditional statements and forms a conclusion by combining the hypothesis of one statement with the conclusion of another. Here is the general form, with the true premise P:
#P→Q
#Q→R
#Therefore, P→R.

The following is an example:

#If Larry is sick, then he will be absent from school.
#If Larry is absent, then he will miss his classwork.
#If Larry is sick, then he will miss his classwork.

We deduced the final statement by combining the hypothesis of the first statement with the conclusion of the second statement.
We also conclude that this could be a false statement.

==Deductive Logic: Validity and Soundness==
Deductive arguments are evaluated in terms of their ''validity'' and ''soundness''. It is possible to have a deductive argument that is logically valid but is not sound.

An argument is [[Validity|valid]] if it is impossible for its [[premise]]s to be true while its conclusion is false. In other words, the conclusion must be true if the premises, whatever they may be, are true. An argument can be valid even though the premises are false.

An argument is [[Soundness|sound]] if it is valid and the premises are true.

The following is an example of an argument that is ''valid'', but not ''sound'':
#Everyone who eats steak is a quarterback.
#John eats steak.
#Therefore, John is a quarterback.

The example's first premise is false&amp;nbsp;– there are people who eat steak and are not quarterbacks&amp;nbsp;– but the conclusion must be true, so long as the premises are true (i.e. it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false). Therefore the argument is valid, but not sound.

In this example, the first statement uses [[term logic|categorical reasoning]], saying that all steak-eaters are definitely quarterbacks. This theory of deductive reasoning&amp;nbsp;– also known as [[term logic]]&amp;nbsp;– was developed by [[Aristotle]], but was superseded by [[propositional calculus|propositional (sentential) logic]] and  [[predicate logic]].

Deductive reasoning can be contrasted with [[inductive reasoning]], in regards to validity and soundness. In cases of inductive reasoning, even though the premises are true and the argument is &quot;valid&quot;, it is possible for the conclusion to be false (determined to be false with a counterexample or other means).

==Hume's Skepticism==
{{see also|Problem of induction}}
Philosopher [[David Hume]] presented grounds to doubt deduction by questioning [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Hume's [[problem of induction]] starts by suggesting that the use of even the simplest forms of ''induction'' simply cannot be [[theory of justification|justified]] by inductive reasoning itself. Moreover, induction cannot be justified by deduction either. Therefore, induction cannot be justified rationally. Consequently, if induction is not yet justified, then deduction seems to be left to rationally justify itself&amp;nbsp;– an objectionable conclusion to Hume.

==Deductive reasoning and Education==
Deductive reasoning is generally thought of as a skill that develops without any formal teaching or training. As a result of this belief, deductive reasoning skills are not taught in secondary schools, where students are expected to use reasoning more often and at a higher level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylianides2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stylianides|first=G. J.|coauthors=Stylianides|title=A. J.|journal=Mathematical Thinking and Learning|year=2008|volume=10|issue=2|pages=103–133|doi=10.1080/10986060701854425|accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in high school, for example, that students have an abrupt introduction to [[mathematical proof]]s&amp;nbsp;– which rely heavily on deductive reasoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylianides2008&quot;/&gt;
