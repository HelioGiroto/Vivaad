'''Youth activism''' is engagement by the [[youth voice]] in [[community organizing]] for [[social change]]. Around the world, young people are engaged in [[activism]] as planners, researchers, [[teacher]]s, evaluators, [[social workers]], decision-makers, advocates and leading actors in the [[environmental movement]], [[social justice]] organizations, campaigns supporting or opposing legalized [[abortion]], and [[anti-racism]], anti-[[homophobia]] and pro [[gay rights]] campaigns. As the central beneficiaries of [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], youth are also advocating for [[student-led school change]] and [[education reform]] through [[student activism]] and meaningful [[Student engagement|student involvement]].&lt;ref&gt;Checkoway, B. &amp; Gutierrez, L. (2006) “An introduction,” in Checkoway &amp; Gutierrez (eds) Youth Participation and Community Change. New York: Hawthorne Press. p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
There are three main forms of youth activism. The first is youth involvement in social activism. This is the predominant form of youth activism today, as millions of young people around the world participate in social activism that is organized, informed, led, and assessed by adults. Many efforts, including [[education reform]], [[children's rights]], and [[Reform movement|government reform]] call on youth to participate this way, often called [[youth voice]]. [[Youth council]]s are an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;Chawla, L. (2002) Growing Up in an Urbanizing World. Paris/London: Earthscan/UNESCO Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second type is youth-driven activism requires young people to be the primary movers within an adult-led movement. Such is the case with the Sierra Club, where youth compel their peers to join and become active in the environmental movement. This is also true of many organizations that were founded by youth who became adults, such as [[Student Environmental Action Coalition|SEAC]] and [[National Youth Rights Association]].{{fact|date=February 2012}}

The third type is the increasingly common youth-led community organizing. This title encompasses action which is conceived of, designed, enacted, challenged, redesigned, and driven entirely by young people.{{fact|date=February 2012}} There is now global initiative by youth in international movements, such as in the [[International Youth Rights]], the first entirely student-run, non-profit, non-political, international movement organization, which was founded in 2009 by Seung Woo Son, a South Korean youth living in China. Working closely with Ms. Kim, the Director for Education Development at UNICEF Korea, the organization strives to make the youth’s opinions, experiences and their suggested solutions to the world issues be heard across the world and to actualize their solutions in real life, for all to realize what youth can do to make an impact in the world.{{fact|date=February 2012}} The [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]] is also another international movement, which has UN NGO status. I final example is the [[iMatter Movement]], an entirely youth-lead environmental advocacy organization. {{fact|date=February 2012}}

== United States ==
Youth activism as a social phenomenon in the United States truly became defined in the mid- to late-nineteenth century when young people began forming labor strikes in response to their working conditions, wages, and hours. [[Child labor]]ers in the coal mines of [[Appalachia]] began this trend, with newspaper carriers, soon following. These actions isolated youths' interests in the [[popular media]] of the times, and separated young people from their contemporary adult labor counterparts.{{fact|date=February 2012}}

This separation continued through the 1930s, when the [[American Youth Congress]] presented a &quot;Bill of Youth Rights&quot; to the US Congress. Their actions were indicative of a growing student movement present throughout the US from the 1920s through the early 1940s. The 1950s saw the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] bring young people into larger movements for [[civil rights]]. This led to the outbreak of youth activism in the 1960s.{{fact|date=February 2012}}

===Important individuals in U.S. youth activism===
[[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones]] organized the first youth activism in the U.S., marching 100,000 child miners from the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]] to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in 1908. In 1959, Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] engaged youth activists in protesting against [[Bull Connor]]'s racist law enforcement practices in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Coupled with the youth activism of [[Tom Hayden]], [[Keith Hefner (activist)|Keith Hefner]] and other 1960s youth, this laid a powerful precedent for modern youth activism. [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]], [[Myles Horton]] and [[Paulo Freire]] were each important in this period.

In the 1960s, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Abe Fortas]] handed out two landmark case decisions in favor of youth rights, ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines]]'' and ''[[In re Gault]]''.

In recent years, educators such as the [[Paulo Freire]], [[Henry Giroux]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Alfie Kohn]], and [[Jonathan Kozol]] have all called for young people to become central actors in the guidance of schools and communities. Modern advocates have included [[Aaron Keider]], [[William Upski Wimsatt]] and [[Adam Fletcher (activist)|Adam Fletcher]]. Researchers, including [[Shawn Ginwright]], [[David Driskell]], [[Barry Checkoway]] and [[Lorraine Gutierrez]] have led the burgeoning study of modern youth activism.
