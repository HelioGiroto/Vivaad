'''Student activism''' is work done by students to affect political, environmental, economic, or social change. It has often focused on making changes in schools, such as increasing student influence over curriculum or improving educational funding. In some settings, student groups have had a major role in broader political events.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) [http://www.commonaction.org/SocialChangeGuide.pdf ''Guide to Social Change Led By and With Young People''] Olympia, WA: CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National histories==
===Argentina===
In [[Argentina]] in 1918 student activism triggered a general modernization of the universities especially tending towards democratization, called The [[University Revolution]] (Spanish: Revolución Universitaria) or Argentine university reform. The events started in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and spread to the rest of the country, and then through much of [[Latin America]].

===Australia===
Australian Students have a long history of being active in political debates. This is particularly true in the newer universities that have been established in suburban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flindersstudents.com/news/content/view/37/35/|title=Book review: It Can't Happen Here|publisher=FlindersStudents|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of Students (Australia)|National Union of Students]] has sometimes been at the forefront of campus activism in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
As in other Western nations, students across Australia also protested the domination of state-run education on the back of some very strong protests and even violent clashes with police and other educational and state-represented authorities - such clashes probably peaking by the year, 1967.  As in other nations, left-wing students, in particular, demanded significant changes in educational perspective that reflected the down-trodden state of the working classes. This perspective was a virtual about-face on the more traditional functionalist view that had previously prevailed in state education.  These clashes and the immensity of opposition of students to traditional state-perceived functional views of society paved the way for a 'consciousness' of minority groups within society which has changed the Australian persona on the view of functional society ever since.  The newer theory had graduated by the 1980s into what was perceived as a more 'critical view' of society.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], several [[New Left]] student organizations emerged in the late 1950s and 1960s. There were several dominant New Left groups in Canada, the two main political organizations being the Student Union for Peace Action (SUPA) and the Company of Young Canadians (CYC). SUPA grew out of the pacifistic and moralistic Combined Universities Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CUCND) in December, 1965, at a conference at the University of Saskatchewan, and expanded its scope of affairs to include grass-roots politics in disadvantaged communities and ‘consciousness raising’ to radicalize and raise awareness of the ‘generation gap’ experienced by Canadian youth.  SUPA was a decentralized organization, rooted in local university campuses, and thus inherited the distinctly middle-class orientation of Canadian students. After SUPA disintegrated in late 1967, its members either moved to the CYC or became active leaders in the Canadian Union of Students (CUS), leading the CUS to assume the mantle of New Left student agitation. The organizations were marked by widespread intellectual debates. For example, with respect to the working class, the idea that the traditional ‘working class’ had been bought off and integrated into the system was widespread in these discussions, leaving the question of who now represented the most important actor in the struggle for a new and better socialist society. Indeed, SUPA fell apart over these debates over the role of the working class and the 'Old Left'. In 1968 Students for a Democratic University (SDU) was formed in McGill and Simon Fraser University. The SFU SDU was originally composed of former SUPA members and New Democratic Youth but also absorbed members from the campus Liberal Club and Young Socialists. SDU was prominent in the Administration Occupation of that year and the student strike in 1969. After the failure of the student strike SDU broke up. Some members joined the IWW and the Youth International Party. (Yippies) Other members helped form the Vancouver Liberation Front in 1970.

Since the 1970s [[Public Interest Research Groups]] (PIRG's) have been created as a result of Student's Union referendums across Canada e.g. Ontario Public Interest Research Group, the [[Alberta Public Interest Research Group (APIRG)]] and the Nova Scotia Public Interest Research Group. For a more complete list of PIRGs in Canada see  [http://pirg.ca pirg.ca] .  

Canadian PIRG's are unique from their American counterparts in that, in principle, the projects are student directed and run. Most, if not all, Canadian PIRG's operate on a [[consensus decision making]] model. Canadian PIRGs are student run and the majority of their funding comes directly from students. Although some efforts have been made towards collaboration Canadian PIRGs are independent of each other.

The [[Student Coalition Against War]] was formed to focus on public education, non-violent activism, organizing, advocacy and above all, reform.

===China===
[[File:May Fourth.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Students from the [[Peking University]] on Tiananmen Square in 1919]]

Since the defeat of the [[Qing Dynasty]] during the [[First Opium War|First]] (1839–1842) and [[Second Opium War]]s (1856–1860), student activism has played a significant role in the modern Chinese history.&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;{{Cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fueled mostly by [[Chinese nationalism]], Chinese student activism strongly believes that young people are responsible for China's future.&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt; This strong nationalistic belief has been able to manifest in several forms such as [[Democracy]], [[anti-Americanism]] and [[Communism]].&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt;

One of the most important acts of student activism in Chinese history is the [[May Fourth Movement]], which over 3,000 students of [[Peking University]] and other schools gathered together in front of [[Tiananmen]] and held a demonstration. It is regarded as an essential step of the democratic revolution in China, and it had also give birth to Chinese Communism. Anti-Americanism movements led by the students during the [[Chinese Civil War]] were also instrumental in discrediting the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] government and bring the Communist victory in China.&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt; In 1989, the democracy movement led by the students at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] ended in a brutal government crackdown which would later be called a massacre.

===Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet Union states===
During communist rule, students in [[Eastern Europe]] were the force behind several of the best-known instances of protest. The chain of events leading to the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was started by peaceful student demonstrations in the streets of [[Budapest]], later attracting workers and other Hungarians. In [[Czechoslovakia]], one of the most known faces of the protests following the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-led invasion that ended the [[Prague Spring]] was [[Jan Palach]], a student who committed [[suicide]] by setting fire to himself on January 16, 1969. The act triggered a major protest against the occupation.

Student-dominated youth movements have also played a central role in the &quot;[[color revolutions]]&quot; seen in post-communist societies in recent years. The first example of this was the [[Serbia]]n [[Otpor]] (&quot;Resistance&quot; in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]), formed in October 1998 as a response to repressive university and media laws that were introduced that year. In the presidential campaign in September 2000, the organisation engineered the &quot;Gotov je&quot; (&quot;He's finished&quot;) campaign that galvanized Serbian discontent with [[Slobodan Milošević]], ultimately resulting in his defeat.

Otpor has inspired other youth movements in [[Eastern Europe]], such as [[Kmara]] in [[Republic of Georgia|Georgia]], that played an important role in the [[Rose Revolution]], and [[Pora]] in [[Ukraine]], the most important movement organising the demonstrations that led to the [[Orange Revolution]]. Like Otpor, these organisations have consequently practiced [[non-violent resistance]] and used ridiculing humor in opposing authoritarian leaders. Similar movements include [[KelKel]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Zubr (political organization)|Zubr]] in [[Belarus]] and [[MJAFT!]] in [[Albania]].

Opponents of the &quot;color revolutions&quot; have accused the [[Soros Foundation]]s and/or the [[United States]] government of supporting and even planning the revolutions in order to serve western interests. Supporters of the revolutions have argued that these allegations are greatly exaggerated, and that the revolutions were positive events, morally justified, whether or not Western support had an influence on the events.

===France===
In [[France]], student activists have been influential in shaping public debate. In [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] the [[University of Paris]] at [[Nanterre]] was closed due to problems between the students and the administration. In protest of the closure and the expulsion of Nanterre students, students of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] began their own demonstration. The situation escalated into a nation-wide [[insurrection]] during which a variety of groups, including communists, [[anarchist]]s, and right-wing [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] activists, used the tension to advocate their own causes.

The events in Paris were followed by student protests throughout the world. The [[German student movement]] participated in major demonstrations against proposed [[German Emergency Acts|emergency legislation]]. In many countries, the student protests caused authorities to respond with violence. In [[Spain]], student demonstrations against [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] dictatorship led to clashes with police. A student demonstration in [[Mexico City]] ended in a storm of bullets on the night of October 2, 1968, an event known as the [[Tlatelolco massacre]]. Even in [[Pakistan]], students took to the streets to protest changes in education policy, and on November 7 a college student was shot dead as police opened fire on a demonstration.

===Germany===
{{See also|German student movement}}
[[File:Wartburg-Stundentenzug-1817.jpg|thumb|180px|Procession of students at Wartburg Festival]]
In 1815 in [[Jena]] ([[Germany]]) the [[Burschenschaft|&quot;Urburschenschaft&quot;]] was founded. That was a [[Studentenverbindung]] that was concentrated on national and democratic ideas.
In 1817, inspired by liberal and patriotic ideas of a united Germany, student organisations gathered for the [[Wartburg festival]] at [[Wartburg Castle]], at [[Eisenach]] in [[Thuringia]], on the occasion of which reactionary books were burnt.

In 1819 the student [[Karl Ludwig Sand]] murdered the writer [[August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue|August von Kotzebue]], who had scoffed at liberal student organisations.

In May 1832 the [[Hambacher Fest]] was celebrated at [[Hambach Castle]] near [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]] with about 30 000 participants, amongst them many students. Together with the [[Frankfurter Wachensturm]] in 1833 planned to free students held in prison at Frankfurt and [[Georg Büchner|Georg Büchner's]] revolutionary [[pamphlet]] ''Der Hessische Landbote'' that were events that led to [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|the revolutions in the German states in 1848]].

In the 1960s, the worldwide upswing in student and youth radicalism manifested itself through the [[German student movement]] and organisations such as the [[German Socialist Student Union]]. The movement in Germany shared many concerns of similar groups elsewhere, such as the democratisation of society and opposing the [[Vietnam War]], but also stressed more nationally specific issues such as coming to terms with the legacy of the [[Nazi]] regime and opposing the [[German Emergency Acts]].

===Indonesia===
In [[Indonesia]], university student groups have repeatedly been the first groups to stage street demonstrations calling for governmental change at key points in the nation's history, and other organizations from across the political spectrum have sought to align themselves with student groups.

In 1928, the Youth Pledge ([[Sumpah Pemuda]]) helped to give voice to [[anti-colonial]] sentiments.

During the political turmoil of the 1960s, right-wing student groups staged demonstrations calling for then-President [[Sukarno]] to eliminate alleged [[Communist]]s from his government, and later demanding that he resign.  Sukarno did step down in 1967, and was replaced by Army general [[Suharto]].

Student groups also played a key role in Suharto's 1998 fall by initiating large demonstrations that gave voice to widespread popular discontent with the president. High school and university students in [[Jakarta]], [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Medan, Indonesia|Medan]], and elsewhere were some of the first groups willing to speak out publicly against the military government. Student groups were a key part of the political scene during this period. For example, upon taking office after Suharto stepped down, [[B. J. Habibie]] made numerous mostly unsuccessful overtures to placate the student groups that had brought down his predecessor, meeting with student leaders and the families of students killed by security forces during demonstrations.

===Iran===
In [[Iran]], students have been at the forefront of protests both against the pre-1979 secular monarchy and, in recent years, against the theocratic [[islamic republic]]. Both religious and more moderate students played a major part in [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s opposition network against the [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. In January 1978 the army dispersed demonstrating students and religious leaders, killing several students and sparking a series of widespread protests that ultimately led to the [[Iranian Revolution]] the following year. On November 4, 1979, militant Iranian students calling themselves the Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam seized the [[United States of America|U.S.]] embassy in [[Tehran]] holding 52 embassy employees hostage for a 444 days (see [[Iran hostage crisis]]).

Recent years have seen several incidents when liberal students have clashed with the Iranian regime, most notably the [[Iran student riots, July 1999|Iranian student riots of July 1999]]. Several people were killed in a week of violent confrontations that started with a police raid on a university dormitory, a response to demonstrations by a group of students of [[Tehran University]] against the closure of a reformist newspaper. [[Akbar Mohammadi]] was given a [[capital punishment|death sentence]], later reduced to 15 years in prison, for his role in the protests. In 2006, he died at [[Evin prison]] after a hunger strike protesting the refusal to allow him to seek medical treatment for injuries suffered as a result of torture.

At the end of 2002, students held mass demonstrations protesting the death sentence of reformist lecturer [[Hashem Aghajari]] for alleged blasphemy. In June 2003, several thousand students took to the streets of Tehran in anti-government protests sparked by government plans to privatise some universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2980102.stm|title= Iranians protest against clerics|publisher=[[BBC]]|date= 2003-06-11|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the May 2005 [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|Iranian presidential election]], Iran's largest student organization, ''The Office to Consolidate Unity'', advocated a voting [[boycott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61117-2004Nov18.html|title= In Iran, Students Urge Citizens Not to Vote|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2004-11-19|accessdate=2007-09-13 | first=Robin | last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], student protests against the government has continued. In May 2006, up to 40 police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrating students in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5012026.stm|title= Protests at Tehran universities|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2006-05-24|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Iranian regime has called for student action in line with its own political agenda. In 2006, President Ahmadinejad urged students to organize campaigns to demand that liberal and secular university teachers be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5316634.stm|title= Iran's liberal lecturers targeted|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2006-09-05|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, after the [[2009 Iranian election|disputed presidential election]], a series of student protests broke out. The violent measures used by the Iranian regime to suppress these protests have been the subject of widespread international condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Scott|title=Obama in Farsi, on Twitter and WhiteHouse.gov|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/06/23/obama_in_farsi_on_twitter_and.html|accessdate=8 June 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In Israel the student was leading the [[2011 Israeli social justice protests]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. that became after that [[Cottage cheese boycott]].

===Japan===
Japanese student movement&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:日本の学生運動]] - Wikipedia Japan&lt;/ref&gt; began during the [[Taishō Democracy]], and grew in activity after World War II. They were mostly carried out by activist students. One such event was the Anpo opposition movement, which occurred during 1960, and again in 1968 &amp;ndash; 1970, in opposition to [[Anpo]]. During the second riots, leftist activists barricaded themselves in Universities, resulting in armed conflict with the Japanese police force. Activists organized in places known as &quot;agitating points&quot;. Some wider causes were supported including opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and [[apartheid]], and for the acceptance of the [[hippie]] lifestyle.

===Malaysia===
Since the amendment of Section 15 of the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 (UUCA) in 1975, students were barred from being members of, and expressing support or opposition to, any political parties or &quot;any organization, body or group of persons which the Minister, after consultation with the Board, has specified in writing to the Vice-Chancellor to be unsuitable to the interests and well-being of the students or the University.&quot; However, in October 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled that the relevant provision in Section 15 UUCA was unconstitutional due to Article 10 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]] pertaining to [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/malaysia-rules-against-ban-on-student-politics/475393|title=Malaysia Rules Against Ban on Student Politics|date=31 October 2011|work=Jakarta Globe|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the act prohibiting students from expressing “support, sympathy or opposition” to any political party was enacted in 1971, Malaysian students have repeatedly demanded that the ban on political involvement be rescinded. The majority of students are not interested in politics because they are afraid that the universities will take action against them. The U.U.C.A. has successfully made the students fearful to criticize the government.

In Kuala Lumpur on 14th April 2012, student activists camped out at Independence Square and marched against a government loan program that they said charged students high interest rates and left them with debt.

The largest student movement in Malaysia is the ''Solidariti Mahasiswa Malaysia (SMM)''(Student Solidarity of Malaysia). SMM is a coalition group that represents about 15 student organizations. SMM was established in the year of 2003. Currently, SMM is actively campaigning against the UUCA and a free education at primary, secondary and tertiary level.

===México===
During the [[protests of 1968]], [[México|Mexican]] government killed students and civilian protesters. This killing is known as in the [[Tlatelolco massacre]]

===South Korea===
{{main|People's Democracy (South Korea)|National Liberation (South Korea)}}

===United Kingdom===
Student politics has existed in U.K since the 1880s with the formation of the student representative councils, precursors of union organisations designed to present students interests. These later evolved into unions, many of which became part of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] formed in 1921. However, the NUS was designed to be specifically outside of &quot;political and religious interests&quot;, reducing its importance as a centre for student activism. During the 1930s students began to become more politically involved with the formation of many socialist societies at universities, ranging from social democratic to marxist-leninist and trotskyite, even leading to [[Brian Simon]], a communist, becoming head of the NUS.

However, it was not until the 1960s that student activism became important in British universities. Here, like many other countries, the Vietnam war and issues of Racism became a focus for many other local frustrations, such as fees and student representation. In 1962, the first student protest against the Vietnam War was held, with [[CND]]. However, student activism did not begin on a large scale until the mid-1960s. In 1965, a student protest of 250 students was held outside [[Edinburgh]]'s American embassy and the beginning of protests against the Vietnam war in [[Embassy of the United States in London|Grovesnor square]]. It also saw the first student teach-in at Oxford, where students debated alternative non-violent means of protest and protests at the [[London School of Economics]] against the government of [[Ian Smith]] in [[Rhodesia]].

In 1966 the ''Radical Student Alliance'' and [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]] were formed, both of which became centres for the protest movement. However, the first student sit-in was held at the London School of Economics in 1967 by their Student's Union over the suspension of two students. Its success and a national student rally of 100,000 held in the same year is usually considered to mark the start of the movement. Up until the mid 1970's student activities were held including a protest of up to 80,000 strong in Grovesnor square, anti-racist protests and occupations in Newcastle, the breaking down of riot control gates and forced closure of the London School of Economics and [[Jack Straw]] becoming the head of the NUS for the RSA.  However, two important things should be noted about the student activisim in the UK. Firstly, most British students still had faith in the democratic system{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and the authorities knew not to be too heavy handed with the protestors. Secondly, many protests were over more local issues, such as student representation in college governance,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. H. J. (2007)[http://www.patricksmith.org.uk/ ''Student revolution in 1960s Britain: Myth or reality?'']&lt;/ref&gt; better accommodation, lower fees or even canteen prices. Student protests erupted again in 2010 during the [[Premiership of David Cameron]] over the issue of [[Tuition fees (UK)|Tuition fees]], higher education funding cuts and withdrawal of the Education Maintenance Allowance. Though largely non-violent{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}, some students and police were injured in a few isolated incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11877034 | work=BBC News | title=Student tuition fee protest ends with 153 arrests | date=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], student activism is often understood as a form of [[youth activism]] that is specifically oriented toward change in the [[Education in the United States|American educational system]]. Student activism in the United States dates to the beginning of public education, if not before. The best early historical documentation comes from the 1930s. The [[American Youth Congress]] was a student-led organization in Washington, DC, which lobbied the US Congress against racial discrimination and for youth programs. It was heavily supported by First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].

The 1960s saw student activists gaining increased political prominence. One highlight of this period was [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) launched in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], a student-led organization that focused on schools as a social agent that simultaneously oppresses and potentially uplifts society. SDS eventually spun off the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. Another successful group was [[Ann Arbor]] Youth Liberation, which featured students calling for an end to state-led education. Also notable was the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], which fought against racism and for integration of public schools across the US. These specific organizations closed in the mid-1970s.

The largest [[Student Strike of 1970|student strike]] in American history took place in May and June 1970, in response to the [[Kent State shootings]] and the American [[Cambodian Campaign|invasion of Cambodia]].

In the early 1980s several formalized organizations brought [[neoliberal]] models of student activism to campuses across the nation, especially the Campus Outreach Opportunity League (C.O.O.L.). They claim large responsibility for identifying and championing the interest in [[community service|service]] among [[higher education]] students.

American society saw an increase in student activism again in the 1990s with the ushering in of the [[neoliberal]] [[community service]] policies of [[Bill Clinton]]. The popular education reform movement has led to a resurgence of [[populism|populist]] student activism against standardized testing and teaching,&lt;ref&gt;HoSang, D. (2003). [http://www.fcyo.org/Papers_no2_v4.qxd.pdf ''Youth and Community Organizing Today''] New York: Funders Collaborative on Youth Organizing.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more complex issues including military/industrial/prison complex and the influence of the military and corporations in education&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, M. (2004) [http://www.arc.org/Pages/pubs/youthrising.html ''Youth Rising''].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increased emphasis on ensuring that changes that are made are sustainable, by pushing for better education funding and policy or leadership changes that engage students as decision-makers in schools. Major contemporary campaigns include work for funding of [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], against increased tuitions at colleges or the use of [[sweatshop|sweatshop labor]] in manufacturing school apparel (e.g. United students against sweatshops), for increased student voice throughout education planning, delivery, and policy-making (e.g. The [[Roosevelt Institution]]), and to raise national and local awareness of the humanitarian consequences of the [[Darfur Conflict]]&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Hamilton (2011) [http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Darfur-Public-Struggle-Genocide/dp/B005GNKK9M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319947948&amp;sr=8-1 ''Fighting for Darfur: Public Action and the Struggle to Stop Genocide'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011)].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increasing activism around the issue of global warming. Antiwar activism has also increased leading to the creation of the [[Campus Antiwar Network]] and the refounding of [[Students for a Democratic Society (2006 organization)|SDS]] in 2006.

==Current activities==
Modern student activist movements vary widely in subject, size, and success, with all kinds of students in all kinds of educational settings participating, including public and private school students; elementary, middle, senior, undergraduate, and graduate students; and all races, socio-economic backgrounds, and political perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006)[http://www.commonaction.org/publications.htm ''Washington Youth Voice Handbook''] Olympia, WA: CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular issues include [[youth voice]], [[student rights]], school funding, [[drug policy reform]], [[anti-racism]] in education, tuition increases (in colleges), supporting campus workers' struggles, and many other areas. For more information, see [[youth activism]].

==Criticisms==
A contemporary challenge of student activism comes from the late Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]], who identified the crisis of the &quot;pure activist&quot; who operates without critical reflection
:&quot;The leaders [should not] treat the oppressed as mere activists to be denied the opportunity of reflection and allowed merely the illusion of acting, whereas in fact they would continue to be manipulated - and in this case by the presumed foes of the manipulation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1993) [http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/philosophy/education/freire/freire-2.html Chapter 2:] ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus Freire believed that by eliminating the reflective process from activism, organizers may actually perpetuate the very problems they purport to address.
