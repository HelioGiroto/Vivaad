[[File:Autonomous areas.svg|thumb|445px|Countries with at least one area labelled &quot;autonomous&quot; or defined as such by law]]

An '''autonomous area''' or '''autonomous entity''' is an area of a [[country]] that has a degree of [[autonomy]], or freedom from an external authority. Typically it is either geographically distinct from the rest of the country or populated by a [[Minority group|national minority]]. Giving one a certain amount of self-government may be a way for a national government to try and defuse an existing or possible internal conflict.  Countries that include autonomous areas are often [[Federacy|federacies]]. Autonomous areas can be divided into [[Territory (country subdivision)|territorial]] autonomies, subregional territorial autonomies and local autonomies.

==Contemporary==
Many autonomous areas lie within two of the world's largest countries, [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Russia]].

===China===
{{main|Autonomous areas of China}}
China (PRC) has five types of autonomous areas.

;Autonomous banner
Found only as [[Autonomous banner|divisions of Inner Mongolia]]. In effect, these are autonomous counties (see below).

;Autonomous county
{{main|Autonomous counties of China}}
The most numerous type of autonomous area in China, found both within and outside the larger autonomous prefectures and regions.

;Autonomous prefecture
{{main|Autonomous prefectures of China}}
China has 30 prefectures that are autonomous, mostly in the periphery of the country.

;Autonomous region
{{main|Autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China}}
A first-level administrative subdivision of China. There are five ARs in China. They are [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia AR]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet AR]], [[Ningxia|Ningxia Hui AR]], [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur AR]], and [[Guangxi|Guangxi Zhuang AR]]. Regardless of the names, these regions are in fact less autonomous than the special administrative regions of China.

;Special administrative region
{{main|Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China}}
Although not autonomous in name, in practice China's special administrative regions, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], enjoy a very high degree of autonomy.

===Russia===
Apart from [[Republics of Russia|its republics]], which by definition have a degree of autonomy, Russia has two types of autonomies:

;Autonomous okrug
{{Main|Autonomous okrugs of Russia}}

''[[Okrug]]'' is a [[transliteration|transliterated]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[loanword]] usually translated as &quot;district&quot;. Okrugs, however, vary more widely in size than other areas commonly identified as &quot;districts&quot;, from [[country subdivision#Levels|large first-level divisions to third-level divisions within cities]]. As of 2008, Russia has four autonomous okrugs.

;Autonomous oblast
{{main|Autonomous oblasts of Russia}}
''[[Oblast]]'' is a transliterated Slavic loanword usually understood to mean &quot;province&quot;. [[Wikipedia:As of|As of 2011]], one autonomous oblast exists: the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]].

===Other countries===
The other types of autonomous areas to be found in the world are:

====Autonomous city====
{{main|Autonomous city}}
{{see also|Buenos Aires|Tashkent|Autonomous cities of Spain}}
Four cities are formally designated by their countries as autonomous: the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]]; the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[exclave]]s of [[Plazas de soberanía|Ceuta and Melilla]]; and the [[Argentina|Argentine]] capital, [[Buenos Aires]].

[[Brussels]], formally the &quot;Bussels-Capital Region&quot; and one of the three regions of [[Belgium]], can also be seen as a kind of autonomous city. Note that the &quot;[[City of Brussels]]&quot; is one of the municipalities ''within'' that Region.

====Autonomous commune====
[[Bangui]], the capital of the [[Central African Republic]], is described as an autonomous [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]] (''commune autonome'').

====Autonomous community====
{{main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}
The territories into which [[Spain]]'s [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] are grouped are known as autonomous communities (''comunidades autónomas''). The Spanish model of state established by the [[Spanish Constitution|1978 Constitution]] is a quasi-federation, consisting of 17 autononomous communities having the constitutional right to [[self-government|self-rule]]. Spain is not a federation in name and is not yet a fully formed federation, but it does exhibit some of the institutional characteristics of contemporary federal political systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lluch 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite conference | first = Jaime | last = Lluch | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2011-04-13 | year = | month = | title = Federacies and Conceptual Stretching: A Critique of the Category of “Federacy” | conference = PSA Annual Conference, 19-21 April 2011, London,  ''British and Comparative Territorial Politics Group'' panel | conferenceurl = | booktitle = | editor = | others = | volume =  | edition = | publisher = The Political Studies Association | location = | pages =  | url = http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2011/739_367.pdf | accessdate = 2012-04-24 | doi = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autonomous province====
Four countries formally designate areas of their territory as autonomous [[province]]s:
* The provinces of [[Trentino]] and [[South Tyrol]] in [[Italy]].
* [[Jeju-do]], a [[South Korea]]n offshore island.
* [[Vojvodina]] in Serbia.
* [[Indonesia]] has the following [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] designated as autonomous: [[Aceh]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]

====Autonomous region====
In addition to the [[autonomous regions of China]] mentioned above, various other areas of the world are formally described as autonomous regions:
* The [[Åland Islands]], dependent territory within the [[Republic of Finland]].
* The [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].
* The [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]],&lt;ref&gt;Also described as a &quot;self-governing territory&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; two autonomous regions within the [[Kingdom of Denmark]].
* [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]], an autonomous dependency within the Republic of [[Mauritius]].
* The [[autonomous regions of India]].
* The four &quot;[[autonomous regions with special statute]]&quot; in [[Italy]]: [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]], [[Aosta Valley]]&lt;!--Already mentioned before as two autonomous provinces; the region exists just by name, no president, no council etc. [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]--&gt;, and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]].
* The two [[autonomous regions of Portugal]]: the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]].
* [[Nunatsiavut]], a self-governing region of Labrador [[Inuit]] in the Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].
* The [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]], in the [[Philippines]].
* The five municipalities, or caracoles in [[Chiapas]], in the southeast of [[Mexico]].
* [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]].
* [[Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte|Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte (RAAN)]] and [[Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur|Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur (RAAS)]] in [[Nicaragua]].
* The [[Nisga'a]] of [[British Columbia]] and [[Tli Cho]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] in Canada have self-government as a result of [[treaty|treaties]].
* In [[Iraq]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] is the only region that has gained official recognition internationally as an autonomous regional entity.

====Autonomous republic====
In addition to the Russian republics mentioned above, areas known as &quot;[[autonomous republic]]s&quot; exist within some of the countries established following the end of the [[Soviet Union]]:
* the [[Nakhichevan|Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]] within [[Azerbaijan]].
* the [[Adjara|Autonomous Republic of Adjaria]] within [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[Abkhazia]] is also regarded an autonomous republic by Georgia, although it declared unilaterally its independence in 1994).
* the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]] within [[Tajikistan]].
* the [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within [[Ukraine]].
* the [[Karakalpakstan|Karakalpakstan Republic]] within [[Uzbekistan]].

The [[Palestinian Authority]] exercises certain sovereign powers within its borders, but is not a fully independent government. The PA-administrated territories are internationally recognized as occupied by [[Israel]], and not a proper part of that country.

====Autonomous sector====
The [[Bissau Region]], in which [[Guinea-Bissau]]'s capital [[Bissau]] is found, is described as an &quot;autonomous sector&quot; (''sector autónomo''). 

====Autonomous territory====
Ostensibly [[Moldova]] has two autonomous territories: [[Gagauzia]] and [[Transnistria]]. However, this nominal status obscures the fact that the central government of Moldova has no effective authority in Transnistria (officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republican), which although unrecognized by any other nation, effectively governs itself as a sovereign state. Gagauzia, on the other hand, is an actual autonomous territory, with a degree of control being exercised by the central government.

====Other entities with devolution (autonomy)====
=====British constituent countries and Crown Dependencies=====
In the [[United Kingdom]].

=====New Zealand dependent territories=====
[[New Zealand]] has several autonomous [[island]]s and [[atoll]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]], like the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] (two states in [[freely associated state|free association]] with New Zealand), the [[Chatham Islands]] (a special territory within New Zealand) and [[Tokelau]] (a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing territory]] of New Zealand).

=====Ethiopian special woredas=====
In [[Ethiopia]], &quot;special woredas&quot; are a subgroup of ''[[woreda]]s'' (districts) that are organized around the traditional homelands of an [[Demographics of Ethiopia|ethnic]] minority, and are outside the usual hierarchy of a ''[[Regions of Ethiopia|kilil]]'', or region. These ''woredas'' have many similarities to autonomous areas in other countries.

==Historical==
* [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship]]
* [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] in [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] (1914).
* [[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union]] (1922–1990)

* [[Free imperial city]] of the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire]]
* [[Transjordan]] of [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Palestine]]

==Other==
Other areas that are autonomous in nature but not in name are areas designated for [[indigenous peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|those of the Americas]]:
* Aboriginal ([[First Nations|First Nation]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]) [[Indian reserve|reserves]] and [[Indian reservation|reservations]], in, respectively, [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].{{discuss}}
* the five [[Provinces and regions of Panama|''comarcas indígenas'']] (&quot;indigenous regions&quot;) of [[Panama]].
