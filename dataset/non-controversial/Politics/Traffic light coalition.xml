'''Traffic light coalition''' ({{lang-de|Ampelkoalition}}) is a term originating in [[Germany|German]] politics where it describes a [[coalition]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|The Greens]]. It arises from the fact that the parties' traditional colours, respectively red, yellow, and green, resemble the normal colour sequence of a [[traffic light]]. It has subsequently been used to describe similar coalitions between [[social democracy|social democrats]], [[liberalism|liberals]], and [[green politics|greens]] in other countries.

==History==
The phrase &quot;traffic light coalition&quot; is a direct translation of the [[German language|German]] word ''Ampelkoalition''.

At a [[States of Germany|state]] level, there have been two traffic light coalitions in Germany: in [[Brandenburg]] between 1990 and 1994 and in [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] between 1991 and 1995. Negotiations to form such a coalition in [[Berlin]] in 2001 were not successful.

At a [[Federal republic|federal]] level, however, to date no government has been formed on this basis. Historically, there have been '[[Red-green alliance|red-green]]' coalitions in the [[Bundestag]] between the SPD and the Greens, and [[social-liberal coalition]]s between the SPD and the FDP. However, whilst there may be common ground in terms of [[social progressivism]] between the three parties, the FDP's [[economic liberalism]] and long association at the federal level with the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] make such a coalition problematic at present and the FDP had specifically ruled out this option for the 2009 election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,643586-2,00.html |title=SPIEGEL Interview With FDP Leader Westerwelle - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term became more widely used outside Germany when the inconclusive [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]] led to its use in the international [[mass media|media]]. The term [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]] was formed in a similar way.

==Traffic light coalitions in other countries==
===Austria===
In [[Austria]] the term ''Ampelkoalition'' has been borrowed from Germany to describe a theoretical coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ), the [[Liberal Forum]] (LiF) and [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|The Greens]]. However, as at this time the Liberal Forum's party colour was light blue, this is a reference to the political similarity between this coalition and a German traffic light coalition rather than to the party's actual symbolic colours. As the Liberal Forum lost its parliamentary representation in the [[Austria legislative election, 1999|1999 Austrian elections]] such a coalition remains highly theoretical; nowadays its party colour ''is'' yellow, however.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] the term has been used to describe a coalition between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], notably that which currently runs the [[City of Lancaster]] [[non-metropolitan district|district council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,3605,1566749,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Delegates try to shake off image as single-issue party | first=Julian | last=Glover | date=10 September 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], a similar coalition in the [[Scottish Parliament]] involving the Labour and Liberal Democrat Parties with the [[Scottish Green Party]] was mooted following the [[Scottish parliamentary election, 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/politics/coxall/update2.htm |title=Palgrave Macmillan - Contemporary British Politics 4th Edition |publisher=Palgrave.com |date=2003-05-03 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year Labour and the Liberal Democrats continued their coalition with a slender majority, and it was again the stated position of the Scottish Greens to aim for such a coalition in 2007, despite possible tension between the [[Unionists (Scotland)|Unionist]] Labour and the Liberal Democrats and the [[Scottish independence|pro independence]] Scottish Greens.  However, Green support collapsed in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament election]] rendering the Greens non-viable as a coalition partner, although they supported [[Alex Salmond]]'s election as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]].

As with their German counterparts, the colours of Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens are respectively red, yellow, and green. In terms of the party's political positions, a red-yellow-green coalition may be more likely in the United Kingdom than in Germany, as the Liberal Democrats fit the [[social democracy|social-democratic]], or at least [[social liberalism|social-liberal]], mould of their precursor party the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] and have worked with Labour in the last two [[Scottish Executive]]s. However, the [[first past the post]] electoral system that applies for general elections and many local elections in the United Kingdom, coupled with the Greens only having one MP, means that a traffic light coalition is highly unlikely at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] in the foreseeable future.  Although the three parties continue to govern Lancaster, a similar coalition was suggested by some in [[Brighton and Hove]] after a By-election caused the Conservatives to lose their majority control.  However this was rejected as doomed to fail due the slim margin over the Tories and concerns over the coalition's stability.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
