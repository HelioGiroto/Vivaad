In 1867, the empire was [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|reformed]] into [[Austria-Hungary]].

After the collapse of the Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) Empire in 1918 at the end of [[World War I]], Austria adopted and used the name the [[Republic of German-Austria]] (&quot;Deutschösterreich&quot;, later &quot;Österreich&quot;) in an attempt for union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], but was forbidden due to the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]]. The [[First Austrian Republic]] was established in 1919.

In 1955, the [[Austrian State Treaty]] re-established Austria as a sovereign state, ending the occupation. In the same year, the [[Parliament of Austria|Austrian Parliament]] created the [[Declaration of Neutrality]] which declared that the Second Austrian Republic would become permanently [[neutral country|neutral]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Austria}}
[[File:Ostarrichi.jpg|thumb|left|First appearance of the word &quot;ostarrichi&quot;. The word is circled in red. Modern Austria honours this document, dated 996, as the founding of the nation.]]

The German name for Austria, {{lang|de|''Österreich''}},  means &quot;eastern kingdom&quot;, it derives from the word ''Ostarrîchi'', which first appears in the &quot;Ostarrîchi document&quot; of 996.&lt;ref name=&quot;University of Klagenfurt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwg.uni-klu.ac.at/spw/oenf/name2.htm|title=University of Klagenfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is probably a translation of [[Medieval Latin]] {{lang|la|''[[Marchia orientalis]]''}} into a local (Bavarian) dialect. It was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976. The word &quot;Austria&quot; is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century.

[[Friedrich Heer]], one of the most important Austrian [[historians]] in the 20th century, stated in his book ''Der Kampf um die österreichische Identität'' (''The Struggle Over Austrian Identity''),&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Heer: ''Der Kampf um die österreichische Identität''. Böhlau, Wien/Köln/Graz 1981, ISBN 3-205-07155-7.&lt;/ref&gt; that the Germanic form ''Ostarrîchi'' was not a translation of the Latin word, but both resulted from a much older term originating in the [[Celtic languages]] of ancient Austria: more than 2,500 years ago, the major part of the actual country was called ''Norig'' by the Celtic population ([[Hallstatt culture]]); according to Heer, ''no-'' or ''nor-'' meant &quot;east&quot; or &quot;eastern&quot;, whereas ''-rig'' is related to the modern German ''Reich'', meaning &quot;realm&quot;. Accordingly, ''Norig'' would essentially mean ''Ostarrîchi'' and ''Österreich'', thus ''Austria''. The Celtic name was eventually Latinised to ''[[Noricum]]'' after the Romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern day Austria, in approximately 15 BC. ''Noricum'' later became a [[Roman province]] in the mid 1st century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noricum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.n/n840136.htm;internal&amp;action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en|title=Noricum, römische Provinz|work=AEIOU|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Austria}}
Settled in ancient times,&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 17&quot;/&gt; the [[Central Europe]]an land that is now Austria was occupied in pre-Roman times by various [[Celt]]ic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of [[Noricum]] was later claimed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made a province. Present day Petronell-Carnuntum in Eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province. Fifty thousand people called [[Carnuntum]] home for nearly 400 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnuntum Tourism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Wappen röm.kaiser.JPG|thumb|Coats of arms of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor in 1605]]

After the fall of the Roman Empire the area was invaded by [[Bavarians]], [[Slavs]] and [[European Avars|Avars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 19&quot; /&gt; The Slavic tribe of the Carantanians [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|migrated into the Alps]] and established the realm of [[Carantania]], which covered much of eastern and central Austrian territory. [[Charlemagne]] conquered the area in 788 AD, encouraged colonisation and introduced [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 19&quot;&gt;Johnson 19&lt;/ref&gt; As part of [[Eastern Francia]], the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of [[Babenberg]]. The area was known as the ''[[March of Austria|marchia Orientalis]]'' and was given to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 20&quot;&gt;Johnson 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The first record showing the name Austria is from 996 where it is written as ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 20&quot; /&gt; In 1156 the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]. With the death of [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs went extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 21&quot;&gt;Johnson 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 21&quot; /&gt; His reign came to an end with his defeat at [[Dürnkrut]] at the hands of [[Rudolph I of Germany]] in 1278.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 23&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, until [[World War I]], Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the [[Habsburgs]].

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438 Duke [[Albert V of Austria]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.

[[File:Vienna Battle 1683.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683 broke the advance of the [[Ottoman Empire]] into Europe.]]

The Habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the hereditary lands. In 1477 [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian]], only son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], married the heiress Maria of [[County of Burgundy|Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[Netherlands]] for the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 25&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 11&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 11&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married [[Joanna the Mad]], the heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and thus acquired [[Spain]] and its Italian, African and [[New World]] appendages for the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 11&quot; /&gt; In 1526 following the [[Battle of Mohács]], [[Bohemia]] and the part of [[Hungary]] not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ottoman–Hungarian Wars|Ottoman expansion]] into Hungary led to [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|frequent conflicts]] between the two empires, particularly evident in the so-called [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606.

During the long reign of [[Emperor Leopold I|Leopold I]] (1657–1705) and following the successful [[Battle of Vienna|defense of Vienna]] in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, [[John III Sobieski]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Great Turkish War|series of campaigns]] resulted in bringing all of Hungary to Austrian control by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.

[[Emperor Charles VI]] relinquished many of the fairly impressive gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for other powers' worthless recognitions of the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]] the [[German dualism|Austrian–Prussian dualism]] began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of Poland]] (in 1772 and 1795).

Austria later became engaged in a war with [[Revolutionary France]], at the beginning highly unsuccessful, with successive defeats at the hands of [[Napoleon]] meaning the end of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806. Two years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 34&lt;/ref&gt; in 1804, the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded. In 1814 Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|Ethno-linguistic map of Austria–Hungary, 1910]]
It emerged from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as one of four of the continent's dominant powers and a recognised [[great power]]. The same year, the [[German Confederation]], ({{lang|de|''Deutscher Bund''}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political and national conflicts the German lands were shaken by the [[1848 revolution]] aiming to create a unified Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 36&quot;&gt;Johnson 36&lt;/ref&gt; A unified Germany would have been possible either as a [[Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland|Greater Germany]], or a Greater Austria or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and successfully freed the independent duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. Nevertheless as they could not agree on a solution to the administration of the two duchies, they fought in 1866 the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. Defeated by Prussia in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]],&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 36&quot; /&gt; Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 55&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze 233&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the ''Ausgleich'', provided for a dual sovereignty, the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], under [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 59&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] groups including [[Croats]], [[Czechs]], [[Poles]], [[Rusyns]], [[Serbs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Slovenes]] and [[Ukrainians]], as well as large [[Italian people|Italian]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] communities.

As a result, ruling Austria–Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, causing a high reliance on the use of an expanded secret police.  Yet the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: The ''Reichsgesetzblatt'', publishing the laws and ordinances of [[Cisleithania]], was issued in eight languages, all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices, for example.

===20th century===

[[File:franzferdinand.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] (right) with his family]]
The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914 by Bosnian Serb [[Gavrilo Princip]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of [[World War I]] which led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Grebler, Leo and Winkler, Wilhelm ''The Cost of the World War to Germany and Austria-Hungary'', Yale University Press, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1918, the elected German members of the ''Reichsrat'' (parliament of Imperial Austria) met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for German Austria (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich''). On 30 October the assembly founded the State of German Austria by appointing a government, called ''Staatsrat''. This new government was invited by the emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with [[Italy]], but refrained from this business; this left the responsibility for the end of the war on 3 November 1918, solely to the emperor and his government. On 11 November the emperor, counseled by ministers of the old and the new government, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November German Austria, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic. The constitution, renaming ''Staatsrat'' to ''Bundesregierung'' (federal government) and ''Nationalversammlung'' to ''Nationalrat'' (national council) was passed on 10 November 1920.

The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 1919 (for Hungary the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of [[Central Europe]] which to a great part had been established in November 1918, creating new states and resizing others. Over 3-million German speaking Austrians found themselves living outside of the newborn Austrian Republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged respective states of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 246&lt;/ref&gt; This included the provinces of [[South Tyrol]] and [[German Bohemia]], the latter of which would play a role in sparking WWII. The South Tyrol question would become a lingering problem between Austria and Italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a large degree of autonomy being granted by the Italian national government. Between 1918 and 1919 Austria was known as the State of [[German Austria]] ({{lang|de|''Staat Deutschösterreich''}}). Not only did the [[Allies of World War I|Entente powers]] forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, they also rejected the name German Austria in the peace treaty to be signed; it was therefore changed to Republic of Austria in late 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 245&lt;/ref&gt; The border between Austria and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) was finally settled with the [[Carinthian Plebiscite]] in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian [[Crownland of Carinthia]] to Austria. This set the border on the [[Karavanke|Karawanken]] mountain range, with a lot of [[Slovenes]] remaining in Austria.

[[File:Austria1914physical.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[Austria–Hungary]]]]
After the war inflation began to devaluate the ''Krone'', still Austria's currency. In the autumn of 1922 Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 257–8&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency and improve its general economic condition. With the granting of the loan, Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925 the ''[[Schilling]]'', replacing the ''Krone'' by 10,000:1, was introduced. Later it was called the Alpine dollar due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Friday.

The [[First Austrian Republic]] lasted until 1933 when Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], using what he called &quot;self-switch-off of Parliament&quot; ({{lang|de|''Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments''}}), established an autocratic regime tending toward [[Italian fascism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 104&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 269&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 269–70&lt;/ref&gt; The two big parties at this time, the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, had paramilitary armies;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brook-Shepherd 261&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 261&lt;/ref&gt; the Social Democrats' [[Republikanischer Schutzbund|''Schutzbund'']] was now declared illegal but still operative&lt;ref name=&quot;Brook-Shepherd 261&quot; /&gt; as [[Austrian Civil War|civil war]] broke out.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 104&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 269&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 107&quot;&gt;Johnson 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1934 several members of the ''Schutzbund'' were executed,&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 283&lt;/ref&gt; the Social Democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 107&quot; /&gt; On 1 May 1934, the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascists]] imposed a new constitution (&quot;Maiverfassung&quot;) which cemented Dollfuss's power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a [[Nazi]] coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 292&lt;/ref&gt;

His successor, [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], struggled to keep Austria independent as &quot;the better German state&quot;, but on 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over government, while German troops occupied the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 112&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March 1938, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria was officially declared. Two days later [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (an Austrian by birth), did what he called the  &quot;re-unification&quot; of his home country with the &quot;rest of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]&quot; on Vienna's [[Heldenplatz]]. He established a plebiscite confirming the union with Germany in April 1938.

[[File:Hitler as young man.jpg|thumb|125px|Adolf Hitler was born in [[Braunau am Inn]], [[Upper Austria]].]]
Austria was incorporated into the [[Third Reich]] and ceased to exist as an independent country. The [[Aryanisation]] of the wealth of Jewish Austrians started immediately mid-March with a so-called &quot;wild&quot; (i.e. extra-legal) phase but soon was structured legally and bureaucratically to strip Jewish citizens of any asset they may have possessed. The Nazis called Austria &quot;[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 112&quot; /&gt; until 1942 when it was again renamed and called &quot;Alpen-Donau-Reichsgaue&quot;. Some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians, including Hitler, [[Adolf Eichmann]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], [[Franz Stangl]], and [[Odilo Globocnik]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wallace (1999). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=OiPp8JLxny8C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false German-speaking exiles in Great Britain]''&quot;.

Cambridge University Press. p.43. ISBN 0-521-85683-3&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Vienna Offensive]] just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. The invading Allied powers, in particular the Americans, planned for the supposed &quot;Alpine Fortress Operation&quot; of national redoubt that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the eastern Alps. However it never materialized because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.

[[Karl Renner]] and [[Adolf Schärf]] (Socialist Party of Austria [Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists]), Leopold Kunschak (Austria's People's Party [former Christian Social People's Party]) and Johann Koplenig (Communist Party of Austria) declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a [[provisional government]] in [[Vienna]] under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious [[Red Army]] and backed by [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 135&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 135–6&lt;/ref&gt; (The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.) At the end of April, most of Western and Southern Austria still was under Nazi rule. On 1 May 1945, the federal constitution of 1929, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again.

Total [[World War II casualties#endnote Austria|military deaths]] from 1939 to 1945 are estimated at 260,000.&lt;ref&gt;Rűdiger Overmans. ''Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg.'' Oldenbourg 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 65,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44183/Austria/33382/Anschluss-and-World-War-II Anschluss and World War II]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; About 140,000 Jewish Austrians had fled the country in 1938–39. Thousands of Austrians had taken part in serious Nazi crimes (hundreds of thousands died in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] only), a fact officially recognised by Chancellor [[Franz Vranitzky]] in 1992.

Much like Germany, Austria was divided into British, French, Soviet and American zones and governed by the [[Allied Commission for Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 137&lt;/ref&gt; As forecast in the [[Moscow Declaration]] in 1943, there was a subtle difference in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 135&quot; /&gt; The Austrian Government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives and Communists (until 1947) and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the [[Western Allies]] in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet. Thereby the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the division of the country could be avoided. Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Manfried Rauchensteiner: Der Sonderfall. Die Besatzungszeit in Österreich 1945 bis 1955 (The Special Case. The Time of Occupation in Austria 1945 to 1955), edited by [[Heeresgeschichtliches Museum]] / Militärwissenschaftliches Institut (Museum of Army History / Institute for Military Science), Vienna 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the [[Cold War]], Austria regained full independence by concluding the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Four Occupying Powers. On 26 October 1955, after all occupation troops had left, Austria declared its &quot;permanent neutrality&quot; by an act of parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 153&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|right|Austria joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]

The political system of the Second Republic is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reintroduced in 1945. The system came to be characterised by ''[[Proporz]]'', meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the Social Democrats and the People's Party.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 139&lt;/ref&gt; Interest group &quot;chambers&quot; with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, business people, farmers) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so that hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 165&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1945 a single-party government took place only in 1966–1970 (Conservatives) and 1970–1983 (Social Democrats). During all other legislative periods, either a grand coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats or a &quot;small coalition&quot; (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.

Following a [[Austrian European Union membership referendum, 1994|referendum in 1994]], at which consent reached a majority of two thirds, the country became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 447,449&lt;/ref&gt;

The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military non-alignment:{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} While the SPÖ in public supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians{{Who|date=July 2010}}. In reality, Austria is taking part in the EU's [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], participates in the so-called{{By whom|date=July 2010}} Petersburg Agenda (including [[Peacekeeping|peace keeping]] and peace creating tasks) and has become member of [[NATO]]'s &quot;Partnership for Peace&quot;; the constitution has been amended accordingly. Since [[Liechtenstein]] joined the [[Schengen Area]] in 2011, none of Austria's neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Austria}}&lt;!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--&gt;
[[File:WienParlament.jpg|thumb|[[Austrian Parliament Building]] in [[Vienna]]]]

The [[Parliament of Austria]] is located in [[Vienna]], the country's largest city and capital. Austria became a federal, [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentary, democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920.
The political system of the Second Republic with its [[States of Austria|nine states]] is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 17, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The [[head of state#Parliamentary system|head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] (''Bundespräsident''), who is directly elected by popular vote. The chairman of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]], who is appointed by the president. The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]]. Voting for the federal president and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071103221527/http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archivedate=3 November 2007|title=Bundesministerium für Inneres – Elections Compulsory voting|publisher=Bmi.gv.at|accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament of Austria consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) has [[Suffrage|voting rights]]. While there is a general threshold of 4% for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or {{lang|de|''Direktmandat''}}, in one of the 43 regional election districts.

The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]], has a limited right of [[veto]] (the Nationalrat can—in almost all cases—ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as '''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. &quot;vote of persistence&quot;). A convention, called the {{lang|de|''Österreich -Konvent''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konvent.gv.at/ |title=Willkommen beim Österreich Konvent |publisher=Konvent.gv.at |accessdate=21 November 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090104001526/http://www.konvent.gv.at/| archivedate= 4 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was convened on 30 June 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two-thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform.

With legislative and executive, the courts are the third column of Austrian state powers. Notably the Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') may exert considerable influence on the political system by ruling out laws and ordinances not in compliance with the constitution. Since 1995, the [[European Court of Justice]] may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union. Austria also implements the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], since the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] is part of the Austrian constitution.

===Recent developments===
After general elections held in October 2006, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]] emerged as the largest party, whereas the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] lost about 8% in votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Election2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|title=24 November 2002 General Election Results – Austria Totals|year=2006|work=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Election2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|title=October&amp;nbsp;1st,&amp;nbsp;2006 General Election Results – Austria Totals|year=2006|work=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and Social Democrats formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008. Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) but together they still held more than 50% of the votes with the Social Democrats holding the majority. They formed a coalition with Werner Faymann from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The positions of the Freedom Party and the deceased [[Jörg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both parties on the political right, were strengthened during the election.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Austria}}
[[File:BMAA Vienna Sept 2006 003.jpg|thumb|Foreign Ministry]]

The 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which &quot;Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality&quot;. The second section of this law stated that &quot;in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory&quot;. Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.

Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the [[United Nations|UN]]-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and, since 1995, it has developed participation in the [[European Union|EU's]] Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Also in 1995, it joined [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still valid fully is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Austria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). As an OSCE participating State, Austria’s international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]].

|}

The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces ({{lang-de|Bundesheer}}) mainly relies on [[conscription]]. All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months [[military service]], followed by an eight-year reserve obligation. Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot; /&gt; [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection]] is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months [[Zivildienst|civilian service]] instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.

The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkräfteführungskommando, SKFüKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkräfte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkräfte), International Missions (Internationale Einsätze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkräfte), next to Mission Support (Kommando Einsatzunterstützung; KdoEU) and Command Support (Kommando Führungsunterstützung; KdoFüU). Austria is a [[landlocked country]] and has no [[navy]].

In 2004, Austria's defence expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.9% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 45,000 soldiers, of whom about half are conscripts. As head of state, [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] (currently [[Heinz Fischer]]) is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. In practical reality, however, command of the Austrian Armed Forces is almost exclusively exercised by the Minister of Defense, currently [[Norbert Darabos]].

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded &quot;[[Iron Curtain]]&quot; separating Austria and its [[Eastern Bloc]] neighbours ([[Hungary]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]), the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]]. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and [[Slovakia]] joined the EU [[Schengen Area]] in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing &quot;internal&quot; border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s. They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.

Within its self-declared status of permanent neutrality, Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]] and, since 1974, in the [[Golan Heights]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|States of Austria}}

As a [[federal republic]], Austria is divided into [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|Bundesländer}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot; /&gt; These states are then divided into [[Districts of Austria|district]]s ({{lang|de|''[[Bezirke]]''}}) and statutory cities ({{lang|de|''[[Statutarstadt|Statutarstädte]]''}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|''Gemeinden''}}). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social care, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Austria}}
[[File:Oesterreich topo.png|thumb|Topography of Austria]]

Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country due to its location in the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaAlps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/17356/Alps|title=Alps|date=11 June 2009|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=12 June 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090601083317/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/17356/Alps| archivedate= 1 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria ({{convert|84000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below {{convert|500|m|ft|0}}. The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.

Austria lies between latitudes [[46th parallel north|46°]] and [[49th parallel north|49° N]], and longitudes [[9th meridian east|9°]] and [[18th meridian east|18° E]].

It can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the [[Eastern Alps]], which constitute 62% of nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.

The six highest mountains in Austria are:

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, Alps conifer and mixed forests and Western European broadleaf forests.

===Climate===
The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. With nearly three-fourths of the country dominated by the Alps, the [[alpine climate]] is predominant. In the east—in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the [[Danube|Danube valley]]—the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter (−10 – 0 °[[Celsius|C]]), summer temperatures can be relatively warm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20101202042009/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003350|title=Average Conditions, Vienna, Austria|year=2006|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with average temperatures in the mid-20s and a highest temperature of {{convert|39.7|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=ZAMG&gt;[http://www.zamg.ac.at/cms/de/klima/klimauebersichten/klimamittel-1971-2000 Klima].

Austria is the 12th [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|richest country in the world]] in terms of GDP ([[Gross domestic product]]) per capita,&lt;ref name=imf2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&amp;ey=2012&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=122&amp;s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&amp;pr.x=37&amp;pr.y=14 |title=Austria|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a well-developed [[social market economy]], and a high [[standard of living]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. [[Labour movement]]s are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.
[[File:Mariahilferstrasse1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mariahilf]] shopping avenue]]
[[Germany]] has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. However, since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]] it has gained closer ties to other EU economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in GDP accelerated in recent years and reached 3.3% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oenb.at/isaweb/report.do?&amp;lang=EN&amp;report=7.7 Real GDP Growth – Expenditure Side], provided by the [[Oesterreichische Nationalbank|Austrian National Bank]] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria indicated on 16 Nov 2010 that it would withhold the December installment of its contribution to the EU bailout of Greece citing material worsening of the Greek debt situation and apparent inability of Greece to collect the level of tax receipts it had previously promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark |url=http://www.marksmarketanalysis.com/2010/11/austria-withholds-greek-bailout-funds.html |title=Mark's Market Analysis |publisher=Marksmarketanalysis.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2011-07-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110714035955/http://www.marksmarketanalysis.com/2010/11/austria-withholds-greek-bailout-funds.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency===
{{Main|Austrian euro coins}}
{{See also|Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)}}
[[File:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|In 1999, Austria introduced the single European currency, the [[euro]]. With 17 other EU member states it forms the [[Eurozone]].]]

In Austria, the [[euro]] was introduced as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, and euro coins and banknotes entered circulation on 1 January 2002. As a preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 1999, however all Austrian euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it; unlike other countries of the [[Eurozone]] where mint year is minted in the coin. Eight different designs, one per face value, were selected for the Austrian coins. In 2007, to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common side of its coins.

Before adopting the euro in 2002 Austria had maintained use of the [[Austrian schilling]] which was first established in December 1924. The Schilling was abolished in the wake of the [[Anschluss]] in 1938 and was reintroduced after the end of the [[World War II]] in November 1945.

Austria has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro coin was exceptionally minted in 2004). These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of the minting of silver and gold coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not [[legal tender]] in all the eurozone. For instance, a €5 Austrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

===Energy===
{{See also|Wind power in Austria|Renewable energy in the European Union}}

In 1972, the country began construction of a [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] electricity-generation station at [[Zwentendorf]] on the River [[Danube]], following a unanimous vote in parliament. However, in 1978, a [[referendum]] voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for,&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 168–9&lt;/ref&gt; and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.

Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by [[hydropower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RES&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.eu/renewables/factsheets/2008_res_sheet_austria_en.pdf|title=Austria Renewable Energy Fact Sheet|date=23 January 2008|format=PDF|work=Europe's Energy Portal|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind power|wind]], [[solar power|solar]] and [[biomass]] powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to 62.89%&lt;ref name=&quot;Renewables&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.eu/renewables/eu-charts/chart4.html|title=Renewable energy in Europe|year=2006|work=Eurobserv'er|publisher=Europe's Energy Portal|accessdate=20 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090520023020/http://www.energy.eu/renewables/eu-charts/chart4.html| archivedate= 20 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of total use in Austria, with the rest being produced by [[Natural gas|gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] powerplants.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Austria}}
[[File:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|A painting by [[Canaletto]] of [[Vienna]] during the first half of the 18th century]]

Austria's population estimate in April 2011 was 8,414,638.&lt;ref name=&quot;Population&quot; /&gt; The population of the capital, [[Vienna]], exceeds 1.7&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name=&quot;Vienna pop&quot; /&gt; (2.2&amp;nbsp;million including the suburbs), representing about a quarter of the country's population. It is known for its vast cultural offerings and high standard of living.

Vienna is by far the country's largest city. [[Graz]] is second in size, with 250,099 inhabitants, followed by [[Linz]] (188,968), [[Salzburg]] (150,000), and [[Innsbruck]] (117,346). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

According to [[Eurostat]], in 2010 there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in the Austria, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population. Of these, 764 000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and  512 000 (6.1%) were born in another EU Member State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, Statistik Austria official estimates have shown that 81% or 6.75 million residents &lt;ref name=&quot;medienservicestelle.at&quot;/&gt; had no migration background and more than 19% or 1.6 million inhabitants&lt;ref name=&quot;medienservicestelle.at&quot;/&gt; had at least one or more parents of migration background. There are more than 415 000 descendants of foreign born immigrants&lt;ref name=&quot;medienservicestelle.at&quot;/&gt; residing in Austria, the great majority of whom have been naturalized.

350,000-400,000 [[Turkish people|Turks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=BBC|title=Turkey's ambassador to Austria prompts immigration spat|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11725311|accessdate=2010-11-10|work=BBC News|date=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including a minority of Turkish [[Kurds]]) compose 4% of the total population, and make up today the biggest single ethnic minority in Austria.
13,000 Turks were naturalized in 2003 and an unknown number have arrived in Austria at the same time. While 2,000 Turks left Austria in the same year, 10,000 immigrated to the country, confirming a strong trend of growth.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2593717.stm]

===Language===
[[German language|German]] is Austria's official language and is spoken natively by 88.6% of the population—followed by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (2.3%), [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (2.2%), [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (1.6%), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (0.5%), [[Polish language|Polish]] (0.5%)and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] (0.4%) .&lt;ref name=&quot;Language&quot; /&gt;

The official German used in education, publications, announcements and websites is [[Austrian German]], which is mostly identical to the German used in Germany but with some vocabulary differences. Many local dialects are spoken in Austria, and though their base is Austrian German it´s often hard to understand. 

The Austrian federal states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] are home to a significant indigenous [[Carinthian Slovenes|Slovene-speaking minority]] while in the easternmost state, [[Burgenland]] (formerly part of the Hungarian portion of [[Austria–Hungary]]), there are significant [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]- and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]-speaking minorities. Of the remaining [[number]] of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] nations. So-called [[foreign worker|guest workers]] ''(Gastarbeiter)'' and their descendants, as well as refugees from the [[Yugoslav wars]] and other conflicts, also form an important [[minority group]] in Austria. Since 1994 the [[Romani people|Roma]]–[[Sinti]] (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.

According to [[census]] information published by [[Statistik Austria]] for 2001&lt;ref name=&quot;Language&quot; /&gt; there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria. Of these, the largest by far are 283,334 foreign nationals from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] (of whom 135,376 speak Serbian; 105,487 Croatian; 31,551 Bosnian – i.e. basically there are altogether 272,414 Austrian resident native speakers of what was officially called [[Serbo-Croatian]] until the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and is still considered as a single language by linguists the world over – plus 6,902 Slovenian and 4,018 Macedonian speakers).

The second largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the [[Turkish people|Turks]] (including minority of [[Kurds]]) with a number of 200,000 to 300,000 who currently live in Austria.

The next largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the  124,392 who speak German as their [[First language|mother tongue]] even though they hail from outside of Austria (mainly immigrants from Germany, some from Switzerland, [[South Tyrol]] in Italy, [[Germans in Romania|Romania]], or the [[Germans in Russia|former Soviet Union]]); 123,417; English; 24,446 Albanian; 17,899 Polish; 14,699 Hungarian; 12,216 Romanian; 10,000 Malayali; 7,982 Arabic; 6,891 Slovak; 6,707 Czech; 5,916 Persian; 5,677 Italian; 5,466 Russian; 5,213 French; 4,938 Chinese; 4,264 Spanish; 3,503 Bulgarian. The populations of the rest fall off sharply below 3,000.

As of 2006, some of the Austrian states introduced standardised tests for new citizens, to assure their language ability, cultural knowledge and accordingly their ability to integrate into the Austrian society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.at/verwaltung/personenwesen/staatsbuergerschaft/allgem.html Requirements to become an Austrian citizen], provided by the Viennese state government {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the national rules, see [[Austrian nationality law#Naturalization as an Austrian citizen|Austrian nationality law – Naturalisation]].

An estimated 13,000 to 40,000 [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (the [[Carinthian Slovenes]]) as well as [[Croats]] (around 30,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110706090820/http://www.croates.at/haupt/gesch_fr.htm |title=HKDC Geschichte – Frame |publisher=Croates.at |accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungarians]] in Burgenland were recognised as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty ({{lang|de|''Staatsvertrag''}}) of 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson 153&quot; /&gt; The Slovenes in the Austrian state of [[Styria (state)|Styria]] (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognised as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the State Treaty of 27 July 1955 states otherwise.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene- and Croat-Austrians live alongside the German speaking population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented. Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two [[World war|World Wars]] and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, [[Jörg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.

Another interesting phenomenon is the so-called &quot;Windischen-Theorie&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Windischen-Theorie]]&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the &quot;loyal Windische&quot; and the &quot;national Slovenes&quot;, was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.

At the end of the 20th century, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Roman Catholic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Census 2001: Population 2001 according to religious affiliation and nationality|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_religionsbekenntnis_und_staatsangehoerigkeit_022894.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2007|language=German|publisher=Statistik Austria|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071114090849/http://www.statistik.at/web_de/static/bevoelkerung_2001_nach_religionsbekenntnis_und_staatsangehoerigkeit_022894.pdf| archivedate= 14 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while about 5% considered themselves [[Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot; /&gt; Austrian Christians are obliged to pay a mandatory membership fee (calculated by income—about 1%) to their church; this payment is called &quot;Kirchenbeitrag&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical/Church contribution&quot;).

Since the second half of the 20th century, the number of adherents and churchgoers has declined. Data for the end of 2005 from the Austrian Roman Catholic church lists 5,662,782 members, or 68.5% of the total Austrian population, and a Sunday church attendance of 753,701 or 9% of the total Austrian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Kirchliche Statistik der Diozösen Österreichs (Katholiken, Pastoraldaten) für das Jahr 2005 | url=http://www.katholisch.at/site/article_blank.siteswift?so=all&amp;do=all&amp;c=download&amp;d=article%3A107%3A5 | accessdate= 21 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data for the end of 2008 published by the Austrian Roman Catholic church shows a further reduction to 5,579,493 members or 66.8% of the total Austrian population, and a Sunday church attendance of 698,527 or 8% of the total Austrian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Kirchliche Statistik der Diozösen Österreichs (Katholiken, Pastoraldaten) für das Jahr 2008 | url=http://www.katholisch.at/site/article_blank.siteswift?so=all&amp;do=all&amp;c=download&amp;d=article%3A107%3A9 | accessdate= 1 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran church also recorded a loss of 47904 adherents between 2001 and 2008. As of January 2010 the percentage of Catholics in Austria declined to 64.8%.

About 12% of the population declared that they have [[irreligion|no religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot; /&gt; in 2001. Of the remaining people, around 340,000 are registered as members of various Muslim communities, mainly due to the influx from [[Turkey]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot; /&gt; About 180,000 are members of [[Orthodox Church]]es (mostly [[Serbs]]), about 21,000 people are active [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/statistics/worldwide_report.htm Statistics: 2010 Report of Jehovah's Witnesses Worldwide].&lt;/ref&gt; and about 8,100 are [[Judaism|Jewish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung&quot; /&gt;

While northern and central Germany was the origin of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Austria and Bavaria were the heart of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the absolute monarchy of [[Habsburg]] imposed a strict regime to restore Catholicism's power and influence among Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 16&lt;/ref&gt; The Habsburgs for a long time viewed themselves as the vanguard of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and all other confessions and religions were repressed.

In 1775, Maria Theresa gave official permission to the [[Mechitarists|Mechistarist]] Congregation of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] to settle in the Habsburg Empire.

In 1781, in the era of Austrian enlightenment, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] issued a Patent of Tolerance for Austria that allowed other confessions a limited [[freedom of religion|freedom of worship]]. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right in Cisleithania after the Austro-Hungarian ''[[Ausgleich]]'' in 1867 thus paying tribute to the fact that the monarchy was home of numerous religions beside Roman Catholicism such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian [[Orthodox Christians]] (Austria neighboured the [[Ottoman Empire]] for centuries), [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Jews. In 1912, after the annexation of [[Bosnia Hercegovina]] in 1908, [[Islam]] was officially recognised in Austria.

Austria remained largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918, First Republic Catholic leaders such as [[Theodor Innitzer]] and [[Ignaz Seipel]] took leading positions within or close to Austria's government and increased their influence during the time of the [[Austrofascism]]; Catholicism was treated much like a [[state religion]] by [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Although Catholic (and Protestant) leaders initially welcomed the Germans in 1938 during the [[Anschluss]] of Austria into [[Germany]], Austrian Catholicism stopped its support {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}of [[Nazism]] later on and many {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} former religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the [[Third Reich]]. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, a stricter [[secularism]] was imposed in Austria, and religious influence on politics declined.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Austria}}

[[File:Melk Stift Altstadt.jpg|thumb|[[Stiftsgymnasium Melk]] is the oldest Austrian school]]
Education in Austria is entrusted partly to the [[States of Austria|Austrian states]] (Bundesländer) and partly to the federal government. School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.

[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.

[[Primary education]], or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The so-called &quot;[[The three Rs|3Rs]]&quot;(Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].

Standard attendance times are 8&amp;nbsp;am to 12&amp;nbsp;pm or 1&amp;nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.

As in Germany, [[secondary education]] consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; [[HBLA]] = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning [[English language|English]] has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.

[[File:Universität Vienna June 2006 164.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]
As at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&amp;nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report (&quot;Zeugnis&quot;) are a prerequisite for moving up (&quot;aufsteigen&quot;) to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year (&quot;sitzenbleiben&quot;).

It is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (slightly more emphasis on arts) or &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.

The Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as [[Medicine]]. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee (&quot;''Studienbeitrag''&quot;) of €363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|work=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around €363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about €5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of €17 is charged for the student union and insurance.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Austria}}
[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791)]]

Austria's past as a European power and its cultural environment have generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria has been the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]].  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], though one that was culturally closely connected to Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.

[[File:WSO-Interior.JPG|thumb|left|World famous [[Vienna State Opera]]]]

Vienna has long been especially an important centre of musical innovation. 18th and 19th century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of [[classical music]]. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.

Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural center in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments including the [[lute]]. [[Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the traditional Austrian anthem by Joseph Haydn.

Austria has also produced one notable jazz musician, keyboardist [[Josef Zawinul]], who helped pioneer electronic influences in jazz as well as being a notable composer in his own right. The [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]]ian [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was internationally acclaimed during the 1980s, especially for his song &quot;[[Rock Me Amadeus]]&quot; dedicated to Mozart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070113183109/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/falco/bio.jhtml|title=Falco|year=2007|work=VH1|accessdate=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drummer [[Thomas Lang]] was born in Vienna in 1967 and is now world renowned for his technical ability, having played with artists such as [[Geri Halliwell]] and [[Robbie Williams]].

Among Austrian Artists and architects one can find the painters [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Hans Makart]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Carl Moll]], and [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], the photographers [[Inge Morath]] and [[Ernst Haas]], and architects like [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], [[Otto Wagner]], [[Adolf Loos]], and [[Hans Hollein]] (recipient of the 1985 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]]).

===Cinema and theatre===
Austrian contributions to the worlds of film and theatre have traditionally been strong. [[Sascha Kolowrat]] was an Austrian pioneer of filmmaking. [[Billy Wilder]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Josef von Sternberg]], and [[Fred Zinnemann]] originally came from Austria before establishing themselves as internationally relevant movie makers. [[Willi Forst]], [[Ernst Marischka]], or [[Franz Antel]] enriched the popular cinema in German language speaking countries. [[Michael Haneke]] became internationally known for his disturbing cinematic studies, before receiving a [[Golden Globe]] for his critically acclaimed film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' in 2010.

The first Austrian film director receiving an [[Academy Award]] was [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]]. Many Austrian actors were able to pursue a career, the impact of which was sensed beyond national borders. Among them were [[Peter Lorre]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Curd Jürgens]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Oskar Werner]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]. [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became American as well as international movie stars. The latter also became the 38th Governor of California. [[Christoph Waltz]] rose to international fame with his performance in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', earning the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]] at [[Cannes]] in 2009, and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 2010. [[Max Reinhardt]] was a master of spectacular and astute theater productions. [[Otto Schenk]] not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.

===Science and philosophy===

{{Further|Austrian School|Vienna circle|List of Austrian scientists}}

Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputation. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the 19th century. In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].

In addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.

{{Austrians}}
A focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th century [[Vienna School of Medicine]]. Austria was home to psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]] and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].

The [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born émigrés include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].

===Literature===
{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}

Complementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].

Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].

===Food and beverages===
{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}
[[File:Einspaenner.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An Einspaenner Coffee: a Viennese specialty. It is a strong black coffee served in a glass topped with whipped cream. [[Powdered sugar]] is served separately.]]

Austria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (&quot;Hofküche&quot;) delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the &quot;Mehlspeisen&quot; Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, &quot;Krapfen&quot; which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and &quot;Strudel&quot; such as &quot;[[Apfelstrudel]]&quot; filled with apple, &quot;Topfenstrudel&quot; filled with a type of cheese curd called &quot;topfen&quot;, and &quot;[[Millirahmstrudel]]&quot; (milk-cream strudel).

In addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Bohemia [[Czech republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Balkan]] and [[France|French]] cuisine, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.

Typical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], [[Schweinsbraten]], [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Knödel]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also Kärntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The &quot;Eierschwammerl&quot;, also known as &quot;Pfifferling&quot;, are native yellow, tan mushrooms. The candy [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner]]schnitten. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition.

[[Beer]] is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Krügerl'' or ''großes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures. At festivals one litre ''Maß'' and two litre ''Doppelmaß'' in the [[Bavaria]]n style are also dispensed. The most popular types of beer are [[lager]] (known as ''Märzen'' in Austria), naturally cloudy ''Zwicklbier'' and [[wheat beer]]. At holidays like Christmas and Easter [[bock]] beer is also available.

The most important wine-producing areas are in [[Lower Austria]], [[Burgenland]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]] and Vienna. The [[Grüner Veltliner]] grape provides some of Austria's most notable white wines and [[Zweigelt]] is the most widely planted red wine grape.

In [[Upper Austria]], Lower Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], ''Most'', a type of [[cider]] or [[perry]] is widely produced.

[[Schnapps]] of typically up to 60% alcohol or fruit [[brandy]] is drunk, which in Austria is made from a variety of fruits, for example [[apricot]]s and [[rowan]]berries. The produce of small private schnapps [[distillery|distilleries]], of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as ''Selbstgebrannter'' or ''Hausbrand''.

===Sports===
{{Hatnote|Main article: [[Sport in Austria]]}}
[[File:EM-Stadion Wals-Siezenheim zur Euro.jpg|thumb|right|Salzburg Stadium, Home of the FC RB Salzburg]]

Due to the mountainous terrain, [[alpine skiing]] is a prominent sport in Austria. Similar sports such as [[snowboarding]] or [[ski-jumping]] are also widely popular and Austrian athletes such as [[Annemarie Moser-Pröll]], [[Franz Klammer]], [[Hermann Maier]], [[Toni Sailer]], [[Benjamin Raich]] and [[Marlies Schild]] are widely regarded as some of the greatest alpine skiers of all time.

A popular [[team sport]] in Austria is [[Association football|football]], which is governed by the [[Austrian Football Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Football&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oefb.at/|title=Österreichischer Fußballbund|year=2009|work=ÖFB|language=German|accessdate=17 June 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090628120811/http://www.oefb.at/| archivedate= 28 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria was among the most successful football playing nations on the European continent placing 4th at the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], 3rd at the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] and 7th at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. However, recently Austrian football has been much less internationally successful in this discipline. It also co-hosted the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].

Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[Österreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for [[basketball]]. [[Bobsleigh]], [[luge]], and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] are also popular events with a permanent track located in [[Igls bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Igls]], which hosted bobsleigh and luge competitions for the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Innsbruck]]. The [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|first Winter Youth Olympics]] in 2012 were held in Innsbruck as well.
Horseback riding is popular also. The famed Spanish Riding School of Vienna is located in Vienna.
