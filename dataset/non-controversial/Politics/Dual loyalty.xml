In [[politics]], '''dual loyalty''' is loyalty to two separate interests that potentially conflict with each other.

==Inherently controversial==
While nearly all examples of alleged &quot;dual loyalty&quot; are considered highly controversial, these examples point to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between what constitutes a &quot;danger&quot; of dual loyalty – i.e., that there exists a pair of ''misaligned'' interests – versus what might be more simply a pair of ''partially aligned'' or even, according to the party being accused, a pair of ''fully aligned'' interests. For example, immigrants who still have feelings of loyalty to their country of origin will often insist that their two (or more) loyalties do not conflict. As Stanley A. Renshon at The Center for Immigration Studies notes,
{{quote|Lan Samantha Chang (1999), a novelist writing in response to the Wen Ho Lee case, could say in a New York Times op-ed piece entitled ''Debunking the Dual Loyalty Myth'', &quot;True, many immigrants have strong ties to their countries of birth...But cultural or familial loyalties are on a different level from political allegiances...I love China, but I am a citizen of the United States.&quot; Ms. Chang appears to want to distinguish a love for one's &quot;home&quot; country from being willing to commit treason against one's adopted one. This is obviously a fair, reasonable, and appropriate distinction.

Yet, in the process of making such a distinction, she acknowledges the duality of her feelings. The issue is not between love of one's country of origin and treason, but rather the multiple loyalties that appear to be part of many immigrants' psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Renshon|Stanley A. Renshon]]. &quot;[http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/paper20/renshon1812.html Dual Citizenship and Conflict: The War of 1812 Redux?]&quot; Center for Immigration Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Transnationalist interpretations===
Some scholars refer to a growing trend of [[transnationalism]] and suggest that as societies become more [[heterogeneous]] and [[multi-cultural]], the term &quot;dual loyalty&quot; increasingly becomes a meaningless [[Bromide (language)|bromide]]. According to the theory of transnationalism, migration (as well as other factors including improved global communication) produces new forms of identity that transcend traditional notions of physical and cultural space. Nina Glick Schiller, Linda Basch, and Cristina Blanc-Szanton define a process by which immigrants &quot;link together&quot; their country of origin and their country of settlement.

The transnationalist view is that &quot;dual loyalty&quot; is a potentially ''positive'' expression of multi-culturalism, and can contribute to the diversity and strength of civil society. While this view is popular in many academic circles, others are skeptical of this idea. As one paper describes it,
{{quote|''On occasion, these imagined communities conform to the root meaning of transnational, extending beyond loyalties that connect to any specific place of origin or ethnic or national group. Yet what immigration scholars describe as transnationalism is usually its opposite... highly particularistic attachments antithetical to those by-products of globalization denoted by the concept of &quot;transnational civil society&quot; and its related manifestations.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.soc.unitn.it:8080/poloeuropeo/content/e64/e385/e393/waldinger.fitzgerald.2004_ita.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beyond its usage in particular instances, the term &quot;dual loyalty&quot; versus &quot;transnationalism&quot; continues to be the subject of much debate. As one academic writes:
{{quote|''Although the events of September 11th may have shaken some assumptions – at least in the United States – about the nature of transnational networks and their capacity to facilitate flows of people, goods, and ideas across borders, the terms &quot;globalization&quot; and &quot;transnationalism&quot; remain relatively stable, albeit frustratingly imprecise additions to the language of social sciences, including anthropology.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~sewagner/johannesburg.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical accusations==
Other historical examples of actual or perceived &quot;dual loyalty&quot; include the following:
* During [[World War II]], a number of [[United States]] citizens of [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[German people|German]], and [[Italian people|Italian]] [[ancestry]], including some born in the U.S., were confined to [[internment]] camps. (''See: [[Japanese internment in the United States]]'')
* [[Roman Catholic]]s are subject to the [[Pope]] on religious matters. This has often perceived as dual loyalty by powers opposed to the [[Holy See]].
** During the [[English Reformation]], many important English and Scottish figures, such as [[Thomas More]], [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[Edmund Campion]], were tried and executed for their alleged double loyalty to the Papacy and infidelity to the Crown.
** During the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 19th-century France, citizens were routinely divided between ''clericals'' and ''anticlericals'' because of long-lasting loyalty related conflicts between the French secularist government and the Holy See.
** During [[John F. Kennedy]]'s campaign for and brief tenure as [[U.S. President]], some opponents questioned whether a [[Roman Catholic]] President of the United States had a divided loyalty with respect to the [[Papacy]] and [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnfkennedy/biography/theamericanfranchise.common.shtml AmericanPresident.org article on John F. Kennedy]&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[Roman Catholicism in China|Chinese Catholics]] have been forced by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] to substitute the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in China by the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]].
* [[Jewish people|Jews]] in the [[Jewish Diaspora]] have been accused of dual loyalty by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century, by the [[French people|French]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]] in the late 19th century, in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin-era]] [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakim&quot;&gt;[[Leonard P.

* The loyalty of many Americans to the U.S. government was called into question during the [[Cold War]] due to alleged [[Communist]] sympathies, resulting in &quot;witch-hunts&quot; of various government officials, celebrities and other citizens. (''See: [[McCarthyism]]'')
* Muslims living in [[Western world|Western]] countries, especially during periods of heightened tensions, such as after [[9/11|September 11, 2001]], or during the [[Danish Cartoons|Danish Cartoon Controversy]] of 2005–2006, are sometimes accused of being more loyal to the Muslim [[ummah]] than to their country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.org/articles/2003/back603.html Postscript 9/11 Media Coverage of Terrorism and Immigration], Center for Immigration Studies, April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Dual loyalty&quot; continues to be a concern of critics of the U.S.'s immigration policy, particularly in those states which border [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Chavez]], &quot;[http://texnews.com/1998/opinion/chavez0408.html Mexican law to challenge loyalties],&quot; ''Abilene Texas News'', April 8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hindu]] minority in [[Muslim]]-majority [[Bangladesh]] has often been accused of dual loyalty to neighboring [[India]] by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party&lt;ref name=&quot;USCIRF&quot;&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/nov/02aziz.htm Bangladesh slammed for persecution of Hindus], ''Rediff.com''&lt;/ref&gt; and even by [[Sheikh Hasina]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2000/2/2000-2-07.shtml A Bleak Future for Bangladesh Hindu's], ''hinduismtoday.com''&lt;/ref&gt; who heads the largest [[Awami League|political outfit]] in Bangladesh hailing [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF13.htm The Hindu Minority in Bangladesh: Legally Identified Enemies], ''Human Rights Documentation Centre''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] has sometimes been accused of dual loyalty to Africa, that as they were vociferous in their criticisms of nations such as [[Israel]] and apartheid [[South Africa]], the CBC stayed largely silent about the numerous human rights abuses of black African dictators.
* The government of [[Iran]] accuses the [[Bahá'í]] minority of having loyalty to foreign powers (see [[Iranian anti-Bahá'í conspiracy theories]]).
