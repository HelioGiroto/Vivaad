      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20350">'''Judicial activism''' describes [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings suspected of being based on personal or political considerations rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cwolfe&quot;&gt;Christopher Wolfe, ''Judicial activism'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, ISBN 0-8476-8531-4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}  The definition of judicial activism, and which specific decisions are activist, is a controversial political issue, particularly in the [[Politics of the United States|United States]].  This phrase is generally traced back to a comment by [[Thomas Jefferson]], referring to the &quot;despotic behaviour&quot; of [[Federalist]] federal judges, in particular, [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=qWlMgSqhRv4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=%22despotic+branch%22+jefferson+adams&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kjs0wYo4d1&amp;sig=IBv5ditYQw7_M0vY1Ul48cpcquM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=027uTqLzHcjc0QGE-rXQCQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22despotic%20branch%22%20jefferson%20adams&amp;f=false Haines &amp; Sherwood, ''The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government and Politics: 1789–1835'', 1944, p.209]&lt;/ref&gt; The question of judicial activism is closely related to [[Constitutional law|constitutional interpretation]], [[statutory construction]], and [[separation of powers]].

==Origins of the term==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term &quot;judicial activism&quot; in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled &quot;The Supreme Court: 1947&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kmiec|first=Keenan D.|title=The Origin and Current Meanings of 'Judicial Activism'|journal=Cal. L. Rev.|year=2004|volume=92|pages=1441, 1447|quote=Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the 'Judicial Activists' and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the 'Champions of Self Restraint.' Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, &quot;An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism,&quot; is highly critical of Schlesinger's use of the term. &quot;Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=roger_craig_green &quot;An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism&quot;] Craig Green, August 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines judicial activism as a &quot;philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in &quot;Takings Clause Jurisprudence: Muddled, Perhaps; Judicial Activism, No&quot; DF O'Scannlain, ''Geo. JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley C. Canon – &quot;Defining the Dimensions of Judicial Activism,&quot; ''Judicature'', 66.6, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|239}} majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. [[David Strauss]] has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning [[case law|judicial precedent]], and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.web.archive.org/20090103124608/http://www.wbez.org/audio_library/od_rasep05.asp#13 Interpreting the Constitution] Chicago Public Radio – Odyssey, September 13, 2005, archived on January 3, 2009 from [http://www.wbez.org/audio_library/od_rasep05.asp#13 the original]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. [[Kermit Roosevelt III]] has argued that &quot;in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with&quot;&lt;ref name=roosevelt&gt;Kermit Roosevelt, III, ''The Myth of Judicial Activism: Making Sense of Supreme Court Decisions'', Yale University Press, 2008, ISBN 0-300-12691-3, ISBN 978-0-300-12691-4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}}; likewise, the [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] under [[George W. Bush]], [[Theodore Olson]], said in an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', in regards to [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated]], that &quot;most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage|title=Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage|work=Fox News Sunday|first=Chris|last=Wallace|first2=Theodore|last2=Olson|date=August 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Others such as current Supreme Court Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] have scolded this approach as unhelpful because it relies on subjective judgments.&lt;ref name=&quot;flewis&quot;&gt;Frederick P. Lewis, ''The context of judicial activism: the endurance of the Warren Court legacy in a conservative age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 1999, ISBN 0-8476-8992-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Sedensky, &quot;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 Justice questions way court nominees are grilled],&quot; Associated Press, May 14, 2010, accessed May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==

Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''; [http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html Romer, ''Governor of Colorado, et al. v. Evans et al.'' (94-1039), 517 U.S. 620 (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of [[judicial review]], and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.  

A third view is that so-called &quot;objective&quot; interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, &quot;Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Z. Tamanaha, ''Beyond the Formalist-Realist Divide: The Role of Politics in Judging'', Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.
