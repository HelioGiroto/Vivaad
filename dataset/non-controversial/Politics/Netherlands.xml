Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction, lowering the surface by several meters. Even in flooded areas peat extraction continued through turf dredging. From the late 16th century [[land reclamation]] started and large [[polder]] areas are now preserved through elaborate drainage systems with [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Much of the Netherlands is formed by the [[estuary]] of three important European rivers, which together with their [[distributary|distributaries]] form the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].  Most of the country is very flat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast and several low hill ranges in the central parts.

The Netherlands was one of the first countries to have an elected parliament. Among other affiliations, the country is a founding member of the EU, [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]. Netherlands has the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|ninth-highest]] per capita income in the world. With Belgium and [[Luxembourg]] it forms the [[Benelux]] economic union.  The country is host to the [[Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] and five international courts: the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]], the [[International Criminal Court]] and the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]].  The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU's criminal intelligence agency [[Europol]] and judicial co-operation agency [[Eurojust]].  This has led to the city being dubbed &quot;the world's legal capital&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = van Krieken|first = Peter J.|coauthors = David McKay|title = The Hague: Legal Capital of the World|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2005|isbn = 90-6704-185-8}}, specifically, ''&quot;In the 1990s, during his term as United Nations Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali started calling The Hague the world's legal capital.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking 13th of 157 countries according to the [[Index of Economic Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080823212557/http://www.heritage.org/Index/country.cfm?id=Netherlands Netherlands], [[Index of Economic Freedom]]. heritage.org&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the Netherlands was ranked as the &quot;happiest&quot; country according to results published by the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchofficespace.com/blog/blog/where-is-the-happiest-place-on-earth/ |title=Where is the happiest place on Earth? &amp;#124; The Search Office Space Blog &amp;#124; Searchofficespace |publisher=News.searchofficespace.com |date=25 May 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation is well known for its liberal stance on many issues, with a long tradition of social tolerance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the Netherlands region was part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day [[Belgium]], Luxembourg, and some land in France and Germany.

The [[Eighty Years' War]] between the provinces and Spain began in 1568.  In 1579, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces formed the [[Union of Utrecht]], a treaty in which they promised to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army.&lt;ref&gt;Motley, John Lothrop  (1855). [http://books.google.com/books?id=8isNLCXfNycC&amp;pg=PA411 ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic''] Vol. III, Harper Bros.: New York, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands. In 1581 the northern provinces adopted the [[Act of Abjuration]], the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed [[Philip II of Spain]] as reigning monarch in the northern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Motley, John Lothrop  (1855).

Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] sympathised with the Dutch struggle against the Spanish, and in 1585 she concluded a treaty with the Dutch whereby she promised to send an English army to the Netherlands to aid the Dutch in their war with the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Willson, David Harris (1972). ''History of England'', Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston: New York, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1585, 7,600 soldiers were sent to the Netherlands from England under the command of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]].

Although Robert Dudley returned to the Netherlands in November 1586 with another army, the army still had little effect in the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Mattingly, ''The Armada'' (Houghton Mifflin: Boston, 1959) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip II, the son of Charles V, was not prepared to let them go easily, and war continued until 1648, when Spain under King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] finally recognised the independence of the seven northwestern provinces in the [[Peace of Münster]].  Parts of the southern provinces became ''de facto'' colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire.

===Dutch Republic 1581–1795===
{{Main|Dutch Republic}}
After independence, the provinces of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Overijssel]], and [[Gelderland]] formed a [[confederation]] known as the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]].  All these provinces were autonomous and had their own government, the &quot;States of the Province&quot;. The [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]], the confederal government, were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces.  The sparsely populated region of [[Drenthe]], mainly consisting of poor [[peat]]land, was part of the republic too, although Drenthe was not considered one of the provinces; it had its own States, but the [[landdrost]] of Drenthe was appointed by the States-General. Moreover, the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years' War a number of so-called [[Generality Lands]] (''Generaliteitslanden'' in Dutch).  These territories were governed directly by the States-General. They did not have a governmental structure of their own and did not have representatives in the States-General.  Their population was mainly Roman Catholic, and these areas were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the [[Southern Netherlands]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The [[Dutch Empire]] grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers of the 17th century.  In the [[Dutch Golden Age]] (&quot;Gouden Eeuw&quot;), colonies and [[trading post]]s were established all over the world.  Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of [[New Amsterdam]], on the southern part of [[Manhattan]] in 1614. In South Africa, the Dutch settled the [[Cape Colony]] in 1652. By 1650, the Dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display_printable.cfm?HHID=682 The Middle Colonies: New York]&quot;. Digital History.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, the Dutch population increased from an estimated 1.5&amp;nbsp;million to almost 2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;The preponderance of the Dutch population lived in two provinces, Holland and Zeeland. This area experienced a population explosion between 1500 and 1650, with a growth from 350,000 to 1,000,000 inhabitants. Thereafter the growth leveled off, so that the population of the whole country remained at the 2&amp;nbsp;million level throughout the 18th century; De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world. In early modern Europe it featured the wealthiest trading city ([[Amsterdam]]) and the first full-time [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle, the world's first asset-inflation bubble, the [[tulip mania]] of 1636–1637, and, according to Murray Sayle, the world's first [[bear raid]]er, [[Isaac le Maire]], who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n07/murray-sayle/japan-goes-dutch|title=Japan Goes Dutch|journal=London Review of Books|date=5 April 2001|author=Murray Sayle|volume=23|issue=7|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The republic went into a state of general decline in the later 18th century, with economic competition from England and long standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the ''Staatsgezinden'' (Republicans) and the ''Prinsgezinden'' (Royalists or Orangists) as main factors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the 17th century, [[plantation]] colonies were established by the Dutch and English along the many rivers in the fertile [[Guyana]] plains. The earliest documented colony in [[Suriname|Guiana]] was along the [[Suriname River]] and called Marshall's Creek. The area was named after an Englishman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|accessdate=4 May 2008 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=paQMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA253|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of ARTS, SCIENCES, and General LITERATURE, Volume XI |edition=Ninth Edition—Popular Reprint |quote=In 1614 the states of Holland granted to any Dutch citizen a four years' monopoly of any harbour or place of commerce which he might discover in that region (Guiana).

In 1667, the Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of Suriname conquered from the English, resulting from the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]].

===French domination 1795–1814===
{{Further2|[[Batavian Republic]]|[[Kingdom of Holland]]}}

On 19 January 1795, one day after [[stadtholder]] [[William V of Orange]] fled to England, the ''Bataafse Republiek'' ([[Batavian Republic]]) was proclaimed, rendering the Netherlands a [[unitary state]]. From 1795 to 1806, the Batavian Republic designated the Netherlands as a republic modelled after the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].

From 1806 to 1810, the ''Koninkrijk Holland'' ([[Kingdom of Holland]]) was set up by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] in order to control the Netherlands more effectively. The name of the leading province, Holland, was used for the whole country. The Kingdom of Holland covered the area of the present day Netherlands, with the exception of Limburg and parts of Zeeland, which were French territory. In 1807, Prussian [[East Frisia]] and [[Jever]] were added to the kingdom. In 1809, however, after a [[Walcheren Campaign|failed British invasion]], Holland had to give over all territories south of the [[Rhine]] to France.

King Louis Bonaparte did not meet Napoleon's expectations – he tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, allowed trade with the British in spite of the [[Continental System]] and even tried to learn Dutch – and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. He was succeeded by his five-year-old son [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte]]. Napoleon Louis reigned as Louis II for just ten days as Napoleon ignored his young nephew’s accession to the throne. The Emperor sent in an army to invade the country and dissolved the Kingdom of Holland. The Netherlands then became part of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]].

The Netherlands remained part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] and forced to withdraw his troops from the country.

===Kingdom of the Netherlands 1815–1940===
{{Main|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands}}
[[William I of the Netherlands]], son of the last stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V van Oranje]], returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and became Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands. On 16 March 1815, the Sovereign Prince became King of the Netherlands.

In 1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] formed the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] by expanding the Netherlands with [[Belgium]] in order to create a strong country on the northern border of France. In addition, William became hereditary [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg|Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. The Congress of Vienna gave Luxembourg to William as personal property in exchange for his German possessions, [[Nassau-Dillenburg]], [[Siegen]], [[Hadamar]], and [[Diez, Germany|Diez]].

Belgium rebelled and gained independence in 1830, while the [[personal union]] between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890, when [[King William III of the Netherlands]] died with no surviving male heirs. [[Salic Law|Ascendancy laws]] prevented his daughter [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] from becoming the next Grand Duchess. Therefore the throne of Luxembourg passed over from the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] to the [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]], a junior branch of the [[House of Nassau]].

The largest Dutch settlement abroad was the [[Cape Colony]]. It was established by [[Jan van Riebeeck]] on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]] at [[Cape Town]] ({{lang-nl|Kaapstad}}) in 1652. The Prince of Orange acquiesced to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] occupation and control of the Cape Colony in 1788. The Netherlands also possessed several other colonies, but Dutch settlement in these lands was limited. Most notable were the vast [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and the [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Colony of Surinam]] (now [[Suriname]]). These 'colonies' were first administered by the Dutch East India Company and the [[Dutch West India Company]], both collective private enterprises. Three centuries later these companies got into financial trouble, and the territories in which they operated were taken over by the Dutch government (in 1815 and 1791 respectively). Only then did they become official colonies.

During its colonial period the Netherlands was heavily involved in the [[slave trade]]. The Dutch [[plantation|planters]] relied heavily on [[African slaves]] to cultivate the coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Treatment of the slaves by their owners was notoriously bad, and many slaves escaped the plantations. Slavery was abolished by the Netherlands in [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Guiana]] and [[Curaçao and Dependencies]] in 1863, but the slaves were not fully released until 1873, after a mandatory 10 year transition period during which time they were required to work on the plantations for minimal pay and without state sanctioned torture. As soon as they became truly free, the slaves largely abandoned the plantations where they had suffered for several generations in favor of the city [[Paramaribo]]. Every year this is remembered during [[Keti Koti]], 1 July, Emancipation Day (end of slavery).

During the 19th century, the Netherlands was slow to industrialize compared to neighbouring countries, mainly because of the great complexity involved in modernizing the infrastructure, consisting largely of waterways, and the great reliance its industry had on windpower.

Although the Netherlands remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during [[World War I]], it was heavily involved in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbenhuis%252C%2520Maartje%2520M%25202006&quot;&gt;Abbenhuis, Maartje M.

Amsterdam University Press, 2006 ISBN 90-5356-818-2.&lt;/ref&gt; German general [[Alfred von Schlieffen|Count Schlieffen]], who was Chief of the Imperial [[German General Staff]] had originally planned to invade the Netherlands while advancing into France in the original [[Schlieffen Plan]]. This was changed by Schlieffen's successor [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] in order to maintain Dutch neutrality. Later during the war Dutch neutrality proved essential to German survival until the blockade by Great Britain in 1916, when the import of goods through the Netherlands was no longer possible. However, the Dutch were able to continue to remain neutral during the war using their diplomacy and their ability to trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbenhuis%252C%2520Maartje%2520M%25202006&quot;/&gt;

===Second World War 1940–1945===
{{Main|History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)}}
[[File:Rotterdam.jpg|thumb|[[Rotterdam]] after German air raids in 1940.]]
The Netherlands intended to remain neutral during the [[Second World War]], although contingency plans involving the armies of Belgium, France and the United Kingdom were drawn up in case of German aggression. Despite this neutrality, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940 as part of their campaign against the Allied forces. French forces in the south and British ships in the west came to help but turned around quickly, evacuating many civilians and several thousand German prisoners of war from the German elite airborne divisions.

The country was overrun in five days. Only after (but not because of) the [[bombing of Rotterdam]], the main element of the Dutch army surrendered on 14 May 1940, although a Dutch and French force held the western part of Zeeland for some time after the surrender. The Kingdom as such, continued the war from the colonial empire; the [[government in exile]] resided in London.

During the [[Military occupation|occupation]], over 100,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20041207064440/http://www.kampwesterbork.nl/site1.2/English/KAMP/k08.html 93 trains]. kampwesterbork.nl&lt;/ref&gt; were rounded up to be transported to Nazi German [[concentration camp]]s in Germany, [[General Government|German-occupied Poland]] and German-occupied [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czechoslovakia]]. By the time these camps were liberated, only 876 Dutch Jews survived. Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in German factories, civilians were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers, and the countryside was plundered for food for German soldiers in the Netherlands and for shipment to Germany. Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans, as recounted in ''[[The Hiding Place (book)|The Hiding Place]]'' by [[Corrie ten Boom]] and ''The Heart Has Reasons'' by [[Mark Klempner]],&lt;ref&gt;Klempner, Mark.

Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and heir to the throne, sought refuge in [[Ottawa]], Canada, with her two daughters, Beatrix and Irene, during the war. During Princess Juliana’s stay in Canada, preparations were made for the birth of her third child. To ensure the Dutch citizenship of this royal baby, the Canadian Parliament passed a special law declaring Princess Juliana's suite at the Ottawa Civic Hospital “extraterritorial”.

===Recent history 1945–present===


After the war, the Dutch economy prospered by leaving behind an era of neutrality and gaining closer ties with neighbouring states. The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the [[Benelux]] ('''Be'''lgium, the '''Ne'''therlands and '''Lux'''embourg) grouping, was among the twelve founding members of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO), and was among the six founding members of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] ([[Common Market]]) and then the [[European Union]].

The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid ''[[pillarization|ontzuiling]]'' (literally: depillarisation), a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along class and religious lines. Youths, and students in particular, rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as [[women's rights]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[disarmament]] and [[environmental issues]].

Today, the Netherlands is regarded as a liberal country, considering [[drug policy of the Netherlands|its drug policy]] and its legalisation of [[euthanasia]]. On 1 April 2001, the Netherlands became the first nation to recognize [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|same-sex marriage]].

On 10 October 2010 the [[Netherlands Antilles]]—a former country of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in the [[Caribbean]]—was [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolved]]. Referendums were held on each island of the Netherlands Antilles between June 2000 and April 2005 to determine their future status. As a result the islands of [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]] (the BES islands) were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands. This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as ''[[special municipalities]]'' upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. The special municipalities are collectively known as the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].

==Geography of the European Netherlands==
[[File:Satellite image of the Netherlands in May 2000.jpg|thumb|Satellite overview of the Netherlands]]
{{Main|Geography of the Netherlands}}

The European area of the Netherlands lies between latitudes [[50th parallel north|50°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and longitudes [[3rd meridian east|3°]] and [[8th meridian east|8° E]].

The country is divided into two main parts by three large rivers, the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn'') and its main distributaries, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas''). These rivers functioned as a natural barrier between earlier [[fief]]doms and hence created traditionally a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognizable north and south of these &quot;Large Rivers&quot; (''de Grote Rivieren'').

The southwestern part of the Netherlands is a [[river delta]] and two tributaries of the [[Scheldt]] (''Westerschelde and Oosterschelde''). There is only one significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharging into the [[IJsselmeer]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). This river also forms a linguistic divide: people to the east of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).&lt;ref name=&quot;international2000&quot;&gt;Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000–2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|Storm tides of the North Sea}}

Over the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of human intervention and natural disasters. Most notable in terms of land loss is the 1134 storm, which created the [[archipelago]] of [[Zeeland]] in the southwest.

On 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed [[polder]], replacing it with the {{convert|72|km2|mi2|0|sing=on}} ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The [[North Sea flood of 1953|last major flood in the Netherlands]] took place in early February 1953, when a huge storm caused the collapse of several dikes in the southwest of the Netherlands. More than 1,800 people drowned in the ensuing inundations. The Dutch government subsequently decided on a large-scale program of public works (the &quot;[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]&quot;) to protect the country against future flooding. The project took more than thirty years to complete.

The disasters were partially increased in severity through human influence. People had drained relatively high lying swampland to use it as farmland. This drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to compress and the ground level to drop, whereby they would lower the water level to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to compress even more. Due to the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Duplessis. &quot;Transitions to Capitalism in Early Modern Europe.&quot; (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The flooding problem remains unsolvable to this day. Also, up until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further adding to the problem.
[[File:Netherlands, Zoetermeer, Zoetermeerse Meerpolder (1).JPG|thumb|A polder at 5.53 meter below sea level]]

To guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium AD, villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''&quot;[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]&quot;'' (English &quot;water bodies&quot;) or ''&quot;[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]&quot;'' (&quot;high home councils&quot;) started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods. (These agencies exist to this day, performing the same function.) As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century, [[windmill]]s had come into use in order to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polders]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

In 1932, the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (English &quot;Closure Dike&quot;) was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake). It became part of the larger [[Zuiderzee Works]] in which four polders totalling {{convert|2500|km2|mi2|0}} were reclaimed from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/gemeentes/gem533nh.htm|publisher=sdu.nl|title=Kerngegevens gemeente Wieringermeer|accessdate=21 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080106163025/http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/gemeentes/gem533nh.htm |archivedate = 6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/PROVINCIES/flevoland.htm|publisher=sdu.nl|title=Kerngegevens procincie Flevoland|accessdate=21 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071226115958/http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/PROVINCIES/flevoland.htm |archivedate = 26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from [[climate change]].

====Delta Works====
{{Main|Delta Works}}
[[File:Deltawerken na.png|thumb|The [[Delta Works]] are located in the provinces of [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].]]
After the [[North Sea Flood of 1953|1953 disaster]], the [[Delta Works]] were constructed, a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising {{convert|3000|km|mi|0|sp=us}} of outer sea-dykes and {{convert|10000|km|mi|0|sp=us}} of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea [[estuary|estuaries]] of the Zeeland province. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dyke reinforcements. The Delta project is one of the largest construction efforts in human history{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and is considered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] as one of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers#World Wonders|seven wonders of the modern world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asce.org/Content.aspx?id=2147487305 Seven Wonders].

===Climate===

The predominant wind direction in the Netherlands is southwest, which causes a moderate [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with cool summers and mild winters. This is especially the case with places within direct proximity of the Dutch coastline, which sometimes are over {{convert|10|C-change|0}} warmer (in winter) or cooler (in summer) than places in the (south)east of the country.

The following tables are based on mean measurements by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] weather station in [[De Bilt]] between 1981 and 2010:

Ice days (maximum temperature below 0 °C) usually occur from December until February, with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period. Freezing days (minimum temperature below 0 °C) occur much more often, usually ranging from mid November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid October and as late as mid May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be 10&amp;nbsp;cm. above ground instead of 150&amp;nbsp;cm., one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April, but can be measured in May or October too, however, unlike these data suggest, there hasn't neither been any snow in April nor in May for years.
[[File:Nijlânnermolen Workum.jpg|thumb|Friesland]]
Warm days (maximum temperature above 20 °C) in De Bilt are usually measured in the time span of April until October, but in some parts of the country such temperatures can also occur in March or even in November or February (this is usually not in De Bilt, however). Summer days (maximum temperature above 25 °C) are usually measured in De Bilt from May until September, tropical days (maximum temperature above 30 °C) are rare and usually occur only from June until August.

Precipitation throughout the year is relatively equally shared by each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little bit more precipitation than other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning too is much more frequent than otherwise).

The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that due to the geographical latitude the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.

===Environment===
{{See|List of national parks of the Netherlands|List of extinct animals of the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves. Most are owned by [[Staatsbosbeheer]] and [[Natuurmonumenten]] and include lakes, [[heathland]], [[Woodland|woods]], [[dunes]] and other habitats.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Netherlands belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Atlantic mixed forests.

In 1871 the last old original natural woods (Beekbergerwoud) were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like [[Scots Pine]] and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These woods were planted on [[heath (habitat)#Anthropogenic heaths|anthropogenic heaths]] and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) ([[Veluwe]]).

==Geography of the Caribbean Netherlands==
{{Main|Bonaire#Geography|l1=Bonaire|Saba#Geography and ecology|l2=Saba|Sint Eustatius#Geography|l3=Sint Eustatius}}
[[File:Bonaire_1.jpg|thumb|right|View of the coast of [[Bonaire]]]]
[[File:Windwardside.jpg|thumb|right|A view of [[Saba]]]]
The [[Caribbean Netherlands]] form part of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Within this island group, 
* '''Bonaire''' is part of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] within the [[Leeward Antilles]] island chain off the [[Venezuela]]n coast. The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin.
* '''Saba''' and '''Sint Eustatius''' are part of the [[SSS islands]]. They are located east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|877|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]] (also the highest point in all the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]).

===Climate===
The islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Islands are warmer and drier than the Windward islands. In summer, the Windward Islands can be subject to [[hurricanes]].

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Netherlands}}
[[File:Koningin Beatrix in Vries.jpg|thumb|[[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands]].]]
[[File:Den Haag Binnenhof.jpg|thumb|The [[Binnenhof]], where the lower and upper houses of the States-General meet.]]
[[File:Mark Rutte-6.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Rutte]] of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] has been the Prime Minister of the Netherlands since October 2010.]]
The Netherlands has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] since 1815 and a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] since 1848. The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2010, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 10th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].

The [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present [[Queen Beatrix]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers. The monarch can exert some influence during the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands#Formation|formation of a new cabinet]], where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties. Additionally, the king (the title queen has no constitutional significance) has the right to be briefed and consulted. Depending on the personality and qualities of the king and the ministers, the king might have ''influence'' beyond the ''power'' granted by the constitution.

In practice, the [[executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers of the Netherlands|council of Ministers]], the deliberative council of the [[cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet consists usually of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. In fact, this has been continuously the case since 1973. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', meaning he has no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. Currently, the Prime Minister is [[Mark Rutte]].

The cabinet is [[ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament, the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]], which also has [[legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]], the [[Lower House]], are elected in [[direct election]]s, which are held every four years or after the fall of the cabinet (by example: when one of the chambers carries a motion of no-confidence, the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has less legislative powers, as it can merely reject laws, not propose or amend them.

Both trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.

The Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]]. In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, and [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated. In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance is linked to Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.

===Political parties===
{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands}}
Due to the [[political parties of the Netherlands|multi-party system]], no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century, and [[coalition government|coalition cabinets]] had to be formed. Since [[suffrage]] became universal in 1919, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest family were the [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA), second were the [[social democracy|social democrats]], of which the [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour Party]] (PvdA), and third were the [[liberalism in the Netherlands|liberals]], of which the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.

These parties cooperated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre left coalition of the Christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre right coalition of Christian democrats and liberals. In the 1970s, the party system became more volatile: the Christian democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] democrat and [[progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[D'66|D66]].

In the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A &quot;[[purple (government)|purple]]&quot; cabinet was formed by VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, due to an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by CDA leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]] in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious program of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[health care system]], and the [[immigration policy|immigration]] policies.

In June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against minister of immigration and integration [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of VVD MP [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]. A [[Balkenende III|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006-2007 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[ChristianUnion]].

On 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web |title = Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit|publisher=[[De Volkskrant]]|date = 20 February 2010|url =http://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit|accessdate =20 February 2010|author = Dirks, Bart and Koelé, Theo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats. The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats. The big winner of the 2010 elections was [[Geert Wilders]] whose [[Party for Freedom|PVV]] more than doubled in number of seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100610-netherlands-government-coalition-elections-party-for-freedom-anti-islam |title=Lengthy coalition talks loom after far-right gain in Dutch elections |publisher=France24 |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2010 Dutch cabinet formation|Negotiation talks for a new government]] have resulted in a VVD-led [[minority government]] in coalition with CDA as of 14 October 2010.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of the Netherlands|Municipalities of the Netherlands|Water board (Netherlands)|Public body (Netherlands)|Caribbean Netherlands}}

[[File:Netherlands Map.svg|thumb|[[Provinces of the Netherlands|Provinces]] and [[special municipalities]] of the Netherlands.]]

The Netherlands is divided into twelve administrative regions, called provinces, each under a Governor, who is called ''Commissaris van de Koningin'' (Commissioner of the Queen), except for the province [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] where the commissioner is called Gouverneur (Governor). All provinces are divided into [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipalities]] (''gemeenten''), 430 in total (13 March 2010).

The country is also subdivided in water districts, governed by a [[Water board (Netherlands)|water board]] (''waterschap'' or ''hoogheemraadschap''), each having authority in matters concerning water management. As of 1 January 2005 there are 27. The creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196. In fact, the Dutch water boards are one of the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence.

The administrative structure on the 3 BES islands, also known as the [[Caribbean Netherlands]], is different. These islands have the status of ''openbare lichamen ([[Public body (Netherlands)|public bodies]])'' and are generally referred to as ''special municipalities''. They are not part of a province.&lt;ref name=WOLBES&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eerstekamer.nl/wetsvoorstel/31954_wet_openbare_lichamen|title=31.954, Wet openbare lichamen Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba|language=Dutch|publisher=Eerste kamer der Staten-Generaal|quote=De openbare lichamen vallen rechtstreeks onder het Rijk omdat zij geen deel uitmaken van een provincie.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Through the establishment of the BES islands as public bodies, rather than communities, the BES islands' rules may deviate from the rules in the European part of the Netherlands. The Dutch legislation will be introduced gradually. The public bodies fall directly under the central government because they are not part of a province.&quot;|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), [[The Hague]]]]
{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands}}
The history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since the Second World War the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies on [[international trade]].

The [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|atlantic cooperation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].

During and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire, which fell apart quickly after the Second World War. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands.

===Military===
{{Main|Military of the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]]. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including World War I), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and quickly defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.

[[File:F805 Evertsen.jpg|thumb|[[HNLMS Evertsen (F805)|HNLMS ''Evertsen'']], a [[Royal Dutch Navy]] [[frigate]]]]
The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and later became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].

The military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):
* ''[[Koninklijke Landmacht]]'' (KL), the Royal &lt;!-- Do not change any of these to Dutch, the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands.... --&gt; Netherlands Army
* ''[[Koninklijke Marine]]'' (KM), the Royal Netherlands Navy, including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps
* ''[[Koninklijke Luchtmacht]]'' (KLu), the Royal Netherlands Air Force
* ''[[Koninklijke Marechaussee]]'' (KMar), the Royal Military Police, tasks include military police and border control

General [[Tom Middendorp]] is the current Commander of the Netherlands armed forces.
All military specialities except the [[Koninklijke Marine#Submarine service|submarine service]] and the [[Royal Netherlands Marine Corps]] (''Korps Mariniers'') are open to women. The Korps Commandotroepen, the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for women to become a commando.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korpscommandotroepen.nl/index.php?l=nl&amp;p=118 KCT.

[[File:USDnotes.png|thumb|The Caribbean Netherlands introduced the US Dollar in 2011.  The economies of the three municipalities are primarily based on tourism.]]
The Netherlands has a developed economy and has been playing a special role in the European economy for many centuries. Since the 16th century, shipping, fishing, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy. The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries. Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector. Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, and tourism. Examples include
[[Unilever]], [[Heineken International|Heineken]], financial services ([[ING Group|ING]]), chemicals ([[DSM (company)|DSM]]), petroleum refining ([[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]), electronical machinery ([[Philips]], [[ASML Holding|ASML]]) and car navigation [[TomTom]].

The Netherlands has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|17th largest economy in the world]], and [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|ranks 10th in GDP (nominal) per capita]]. Between 1997 and 2000 annual economic growth (GDP) averaged nearly 4%, well above the European average. Growth slowed considerably from 2001 to 2005 with the global economic slowdown, but accelerated to 4.1% in the third quarter of 2007. Inflation is 1.3%, and unemployment is at 4.0% of the [[labour force]]. By [[Eurostat]] standards, unemployment in the Netherlands is at 4.1% (April 2010) – the lowest rate of all [[European Union]] member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (AEX), part of [[Euronext]], is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is situated near [[Dam Square]] in the city's centre. As a founding member of the euro, the Netherlands replaced (for accounting purposes) its former currency, the &quot;gulden&quot; ([[Dutch guilder|guilder]]), on 1 January 1999, along with 15 other adopters of the euro. Actual [[euro coins]] and [[euro banknotes|banknotes]] followed on 1 January 2002. One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders. However, in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]], the [[U.S. dollar]] is used instead of the euro.

The Netherlands' location gives it prime access to markets in the UK and Germany, with the [[port of Rotterdam]] being the largest port in Europe. Other important parts of the economy are [[international trade]] (Dutch colonialism started with cooperative private enterprises such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]), banking and transport. The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners. Amsterdam is the 5th busiest tourist destination in Europe with more than 4.2&amp;nbsp;million international visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;42milvisitors&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090215160103/http://www.ez.amsterdam.nl/page.php?page=9&amp;menu=27 Amsterdam en de wereld: Toerisme en congreswezen]. ez.amsterdam.nl&lt;/ref&gt; Since the enlargement of the EU large numbers of [[migrant worker]]s have arrived in the Netherlands from central and eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/10/uk-dutch-immigrants-idUKTRE8191ML20120210 |title= Dutch allow Wilders' anti-Pole website, EU critical | publisher= Reuters | date=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007. The Netherlands moved up from the 11th position in the [[Global Competitiveness Index]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollandtrade.com/holland-information/economic-development/?gclid=CIfivLDGvJ4CFUgA4wodRk1F1g |title=Economic development |publisher=hollandtrade.com |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=27 January 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 9th position in 2007.

One of the largest [[natural gas field]]s in the world is situated near [[Slochteren]]. Exploitation of this field resulted in a total revenue of €159&amp;nbsp;billion since the mid 1970s. With just over half of the reserves used up and an expected continued rise in oil prices, the revenues over the next few decades are expected to be at least that much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title = Aardgas als smeerolie|url = http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/andere-tijden/afleveringen/2005-2006/Aardgas-als-smeerolie.html|series = Andere Tijden|network = [[VPRO]]|airdate = 15 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===

A highly mechanised agricultural sector employs 4% of the labour force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Dutch rank third worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the United States and France, with exports earning $55&amp;nbsp;billion annually. A significant portion of Dutch agricultural exports are derived from fresh-cut plants, flowers, and bulbs, with the Netherlands exporting two-thirds of the world's total. The Netherlands also exports a quarter of all the world's tomatoes, and trade of one-third of the world's exports of [[Capsicum|chilis]], tomatoes and cucumbers goes through the country. The Netherlands also exports one-fifteenth of the world's apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200501/146118432.pdf#search=%22netherlands%20main%20agriculture%20export%20flowers%22|title = Netherlands: Agricultural situation|accessdate =20 June 2007|publisher=USDA Foreign Agriculture Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===

[[Rotterdam]] has the largest port in Europe, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the [[hinterland]] upstream reaching to [[Basel, Switzerland]], and into France. In 2006, Rotterdam was the world's seventh largest [[container port]] in terms of [[Twenty-foot equivalent units]] (TEU) handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/home/ |title=Port of Rotterdam |publisher=Port of Rotterdam |date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080518054012/http://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/home/ |archivedate = 18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The port's main activities are [[petrochemical]] industries and general cargo handling and [[transshipment]]. The harbour functions as an important transit point for [[bulk material handling|bulk materials]] and between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. In 2007, the ''[[Betuweroute]]'', a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed.

Several dialects of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] (''Nedersaksisch'' in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east, like the [[Twents]] in the [[Twente]] region, and Drents in the province Drenthe. They are recognised by the Netherlands as ''regional languages'' according to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], as well as the [[Meuse-Rhenish]] [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] varieties in the southeastern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], here called [[Limburgish]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;international2000&quot;/&gt; English is an official language in the special municipalities of [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]].

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in the Netherlands}}
[[File:DomTorenUtrechtNederland.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dom Tower of Utrecht]].]]

The Netherlands is one of the most secular countries in Western Europe, with only 39% being religiously affiliated (31% for those aged under 35), and fewer than 20% visiting church regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Godsdienstige veranderingen in Nederland|language=Dutch|author=Becker, Jos and Joep de Hart|isbn=90-377-0259-7|year=2006|publisher=Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau|oclc=84601762}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer]] poll 2005,&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|title=Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 – page 11|accessdate=5 May 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 34% of the Dutch citizens responded that &quot;they believe there is a God&quot;, whereas 37% answered that &quot;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot;, and 27% that &quot;they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force&quot;.

Currently, Roman Catholicism is the single largest religion of the Netherlands with around four million registered adherents which is 24% of the Dutch population in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;SILA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sila.nl/5-Pages/01-Aantallen2011.html |title=Kerkelijke gezindte en kerkbezoek; vanaf 1849; 18 jaar of ouder |date=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protestant Church of the Netherlands]] follows with 16% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=37944&amp;D1=0-5,10&amp;D2=29-40&amp;VW=T |title=Kerkelijke gezindte en kerkbezoek; vanaf 1849; 18 jaar of ouder |date=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the two major strands of [[Calvinism]]: the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (which represented roughly 8.5% of the population), the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]] (3.7% of the population), and a smaller [[Lutheran]] Church. Other Protestant churches, mostly orthodox Calvinist splits, represent 6% of the population. In 1947, 44.3% belonged to Protestant denominations, 38.7% belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, and 17.1% were unaffiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkstellingen.nl/ |title=Volkstellingen 1795–1971 |publisher=Volkstellingen.nl |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, there were 850,000 [[Islam in the Netherlands|Muslims]] (5% of the total Dutch population).&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/ACE89EBE-0785-4664-9973-A6A00A457A55/0/2007k3b15p48art.pdf|title=Towards a new estimation on the number of Muslims in the Netherlands|work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Netherlands|year=2006|accessdate=5 July 2009|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 [[Buddhism in the Netherlands|Buddhists]] or people who feel strongly attracted by this religion, largely ethnic Dutch people. There are approximately 200,000 [[Hinduism in the Netherlands|Hindus]], most of them are of [[Surinamese|Indo-Surinamese]] origin. [[Sikh]]s are another religious minority numbering around 12,000, mainly located in or around Amsterdam. There are five [[gurudwara]]s in the Netherlands. The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 6,400 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCE-05&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005)|work=The Association of Religion Data Archives|year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp|accessdate =4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Holocaust]] deeply affected the [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jewish]] community (killing about 75% of its 140,000 members at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=JCH Blom |title=The Persecution of the Jews in the Netherlands: A Comparative Western European Perspective |doi=10.1177/026569148901900302 |journal=European History Quarterly |month=July |year=1989 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=333–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it has managed to rebuild a vibrant and lively Jewish life for its approximately 45,000 current members.

Freedom of education has been guaranteed by the Dutch constitution since 1917, and schools run by religious groups (especially Catholic and Protestant) are funded by the government. All schools must meet strict quality criteria.

Three political parties in the Dutch parliament (CDA, ChristianUnion, and SGP) base their policy on Christian belief in varying degrees. Although the Netherlands is a secular state, in some [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipalities]] where the Christian parties have the majority, the council meetings are opened by prayer.

Municipalities in general also give civil servants a day off on Christian religious holidays, such as Easter and the [[Ascension of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beleven.org/feesten/lijsten/landen.php?land=Nederland |title=Feestdagen Nederland |publisher=Beleven.org |accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education in the Netherlands}}
Education in the Netherlands is compulsory between the ages of 4 and 16, and partially compulsory between the ages of 16 and 18.

All children in the Netherlands usually attend elementary school from (on average) ages 4 to 12. It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the 8th grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education (after completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream):
* The [[voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|vmbo]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the mbo (&quot;middle-level applied education&quot;). This form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade. With the mbo certification, a student can apply for the hbo.
* The [[hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|havo]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the hbo (&quot;higher professional education&quot;), which are [[vocational university|universities of professional education]] (or applied sciences) that award professional bachelor degrees that gives access to the university system.
* The [[voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|vwo]] (including [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. The university consists of a three year bachelor's degree, followed by a one, two or three year master's degree, and finally a four year [[doctoral degree]]. [[Research assistant|Doctoral candidates]] in the Netherlands are temporary employees of a university.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}
[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|Symbols and icons of Dutch culture]]

The Netherlands has had many well-known painters. The 17th century, when the Dutch republic was prosperous, was the age of the &quot;Dutch Masters&quot;, such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Jacob van Ruysdael]] and many others. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphics artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist. The Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. All of [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' major work was done in the Netherlands. The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].

In the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P.C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in Dutch colonies. Important 20th century authors include [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard van het Reve|Gerard (van het) Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she died in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.

Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], Japan. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], China. [[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|wooden shoes]], cheese, [[Delftware]] pottery, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.

===Sport===
[[File:Perfumo y cruyff.jpg|thumb|[[Johan Cruyff]] with [[Roberto Perfumo]] at the 1974 World Cup]]
{{main|Sport in the Netherlands}}
Approximately 4.5 million of the 16 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country. About two thirds of the population older than 15 years participates in sports weekly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100123173830/http://s2.ned.univie.ac.at/NoN/landeskunde/nl/h11/index.htm Sport in Nederland]. ned.univie.ac.at (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, [[Football in the Netherlands|football]], [[basketball]], speed skating, handball, cycling, field hockey, volleyball, equestrian sports, and tennis are popular sports{{fact|date=May 2012}}. A lot of amateurs practice them, and the Netherlands is a strong competitor in international tournaments for these sports.  In the Dutch Caribbean, baseball is a popular sport, with the islands frequently sending teams to the annual [[Little League World Series]].

Organization of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 246 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 86 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

===Cuisine===
{{main|Dutch Cuisine}}
{{clear}}

Traditional Dutch cuisine consists of working class meals. Many traditional dishes are mashed dishes, for instance potatoes mashed with kale (''boerenkool''), sauerkraut (''zuurkool''), or endive (''andijvie''). These dishes are served with greasy, smoked sausage (''rookworst'') and gravy. Another traditional dish is split pea soup (''erwtensoep'').

As the Netherlands always had strong ties with (former) colonies Indonesia and Suriname, dishes from those countries have mixed with Dutch cuisine. Common Asian dishes in the Netherlands include noodles (''bami'') and rice (''nasi'') dishes.

==Colonial heritage==
{{main|Dutch Empire}}
{{see|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}
From the 17th century exploitations of the [[Dutch East India Company]], through 19th century [[New Imperialism|colonisations]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch imperial possessions]] continued to expand, reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hart, Jonathan |title=Empires and Colonies |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LnevC1FYdnEC&amp;pg=PA201 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |year=2008|publisher=Polity |isbn=978-0-7456-2614-7 |pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands.

In The [[Dutch Golden Age]] of the 17th century, the Netherlands urbanised considerably, mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies. Social status was based on merchants' income, which reduced [[feudalism]] and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society. When the [[Dutch Royal Family]] was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade.&lt;ref&gt;To this day the Dutch Royal family is in fact the wealthiest family of the Netherlands, one of the foundations of its wealth was the colonial trade.{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/30/worlds-richest-royals-biz-royals07-cx_lk_0830royalintro_slide_15.html?thisSpeed=30000 |title=In Pictures: The World's Richest Royals |work=Forbes |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities such as the Royal [[Leiden University]] founded in the 16th century have developed into leading knowledge centres about Southeast Asian and Indonesian studies.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the University faculties still include: Indonesian Languages and Cultures; Southeast Asia and Oceania Languages and Cultures; Cultural Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; Leiden University has produced leading academics such as [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]], and still has academics who specialise in Indonesian languages and cultures. Leiden University and in particular [[KITLV]] are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in Indonesian studies. Other scientific institutions in the Netherlands include the Amsterdam [[Tropenmuseum]], an anthropological museum with massive collections of Indonesian art, culture, ethnography and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[tudelft.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditions of the [[Royal Dutch East Indies Army]] (KNIL) are maintained by the [[Regiment Van Heutsz]] of the modern [[Royal Netherlands Army]]. A dedicated ''[[Bronbeek]] Museum'', a former home for retired KNIL soldiers, exists in [[Arnhem]] to this day.

A specific segment of Dutch literature called [[Dutch Indies literature]] still exists and includes established authors, such as [[Louis Couperus]], the writer of &quot;The Hidden Force&quot;, taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuys, Rob ''Mirror of the Indies: A History of Dutch Colonial Literature'' translated from Dutch by E. M. Beekman (Publisher: Periplus, 1999) [http://dannyreviews.com/h/Mirror_Indies.html Book review.]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the great masterpieces of [[Dutch literature]] is the book &quot;[[Max Havelaar]]&quot; written by [[Multatuli]] in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Etty, Elsbeth (July 1998).

The majority of Dutchmen that repatriated to the Netherlands after and during the Indonesian revolution are [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian), native to the islands of the Dutch East Indies. This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community.&lt;ref&gt;Bosma U., Raben R. (2008).

Including their second generation descendants, Indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the Netherlands. In 2008, the Dutch Census Buro for Statistics (CBS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/bevolking/cijfers/default.htm Official CBS website containing all Dutch demographic statistics]. Cbs.nl. Retrieved on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; registered 387,000 first and second generation Indos living in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Marlene (2009). [http://books.google.com/books?id=PNo0ZYamYsUC ''Indisch is een gevoel, de tweede en derde generatie Indische Nederlanders.''] Amsterdam University Press, ISBN 978-90-8964-125-0, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; Although considered fully assimilated into Dutch society, as the main ethnic minority in the Netherlands, these 'Repatriants' have played a pivotal role in introducing elements of Indonesian culture into Dutch mainstream culture. 

Practically each town in the Netherlands will have a 'Toko' (Dutch Indonesian Shop) or Indonesian restaurant&lt;ref&gt;[http://indisch-eten.startpagina.nl/ Overview website (incomplete)]. Indisch-eten.startpagina.nl. Retrieved on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and many '[[Pasar Malam]]' (Night market in Malay/Indonesian) fairs are organised throughout the year. Many Indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the Netherlands. [[Rijsttafel]] a colonial culinary concept and dishes such as [[Nasi goreng]] and [[satay|sateh]] are still very popular in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[dutchfood.about.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
