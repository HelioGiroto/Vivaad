'''Social liberalism''' is the belief that [[liberalism]] should include a social foundation. It differs from [[classical liberalism]] in that it believes the legitimate role of the [[state (polity)|state]] includes addressing economic and social issues such as [[welfare]], [[health care]], and [[education]] while simultaneously expanding [[civil and political rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://socialliberal.net/2009/02/12/what-is-social-liberalism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libdemvoice.org/opinion-the-importance-of-social-liberalism-25932.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=October 2012}} Under social liberalism, the [[common good|good of the community]] is viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of European liberalism'' (1959), Guido De Ruggiero, pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt;  Social liberal policies have been widely adopted in much of the capitalist world, particularly following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/books?id=FAtlVdPhEFAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Political%20Sociology%3A%20A%20Critical%20Introduction&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Fauks, Keith.

A reaction against social liberalism in the late twentieth century, often called [[neoliberalism]], led to [[monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies and a reduction in government provision of services.  However, this reaction did not result in a return to [[classical liberalism]], as governments continued to provide social services and retained control over economic policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faulks&quot;&gt;[http://www.google.com/books?id=FAtlVdPhEFAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Political%20Sociology%3A%20A%20Critical%20Introduction&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Fauks, Keith.

==Origins==
{{Main|History of liberalism}}

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse , c1910.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse|L.T. Hobhouse]]]]
By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of [[classical liberalism]] were challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of organized labour. The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialization and ''laissez-faire'' capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers—including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[Matthew Arnold]]—became early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. The new liberals tried to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an equal chance of success.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Eatwell | first = Roger | authorlink = | coauthors = Wright, Anthony | title = Contemporary political ideologies | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 1999 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780826451736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Thomas Hill Green|T.H. Green]]]]In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, a group of British thinkers, known as the New Liberals, made a case against ''laissez-faire'' classical liberalism and argued in favor of state intervention in social, economic, and cultural life. The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like [[Thomas Hill Green|T.H. Green]], [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse|L.T. Hobhouse]], and [[John A. Hobson]], saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;adams&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams  |first=Ian |title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today) |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |isbn=0719060206 |year=2001 |location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented, and interventionist state.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge encyclopaedia of philosophy, p.599&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] governments of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H. Asquith]], especially thanks to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], established the foundations of the welfare state in the UK before the [[World War I|First World War]]. The comprehensive welfare state built in the UK after the [[Second World War]], although largely accomplished by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], was significantly designed by two Liberals—[[John Maynard Keynes]], who laid the economic foundations, and [[William Beveridge]], who designed the welfare system.&lt;ref name=&quot;adams&quot;/&gt;

===Germany===
In late nineteenth century [[Germany]], liberals established trade unions in order to help improve working and economic conditions. Leading liberals, such as [[Lujo Brentano]], established the [[Social Policy Association]] in 1873 to promote social reform. The focus of the liberals primarily centered about free speech, freedom of assembly, free trade, representative government, equal suffrage, privacy, and protection of private property, although it included strong opposition to the [[welfare state]], which they deemed [[state socialism]]. [[Friedrich Naumann]], who was an Association member, later established the [[National Social Union]], which attempted to address the social question as non-Marxist liberal perspective. The new group advocated, among other things, increased social welfare legislation, the right to strike, and profit-sharing in industry.  Although the party was unable to win any seats and soon dissolved, the theories it developed would remain influential in German liberalism.

[[File:Friedrich Naumann 1886.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Friedrich Naumann]]]]

While some writers describe Germany's liberalism as social liberalism, others only apply the term to the policies of the National Social Union. Historically, social liberalism culminated primarily in two particular parties, namely the [[German Empire|imperial]] [[German Progress Party]] and the [[Weimar Republic|Weimarian]] [[German Democratic Party]], their current heir being the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]]. The term &quot;social liberal&quot; contrasted these parties with the more conservative and classically liberal, such as the right-wing of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]], which allied itself with the Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;''Contending liberalisms in world politics'' (2001) James L. Richardson, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liberal Democrats in the Weimar Republic: The History of the German Democratic Party and the German State Party'' (1985) Bruce B. Frye, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Democratic Movement in Germany, 1789–1914'' (1976) John L. Snell, p. 304-334&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], social liberal theory was developed in the [[Third Republic]] by [[Social solidarity|solidarist]] thinkers, including [[Alfred Fouillée]] and [[Émile Durkheim]], who were inspired by [[sociology]] and influenced radical politicians like [[Léon Bourgeois]]. They explained that a greater division of labor caused greater opportunity and individualism, but it also inspired a more complex interdependence. They argued that the individual had a debt to society, promoting progressive taxation to support public works and welfare schemes.  However, they wanted the state to coordinate rather than to manage, and they encouraged cooperative insurance schemes among individuals. Their main objective was to remove barriers to social mobility rather than create a welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary political ideologies'' (1999) Roger Eatwell, Anthony Wright, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the 1870s and the 1880s, the American economists [[Richard Ely]], [[John Bates Clark]], and [[Henry Carter Adams]]—influenced both by [[socialism]] and the [[Evangelical Protestant]] movement—castigated the conditions caused by industrial factories and expressed sympathy towards [[labor unions]]. None, however, developed a systematic political philosophy, and they later abandoned their flirtations with socialist thinking. In 1883, [[Lester Frank Ward]] published the two-volume ''Dynamic Sociology'' and formalized the basic tenets of social liberalism while at the same time attacking the laissez-faire policies advocated by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]]. The historian [[Henry Steele Commager]] ranked Ward alongside [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes]] and called him the father of the modern welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele, ed.; Lester Ward and the Welfare State. New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Writing from 1884 until the 1930s, [[John Dewey]]—an educator influenced by Hobhouse, Green, and Ward—advocated socialist methods to achieve liberal goals.  Some social liberal ideas were later incorporated into the [[New Deal]],&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; which developed as a response to the [[Great Depression]].

==Implementation==
The welfare state grew gradually and unevenly from the late nineteenth century, but became fully developed following the Second World War, along with the mixed market economy.  Also called &quot;[[embedded liberalism]]&quot;, social liberal policies gained broad support across the political spectrum, because they reduced the disruptive and polarizing tendencies in society, without challenging the capitalist economic system.  Business accepted social liberalism in the face of widespread dissatisfaction with the [[boom and bust]] cycle of the earlier economic system, and because it seemed to them to be a lesser evil than more left-wing modes of government.  Social liberalism was characterized by cooperation between big business, government and labor unions.  Government was able to assume a strong role because its power had been strengthened by the wartime economy.  However, the extent to which this occurred varied considerably among Western democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[Image:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=Leaflet, titled &quot;Dawn of hope,&quot; showing a sick man being attended to by a doctor, with the caption &quot;Support the Liberal government in their policy of social reform&quot;. |[[United Kingdom|British]] leaflet from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] expressing support for the [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Health Insurance Act of 1911]]. The legislation provided benefits to sick and unemployed workers, marking a major milestone in the development of [[social welfare]].]]
The first notable implementation of social liberal policies occurred under the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] in Britain from 1906 until 1914. These initiatives became known as the [[Liberal reforms]]. The main elements included pensions for poor elderly people, [[National Insurance Act 1911|health, sickness, and unemployment insurance]] based on earlier programs in Germany, and the establishment of [[Labour Exchanges Act 1909|labour exchanges]]. These changes were accompanied by [[progressive income tax|progressive taxation]], particularly in the [[People's Budget]] of 1909. The old system of charity—relying on the [[English Poor Laws|Poor laws]] and supplemented by private charity, public co-operatives, and private insurance companies—was in crisis, giving the state added impetus for reform. The Liberal Party caucus elected in 1906 also contained more professionals, including academics and journalists, sympathetic to social liberalism. The large business owners had mostly deserted the Liberals for the Conservatives, the latter becoming the favorite party for commercial interests. The reforms were regularly opposed by both business interests and trade unions. Liberals most identified with these reforms were the prime minister [[H. H. Asquith]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[David Lloyd George]] (especially as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), [[Winston Churchill]] (as [[President of the Board of Trade]]) in addition to the civil servant [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Feuchtwanger, pp. 273-317&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest of Europe===
The post-war governments of other countries in Western Europe also followed social liberal policies.  These policies were implemented primarily by [[Christian Democrats]] and [[Social Democrats]], as liberal parties in Europe declined in strength from their peak in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
American political discourse resisted this social turn in European liberalism.  While the economic policies of the [[New Deal]] appeared Keynesian, there was no revision of liberal theory in favor of greater state initiative. America lacked an effective socialist movement; however, New Deal policies often appeared radical and were attacked by the right. The separate development of [[modern liberalism in the United States]] is often attributed to [[American exceptionalism]], which kept mainstream American ideology within a narrow range.&lt;ref&gt;''Contending liberalisms in world politics: ideology and power'' (2001), James L. Richardson, pp. 38–41 [http://www.google.com/books?id=FM_tCJk51yQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=contending%20liberalisms%20in%20world%20politics&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reversal==
Following economic problems in the 1970s, social liberal thought underwent some transformation. Keynesian economic management was seen as interfering with the free market while increased welfare spending that had been funded by higher taxes prompted fears of lower investment, lower consumer spending, and the creation of a &quot;dependency culture.&quot; Trade unions often caused high wages and industrial disruption, while full employment was regarded as unsustainable. Writers such as [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Samuel Brittan]], who were influenced by [[Friedrich Hayek]], advocated a reversal of social liberalism. Their policies, which are often called [[neoliberalism]], had a significant influence on Western politics, most notably on the governments of UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and US President [[Ronald Reagan]], who pursued policies of deregulation of the economy and reduction in spending on social services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faulks&quot;/&gt;

Part of the reason for the collapse of the social liberal coalition was a challenge in the 1970s from financial interests that could operate independently of national governments.  Another cause was the decline of organized labor which had formed part of the coalition but was also a support for left-wing ideologies challenging the liberal consensus.  Related to this was the decline of working class consciousness and the growth of the middle class.  The push by the United States, which had been least accepting of social liberalism, for trade liberalization further eroded support.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active social liberal parties and organizations==
In [[Europe]], social liberal parties tend to be small or medium-sized [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Centre-left|center-left]] parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirchner&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kirchner |first=Emil |title=Liberal parties in Western Europe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521323949 |year=2000 |pages=356–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of successful European social liberal parties, which have participated in government coalitions at national or regional levels, are the [[Liberal Democrats]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Democrats 66|D66]] in the [[Netherlands]], and the [[Det Radikale Venstre|Danish Social Liberal Party]] in [[Denmark]]. In continental European politics, social liberal parties are integrated in the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|ALDE]] group of the [[European Parliament]], which is the third biggest group at the parliament and includes both social liberal parties and market liberal parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;alde&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alde.eu/en/about-us/national-delegations/ |title=ALDE National Delegations |year=2010 |publisher=ALDE Group in the European Parliament |accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving an exhaustive list of social liberal parties worldwide is difficult, largely because political organisations are not always ideologically pure. Party ideologies often change over time. However, the following parties and organisations are usually accepted by peers&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex04&quot;&gt;[[Liberal International]], [[ELDR]], [[CALD]], [[Africa Liberal Network]], [[Liberal Network for Latin America|RELIAL]] or [[European Liberal Forum]]&lt;/ref&gt; or scholars as following social liberalism as a core ideology.
