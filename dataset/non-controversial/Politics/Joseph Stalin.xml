'''Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin''' ({{lang-ru|Иосиф Виссарионович Сталин}}; born '''Ioseb Besarionis dze Dzhugashvili,''', {{lang-ka|იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი}}; 18 December 1878&lt;ref name=&quot;dob&quot;/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 5 March 1953) was the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]] from 6 May 1941 until his death in 5 March 1953. Among the [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries who brought about the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, Stalin held the position of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union#List of General Secretaries|General Secretary]] of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] from 1922 until his death. While the office was initially not highly regarded, Stalin used it to consolidate more power after the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in 1924, gradually putting down all opposition. This included [[Leon Trotsky]], the principal critic of Stalin among the early Soviet leaders. Whereas Trotsky advocated world [[permanent revolution]], Stalin's concept of [[socialism in one country]] became primary policy as he emerged the leader of the Soviet Union.

In 1928, Stalin replaced the decade's [[New Economic Policy]] with a highly centralised [[command economy]] and [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]], launching a period of industrialization and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization in the countryside]]. As a result, the USSR was rapidly transformed from an agrarian society into an industrial power, the basis for its emergence as the world's second largest economy after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wheatcroft, S.

In 1937–38, a campaign against alleged enemies of the Stalinist regime culminated in the [[Great Purge]], a period of mass repression against the population in which hundreds of thousands of people were executed. Major figures in the Communist Party such as Trotsky and [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|Red Army leaders]], were killed, convicted of participating in plots to overthrow the Soviet government and Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott Gleason (2009).

''Europe-Asia Studies'', Vol. 45, No. 2 (1993), pp. 303–341&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin entered into a [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|pact with Nazi Germany]] that divided their influence in Eastern Europe and allowed the USSR to regain some of its lost territories. Germany violated the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941, opening the bloodiest theatre of war in history, the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The Soviet Union joined the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]] and despite heavy human and territorial losses in the initial period of war, it stopped the Axis advance in the decisive battles of [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. Eventually, the Red Army drove through Eastern Europe and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in May 1945. Having played a decisive role in the Allied victory against Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Weinberg, G.L.|title=A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II|isbn=0-521-55879-4|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=264|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rozhnov, Konstantin, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4508901.stm Who won World War II?].

State communist governments loyal to the Soviet Union were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]], as [[satellite states]].  Stalin intended these to be a buffer in case of another war, as the USSR was beginning to [[Cold War|enter a struggle for global dominance]] with the [[Western world]].  In Asia, Stalin fostered relations with [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Kim Il-sung]] in [[North Korea]], and his rule served as a model for their newly formed respective governments.

In power until his death in 1953, Stalin led the USSR during the period of post-war reconstruction, marked by the dominance of [[Stalinist architecture]]. The successful development of the [[Soviet nuclear program]] enabled the country to become the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]]; the later [[Soviet space program]] began as a spin-off of the nuclear project. Stalin also launched the [[Great Construction Projects of Communism]] and the [[Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature]]. Stalin and his regime have been condemned on numerous occasions, the most significant being [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|in 1956]], when Stalin's successor [[Nikita Khrushchev]] [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced his legacy]] and initiated a process of [[de-Stalinization]].

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of Joseph Stalin}}
{{double image|right|Stalin 1894.jpg|110|Stalin 1902.jpg|120|Young Ioseb, {{circa|1894}}, aged 16 (left) and 23 (right) {{circa|1902.}}}}
Stalin was born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili ({{lang-ka|იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი}}; {{lang-ru|Иосиф Виссарионович Джугашвили}}, ''[[Romanization of Russian|Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili]]'') on 18 December 1878&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; to [[Ketevan Geladze]] and [[Besarion Jughashvili]], a cobbler, in the town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], [[Tiflis Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now Georgia).  He was their fourth child; their three previous sons died in infancy.

At the age of seven, he contracted [[smallpox]], which permanently scarred his face. At ten, he began attending church school where the Georgian children were forced to speak Russian. By the age of twelve, two horse-drawn carriage accidents left his left arm permanently damaged. At sixteen, he received a scholarship to a [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgian Orthodox]] [[seminary]], where he rebelled against the imperialist and religious order. Though he performed well there, he was expelled in 1899 after missing his final exams. The seminary's records suggest that he was unable to pay his tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore, ''Young Stalin'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The official Soviet version states that he was expelled for reading illegal literature and for forming a Social Democratic study circle.&lt;ref&gt;Medvedev, ''Let History Judge'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after leaving the seminary, Stalin discovered the writings of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and decided to become a Marxist revolutionary, eventually joining Lenin's [[Bolsheviks]] in 1903. After being marked by the [[Okhranka]] (the Tsar's secret police) for his activities, he became a full-time revolutionary and outlaw. He became one of the [[Bolsheviks]]' chief operatives in the [[Caucasus]], organizing paramilitaries, inciting strikes, spreading propaganda and raising money through bank robberies, ransom kidnappings and extortion. The infamy he gained from being associated with organizing the [[1907 Tiflis bank robbery]], which resulted in several deaths and the stealing of 250,000 rubles (about US $3.4 million in modern terms), would trouble him politically for years later.&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore, ''Young Stalin'', p. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1906, Stalin married [[Ekaterina Svanidze]], who later gave birth to Stalin's first child, [[Yakov Dzhugashvili|Yakov]]. A year later she died of [[typhus]] in [[Baku]].

Stalin was captured and sent to [[Siberia]] seven times, but escaped most of these exiles. He eventually adopted the name &quot;Stalin&quot; from the Russian word for steel and used it as an alias and pen name in his published works.

During his last exile, Stalin was conscripted by the Russian army to fight in World War I, but was deemed unfit for service because of his damaged left arm.&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore, ''Young Stalin'', p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolution, Civil War, and Polish-Soviet War==
{{Main|Joseph Stalin in the Russian Revolution, Russian Civil War, and Polish-Soviet War}}

===Role during the Russian Revolution of 1917===
[[File:Stalin's Mug Shot.jpg|thumb|Prior to the revolution of 1917, Stalin played an active role in fighting the tsarist government. Here he is shown on a 1911 information card from the files of the Tsarist secret police in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young Stalin&quot;&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore. Young Stalin. 2007. ISBN 978-0-297-85068-7&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2011}}]]
After returning to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] from exile, Stalin ousted [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Alexander Shlyapnikov]] as editors of ''[[Pravda]]''. He then took a position in favor of supporting [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]]. However, after Lenin prevailed at the April 1917 Communist Party conference, Stalin and ''Pravda'' shifted to opposing the provisional government. At this conference, Stalin was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee.  In October 1917, the Bolshevik Central Committee voted in favor of an insurrection. On 7 November, from the [[Smolny Institute]], Trotsky, Lenin and the rest of the Central Committee coordinated the insurrection against Kerensky in the 1917 [[October Revolution]]. By 8 November, the Bolsheviks had stormed the [[Winter Palace]] and Kerensky's Cabinet had been arrested.

===Role in the Russian Civil War, 1917–1919===

Upon seizing Petrograd, Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs. Thereafter, [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] broke out in Russia, pitting [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] Red Army against the [[White Army]], a loose alliance of anti-Bolshevik forces. Lenin formed a five-member [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], which included Stalin and [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]. In May 1918, Lenin dispatched Stalin to the city of [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]]. Through his new allies, [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Semyon Budyonny]], Stalin imposed his influence on the military.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Stalin challenged many of the decisions of [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], ordered the killings of many counter-revolutionaries and former Tsarist officers in the Red Army{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and burned villages in order to intimidate the peasantry into submission and discourage bandit raids on food shipments.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In May 1919, in order to stem mass desertions on the Western front, Stalin had deserters and renegades publicly executed as traitors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service. ''Stalin: A Biography''. pg 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–1921===
After the Bolshevik victory in the [[Russian Civil War]], Poland invaded Ukraine, starting what became known as the [[Polish–Soviet War]], but the Bolsheviks pushed them back into Poland. As commander of the southern front, Stalin was determined to take the Polish-held city of [[Lviv]]. This conflicted with the general strategy set by Lenin and Trotsky, which focused on the capture of [[Warsaw]] further north.

Trotsky's forces engaged those of Polish commander [[Władysław Sikorski]] at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], but Stalin refused to redirect his troops from Lviv to help. Consequently, the battles for both Lviv and Warsaw were lost, and Stalin was blamed. In August 1920, Stalin returned to Moscow, where he defended himself and resigned his military command. At the Ninth Party Conference on 22 September, Trotsky openly criticized Stalin's behavior.

==Rise to power==
{{Main|Rise of Joseph Stalin}}
Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]], following which he adopted particularly hardline, centralist policies towards [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]]. This led to the [[Georgian Affair]] of 1922 and other repressions.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Ami W. (1991), Beria and the Cult of Stalin: Rewriting Transcaucasian Party History. ''[[Soviet Studies]]'', Vol. 43, No. 4, pp. 749–763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanin, Teodor (July 1989), Ethnicity in the Soviet Union: Analytical Perceptions and Political Strategies. ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 409–424&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's actions in Georgia created a rift with Lenin, who believed that all the Soviet states should stand equal.

Lenin nonetheless considered Stalin to be a loyal ally, and when he got mired in squabbles with Trotsky and other politicians, he decided to give Stalin more power. With the help of [[Lev Kamenev]], Lenin had Stalin appointed [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;StalinRobertService&quot;&gt;Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography. 2004. ISBN 978-0-330-41913-0&lt;/ref&gt; This post enabled Stalin to appoint many of his allies to government positions.
[[File:Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, 1919.jpg|thumb|Stalin and Vladimir Lenin in 1919.]]
Lenin suffered a stroke in 1922, forcing him into semi-retirement in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]]. Stalin visited him often, acting as his intermediary with the outside world,&lt;ref name=&quot;StalinRobertService&quot; /&gt; but the pair quarreled and their relationship deteriorated.&lt;ref name=&quot;StalinRobertService&quot; /&gt; Lenin dictated increasingly disparaging notes on Stalin in what would become his testament. He criticized Stalin's political views, rude manners, and excessive power and ambition, and suggested that Stalin should be removed from the position of General Secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;StalinRobertService&quot; /&gt; During Lenin's semi-retirement, Stalin forged an alliance with Kamenev and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] against Trotsky. These allies prevented ''[[Lenin's Testament]]'' from being revealed to the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Twelfth Party Congress]] in April 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;StalinRobertService&quot; /&gt;

Lenin died of a heart attack on 21 January 1924. Again, Kamenev and Zinoviev helped to keep Lenin's Testament from going public. Thereafter, Stalin's disputes with Kamenev and Zinoviev intensified. Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev grew increasingly isolated, and were eventually ejected from the Central Committee and then from the Party itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;StalinRobertService&quot; /&gt; Kamenev and Zinoviev were later readmitted, but Trotsky was exiled from the Soviet Union.

The [[Northern Expedition]] in China became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin wanted the [[Communist Party of China]] to ally itself with the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]], rather than attempt to implement a communist revolution. Trotsky urged the party to oppose the Kuomintang and launch a full-scale revolution.

Stalin pushed for more rapid industrialization and central control of the economy, contravening Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP). At the end of 1927, a critical shortfall in grain supplies prompted Stalin to push for the collectivisation of agriculture and order the seizure of grain hoards from [[kulak]] farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;StalinRobertService&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RedTsar&quot;&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore. ''Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar'', Knopf, 2004 (ISBN 1-4000-4230-5)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Alexey Rykov]] opposed these policies and advocated a return to the NEP, but the rest of the Politburo sided with Stalin and removed Bukharin from the Politburo in November 1929. Rykov was fired the following year and was replaced by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on Stalin's recommendation.

In December 1934, the popular Communist Party boss in [[Leningrad]], [[Sergei Kirov]], was murdered. Stalin blamed Kirov's murder on a vast conspiracy of saboteurs and Trotskyites. He launched a massive purge against these internal enemies, putting them on rigged show trials and then having them executed or imprisoned in Siberian [[Gulag]]s. Among these victims were old enemies, including Bukharin, Rykov, Kamenev and Zinoviev. Stalin made the loyal [[Nikolai Yezhov]] head of the secret police, the [[NKVD]], and had him purge the NKVD of veteran Bolsheviks. With no serious opponents left in power, Stalin ended the purges in 1938. Yezhov was held to blame for the excesses of the Great Terror. He was dismissed from office and later executed.

===Bolstering Soviet secret service and intelligence===
{{Main|Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies}}
{{Stalinism sidebar}}
Stalin vastly increased the scope and power of the state's secret police and intelligence agencies. Under his guiding hand, Soviet intelligence forces began to set up intelligence networks in most of the major nations of the world, including Germany (the famous ''[[Red Orchestra (spy)|Rote Kappelle]]'' spy ring), Great Britain, France, Japan, and the United States. Stalin made considerable use of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] movement in order to infiltrate agents and to ensure that foreign Communist parties remained pro-Soviet and pro-Stalin.

One of the best examples of Stalin's ability to integrate secret police and foreign espionage came in 1940, when he gave approval to the secret police to have Leon Trotsky assassinated in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE3DF133EF936A35752C0A96F948260 Soviet Readers Finally Told Moscow Had Trotsky Slain].

===Cult of personality===
{{main|Stalin's cult of personality}}
Stalin created a [[cult of personality]] in the Soviet Union around both himself and Lenin. Many personality cults in history have been frequently measured and compared to his. Numerous towns, villages and cities were renamed after the Soviet leader (see [[List of places named after Stalin]]) and the [[Stalin Prize]] and [[Stalin Peace Prize]] were named in his honor. He accepted grandiloquent titles (e.g., &quot;[[Coryphaeus]] of Science,&quot; &quot;Father of Nations,&quot; &quot;Brilliant Genius of Humanity,&quot; &quot;Great Architect of Communism,&quot; &quot;Gardener of Human Happiness,&quot; and others), and helped rewrite Soviet history to provide himself a more significant role in the revolution of 1917. At the same time, according to [[Nikita Khrushchev]], he insisted that he be remembered for &quot;the extraordinary modesty characteristic of truly great people.&quot; Statues of Stalin depict him at a height and build approximating the very tall Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], while photographic evidence suggests he was between 5&amp;nbsp;ft 5&amp;nbsp;in and 5&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in (165–168&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebheights.com/s/Joseph-Stalin-3210.html|title=Joseph Stalin Height – Stalin's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky criticized the cult of personality built around Stalin. It reached new levels during World War II, with Stalin's name included in the new [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union#1944|Soviet national anthem]]. Stalin became the focus of literature, poetry, music, paintings and film that exhibited fawning devotion. He was sometimes credited with almost god-like qualities, including the suggestion that he single-handedly won the Second World War. The degree to which Stalin himself relished the cult surrounding him is debatable. The Finnish communist [[Arvo Tuominen]] records a sarcastic toast proposed by Stalin at a New Year Party in 1935 in which he said &quot;Comrades! I want to propose a toast to our patriarch, life and sun, liberator of nations, architect of socialism [he rattled off all the appellations applied to him in those days]{{spaced ndash}}Josef Vissarionovich Stalin, and I hope this is the first and last speech made to that genius this evening.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Arvo Tuominen|author=Tuominen, Arvo|title=The Bells of the Kremlin|page=162|isbn=0-87451-249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1956 speech, Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult of personality with these words: &quot;It is impermissible and foreign to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to elevate one person, to transform him into a superman possessing supernatural characteristics akin to those of a god.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Stalin, as head of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], consolidated near-absolute power in the 1930s with a [[Great Purge]] of the party that was justified as an attempt to expel &quot;opportunists&quot; and &quot;counter-revolutionary infiltrators&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes&quot;&gt;[[Orlando Figes]] ''The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia'', 2007, ISBN 0-8050-7461-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Social Catastrophe&quot;&gt;Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe. By Robert Gellately. 2007. Knopf. ISBN 1-4000-4005-1&lt;/ref&gt; Those targeted by the purge were often expelled from the party, however more severe measures ranged from banishment to the Gulag [[labor camp]]s to execution after trials held by [[NKVD troika]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, Moshe Lewin, ''Stalinism and Nazism: Dictatorships in Comparison'', Cambridge University Press 1997, ISBN 0-521-56521-9, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Kuper, ''Genocide: Its Political Use in the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press 1982, ISBN 0-300-03120-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Stalin apparently became increasingly worried about the growing popularity of the Leningrad party boss Sergei Kirov. At the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] where the vote for the new Central Committee was held, Kirov received only three negative votes, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 1,108 negative votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the assassination of Kirov, which may have been orchestrated by Stalin, Stalin invented a detailed scheme to implicate opposition leaders in the murder, including Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev.&lt;ref name=&quot;brackman205&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|pp=205–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations and trials expanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;brackman207&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin passed a new law on &quot;terrorist organizations and terrorist acts&quot; that were to be investigated for no more than ten days, with no prosecution, defense attorneys or appeals, followed by a sentence to be executed &quot;quickly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Overy 2004 p=182&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Overy|2004|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, several trials known as the [[Moscow Trials]] were held, but the procedures were replicated throughout the country. [[Article 58]] of the legal code, which listed prohibited anti-Soviet activities as counterrevolutionary crime, was applied in the broadest manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|1992|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flimsiest pretexts were often enough to brand someone an &quot;[[enemy of the people]]&quot;, starting the cycle of public persecution and abuse, often proceeding to interrogation, torture and deportation, if not death. The Russian word [[:wikt:troika|troika]] gained a new meaning: a quick, simplified trial by a committee of three subordinated to NKVD -[[NKVD troika]]- with sentencing carried out within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overy 2004 p=182&quot;/&gt; Stalin's hand-picked executioner, [[Vasili Blokhin]], was entrusted with carrying out some of the high profile executions in this period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

Many military leaders were convicted of treason and a large-scale purge of [[Red Army]] officers followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;scale&quot;&gt;The scale of Stalin's purge of Red Army officers was exceptional—90% of all generals and 80% of all colonels were killed. This included three out of five Marshals, 13 out of 15 Army commanders, 57 of 85 Corps commanders, 110 of 195 divisional commanders and 220 of 406 brigade commanders as well as all commanders of military districts.

With the exception of [[Vladimir Milyutin]] (who died in prison in 1937) and Joseph Stalin himself, all of the members of [[Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic#The original People's Commissars|Lenin's original cabinet]] who had not succumbed to death from natural causes before the purge were executed.

[[Mass operations of the NKVD]] also targeted &quot;national contingents&quot; (foreign ethnicities) such as Poles, ethnic Germans, Koreans, etc. A total of 350,000 (144,000 of them Poles) were arrested and 247,157 (110,000 Poles) were executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;RedTsar&quot; /&gt; Many Americans who had emigrated to the Soviet Union during the worst of the [[Great Depression]] were executed; others were sent to prison camps or [[gulags]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Tzouliadis.

''The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia''. The [[Penguin Press]], 2008 (ISBN 1594201684)&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent with the purges, efforts were made to rewrite the history in Soviet textbooks and other propaganda materials. Notable people executed by [[NKVD]] were removed from the texts and photographs as though they never existed. Gradually, the history of revolution was transformed to a story about just two key characters: Lenin and Stalin.

In light of revelations from Soviet archives, historians now estimate that nearly 700,000 people (353,074 in 1937 and 328,612 in 1938) were executed in the course of the terror,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Barry McLoughlin|coauthors=Kevin McDermott(eds)|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8yorTJl1QEoC&amp;pg=PA141|title=Stalin's Terror: High Politics and Mass Repression in the Soviet Union|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2002|isbn=1-4039-0119-8|page=141|date=4 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the great mass of victims merely &quot;ordinary&quot; Soviet citizens: workers, peasants, homemakers, teachers, priests, musicians, soldiers, pensioners, ballerinas, beggars.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroaki Kuromiya, ''The Voices of the Dead: Stalin's Great Terror in the 1930s.''

====Population transfer====
{{Main|Population transfer in the Soviet Union}}

&lt;!-- Please add factual material to the main article, and keep only summary here. --&gt;
Shortly before, during and immediately after World War II, Stalin conducted a series of [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|deportations]] on a huge scale that profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that between 1941 and 1949 nearly 3.3&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name=&quot;Boobbyer 2000 p=130&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boobbyer|2000|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pohl, Otto, ''Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937–1949'', ISBN 0-313-30921-3&lt;/ref&gt; were deported to [[Siberia]] and the Central Asian republics. By some estimates up to 43% of the resettled population died of [[infectious diseases|diseases]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/USSR.TAB1B.GIF |title=Soviet Transit, Camp, and Deportation Death Rates |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separatism, resistance to Soviet rule and collaboration with the invading Germans were cited as the official reasons for the deportations, rightly or wrongly. Individual circumstances of those spending time in German-occupied territories were not examined.&lt;ref name=&quot;bullock904&quot;&gt;[[Alan Bullock]], pp. 904–905&lt;/ref&gt; After the brief Nazi occupation of the Caucasus, the entire population of five of the small highland peoples and the Crimean Tatars{{spaced ndash}}more than a million people in total – were deported without notice or any opportunity to take their possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bullock904&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of Stalin's lack of trust in the loyalty of particular ethnicities, ethnic groups such as the [[Koryo-saram|Soviet Koreans]], the [[Volga Germans]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], the [[Chechens]], and many [[Poles]] were forcibly moved out of strategic areas and relocated to places in the central Soviet Union, especially Kazakhstan in [[Soviet Central Asia]]. By some estimates, hundreds of thousands of deportees may have died en route.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boobbyer 2000 p=130&quot; /&gt;

According to official Soviet estimates, more than 14 million people passed through the ''Gulag'' from 1929 to 1953, with a further 7 to 8&amp;nbsp;million being [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|deported and exiled]] to remote areas of the Soviet Union (including the entire nationalities in several cases).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest in ''Victims of Stalinism: A Comment.'' Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 49, No. 7 (Nov. 1997), pp. 1317–1319 states:&quot;We are all inclined to accept the Zemskov totals (even if not as complete) with their 14 million intake to Gulag 'camps' alone, to which must be added 4–5&amp;nbsp;million going to Gulag 'colonies', to say nothing of the 3.5&amp;nbsp;million already in, or sent to, 'labour settlements'. However taken, these are surely 'high' figures.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1956, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] condemned the deportations as a violation of [[Leninism]], and reversed most of them, although it was not until 1991 that the Tatars, [[Meskheti]]ans and Volga Germans were allowed to return ''en masse'' to their homelands. The deportations had a profound effect on the peoples of the Soviet Union. The memory of the deportations has played a major part in the separatist movements in the Baltic States, [[Tatarstan]] and [[Chechnya]], even today.

===Collectivization===
{{Main|Collectivization in the Soviet Union}}
Stalin's regime moved to force [[collective farming|collectivization]] of agriculture. This was intended to increase agricultural output from large-scale mechanized farms, to bring the peasantry under more direct political control, and to make tax collection more efficient. Collectivization brought social change on a scale not seen since the abolition of serfdom in 1861 and [[wiktionary:alienate|alienation]] from control of the land and its produce. Collectivization also meant a drastic drop in living standards for many peasants, and it faced violent reaction among the peasantry.

In the first years of collectivization it was estimated that industrial production would rise by 200% and agricultural production by 50%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?HistoryID=ac14&amp;ParagraphID=qxe#qxe|accessdate=19 July 2008|title=The rise of Stalin: AD1921–1924|work=History of Russia|publisher=HistoryWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these expectations were not realized. Stalin blamed this unanticipated failure on [[kulaks]] (rich peasants), who resisted collectivization. However, kulaks proper made up only 4% of the peasant population; the &quot;kulaks&quot; that Stalin targeted included the slightly better-off peasants who took the brunt of violence from the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]] and the Komsomol. These peasants were about 60% of the population. Those officially defined as &quot;kulaks,&quot; &quot;kulak helpers,&quot; and later &quot;ex-kulaks&quot; were to be shot, placed into Gulag [[labor camp]]s, or deported to remote areas of the country, depending on the charge. Archival data indicates that 20,201 people were executed during 1930, the year of [[Dekulakization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuromiya pg2&quot; /&gt;

The two-stage progress of collectivization—interrupted for a year by Stalin's famous editorials, &quot;Dizzy with success&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stalin, Joseph, ''[http://www.marx2mao.com/Stalin/DS30.html Dizzy with success]'', ''[[Pravda]]'', 2 March 1930&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Reply to Collective Farm Comrades&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stalin, Joseph, [http://www.marx2mao.com/Stalin/RCFC30.html ''Reply to Collective Farm Comrades''], ''Pravda'', 3 April 1930&lt;/ref&gt;—is a prime example of his capacity for tactical political withdrawal followed by intensification of initial strategies.

The USSR also experienced a major [[Soviet Famine of 1947|famine in 1947]] as a result of war damage and severe droughts, but economist Michael Ellman argues that it could have been prevented if the government had not mismanaged its grain reserves. The famine cost an estimated 1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million lives as well as secondary population losses due to [[fertility rate|reduced fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Ellman, although the 1946 drought was severe, government mismanagement of its grain reserves largely accounted for the population losses.

====Ukrainian famine====
{{Main|Holodomor}}
The Holodomor famine is sometimes referred to as the [[Ukrainian Genocide]], implying it was engineered by the Soviet government, specifically targeting the Ukrainian people to destroy the Ukrainian nation as a political factor and social entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Findings of the Commission on the Ukraine Famine|url=http://www.faminegenocide.com/resources/findings.html|publisher=Famine Genocide|date=19 April 1988}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.skrobach.com/ukrhol.htm|title=Statement by Pope John Paul II on the 70th anniversary of the Famine|accessdate=23 August 2008|publisher=Skrobach}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.artukraine.com/famineart/uscongr4.htm|title=Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the man-made famine that occurred in Ukraine in 1932–1933|publisher=US House of Representatives|date=21 October 2003|accessdate=23 August 2008}} See also: {{Cite journal|author=Yaroslav Bilinsky|title=Was the Ukrainian Famine of 1932–1933 Genocide?|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|year=1999|volume=1|issue=2|pages=147–156|url=http://www.faminegenocide.com/resources/bilinsky.html|doi=10.1080/14623529908413948|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; While historians continue to disagree whether the policies that led to Holodomor fall under the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|legal definition of genocide]], twenty-six countries have officially recognized the Holodomor as such. On 28 November 2006, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a bill declaring the Soviet-era forced famine an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lisova |first=Natasha |title=Ukraine Recognize Famine As Genocide |agency=Associated Press |date=28 November 2006 |url=http://www.ukemonde.com/holodomor/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Michael Ellman concludes that Ukrainians were victims of genocide in 1932–33 according to a more [[Genocide definitions|relaxed definition]] that is favored by some specialists in the field of genocide studies. He asserts that Soviet policies greatly exacerbated the famine's death toll. Although 1.8&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of grain were exported during the height of the starvation—enough to feed 5 million people for one year-the use of torture and execution to extract grain under the [[Law of Spikelets]], the use of force to prevent starving peasants from fleeing the worst-affected areas, and the refusal to import grain or secure international humanitarian aid to alleviate conditions led to incalcuable human suffering in the Ukraine. It would appear that Stalin intended to use the starvation as a cheap and efficient means (as opposed to deportations and shootings) to kill off those deemed to be &quot;counterrevolutionaries,&quot; &quot;idlers,&quot; and &quot;thieves,&quot; but not to annihilate the Ukrainian peasantry as a whole. Ellman also claims that, while this was not the only Soviet genocide (e.g., the [[Polish operation of the NKVD]]), it was the worst in terms of mass casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellman&quot;&gt;[http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/mjellman/ Michael Ellman],

===Industrialization===
The Russian Civil War and [[wartime communism]] had a devastating effect on the country's economy. Industrial output in 1922 was 13% of that in 1914. A recovery followed under the [[New Economic Policy]], which allowed a degree of market flexibility within the context of socialism. Under Stalin's direction, this was replaced by a system of centrally ordained &quot;Five-Year Plans&quot; in the late 1920s. These called for a highly ambitious program of state-guided crash industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture.
[[File:Stalin kanal.jpg|thumb|240px|Stalin on building of [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]]. It was constructed from 1932 to 1937 by [[Gulag]] prisoners.]]
With seed capital unavailable because of international reaction to Communist policies, little [[international trade]], and virtually no modern infrastructure, Stalin's government financed industrialization both by restraining consumption on the part of ordinary Soviet citizens to ensure that capital went for re-investment into industry, and by ruthless extraction of wealth from the kulaks.

In 1933 workers' real earnings sank to about one-tenth of the 1926 level.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Common and political prisoners in [[labor camp]]s were forced to perform unpaid labor, and communists and [[Komsomol]] members were frequently &quot;mobilized&quot; for various construction projects. The Soviet Union used numerous foreign experts to design new factories, supervise construction, instruct workers and improve manufacturing processes. The most notable foreign contractor was [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn's]] firm that designed and built 521 factories between 1930 and 1932. As a rule, factories were supplied with imported equipment.

In spite of early breakdowns and failures, the first two Five-Year Plans achieved rapid industrialization from a very low economic base. While it is generally agreed that the Soviet Union achieved significant levels of economic growth under Stalin, the precise rate of growth is disputed. It is not disputed, however, that these gains were accomplished at the cost of millions of lives. Official Soviet estimates stated the annual rate of growth at 13.9%; Russian and Western estimates gave lower figures of 5.8% and even 2.9%. Indeed, one estimate is that Soviet growth became temporarily much higher after Stalin's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ipn.lexi.net/images/uploaded/12-402934626c558--charles_steele_chapter6.pdf|title=Sustainable Development: Promoting Progress or Perpetuating Poverty?|author=Charles N.

According to Robert Lewis, the Five-Year Plan substantially helped to modernize the previously backward Soviet economy. New products were developed, and the scale and efficiency of existing production greatly increased. Some innovations were based on indigenous technical developments, others on imported foreign technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Robert Lewis|title=The Economic Transformation of the Soviet Union|coauthors=ed. Mark Harrison, [[R.W. Davies]], [[S.G. Wheatcroft]]|page=188|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its costs, the industrialization effort allowed the Soviet Union to fight, and ultimately win, World War II.

===Science===
{{Main|Science and technology in the Soviet Union|Suppressed research in the Soviet Union}}
Science in the [[Soviet Union]] was under strict ideological control by Stalin and his government, along with art and literature. There was significant progress in &quot;ideologically safe&quot; domains, owing to the free [[Soviet education]] system and state-financed research. However, the most notable legacy during Stalin's time was his public endorsement of the agronomist [[Trofim Lysenko]], who rejected [[Mendelian genetics]] as &quot;[[bourgeois pseudoscience]]&quot; and instead supported hybridization theories that caused widespread agricultural destruction and major setbacks in Soviet knowledge in biology. Although many scientists opposed his views, those who publicly came out were imprisoned and denounced. Some areas of physics were criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olival Freire, Jr.]]: ''[http://anikov.myweb.uga.edu/intel/freire.pdf Marxism and the Quantum Controversy: Responding to Max Jammer's Question]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Péter Szegedi ''[http://hps.elte.hu/~szegedi/cikkek/coldw.doc Cold War and Interpretations in Quantum Mechanics]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social services===
Under the Soviet government people benefited from some social liberalization. Girls were given an adequate, equal education and women had equal rights in employment,&lt;ref name=&quot;RedTsar&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2011}} improving lives for women and families. Stalinist development also contributed to advances in health care, which significantly increased the lifespan and quality of life of the typical Soviet citizen.&lt;ref name=&quot;RedTsar&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2011}} Stalin's policies granted the Soviet people universal access to healthcare and education, effectively creating the first generation free from the fear of [[typhus]], [[cholera]], and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Montefiore-Stalin&quot;&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore.

The generation born during Stalin's rule was the first near-universally literate generation. Millions benefited from mass literacy campaigns in the 1930s, and from workers training schemes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Acton-Tsarist&quot;&gt;Acton, Edward, ''Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy'', Longmann Group Ltd (1995) ISBN 0-582-08922-0&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2011}} Engineers were sent abroad to learn industrial technology, and hundreds of foreign engineers were brought to Russia on contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montefiore-Stalin&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2011}} Transport links were improved and many new railways built.

===Culture===
{{Main|Socialist Realism}}
[[File:Marshall Stalin.jpg|thumb|Propaganda portrait of &quot;Marshal Stalin&quot;, [[WW II]]]]
Although he was [[Georgians|Georgian]] by birth, Stalin became a [[Russia#Soviet_Russia|Russian nationalist]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AdlerPouwels2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip J. Adler|author2=Randall L. Pouwels|title=World Civilizations: Since 1500|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=swBD0hF2BxwC&amp;pg=PA590|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-91302-3|pages=590–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly promoted Russian history, language, and Russian national heroes, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s. He held the Russians up as the elder brothers of the non-Russian minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Russia|year=2007|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Stalin's reign the official and long-lived style of Socialist Realism was established for painting, sculpture, music, drama and literature. Previously fashionable &quot;revolutionary&quot; [[expressionism]], [[abstract art]], and [[Russian avant-garde|avant-garde]] experimentation were discouraged or denounced as &quot;[[formalism (art)|formalism]]&quot;.

The degree of Stalin's personal involvement in general, and in specific instances, has been the subject of discussion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Stalin's favorite novel ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', shared similarities{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} with [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film, ''[[Ivan the Terrible (film)|Ivan the Terrible]]'', produced under Stalin's tutelage.

In architecture, a [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Empire Style]] (basically, updated [[neoclassicism]] on a very large scale, exemplified by the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]] of Moscow) replaced the [[constructivist architecture|constructivism]] of the 1920s. Stalin's rule had a largely disruptive effect on indigenous cultures within the Soviet Union, though the politics of [[Korenizatsiya]] and forced development were possibly beneficial to the integration of later generations of indigenous cultures.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stalin church 1939.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of &quot;Stalin a great friend of religion&quot;, when churches were allowed to be opened during World War II.]] --&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in the Soviet Union}}
Although raised in the Georgian Orthodox faith, Stalin was an atheist. Stalin followed the position adopted by Lenin that religion was an opiate that needed to be removed in order to construct the ideal communist society. His government promoted [[atheism]] through special atheistic education in schools, anti-religious propaganda, the antireligious work of public institutions ([[Society of the Godless]]), discriminatory laws, and a terror campaign against religious believers. By the late 1930s it had become dangerous to be publicly associated with religion.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin's role in the fortunes of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is complex. Continuous persecution in the 1930s resulted in its near-extinction as a public institution: by 1939, active parishes numbered in the low hundreds (down from 54,000 in 1917), many churches had been leveled, and tens of thousands of priests, monks and nuns were persecuted and killed. Over 100,000 were shot during the purges of 1937–1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|author=Alexander N.

The Russian Orthodox Church Synod's recognition of the Soviet government and of Stalin personally led to a schism with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]].

Just days before Stalin's death, certain religious sects [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union#Religious persecution|were outlawed and persecuted]]. Many religions popular in ethnic regions of the Soviet Union, including the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Baptists]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Judaism]] underwent ordeals similar to that which the Orthodox churches in other parts of the country suffered: thousands of monks were persecuted, and hundreds of churches, [[synagogue]]s, [[mosque]]s, temples, sacred monuments, monasteries and other religious buildings were razed. Stalin had a different policy outside the Soviet Union; he supported the Communist [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] Muslim separatists under [[Ehmetjan Qasim]] in the [[Ili Rebellion]] against the Anti Communist [[Republic of China]] regime. He supplied weapons to the Uyghur Ili army and Red Army support against Chinese forces, and helped them establish the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] of which Islam was the official state religion.

===Theorist===
{{Main|Stalinism}}
Stalin and his supporters have highlighted the notion that socialism can be built and consolidated by a country (&quot;[[Socialism in One Country]]&quot;) as underdeveloped as Russia during the 1920s. Indeed this might be the only means in which it could be built in a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph V.Stalin. &quot;Voprosy leninizma&quot;, 2nd ed., Moscow, p. 589; (1951) &quot;Istoricheskij materializm&quot;, ed. by F. B. Konstantinov, Moscow, p. 402; P. Calvert (1982). &quot;The Concept of Class&quot;, New York, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Stalin put forward the theory of [[aggravation of class struggle under socialism|aggravation of the class struggle along with the development of socialism]], arguing that the further the country would move forward, the more acute forms of struggle will be used by the doomed remnants of exploiter classes in their last desperate efforts{{spaced ndash}}and that, therefore, political repression was necessary.

In 1936, Stalin announced that the society of the Soviet Union consisted of two non-antagonistic classes: workers and [[kolkhoz]] peasantry. These corresponded to the two different forms of property over the [[means of production]] that existed in the Soviet Union: state property (for the workers) and collective property (for the peasantry). In addition to these, Stalin distinguished the stratum of [[intelligentsia]]. The concept of &quot;non-antagonistic classes&quot; was entirely new to Leninist theory. Among Stalin's contributions to Communist theoretical literature were &quot;[[Dialectical and Historical Materialism]],&quot; &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot;, &quot;Trotskyism or Leninism&quot;, and &quot;The Principles of Leninism.&quot;

==Calculating the number of victims==
Before the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, researchers who attempted to count the number of people killed under Stalin's regime produced estimates ranging from 3 to 60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Stalin|title=Twentieth Century Atlas – Death Tolls}} See also: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: ''The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956'', 1973–1976 ISBN 0-8133-3289-3&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]], evidence from the Soviet archives also became available, containing official records of the execution of approximately 800,000 prisoners under Stalin for either political or criminal offenses, around 1.7&amp;nbsp;million deaths in the Gulags and some 390,000 deaths during kulak [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced resettlement]]{{spaced ndash}}with a total of about 3 million officially recorded victims in these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G.

===Soviets stop the Germans===
While the Germans pressed forward, Stalin was confident of an eventual Allied victory over Germany. In September 1941, Stalin told British diplomats that he wanted two agreements: (1) a mutual assistance/aid pact and (2) a recognition that, after the war, the Soviet Union would gain the territories in countries that it had taken pursuant to its division of Eastern Europe with Hitler in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British agreed to assistance but refused to agree upon the territorial gains, which Stalin accepted months later as the military situation deteriorated somewhat in mid-1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars114&quot; /&gt; By December 1941, Hitler's troops had advanced to within 20 miles of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars88&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, the Soviets launched a counteroffensive, pushing German troops back 40–50 miles from Moscow, the [[Wehrmacht]]'s first significant defeat of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars88&quot; /&gt;

In 1942, Hitler shifted his primary goal from an immediate victory in the East, to the more long-term goal of securing the southern Soviet Union to conquer oil fields vital to a long-term German war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars117&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=117–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1942, Hitler praised the efficiency of the Soviet military industry and Stalin: {{quote|Stalin, too, must command our unconditional respect.

===Soviet push to Germany===
The Soviets repulsed the important [[Operation Blau|German strategic southern campaign]] and, although 2.5&amp;nbsp;million Soviet casualties were suffered in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars155&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars180&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties later agreed that Britain and America would launch a cross-channel invasion of France in May 1944, along with a separate invasion of southern France.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars185&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, which Churchill opposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars186&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=186–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars194&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=194–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Operation Bagration]], a massive offensive in [[Belorussia]] against the German Army Group Centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars199&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=199–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final victory===
By April 1945, Nazi Germany faced its last days with 1.9&amp;nbsp;million German soldiers in the East fighting 6.4&amp;nbsp;million Red Army soldiers while 1 million German soldiers in the West battled 4&amp;nbsp;million Western Allied soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;glantz.sgw&quot;&gt;Glantz, David, ''The Soviet-German War 1941–45: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay'', 11 October 2001 [http://www.strom.clemson.edu/publications/sg-war41-45.pdf Clemson.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; While initial talk existed of a [[race to Berlin]] by the Allies, after Stalin successfully lobbied for Eastern Germany to fall within the Soviet &quot;sphere of influence&quot; at [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], no plans were made by the [[Western Allies]] to seize the city by a ground operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor194&quot;&gt;Beevor, Antony, ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'', Viking, Penguin Books, 2005, ISBN 0-670-88695-5, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Andrew (2005).

===Allied conferences on post-war Europe===
[[File:Yalta summit 1945 with Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin.jpg|right|thumb|The Big Three: [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Stalin at the [[Yalta Conference]], February 1945.]]
Stalin met in several [[List of World War II conferences|conferences]] with British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] (and later [[Clement Attlee]]) and/or U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (and later [[Harry Truman]]) to plan [[military strategy]] and, later, to discuss Europe's postwar reorganization. Very early conferences, such as that with British diplomats in [[Moscow Conference (1941)|Moscow in 1941]] and with Churchill and American diplomats in [[Moscow Conference (1942)|Moscow in 1942]], focused mostly upon war planning and supply, though some preliminary postwar reorganization discussion also occurred. In 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in the [[Tehran Conference]]. In 1944, Stalin met with Churchill in the [[Moscow Conference (1944)|Moscow Conference]]. Beginning in late 1944, the [[Red Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe during these conferences and the discussions shifted to a more intense focus on the reorganization of postwar Europe.

In February 1945, at the [[Yalta Conference|conference at Yalta]], Stalin demanded a Soviet sphere of political influence in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars241&quot; /&gt; Stalin eventually was convinced by Churchill and Roosevelt not to dismember Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars241&quot; /&gt; Stalin also stated that the [[Polish government-in-exile]] demands for self-rule were not negotiable, such that the Soviet Union would keep the territory of eastern Poland they had already [[Soviet invasion of Poland|taken by invasion with German consent in 1939]], and wanted the pro-Soviet Polish government installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars241&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; After resistance by Churchill and Roosevelt, Stalin promised a re-organization of the current [[Polish Committee of National Liberation|Communist puppet government]] on a broader democratic basis in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars241&quot; /&gt; He stated the new government's primary task would be to prepare elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig47&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=47–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties at Yalta further agreed that the countries of liberated Europe and former Axis satellites would be allowed to &quot;create democratic institutions of their own choice&quot;, pursuant to &quot;the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yaltareport&quot;&gt;11 February 1945 Potsdam Report, ''reprinted in'' Potsdam Ashley, John, Soames Grenville and Bernard Wasserstein, ''The Major International Treaties of the Twentieth Century: A History and Guide with Texts'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001 ISBN 0-415-23798-X&lt;/ref&gt; The parties also agreed to help those countries form interim governments &quot;pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections&quot; and &quot;facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yaltareport&quot; /&gt; After the re-organization of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]], the parties agreed that the new party shall &quot;be pledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yaltareport&quot; /&gt; One month after Yalta, the Soviet NKVD arrested 16 Polish leaders wishing to participate in provisional government negotiations, for alleged &quot;crimes&quot; and &quot;diversions&quot;, which drew protest from the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig47&quot; /&gt; The [[Polish legislative election, 1947|fraudulent Polish elections]], held in January 1947 resulted in Poland's official transformation to undemocratic [[People's Republic of Poland|communist]] state by 1949.

[[File:Potsdam conference 1945-8.jpg|left|thumb|[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]], [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] and Joseph Stalin at the [[Potsdam Conference]], July 1945.]]At the [[Potsdam Conference]] from July to August 1945, though Germany had surrendered months earlier, instead of withdrawing Soviet forces from Eastern European countries, Stalin had not moved those forces. At the beginning of the conference, Stalin repeated previous promises to Churchill that he would refrain from a &quot;Sovietization&quot; of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars274&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=274–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens' survival, which worried Truman and Churchill who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for Western powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig90&quot; /&gt;

In addition to reparations, Stalin pushed for &quot;[[war booty]]&quot;, which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig90&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=90–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1945, Stalin's troops effectively controlled the Baltic States, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, and refugees were fleeing out of these countries fearing a Communist take-over. The western allies, and especially Churchill, were suspicious of the motives of Stalin, who had already installed communist governments in the [[central European]] countries under his influence.

In these conferences, his first appearances on the world stage, Stalin proved to be a formidable negotiator. [[Anthony Eden]], the British Foreign Secretary noted: &quot;Marshal Stalin as a negotiator was the toughest proposition of all. Indeed, after something like thirty years' experience of international conferences of one kind and another, if I had to pick a team for going into a conference room, Stalin would be my first choice. Of course the man was ruthless and of course he knew his purpose. He never wasted a word. He never stormed, he was seldom even irritated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Anthony Eden|authorlink=Anthony Eden|year=1965|title=Memoirs: The Reckoning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Soviet forces remained in Eastern and Central European countries, with the beginnings of communist puppet regimes in those countries, Churchill referred to the region as being behind an &quot;[[Iron Curtain]]&quot; of control from Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Muller, James W., ''Churchill's &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; Speech Fifty Years Later'', University of Missouri Press, 1999, ISBN 0-8262-1247-6, pp. 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lewis Gaddis|Gaddis, John Lewis]], ''We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History'', Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 1998, ISBN 0-19-878071-0&lt;/ref&gt; The countries under Soviet control in Eastern and Central Europe were sometimes called the &quot;[[Eastern bloc]]&quot; or &quot;Soviet Bloc&quot;.
[[File:EasternBloc BasicMembersOnly.svg|right|thumb|The [[Eastern Bloc]] until 1989]]
In Soviet-controlled [[East Germany]], the major task of the ruling communist party in Germany was to channel Soviet orders down to both the administrative apparatus and the other bloc parties pretending that these were initiatives of its own,&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=95–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; with deviations potentially leading to reprimands, imprisonment, torture and even death.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig95&quot; /&gt; Property and industry were nationalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig95&quot; /&gt;

The [[German Democratic Republic]] was declared on 7 October 1949, with a new constitution which enshrined socialism and gave the Soviet-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) control. In Berlin, after citizens strongly rejected communist candidates in an election, in June 1948, the Soviet Union [[Berlin Blockade|blockaded West Berlin]], the portion of Berlin not under Soviet control, cutting off all supply of food and other items. The blockade failed due to the unexpected massive aerial resupply campaign carried out by the Western powers known as the [[Berlin Airlift]]. In 1949, Stalin conceded defeat and ended the blockade.

While Stalin had promised at the [[Yalta Conference]] that free elections would be held in Poland,&lt;ref name=&quot;yaltareport&quot; /&gt; after an election failure in &quot;[[Polish people's referendum, 1946|3 times YES]]&quot; elections,&lt;ref&gt;Curp, David, ''A Clean Sweep?: The Politics of Ethnic Cleansing in Western Poland, 1945–1960'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2006, ISBN 1-58046-238-3, pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; [[electoral fraud|vote rigging]] was employed to win a majority in the carefully controlled poll.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-28216 &quot;Poland.&quot;] Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007.

During World War II, in Bulgaria, the Red Army crossed the border and created the conditions for a communist [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état]] on the following night.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet military commander in Sofia assumed supreme authority, and the communists whom he instructed, including [[Kimon Georgiev]], took full control of domestic politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig50&quot; /&gt;

In 1949, the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], and [[Communist Romania|Romania]] founded the [[Comecon]] in accordance with Stalin's desire to enforce Soviet domination of the lesser states of Central Europe and to mollify some states that had expressed interest in the [[Marshall Plan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;loc-cs&quot;&gt;Germany (East), Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html ''Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance'']&lt;/ref&gt; and which were now, increasingly, cut off from their traditional markets and suppliers in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;bideleaux&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had remained interested in Marshall aid despite the requirements for a [[convertible currency]] and [[market economy|market economies]]. In July 1947, Stalin ordered these communist-dominated governments to pull out of the Paris Conference on the European Recovery Programme. This has been described as &quot;the moment of truth&quot; in the post–World War II division of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;bideleaux&quot; /&gt;

In Greece, Britain and the United States supported the anti-communists in the [[Greek Civil War]] and suspected the Soviets of supporting the Greek communists, although Stalin refrained from getting involved in Greece, dismissing the movement as premature. Albania remained an ally of the Soviet Union, but [[Yugoslavia]] [[Tito-Stalin split|broke with the USSR]] in 1948.

In Stalin's last year of life, one of his last major foreign policy initiatives was the 1952 [[Stalin Note]] for [[German reunification]] and [[Superpower disengagement]] from Central Europe, but Britain, France, and the United States viewed this with suspicion and rejected the offer.

===Sino-Soviet relations===
[[File:Chinese stamp in 1950.jpg|thumb|Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]] on Chinese postage stamp]]
In Asia, the Red Army had overrun [[Manchuria]] in the last month of the war and then also occupied Korea above the [[38th parallel north]]. [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Communist Party of China]], though receptive to minimal Soviet support, defeated the pro-Western and heavily American-assisted Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]], KMT) in the [[Chinese Civil War]].

There was friction between Stalin and Mao from the beginning. During World War II Stalin had supported the dictator of China, [[Chiang Kai-Shek]], as a bulwark against Japan and had turned a blind eye to Chiang's mass killings of communists. He generally put his alliance with Chiang against Japan ahead of helping his ideological allies in China in his priorities. Even after the war Stalin concluded a non-aggression pact between the USSR and Chiang's KMT regime in China and instructed Mao and the Chinese communists to cooperate with Chiang and the KMT after the war. Mao did not follow Stalin's instructions though and started a communist revolution against Chiang. Stalin did not believe Mao would be successful so he was less than enthusiastic in helping Mao. The USSR continued to maintain diplomatic relations with Chiang's KMT regime until 1949 when it became clear Mao would win.

Stalin supported the Turkic Muslims known today as [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] in seeking their own state, [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] during the [[Ili Rebellion]] against the [[Republic of China]]. He backed the Uyghur Communist Muslim leader [[Ehmetjan Qasim]] against the anti Communist Chinese Kuomintang forces.

Stalin did conclude a new friendship and alliance treaty with Mao after he defeated Chiang. But there was still a lot of tension between the two leaders and resentment by Mao for Stalin's less than enthusiastic help during the civil war in China.

The Communists controlled mainland China while the Nationalists held a [[rump state]] on the island of Taiwan. The Soviet Union soon after recognized Mao's People's Republic of China, which it regarded as a new ally. The People's Republic claimed Taiwan, though it had never held authority there.
[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|240 px|[[Mao Zedong|Mao]] at Stalin's 70th birthday celebration in Moscow, December 1949 ]]
Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and China reached a high point with the signing of the 1950 [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance]]. Both countries provided military support to a new friendly state in North Korea. After various Korean border conflicts, war broke out with U.S.-allied South Korea in 1950, starting the [[Korean War]].

However, not surprisingly, the relations with the Kuomintang deteriorated. In 1951, in Taiwan, the [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] Kuomintang General [[Bai Chongxi]] made a speech broadcast on radio to the entire Muslim world calling for a war against Russia, claiming that the &quot;imperialist ogre&quot; leader Stalin was engineering World War III, and Bai also called upon Muslims to avoid the Indian leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], accusing him of being blind to Soviet imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moslems Urged To Resist Russia|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=25 September 1951|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/275861742.html?dids=275861742:275861742&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Sep+25%2C+1951&amp;author=&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Moslems+Urged+To+Resist+Russia&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINESE ASKS ALL MOSLEMS TO FIGHT REDS|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=24 September 1951|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/497978032.html?dids=497978032:497978032&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep+24%2C+1951&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=CHINESE+ASKS+ALL+MOSLEMS+TO+FIGHT+REDS&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
Contrary to America's policy which restrained armament (limited equipment was provided for infantry and police forces) to South Korea, Stalin extensively armed [[Kim Il Sung]]'s North Korean army and air forces with military equipment (to include T-34/85 tanks) and &quot;advisors&quot; far in excess of those required for defensive purposes) in order to facilitate Kim's (a former Soviet Officer) aim of conquering the rest of the Korean peninsula.

The [[Korean People's Army|North Korean Army]] struck in the pre-dawn hours of Sunday, 25 June 1950, crossing the 38th parallel behind a firestorm of artillery, beginning their invasion of South Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title= A Short History of the Korean War|last=Stokesbury |first= James L|year= 1990|publisher=Harper Perennial |location= New York|isbn= 0-688-09513-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War]], Soviet pilots flew Soviet aircraft from Chinese bases against United Nations aircraft defending South Korea. Post–Cold War research in Soviet Archives has revealed that the Korean War was begun by Kim Il-sung with the express permission of Stalin, though this is disputed by North Korea.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Israel===
Stalin originally supported the creation of Israel in 1948. The USSR was one of the first nations to recognize the new country.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Brown, Philip Marshall. &quot;The Recognition of Israel&quot;, ''American Journal of International Law'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;42, No.&amp;nbsp;3 (Jul. 1948), p.&amp;nbsp;620&lt;/ref&gt; [[Golda Meir]] came to Moscow as the first Israeli Ambassador to the USSR that year. However, after providing [[war materiel]] for Israel through Czechoslovakia ([[Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947–1949]]), Stalin later changed his mind and came out against Israel.

===''Falsifiers of History''===
In 1948, Stalin personally edited and rewrote by hand sections of the cold war book ''[[Falsifiers of History]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Falsifiers'' was published in response to the documents made public in ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'',&lt;ref name=&quot;henig67&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts96&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included the secret protocols of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and other secret German-Soviet relations documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;henig67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=80–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Falsifiers'' originally appeared as a series of articles in ''[[Pravda]]'' in February 1948,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts96&quot; /&gt; and was subsequently published in numerous language and distributed worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book did not attempt to directly counter or deal with the documents published in ''Nazi-Soviet Relations''&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rather, focused upon Western culpability for the outbreak of war in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot; /&gt; It argues that &quot;Western powers&quot; aided Nazi rearmament and aggression, including that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.&lt;ref name=&quot;henig67&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot; /&gt; It depicted the Soviet Union as striving to negotiate a collective security against Hitler, while being thwarted by double-dealing Anglo-French appeasers who, despite appearances, had no intention of a Soviet alliance and were secretly negotiating with Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot; /&gt; It casts the [[Munich agreement]], not just as Anglo-French short-sightedness or cowardice, but as a &quot;secret&quot; agreement that was a &quot;a highly important phase in their policy aimed at goading the Hitlerite aggressors against the Soviet Union.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taubert|2003|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offers to join the Axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;nekrich202&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events until [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nekrich202&quot; /&gt;

===Domestic support===
Domestically, Stalin was seen as a great wartime leader who had led the Soviets to victory against the Nazis.

An increasingly nationalistic emphasis on Russian history and achievements became a salient feature of Soviet culture in the 1940s. At the end of May 1945, Stalin proposed a victory toast to the Soviet people, and to the virtues of the Russian majority in particular: 
{{quote|I should like to propose a toast to the health of our Soviet people, and in the first place, the Russian people. (Loud and prolonged applause and shouts of 'Hurrah.')

I drink in the first place to the health of the Russian people because it is the most outstanding nation of all the nations forming the Soviet Union.
&lt;br /&gt;
I propose a toast to the health of the Russian people because it has won in this war universal recognition as the leading force of the Soviet Union among all the peoples of our country.
&lt;br /&gt;
I propose a toast to the health of the Russian people not only because it is the leading people, but also because it possesses a clear mind, a staunch character, and patience.&lt;ref&gt;Stalin, J. V. (1945). [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1945/05/24.htm &quot;Toast to the Russian People at a Reception in Honour of Red Army Commanders Given by the Soviet Government in the Kremlin on Thursday, May 24, 1945&quot;.] In ''War Speeches, Orders of the Day and Answers to Foreign Correspondents During the Great Patriotic War''. Hutchinson &amp; Co., Ltd., London, 1946. [[Marxists Internet Archive]]. Retrieved 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various foreign scientific discoveries and inventions (such as the [[Wright Brothers]]' airplane) were attributed to Russians in post-war Soviet propaganda. Examples include the [[boiler]], reclaimed by father and son [[Yefim Alekseyevich Cherepanov|Cherepanov]]s; the [[electric light]], by [[Pavel Yablochkov|Yablochkov]] and [[Alexander Nikolayevich Lodygin|Lodygin]]; the radio, by [[Alexander Popov (physicist)|Popov]]; and the airplane, by [[Alexander Mozhaiski|Mozhaysky]]. Stalin's internal repressive policies continued (including in newly acquired territories), but never reached the extremes of the 1930s.

===&quot;Doctors' plot&quot;===
{{Main|Doctors' plot}}
The &quot;Doctors' plot&quot; was a plot outlined by Stalin and Soviet officials in 1952 and 1953 whereby several doctors (over half of whom were Jewish) allegedly attempted to kill Soviet officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;roi103&quot;&gt;Ro'i, Yaacov, ''Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union'', Routledge, 1995, ISBN 0-7146-4619-9, pp. 103–6&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing opinion of many scholars outside the Soviet Union is that Stalin intended to use the resulting doctors' trial to launch a massive party purge.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/167427/Doctors-Plot ''The Doctors' Plot''], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The plot is also viewed by many historians as an [[antisemitic]] provocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;roi103&quot; /&gt; It followed on the heels of the 1952 show trials of the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]]&lt;ref name=&quot;brackman384&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|pp=384–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the secret execution of thirteen members on Stalin's orders in the [[Night of the Murdered Poets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pogrom&quot;&gt;[http://www.joshuarubenstein.com/stalinsecret/intro.html Stalin's Secret Pogrom: The Postwar Inquisition of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee] (introduction) by Joshua Rubenstein&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, in a December [[Politburo]] session, Stalin announced that &quot;Every Jewish nationalist is the agent of the American intelligence service. Jewish nationalists think that their nation was saved by the United States (there you can become rich, bourgeois, etc.). They think they're indebted to the Americans. Among doctors, there are many Jewish nationalists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;From the diary of Vice-Chair of the [[Sovmin]] V.A. Malyshev. See G. Kostyrchenko, ''Gosudarstvennyj antisemitizm v SSSR'', Moscow, 2005, pp. 461, 462&lt;/ref&gt; To mobilize the Soviet people for his campaign, Stalin ordered ''TASS'' and ''Pravda'' to issue stories along with Stalin's alleged uncovering of a &quot;Doctors Plot&quot; to assassinate top Soviet leaders,&lt;ref name=&quot;brent288&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brent|Naumov|2004|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gorlizki158&quot;&gt;Gorlizki, Yoram and Oleg Khlevniuk, ''Cold Peace: Stalin and the Soviet Ruling Circle 1945–1953'', Sourcebooks, Inc., 2005 ISBN 0-19-530420-9, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; including Stalin, in order to set the stage for show trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;zuehlke99&quot;&gt;Zuehlke, Jeffrey, ''Joseph Stalin'', Twenty-First Century Books, 2005, ISBN 0-8225-3421-5, pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;

The next month, Pravda published stories with text regarding the purported &quot;Jewish [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois-nationalist]]&quot; plotters.&lt;ref name='Vicious Spies and Killers under the Mask of Academic Physicians'&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vicious Spies and Killers under the Mask of Academic Physicians|date=13 January 1953|url =http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/vrach-ubijca-e.html|work=Pravda|accessdate =1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikita Khrushchev wrote that Stalin hinted him to incite anti-Semitism in the Ukraine, telling him that &quot;the good workers at the factory should be given clubs so they can beat the hell out of those Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pinkus, Benjamin, ''The Soviet Government and the Jews 1948–1967: A Documented Study'', Cambridge University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-521-24713-6, pp. 107–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brackman390&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin also ordered falsely accused physicians to be tortured &quot;to death&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html &quot;Stalin's torture: 'Beat them to death'&quot;], ''Novaya Gazeta'', 2008.

Vovsi was released by Beria after Stalin's death in 1953, as was his son-in-law, the composer [[Mieczyslaw Weinberg]].

Some historians have argued that Stalin was also planning to send millions of Jews to four large newly built labor camps in Western Russia&lt;ref name=&quot;zuehlke99&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brent295&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brent|Naumov|2004|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a &quot;Deportation Commission&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brackman388&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brent47&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brent|Naumov|2004|pp=47–48 &amp; 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eisenstadt&quot;&gt;Eisenstadt, Yaakov, ''Stalin's Planned Genocide'', 22 Adar 5762, 6 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; that would purportedly act to save Soviet Jews from an engraged Soviet population after the Doctors Plot trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;brackman388&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brent298&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brent|Naumov|2004|pp=298–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitzin, Alexander, ''The Gulag Archipelago'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that any charge of an alleged mass deportation lacks specific documentary evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;gorlizki158&quot; /&gt; Regardless of whether a plot to deport Jews was planned, in his &quot;[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]&quot; in 1956, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] stated that the Doctors Plot was &quot;fabricated ... set up by Stalin&quot;, that Stalin told the judge to beat confessions from the defendants&lt;ref name=&quot;secretspeech&quot;&gt;Khrushchev, Nikita, [http://www.uwm.edu/Course/448-343/index12.html ''Special Report to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union''], Closed session, 24–25 February 1956&lt;/ref&gt; and had told Politburo members &quot;You are blind like young kittens. What will happen without me? The country will perish because you do not know how to recognize enemies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;secretspeech&quot; /&gt;

==Death and aftermath==
Stalin's health deteriorated towards the end of World War II. He suffered from [[atherosclerosis]] from his heavy smoking. He suffered a mild stroke around the time of the Victory Parade, and a severe heart attack in October 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Zhores A. Medvedev, ''The unknown Stalin'' (2006) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

On the early morning hours of 1 March 1953, after an all-night dinner and a movie&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Why Stalin loved Tarzan and wanted John Wayne shot |first=Simon |last=Sebag Montefiore |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=4 June 2004 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3618310/Why-Stalin-loved-Tarzan-and-wanted-John-Wayne-shot.html |accessdate=24 August 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin arrived at his [[Kuntsevo]] residence some 15&amp;nbsp;km west of Moscow centre with interior minister [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and future premiers [[Georgy Malenkov]], [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] where he retired to his bedroom to sleep. At dawn, Stalin did not emerge from his room.

[[File:Stalin Grave.jpg|thumb|left|Stalin's Grave in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]]]]
Although his guards thought that it was odd for him not to rise at his usual time, they were under strict orders not to disturb him and left him alone the entire day. At around 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. he was discovered by Peter Lozgachev, the Deputy Commandant of Kuntsevo, who entered his bedroom to check up on him and recalled a horrifying scene of Stalin lying on his back on the floor of his room beside his bed wearing [[pyjama]] bottoms and an undershirt with his clothes soaked in stale urine. A frightened Lozgachev asked Stalin what happened to him, but all he could get out of the Generalissimo was unintelligible responses that sounded like &quot;Dzhh.&quot; Lozgachev used the bedroom telephone where he frantically called a few party officials telling them that Stalin may have had a stroke and asked them to send good doctors to the Kuntsevo residence immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Последняя тайна Сталина|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/press/newsid_2796000/2796261.stm|publisher=BBC  | date=25 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag-Montefiore|Montefiore Sebag, Simon]]. ''Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar''. p. 634; New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2004 (ISBN 1-4000-4230-5); New York: Vintage, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Lavrentiy Beria was informed and arrived a few hours afterwards, and the doctors only arrived in the early morning of 2 March in which they changed Stalin's bedclothes and tended to him. The bedridden Stalin died four days later, on 5 March 1953,&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; at the age of 74, and was embalmed on 9 March. 

His body was preserved in [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] until 31 October 1961, when his body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] next to the [[Kremlin wall]]s as part of the process of [[de-Stalinization]].

Officially, Stalin died naturally due to a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] (massive stroke). However, in 2003, a joint group of Russian and American historians announced their view that Stalin had ingested flavorless [[warfarin]], a powerful rat poison that inhibits coagulation of the blood and which predisposes the victim to hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral hemorrhage).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brent|Naumov|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recently released autopsy stated that Stalin died naturally from a stroke induced by hypertensive hemorrhage. However, the report also noted cardiac, gastrointestinal and renal hemorrhaging which is inconsistent with a natural death; this is consistent with poisoning by [[warfarin]].  Beria and Khrushchev were in a position to add the tasteless warfarin to Stalin's wine the evening before.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/article.asp?issn=2152-7806;year=2011;volume=2;issue=1;spage=161;epage=161;aulast=Faria Faria M, 2011, Stalin's mysterious death, Surgical Neuroloy International]&lt;/ref&gt;

His demise certainly arrived at a convenient time for [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and others, who feared being swept away in yet another purge. It is believed that Stalin felt Beria's power was too great and threatened his own.&lt;ref&gt;”Stalin was ‘afraid of Beria’, thought Khrushchev, ‘and would have been glad to get rid of him but didn’t know how to do it.’ Stalin himself confirmed this, sensing that Beria was winning support...”. Simon Sebag Montefiore, ''Stalin'', 2003, p. 548. Cf. Nikita Khrushchev, ''Khrushchev remembers'', 1971, pp. 250, 311&lt;/ref&gt;

The political memoirs of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], published in 1993, claimed that Beria had boasted to Molotov that he poisoned Stalin: &quot;I took him out.&quot;
Khrushchev wrote in his (unreliable) memoirs that Beria had, immediately after the stroke, gone about &quot;spewing hatred against [Stalin] and mocking him&quot;, and then, when Stalin showed signs of consciousness, dropped to his knees and kissed his hand. When Stalin fell unconscious again, Beria immediately stood and spat.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore, ''Stalin'', 2003, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested by [[Jože Pirjevec]] that Stalin was assassinated by the order of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in retaliation for assassination attempts on Tito.  A letter was found in Stalin's office from Tito that read: &quot;Stop sending people to kill me. We've already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle... If you don't stop sending killers, I'll send one to Moscow, and I won't have to send a second.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2175385/Did-Tito-poison-Stalin-Historian-claims-Yugoslav-dictator-killed-rival-target-22-Soviet-assassination-attempts.html?ito=feeds-newsxml]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction by successors===
[[File:Grutas Stalin.jpg|thumb|[[Grutas Park]] is home to a monument of Stalin, originally set up in [[Vilnius]].]]
[[File:Goristatue.JPG|thumb|Monument to Stalin stood in Gori, Georgia until 2010 when it was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22453 Stalin Statue Removed from Gori]. ''[[Civil Georgia]]''. 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The harshness with which Soviet affairs were conducted during Stalin's rule was subsequently repudiated by his successors in the Communist Party leadership, most notably by Nikita Khrushchev's repudiation of Stalinism in February 1956. In his &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, ''[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]]'', delivered to a closed session of the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Khrushchev Thaw|Khrushchev denounced Stalin]] for his cult of personality, and his regime for &quot;violation of Leninist norms of legality&quot;.

A 1974 Soviet work describes Stalin's leadership in the following manner:
{{Quote
| text = J. V. Stalin had held, since 1922, the post of General Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee. He had made important contributions to the implementation of the Party’s policy of socialist construction in the USSR, and he had won great popularity by his relentless fight against the anti-Leninist groups of the Trotskyites and Bukharinites. Since the early 1930s, however, all the successes achieved by the Soviet people in the building of socialism began to be arbitrarily attributed to Stalin. Already in a letter written back in 1922 Lenin warned the Party Central Committee: &quot;Comrade Stalin,&quot; he wrote, &quot;having become General Secretary, has concentrated boundless authority in his hands, and I am not sure whether he will always be able to exercise that authority with sufficient discretion.&quot; During the first few years after Lenin’s death Stalin reckoned with his critical remarks. As time passed, however, he abused his position of General Secretary of the Party Central Committee more and more frequently, violating the principle of [[collective leadership]] and making independent decisions on important Party and state issues. Those personal shortcomings of which Lenin had warned manifested themselves with greater and greater insistence: his rudeness, capriciousness, intolerance of criticism, arbitrariness, excessive suspiciousness, etc. This led to unjustified restrictions of democracy, gross violations of socialist legality and repressions against prominent Party, government and military leaders and other people.

Results of a controversial poll taken in 2006 stated that over 35% of Russians would vote for Stalin if he were still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060101facomment85101/sarah-e-mendelson-theodore-p-gerber/failing-the-stalin-test.html|title=Modern Poll{{spaced ndash}}Votes for Stalin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Walker, Shaun|date=14 May 2008|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-why-is-stalin-still-popular-in-russia-despite-the-brutality-of-his-regime-827654.html|title=The Big Question: Why is Stalin still popular in Russia, despite the brutality of his regime?|work=The Independent  |location=UK |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than a third of all Russians regarded Stalin as a &quot;murderous tyrant&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;How Russia faced its dark past&quot;/&gt; however, a Russian court in 2009, ruling on a suit by Stalin's grandson, [[Yevgeny Dzhugashvili]], against the newspaper, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'', ruled that referring to Stalin as a &quot;bloodthirsty cannibal&quot; was not [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/europe/14briefs-Russiabf.html &quot;Russia: Court Rejects Libel Claim by Stalin's Grandson&quot;] [[Associated Press]] article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 13 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2007 poll 54% of the Russian youth agreed that Stalin did more good than bad while 46% (of them) disagreed that Stalin was a &quot;cruel tyrant&quot;. Half of the respondents, aged from 16 to 19, agreed Stalin was a wise leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;/&gt;

In December 2008 Stalin was voted third in the nationwide television project [[Name of Russia (Russia TV)|Name of Russia]] (narrowly behind 13th century prince [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Pyotr Stolypin]], one of Nicholas II's prime ministers). The [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] accused the Kremlin in rigging the poll in order to prevent him or Lenin being given first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Tom Parfitt in Moscow |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/29/stalin-name-of-russia |title=Greatest Russian poll |work=The Guardian  |location=UK |date= 29 December 2008|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Kremlin [[video blog]] posted on 29 October 2009, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] denounced the efforts of people seeking to rehabilitate Stalin's image. He said the mass extermination during the Stalin era cannot be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Galpin |first=Richard |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8334009.stm |title= Medvedev blasts Stalin defenders|date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2010|work=BBC News   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Origin of name, nicknames and pseudonyms===
Stalin's original Georgian name is transliterated as &quot;Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili&quot; ([[Georgian language|Georgian:]] იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი). The Russian transliteration of his name Ио́сиф Виссарио́нович Джугашви́ли is in turn transliterated to English as &quot;Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili&quot;. Like other Bolsheviks, he became commonly known by one of his revolutionary ''[[nom de guerre|noms de guerre]]'', of which &quot;Stalin&quot; was only the last. Prior nicknames included &quot;Koba&quot;, &quot;Soselo&quot;, &quot;Ivanov&quot; and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Montefiore |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Sebag Montefiore |title=Young Stalin |edition=2007 Costa biography winner |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |location=Britain |isbn=0-297-85068-7 |page=395 |chapter=Epilogue |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin is believed to have started using the name &quot;K. Stalin&quot; sometime in 1912 as a pen name.

During Stalin's reign his nicknames included:

===Appearance===

While photographs and portraits portray Stalin as physically massive and majestic (he had several painters shot who did not depict him &quot;right&quot;),&lt;ref name=tolstoy/&gt; he was only five feet four inches tall (160&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=tolstoy&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Nikolai Tolstoy]] |title=Stalin's Secret War| publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston (1981), ISBN 0-03-047266-0| pages=19–21| isbn=0-03-047266-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (President Harry S. Truman, who stood only five feet nine inches himself, described Stalin as &quot;a little squirt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8fp1A2s6aQwC&amp;pg=PA507|page=507|title=Truman |publisher=Simon and Schuster |date=9 April 1952 |accessdate=25 June 2010|first=David|last=McCullough|isbn=978-0-7432-6029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) His mustached face was pock-marked from [[small-pox]] during childhood. After a carriage accident in his youth, his left arm was shortened and stiffened at the elbow, while his right hand was thinner than his left and frequently hidden.&lt;ref name=tolstoy/&gt; Bronze casts made in 1990 from plaster death mask and plaster cards of his hands clearly show a normal right hand and a withered left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Marriages and family===
[[File:Ekaterina Svanidze.jpg|thumb|upright|Ekaterina &quot;Kato&quot; Svanidze, Stalin's first wife]]
[[File:Iosif &amp; Nadezhda.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Stalin and Nadezhda Alliluyeva]]

Stalin's son [[Yakov Dzhugashvili|Yakov]], whom he had with his first wife Ekaterina Svanidze, shot himself because of Stalin's harshness toward him, but survived. After this, Stalin said &quot;He can't even shoot straight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon Sebag Montefiore&quot;&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, Knopf, 2004. page=11 (ISBN 1-4000-4230-5),&lt;/ref&gt; Yakov served in the Red Army during World War II and was captured by the Germans. They offered to exchange him for Field Marshal [[Friedrich Paulus]], who had surrendered after Stalingrad, but Stalin turned the offer down, stating &quot;You have in your hands not only my son Yakov but millions of my sons. Either you free them all or my son will share their fate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941216,00.html|work=Time|title=Historical Notes: The Death of Stalin's Son|date=1 March 1968|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Yakov is said to have committed suicide, running into an electric fence in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], where he was being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/17/world/ex-death-camp-tells-story-of-nazi-and-soviet-horrors.html|title=Ex-Death Camp Tells Story of Nazi + Soviet Horrors|work=New York Times|date=17 December 2001|author=Desmond Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yakov had a son [[Yevgeny Dzhugashvili|Yevgeny]], who is recently noted for defending his grandfather's legacy in Russian courts.

Stalin had a son, [[Vasily Dzhugashvili|Vasiliy]], and a daughter, [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]], with his second wife [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva-Stalina|Nadezhda Alliluyeva]]. She died in 1932, officially of illness. She may have committed suicide by shooting herself after a quarrel with Stalin, leaving a suicide note which according to their daughter was &quot;partly personal, partly political&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Koba the Dread, p. 133, ISBN 0-7868-6876-7; Stalin: The Man and His Era, p. 354, ISBN 0-8070-7001-7, in a footnote he quotes the press announcement as speaking of her &quot;sudden death&quot;; he also cites pp. 103–105 of his daughter's book, ''Twenty Letters to a Friend'', the Russian edition, New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] Biography, there is also a belief among some Russians that Stalin himself murdered his wife after the quarrel, which apparently took place at a dinner in which Stalin tauntingly flicked cigarettes across the table at her.

Vasiliy rose through the ranks of the Soviet air force, officially dying of alcoholism in 1962; however, this is still in question. He distinguished himself in World War II as a capable airman. Svetlana emigrated to the United States in 1967. In March 2001 Russian Independent Television NTV interviewed a previously unknown grandson living in [[Novokuznetsk]], Yuri Davydov, who stated that his father had told him of his lineage, but, was told to keep quiet because of the campaign against Stalin's cult of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1245986.stm | title=Stalin grandson found in Siberia | date=27 March 2001 | accessdate=28 November 2011 | author=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside his suite in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], Stalin had numerous domiciles. In 1919 he started with a country house near Usovo, he added [[dacha]]s at Zuvalova and [[Kuntsevo]] (''[[Blizhny dacha]]'' built by [[Miron Merzhanov]]). Before World War II he added the [[Lipki, Tula Oblast|Lipki]] estate and [[Semyonovskaya]], and had at least four dachas in the south by 1937, including one near [[Sochi]]. A luxury villa near Gagri was given to him by Beria. In Abkhazia he maintained a mountain retreat. After the war he added dachas at Novy Afon, near [[Sukhumi]], in the [[Valdai Hills|Valdai]] Hills, and at Lake Mitsa. Another estate was near Zelyony Myss on the [[Black Sea]]. All these dachas, estates, and palaces were staffed, well furnished and equipped, kept safe by security forces, and were mainly used privately, rarely for diplomatic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Nikolai Tolstoy]] |title=Stalin's Secret War| publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston (1981), ISBN 0-03-047266-0| pages=35–37| isbn=0-03-047266-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between places Stalin would travel by car or train, never by air; he flew only once when attending the 1943 [[Tehran conference]].

In 1967 [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]] defected to the USA and later married [[William Wesley Peters]] and by him had a daughter Olga (surname now Evans).

===Habits===
Stalin enjoyed drinking, but could keep it under control.&lt;ref name = &quot;McCauley92&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=McCauley, |first=Martin |title=Stalin and Stalinism|publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |location=USA |isbn=1-4058-7436-8 |page=92|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would also often force those around him to join in.&lt;ref name = &quot;McCauley92&quot;/&gt; Stalin preferred [[Georgian wine]] over [[Russian vodka]], but usually ate traditional [[Russian food]].&lt;ref name = &quot;McCauley92&quot;/&gt;

He banned any hint of nudity. When Ivan showed a film with a naked woman Stalin shouted: &quot;Are you making a brothel here Bolshakov?&quot; After the war he took control of all of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' films. After the movie had ended, Stalin often invited the audience for dinner, even though the clock was usually past midnight.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khrushchev115&quot;/&gt;

He could play billiards so well he did not seem to aim at the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore, Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar, page 507&lt;/ref&gt; He could read 500 pages a day and had a library of 20,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; He loved hunting and fishing all his life.

===Religion===
Although raised in the Georgian Orthodox faith, Stalin was an atheist. Stalin had a complex relationship with religious institutions in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hector Avalos|Avalos, Hector]], ''Fighting Words: The Origins Of Religious Violence''. by, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Historians Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshakov have suggested that &quot;[Stalin's] atheism remained rooted in some vague idea of a God of nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inside the Kremlin's Cold War: From Stalin to Khrushchev|author=Vladislav Zubok|coauthors=Constantine Pleshakov|page=4|isbn=0-674-45531-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the Second World War Stalin reopened the churches. One reason could have been to motivate the majority of the population who had Christian beliefs. The reasoning behind this is that by changing the official policy of the party and the state towards religion, the Church and its clergymen could be to his disposal in mobilizing the war effort. On 4 September 1943, Stalin invited Metropolitan [[Sergius I of Moscow|Sergius]], Metropolitan [[Alexy I of Moscow|Alexius]] and Metropolitan [[Nicholas (Yarushevich)|Nicholas]] to the Kremlin and proposed to reestablish the [[Moscow Patriarchate]], which had been suspended since 1925, and elect the [[Patriarch of Moscow|Patriarch]]. On 8 September 1943, Metropolitan Sergius was elected patriarch.

The CPSU Central Committee continued to promote atheism and the elimination of religion during the remainder of Stalin's lifetime after the 1943 concordat.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's greater tolerance for religion after 1943 was limited by party machinations. Whether persecutions after World War II were more aimed at certain sections of society over and above detractors is a disputed point.

==Hypotheses, rumors and misconceptions about Stalin==
There are conflicting [[Stalin before the Revolution|accounts of Stalin's birth]], who listed his birth year in various documents as being in 1878 before coming to power in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;dob&quot;&gt;Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's year and date of birth, Iosif Dzhugashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878. This birth date is maintained in his School Leaving Certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, a police arrest record from 18 April 1902 which gave his age as 23 years, and all other surviving pre-Revolution documents. As late as 1921, Stalin himself listed his birthday as 18 December 1878 in a curriculum vitae in his own handwriting. However, after his coming to power in 1922, Stalin changed the date to 21 December 1879 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style date]] 9 December 1879). That became the day his birthday was celebrated in the [[Soviet Union]].{{cite web|url=http://state.rin.ru/cgi-bin/persona_e.pl?id=4140&amp;id_subcat=6&amp;r=8|publisher=State and Power in Russia|accessdate=19 July 2008|title=Prominent figures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase &quot;death of one man is a tragedy, death of a million is a statistic&quot; is sometimes attributed to Stalin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/genocide0.htm |title=Mass crimes against humanity and genocide |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was actually made by the German writer and pacifist [[Erich Maria Remarque]].
