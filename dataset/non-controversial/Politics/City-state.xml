[[File:View on Monacoville.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Monaco]]]]
[[File:Map of Vatican City.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Vatican City]], a city-state well known for being the smallest country in the world.]]

A '''city-state''' is an independent or autonomous entity whose territory consists of a city which is not administered as a part of another local government. A city-state can also be defined as a central city and its surrounding villages, which together follow the same law, have one form of government, and share languages, religious beliefs, and ways of life. Today, only three independent, sovereign city-states exist: [[Monaco]], [[Singapore]], and [[Vatican City]].

==Historical examples of city-states==
Historical examples include the oldest known [[Sumer]]ian cities of [[Uruk]] and [[Ur]], the [[Phoenicia]]n cities of [[Canaan]] (such as [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]), the [[Berber people|Berber]] city-states of the [[Garamantes]], the city-states of [[ancient Greece]] (the [[poleis]] such as [[Classical Athens|Athens]], [[Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and [[Corinth]]), the [[Roman Republic]] which grew from a city-state into a [[Historical powers|great power]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec|Aztecs]], and other cultures of pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] (including cities such as [[Chichen Itza]], [[Tikal]], [[Monte Albán]] and [[Tenochtitlan]]), the [[central Asia]]n cities along the [[Silk Road]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Croatia]]n city-state of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa (Dubrovnik)]] and many others. The [[Vikings|Viking]] colonial cities in medieval [[Ireland]], most importantly [[Dublin]], have recently been classed as genuine city-states.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Poul, &quot;Viking Dublin and the City-State Concept: Parameters and Significance of the Hiberno-Norse Settlement&quot; (Respondent: Donnchadh Ó Corráin), in [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] (ed.), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=8qvY8pxVxcwC A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures]''. Denmark: Special-Trykkeriet Viborg. (University of Copenhagen, Polis Center). 2000. pp.&amp;nbsp;251–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the transalpine part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial Cities]] enjoyed a considerable autonomy, buttressed legally by the [[Lübeck law]] which was emulated by many other cities. Some cities — though also members of different [[confederation|confederacies]] at that time — officially became sovereign city-states in the 19th century — such as the [[Basel-Stadt|Canton of Basel City]] (1833–48), the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] (1806–11 and again 1813–71), the [[Free City of Frankfurt|Free City of Frankfurt upon Main]] (1815–66), the [[Canton of Geneva]] (1813–48), the [[Hamburg|Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg]] (1806–11 and again 1814–71) and the [[Free City of Lübeck|Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck]] (1806–11 and again 1813–71). Another city-state, though lacking sovereignty, was [[West Berlin]] (1948–90), being a state legally not belonging to any other state, but ruled by the [[Western Allies]]. They allowed — notwithstanding their overlordship as occupant powers — its internal organisation as one state simultaneously being a city, officially called Berlin (West). Though West Berlin held close ties to the West German [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], it was legally never part of it. A number of the aforementioned city-states — though partly with altered borders — continue to exist as city-states within today's [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and today's [[Switzerland#Federal state|Swiss Confederation]] (see below: 'Cities that are component states of federations').

Among the most well-known periods of city-state culture in human history include ancient Greek city-states, and the merchant city-states of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]], who organised themselves in small independent centres. The success of small regional units coexisting as [[autonomy|autonomous]] actors in loose geographical and cultural unity, as in [[Italy]] or [[Greece]], often prevented their [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] into larger national units. However, such small political entities often survived only for short periods because they lacked the resources to defend themselves against incursions by larger states. Thus they inevitably gave way to larger organisations of society, including the [[empire]] and the [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, &quot;Ideal of Human Unity&quot; included in ''Social and Political Thought'', 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mainland Southeast Asia]]n history, settlements were organised into autonomous or semi-autonomous city-states which were referred to as ''[[mueang]]'' and usually related in a tributary relationship now described as [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]. The system existed until the 19th century when colonisation by European powers resulted in the adoption of the modern concept of statehood.

==Contemporary city-states==
Today there are only a handful of cities that exercise authority akin to a sub-regional state, and even fewer that are [[sovereign state]]s in their own right.

===Sovereign city-states===

====Monaco====
{{Main|Monaco}}

The [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] is an independent city-state. [[Monaco-Ville]] (the ancient fortified city) and Monaco's well-known area [[Monte Carlo]] are districts of a continuous urban zone, not distinct cities, though they were three separate municipalities (''communes'') until 1917. The Principality of Monaco and the city of Monaco (each having specific powers) govern the same territory. On 28 June 1919, a [[treaty]] was signed providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], established that Monégasque policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests. Only in 1993 did Monaco become a member of the [[United Nations]], with full voting rights. In 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco clarifies that if there are no heirs to carry on the [[dynasty]], the [[principality]] will remain an independent nation rather than revert to France (which were the terms of the previous arrangement). Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France. Monaco did not receive its first foreign [[ambassador]], the French ambassador, until 16 February 2006.
&lt;!--
San Marino (country) consists of nine municipalities, of which San Marino (city) is one. Therefore, S.M. cannot be called a city state. Perhaps move this paragraph to ==others==?
====San Marino====
The Most Serene Republic of [[San Marino]] (Italian: Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino) is a city and a state situated in the [[Apennine Mountains]]. It is a landlocked enclave, completely surrounded by [[Italy]]. One of the European microstates along with the Vatican and [[Andorra]], San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the [[Council of Europe]].
--&gt;

====Singapore====
{{Main|Singapore}}

Singapore is an island city-state in [[Southeast Asia]]. About 5.2 million people live and work within  {{convert|700|km2}}, making Singapore the [[List of countries by population density|3rd-most-densely populated country in the world]] after Monaco, another city-state.  The entire island functions as a single [[metropolitan area]]. The [[city centre]] near the south of the island is surrounded by [[satellite town]]s, [[parks]], [[reservoirs]] and [[industrial estates]], which are connected to the centre and each other by a dense network of [[roads]], [[expressways]] and [[rapid transit|metro]] railway lines dubbed [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] by locals. Singapore has a highly centralised, [[unitary state|unitary government]] with a [[unicameral legislature]] (the [[City Council of Singapore|City Council]] and the [[Rural Board]] were abolished in the 1960s). While there are [[town council]]s and [[mayors]] in Singapore, these are essentially [[property management|property managers]] in charge of the maintenance of [[public housing]] within their [[constituency]] boundaries. They do not represent [[local authorities]] with any [[legislative]] or [[executive (government)|executive]] autonomy from the national government.

Prior to the 19th century, Singapore was a minor part of various regional empires, including [[Srivijaya]], [[Majapahit]], [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] and [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]]. From 1826 to the [[Battle of Singapore]] in 1942, Singapore was the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Straits Settlements]], a British colony that included the Settlements of [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]] along the [[Straits of Malacca]]. After the [[Second World War]], Singapore was hived off as a separate colony while the other two Settlements joined the [[Malay States]] to form the [[Federation of Malaya]]. In 1963, Singapore merged with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form [[Malaysia]]. However, because of a number of [[Singapore in Malaysia|problems]], Singapore was expelled from the federation in 1965, becoming an independent [[republic]].

Since 1965, Singapore rapidly industrialised and modernised, becoming one of the four &quot;[[East Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]]&quot;. In addition to the substantial [[list of countries by GDP (PPP)|absolute]] and [[list of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|per-capita]] size of its [[economy of singapore|economy]], Singapore maintains a significant [[Singapore Armed Forces|armed forces]]. It ranks highly in terms of [[list of countries by military expenditure|defence spending]] and [[List of countries by number of total troops|troop size]].

Despite its small land area, Singapore has a population, economy and armed forces that place it in a similar league to small, but full-fledged nations like [[New Zealand]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]] and the [[Nordic countries]] (i.e., [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]), rather than semi-dependent [[microstates]]. Singapore also maintains a [[diplomatic corps]] and has memberships in international organizations such as the United Nations, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].

Singapore places emphasis on self-sufficiency in basic needs, like water. The government also stockpiles other key resources, such as sand and oil. In this way, Singapore tries to avoid overdependence economically, politically or militarily on larger entities. Accordingly, Singapore may represent the most-complete contemporary example of a city-state, meeting the full definitions of both a [[city]] and a fully [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state.

====Vatican City====
{{Main|Vatican City}}

Until 1870, the city of [[Rome]] had been controlled by the [[pope]] as part of his [[Papal States]]. When King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] seized the city in 1870, [[Pope Pius IX]] refused to recognize the newly formed [[Italian unification|Kingdom of Italy]]. Because he could not travel without effectively acknowledging the authority of the king, Pius IX and his successors each claimed to be a &quot;[[Prisoner in the Vatican]]&quot;, unable to leave the {{convert|0.44|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} papal [[enclave]] once they had ascended the [[throne#Papal Thrones|papal throne]]s.

The [[Roman Question|impasse]] was resolved in 1929 by the [[Lateran Treaties]] negotiated by the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] between King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and [[Pope Pius XI]]. Under this treaty, the Vatican was recognized as an independent state, with the Pope as its head. The [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] has its own [[citizenship]], [[diplomatic corps]], [[Flag of the Vatican City|flag]], and [[postage stamp]]s. With a population of less than 1,000 (mostly clergymen) it is by far the smallest sovereign country in the world.

====Malta====
{{Main|Malta}}

The Maltese coat-of-arms bears a [[mural crown]] described as &quot;representing the fortifications of Malta and denoting a City State&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov.mt/en/state/symbols.asp &quot;The emblem of Malta&quot;, Department of Information]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been noted that the mural crown was also included in the coats-of-arms of the [[Coat of arms of Austria|Republic of Austria]] and the [[First Spanish Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110508/life-features/malta-s-three-national-emblems-since-independence-what-s-behind-them.364316 Giovanni Bonello, &quot;Malta's three national emblems since Independence: what's behind them?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one has to keep in mind that Malta is divided into [[Local councils of Malta|68 divisions]] for statistical and demographic purposes. According to [[Eurostat]], Malta is composed of two [[Larger Urban Zones]] nominally referred to as &quot;[[Valletta]]&quot; (Malta Island) and &quot;[[Gozo]]&quot; (Gozo Island).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanaudit.org/DataAccessed.aspx Eurostat, Malta]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Demographia]], state is identified as [[urban area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf Demographia: World Urban Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]], Malta is identified as Functional Urban Area (FUA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf &quot;Study on Urban Functions&quot;] - European Spatial Planning Observation Network, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[United Nations]], about 95% area of Malta is urban area and the number grows every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2007/2007WUP_Highlights_web.pdf &quot;World Urbanization Prospects&quot;] - Department of Economic and Social Affairs/Population Division, United Nations (Table A.2; page 79)&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, in the media, Malta is shown as a city-state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1306213/England-populated-country-EU.html &quot;This very crowded isle: England is most over-populated country in EU&quot;] - [[Daily Mail]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some government authorities of Malta, uses the term of city-state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativemalta.gov.mt/internationalisation/introduction ''Draft National Strategy for the Cultural and Creative Industries — Creative Malta'']&lt;/ref&gt; Malta, with area of {{convert|316|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and population of 0.4 million, it is one of the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|most densely populated]] countries worldwide.

===Non-sovereign city-states===
Some cities or urban areas, while not sovereign states, may nevertheless enjoy such a high degree of autonomy that they function as &quot;city-states&quot; within the context of the sovereign state that they belong to.

====Cities under international supervision====

{{Main|Free Territory of Trieste}}

After the [[Second World War]], the UN attempted to make the Free Territory of Trieste into a city state, but it never gained real independence and in 1954 its territory was divided between [[Italy]] and [[Yugoslavia]].

====Cities that are component states of federations====
Some cities or metropolitan areas are component states of [[federation]]s. Examples include:

* [[Argentina]] - [[Buenos Aires]] (formally known in English as the &quot;Autonomous City of Buenos Aires&quot;) capital of [[Argentina]]
* [[States of Austria|Austrian state]] of [[Vienna]]
* [[Belgium|Belgian]] capital [[Brussels]]
* [[Bolivia]] - [[La Paz]]
* [[Ethiopia]]n [[charter city|chartered cities]] (''astedader akababiwach'') of [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]
* [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and, though consisting of two separate cities, [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]
* [[Malaysia]] - [[Melaka]] (also known as Malacca)
* [[Russia]]n cities of [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]
* [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss canton]] of [[Basel-Stadt]], though consisting of three municipalities

====Federally-administered cities====
A [[federation|federal country]] may also have one or more cities that are federally administered:

* [[Australia]] - [[Canberra]] ([[Australian Capital Territory]])
* [[India]]&amp;nbsp;– [[National Capital Territory of Delhi]] and [[Chandigarh]] ([[Union Territory|Union Territories]])
* [[Malaysia]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Putrajaya]] and [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] ([[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]])
* [[Brazil]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Brasília]] (being the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Brazilian Federal District]])
* [[Mexico]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Mexico City]] (being the [[Federal District (Mexico)|Mexican Federal District]])
* [[Nigeria]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Abuja]], [[Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria)|Federal Capital Territory]]
* [[Pakistan]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Islamabad]] (being the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]])
* [[United States]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Washington, District of Columbia]]

=====Washington, D.C.=====
{{See also|D.C. statehood movement|District of Columbia home rule|District of Columbia voting rights}}

[[Image:Wilsonbldg.JPG|thumb|right|The [[John A. Wilson Building]] houses the offices of the mayor and council of the District of Columbia.]]

Not being part of any U.S. state, [[Washington, D.C.]]'s government operates under authority derived from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]]. The city (generally referred to as the District of Columbia) is run by an elected mayor and a [[city council]]. The council is composed of 13 members: one elected from each of the eight [[Ward (subnational entity)|ward]]s and five members, including the [[chairman]], elected [[at-large]]. The council conducts its work through [[Subcommittee|standing committee]]s and special committees established as needed. District schools are administered by a [[chancellor (education)#United States|chancellor]], who is appointed by the mayor; in addition, a [[superintendent of education]] and a [[board of education]] are responsible for setting some educational policies. There are 37 elected [[Advisory Neighborhood Commission]]ers that provide the most direct access for residents to their local government. The commissioners are elected by small neighborhood districts, and their suggestions are given &quot;great weight&quot; by the city council and city agencies. However, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has the ultimate [[plenary power]] over the District. It has the right to review and overrule laws created locally and has often done so. The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which reserves to states all rights not belonging to the federal government, does not apply to the District. Residents of the District have one non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress.

====Autonomous cities of unitary states====
For nations without a federal administrative structure, i.e. [[unitary state]]s, cities may sometimes enjoy a greater degree of [[autonomy]], e.g.:

* [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] ([[Spain]])
* [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] ([[China]])
* [[Gibraltar]] ([[United Kingdom]])

=====Hong Kong and Macau=====
{{See also|Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China}}

Because of [[Hong Kong]]'s and [[Macau]]'s long histories as colonies of the [[British Colony|British]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires, respectively, and the unique &quot;[[one country, two systems|one-country, two-systems]]&quot; policy, the two city-states continue to enjoy a high degree of autonomy even after their return to [[People's Republic of China|China]]. Having [[legal system]]s, [[police force]]s, [[monetary system]]s, [[Customs|customs policies]], [[immigration policy|immigration policies]], [[national sports team]]s, [[official language]]s, [[postal system]]s, academic and educational systems, and certain degrees of [[diplomacy|international representation]] that are different or independent from the [[People's Republic of China]], makes their status almost equivalent to independent nations in many respects{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}.
