'''Human geography''' is one of the two major sub-fields of the discipline of [[geography]]. Human geography is a branch of the [[social science]]s that studies the world, its people, communities, and cultures&lt;ref name=HGDICT&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | last = Johnston| first = Ron| editor1-last = Johnston | editor1-first = Ron| editor2-last = Gregory| editor2-first = Derek| editor3-last = Pratt| editor3-first = Geraldine|editor4-last = Watts | editor4-first = Michael|title = Human Geography| encyclopedia = The Dictionary of Human Geography| pages = 353–360| publisher = Blackwell| location = Oxford| year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on relations of and across space and place. Human geography differs from [[physical geography]] mainly in that it has a greater focus on studying human activities and is more receptive to [[Qualitative research|qualitative research methodologies]]. As a discipline, human geography is particularly diverse with respect to its [[#Philosophical and theoretical approaches|methods and theoretical approaches to study]].

==History==
{{Main|History of geography}}

Geographical knowledge, both physical and social, has a long history. In the history of geography, geographers have often recorded and described features of the Earth that might now be considered the remit of human, rather than physical, geographers. For example [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], a geographer and historian in ancient Greece, described inhabitants of the ancient world as well as physical features.

It was not until the 18th and 19th centuries, however, that geography was recognised as a formal academic discipline.

The [[Royal Geographical Society]] was founded in [[England]] in 1830, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Geographical Society|title=History|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/History.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the United Kingdom did not get its first full Chair of geography until 1917. The first real geographical intellect to emerge in [[United Kingdom]] geography was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.

The [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the [[USA]] in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became and continues to be a great populariser of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education.

[[Image:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]

One of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorise the physical properties of the earth is [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Though a [[physician]] and a pioneer of [[epidemiology]], the map is probably one of the earliest examples of [[Health geography]].

The now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography developed at a later date. This connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of '''[[Environmental determinism]]''', made popular in the 19th century by [[Carl Ritter]] and others, and with close links to [[evolutionary biology]] of the time. Environmental determinism is the theory that a people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. However, by the mid-19th century, environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigour associated with modern science, and later as serving to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]].

A similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent in the later '''[[Regional geography]]''', during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries. The goal of regional geography, through [[regionalization]], was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region, in both human and physical aspects. With links to [[possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] and [[cultural ecology]], some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture, as with environmental determinism remained.    

By the 1960s, however, the '''[[quantitative revolution]]''' lead to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigour in and overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from [[geology]] and the two subfields of physical and human geography, geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical model methods to solving spatial problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;HGDICT&quot;/&gt; Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of [[Geographic information systems]]; the use of statistics, spatial modelling and positivist approaches is still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], and [[Torsten Hägerstrand]].

From the 1970s a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged. Known under the term '''[[critical geography]]''' this signalled another turning point in the discipline. [[Behavioural geography]] emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places, and made locational decisions. More influentially, '''radical geography''' emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, drawing heavily on [[Marxist geography|Marxist]] theory and techniques, and is associated with geographers such as [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]]. Seeking to say something 'meaningful' about the problems recognised through quantitative methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Harvey, David| authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) | coauthors= | title=Social Justice and the City| year=1973 | publisher=Edward Arnold | location=London | pages=128–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide explanations rather than descriptions, to put forward alternatives and solutions and to be politically engaged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&amp;site=1 | title=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography: Celebrating Over 40 years of Radical Geography 1969-2009 | author=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography | year=2009 | accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the detachment associated with positivist methods. (The detachment and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital). Radical geography and the links to Marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography (See: [[Antipode (Journal)]]) Critical geography also saw the introduction of '''humanistic geography''', associated with the work of [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], which, though similar to behavioural geography, pushed for a much more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] approach in methodology.

The changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as [[Feminist geography]], [[Cultural geography#New cultural geography|New cultural geography]], and the engagement with [[postmodern]] and [[post structural]] theories and philosophies.

==Fields==
The main fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of:

===Culture===
[[Cultural geography]] is the study of cultural products and norms and their variation across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analysing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G.; Domosh, Mona; Rowntree, Lester | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Subfields include: ''[[Children's geographies]], [[Animal geographies]], [[Language geography]], [[Sexuality and Space]] and [[Religion geography]]''
'''

===Development===
[[Development geography|Development Geography]] is the study of the Earth's geography with reference to the [[Standard of living]] and the [[Quality of life]] of its human inhabitants, study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities, across the Earth. The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.

===Economic===
[[Economic geography]] examines relationships between human economic systems, states, and other factors, and the biophysical environment. 
* Subfields include ''[[Marketing geography]]'' and ''[[Transportation geography]]''

===Health===

[[Health geography]] is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

===Historical===
[[Historical geography|Historical Geography]] is the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and &quot;real&quot; geographies of the past. Historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics. A common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time. Many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time, including how people have interacted with their environment, and created the cultural landscape.
* Subfields include ''[[Time geography]]''

===Political===
[[Political geography]] is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. 
* Subfields include ''[[Electoral geography]]'', ''[[Geopolitics]]'', ''[[Strategic geography]]'' and ''[[Military geography]]''

===Population===
[[Population geography]] is the study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.

===Settlement===
[[Settlement geography]], including [[urban geography]], is the study of [[urban areas|urban]] and [[rural areas]] with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement.  That is the study of areas which have a concentration of [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]].  These are areas where the majority of [[economy|economic]] activities are in the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sectors]]. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high [[population density]].

==Philosophical and theoretical approaches==
Within each of the subfields, various philosophical approaches can be used in research; therefore, an urban geographer could be a Feminist or Marxist geographer, etc.

Such approaches are:
* [[Behavioural geography]]
* [[Critical geography]]
* [[Feminist geography]]
* [[Marxist geography]]
* [[Non-representational theory]]
* [[Positivism]]
* [[Postcolonialism]]
* [[Poststructuralist]] geography
* [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic geography]]
* [[Psychogeography]]
* [[Spatial analysis]]
