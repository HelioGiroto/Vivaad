[[File:1950s 毛主席给我们的幸福生活.jpg|right|thumb|A 1950s Chinese propaganda poster showing a happy family of five enjoying life under the image of [[Mao Zedong]]. The caption above the picture reads &quot;The happy life Chairman Mao gives us&quot;.]]

A '''cult of personality''' arises when an individual uses [[mass media]], [[propaganda]], or other methods, to create an idealized, heroic, and, at times god-like public image, often through unquestioning [[flattery]] and [[praise]]. [[Sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] developed a [[tripartite classification of authority]]; the ''cult of personality'' holds parallels with what Weber defined as &quot;[[charismatic authority]]&quot;.  A cult of personality is similar to [[apotheosis|hero worship]], except that it is established by mass media and propaganda.

==Etymology==
The term Cult of personality or Personality Cult first appeared in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s Secret Speech in 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=cult+of+personality&amp;searchmode=none |title= Etymology of Cult|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2012-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cult of the individual is a more accurate translation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stalin A Biography|author= [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] |page=362|accessdate=2012-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==
Throughout history, monarchs and heads of state were almost always held in enormous reverence. Through the principle of the [[divine right of kings]], for example, rulers were said to hold office by the will of [[God]]. [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]] (see [[Mandate of Heaven]]), [[ancient Egypt]], [[Japan]], the [[Inca]], the [[Aztecs]], [[Tibet]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Roman Empire]] (see [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]) are especially noted for redefining monarchs as [[god-king]]s.

The spread of democratic and secular ideas in Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries made it increasingly difficult for monarchs to preserve this aura. However, the subsequent development of [[photography]], [[sound recording]], [[film]], and [[mass production]], as well as [[public education]] and techniques used in commercial [[advertising]], enabled political leaders to project a positive image like never before. It was from these circumstances in the 20th century that the best-known personality cults arose. Often these cults are a form of [[political religion]].

==Purpose==
{{See also|Secular religion}}

Personality cults were first described in relation to totalitarian regimes that sought to alter or transform society according to radical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Kreis, Steven Kreis [http://www.historyguide.org/europe/cult.html &quot;Stalin and the Cult of Personality&quot;] Retrieved April 06, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Often, a single leader became associated with this revolutionary transformation, and came to be treated as a benevolent &quot;guide&quot; for the nation without whom the transformation to a better future couldn't occur. This has been generally the justification for personality cults that arose in totalitarian societies of the 20th century, such as those of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].

Not all dictatorships foster personality cults, not all personality cults are dictatorships (some are nominally democratic), and some leaders may actively seek to minimize their own public adulation. For example, during the Cambodian [[Khmer Rouge]] regime, images of dictator [[Pol Pot]] (Saloth Sar) were rarely seen in public, and his identity was under dispute abroad until after his fall from power. The same applied to numerous [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern European]] [[Communist]] regimes following World War II (although not those of [[Enver Hoxha]] and [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], mentioned below).

==Examples==
[[Image:Hitler 1928 crop.jpg|thumb|Adolf Hitler, behind [[Hermann Göring]], at a [[Nuremberg rally|Nazi rally in Nuremberg]] in 1928.]]

The term ''cult of personality'' comes from [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of the &quot;cult of the individual&quot;—expressed in a letter to German political worker, Wilhelm Blos. In that, Marx states thus:

{{bquote|From my antipathy to any cult of the individual, I never made public during the existence of the [1st] International the numerous addresses from various countries which recognized my merits and which annoyed me... [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] and I first joined the secret society of Communists on the condition that everything making for superstitious worship of authority would be deleted from its statute.}}

===Historical examples===

====Argentina====
[[Juan Perón]], elected three times as [[President of Argentina]], and his second wife, [[Eva Duarte de Perón]], were immensely popular among many of the Argentine people, and to this day they are still considered icons by the [[Peronist Party]]. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them [[demagogue]]s and dictators. To achieve their political goals, the Peronists had to unite around the head of state. As a result, a personality cult developed around both Perón and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Education in Argentina'', 1946-1962, by Mónica Esti Rein; trans by Martha Grenzeback. Published by M. E. Sharpe, Armonk, NY/London, 1998, p. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Azerbaijan====

[[File:Heydar Aliyev billboard3.jpg|thumb|right|A billboard in [[Baku]] depicting [[Heydar Aliyev]] and his son [[Ilham Aliyev]].]]

[[Heydar Aliyev's cult of personality]] became a significant part of [[Azerbaijan]]i politics and society after [[Heydar Aliyev]] came to power in 1993 and continuing after his death in 2003, when his son [[Ilham Aliyev]] succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heidar Aliev, maestro of the Caucasus|url=http://www.economist.com/node/354347|agency=''[[The Economist]]''|date=August 31, 2000|accessdate= September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Travels in the Former Soviet Union.

====China====
[[File:Chiang KaiShek Portrait Tiananmen Beijing.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] on [[Tiananmen]]]]
A personality cult in the [[Republic of China]] was centered on the [[Kuomintang]] party founder [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his successor, Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The personality cult of Chiang Kai-shek went further after the republican government fled to Taiwan. He was usually referred as &quot;Lord Chiang&quot; (蔣公) in public and a ''[[Tai tou|Nuo tai]]'' were required in printed materials. Articles in textbooks and songs glorifying him were common to be seen in Taiwan before 1987.

The People's Republic of China under [[Mao Zedong]] can also be considered a cult of personality. Culture of the People's Republic of China before 1981 were highly influenced by the personality cult of Mao Zedong and went to a peak during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Mao was referred as &quot;the great leader Chairman Mao&quot; (伟大领袖毛主席) in public and was entitled as &quot;the great leader, the great supreme commander, the great teacher and the great helmsman&quot; (伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的导师、伟大的舵手) in Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J5QbQpQTegwC&amp;pg=PA421&amp;lpg=PA421&amp;dq=he+great+leader,+the+great+commander,+the+great+teacher+and+the+great+helmsman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qoBJp2Twp4&amp;sig=VGlnSFsfouprQAdXz3zO0I_k4wc&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WD4ZUNDqKqiZiAfx6YGYCA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBA|title=A glossary of political terms of the People's Republic of China|coauthors=Gucheng Li|year=1995|location=|page=639|accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badges and books of his quotations were largely produced. Most of people were required to recite the quotation of Mao and printed material at that time usually quote Mao's words in bold in preface. Loyalty dance (忠字舞) was also introduced in Cultural Revolution.

The cult of personality continued for a short time after Mao's death. His successor, [[Hua Guofeng]] also practised the cult of personality and was referred as &quot;the brilliant leader Chairman Hua&quot; (英明领袖华主席). Reforms in 1981 led to a deconstruction of his cult status and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] was aversive to a cult of personality style rule lest it recreate the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.

====French Indochina====
[[Cambodia]]n schoolchildren in [[French Indochina]] at one point in the early 1940s began their school-day with prayers to Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], opening with the words, &quot;[[Our father]], which art our Leader, glorious be thy name... deliver us from evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Short, Philip. ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare''. New York: Henry Holt and Company. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soviet Union====
[[Nikita Khrushchev]] recalled Marx's criticism in his 1956 &quot;[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]&quot; denouncing [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Stalin's cult of personality|his cult of personality]] to the [[20th Party Congress]]:{{r|guardian}}

{{quote|Comrades, the cult of the individual acquired such monstrous size chiefly because Stalin himself, using all conceivable methods, supported the glorification of his own person.... One of the most characteristic examples of Stalin's self-glorification and of his lack of even elementary modesty is the edition of his Short Biography, which was published in 1948.

This book is an expression of the most dissolute flattery, an example of making a man into a godhead, of transforming him into an infallible sage, &quot;the greatest leader&quot;, &quot;sublime strategist of all times and nations&quot;. Finally no other words could be found with which to lift Stalin up to the heavens.

We need not give here examples of the loathsome adulation filling this book. All we need to add is that they all were approved and edited by Stalin personally and some of them were added in his own handwriting to the draft text of the book.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news | title = The Cult of the Individual | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2007/apr/26/greatspeeches2 | accessdate = 2012-09-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some authors (e.g., [[Alexander Zinovyev]]) have argued that [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule was also characterized by a cult of personality, though unlike Stalin, Brezhnev did not initiate large-scale persecutions in the country. One of the aspects of Leonid Brezhnev's cult of personality was Brezhnev's obsession with titles, rewards and decorations, leading to his inflated decoration with medals, orders and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. http://oldgazette.ru/kopravda/21021978/01-1.html. The list of Brezhnev's decorations is available in [[Russian Wikipedia]]: http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Список_наград_Брежнева&lt;/ref&gt; This was often ridiculed by the ordinary people and led to the creation of many [[Russian political jokes#Brezhnev|political jokes]].

''A History of Inner Asia.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During Niyazov's rule there was no freedom of the press nor was there freedom of speech. This further meant that opposition to Niyazov was strictly forbidden and &quot;major opposition figures have been imprisoned, institutionalized, deported, or have fled the country, and their family members are routinely harassed by the authorities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ciaonet.org&quot;/&gt; Additionally, a silhouette of Niyazov was used as a logo on television broadcasts&lt;ref&gt;Eurasianet. 2007.

Martin. ''Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty''.

====Syria==== 
As one of his strategies to maintain power over [[Syria]], [[Hafez al-Assad]] developed a state-sponsored cult of personality.&lt;ref&gt; Personenkulte Im Stalinismus By Klaus Heller, Jan Plamper, V&amp;R unipress GmbH, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Portraits of him, often depicting him engaging in heroic activities, were placed in every public space.  He named myriad numbers of places and institutions in Syria after himself, and other members of his family. At school, children were taught to sing songs of adulation about Hafez al-Assad. Teachers would begin each lesson with the song &quot;Our eternal leader, Hafez al-Assad&quot;.  In some cases, he portrayed himself with apparently divine properties. Sculptures and portraits depicted him alongside the prophet Mohammad, while, following her death, the government produced portraits of Assad's mother surrounded by a halo.  Syrian officials were made to refer to him as the 'Sanctified one' (al-Muqaddas).&lt;ref&gt;''Syria Beyond the Peace Process'', By Daniel Pipes, (NY 1995) page 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; The personality cult that he developed portrayed him as wise, modest and just leader of the country. This strategy of creating a cult of personality was pursued further by Hafez's son and current ruler [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Commanding Syria: Bashar Al-Assad And the First Years in Power'' (B.Tauris, 2007), By Eyal Zisser, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him.
