      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13587">'''Gandhian economics''' is a school of [[Economics|economic thought]] based on the [[socio-economic]] principles expounded by [[India]]n leader [[Mohandas Gandhi]]. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic [[socialism]], but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term &quot;Gandhian economics&quot; was coined by [[J. C. Kumarappa]], a close supporter of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumarappa|first=Joseph Cornelius|title=Gandhian economic thought|publisher=Vora|location=Bombay, India|date=1951|edition=1st|series=Library of Indian economics|oclc=3529600|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3529600?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gandhi's economic ideas==
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Gandhi's thinking on socia-secular issues was greatly influenced by the American writer [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Throughout his life, Gandhi sought to develop ways to fight India's extreme poverty, backwardness and socio-economic challenges as a part of his wider involvement in the [[Indian independence movement]]. Gandhi's championing of ''[[Swadeshi]]'' and [[Non-cooperation movement|non-cooperation]] were centred on the principles of economic [[self-sufficiency]]. Gandhi sought to target European-made clothing and other products as not only a symbol of [[British Raj|British colonialism]] but also the source of mass unemployment and poverty, as European industrial goods had left many millions of India's workers, craftsmen and women without a means of living. By championing homespun ''[[khadi]]'' clothing and Indian-made goods, Gandhi sought to incorporate peaceful civil resistance as a means of promoting national self-sufficiency. Gandhi led farmers of [[Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha|Champaran and Kheda]] in a ''[[satyagraha]]'' ([[civil disobedience]] and [[tax resistance]]) against the mill owners and landlords supported by the British government in an effort to end oppressive taxation and other policies that forced the farmers and workers and defend their economic rights. A major part of this rebellion was a commitment from the farmers to end [[Indian caste system|caste discrimination]] and oppressive social practices against women while launching a co-operative effort to promote education, health care and self-sufficiency by producing their own clothes and food.&lt;ref&gt;B. N. Ghosh, ''Gandhian political economy: principles, practice and policy'' (2007) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Gandhi and his followers also founded numerous ''[[ashram]]s'' in India (Gandhi had pioneered the ''ashram'' settlement in [[South Africa]]). The concept of an ''ashram'' has been compared with the [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]], where its inhabitants would seek to produce their own food, clothing and means of living, while promoting a lifestyle of self-sufficiency, personal and spiritual development and working for wider social development. The ''ashrams'' included small farms and houses constructed by the inhabitants themselves. All inhabitants were expected to help in any task necessary, promoting the values of equality. Gandhi also espoused the notion of &quot;trusteeship,&quot; which centred on denying material pursuits and coveting of wealth, with practitioners acting as &quot;trustees&quot; of other individuals and the community in their management of economic resources and property.&lt;ref&gt;Jagannath Swaroop Mathur, ''Industrial civilization &amp; Gandhian economics'' (1971)  p 165&lt;/ref&gt; 

Contrary to many Indian socialists and communists, Gandhi was averse to all notions of class warfare and concepts of class-based revolution, which he saw as causes of social violence and disharmony. Gandhi's concept of [[egalitarianism]] was centred on the preservation of human dignity rather than material development. Some of Gandhi's closest supporters and admirers included industrialists such as [[Birla family|Ghanshyamdas Birla]], [[Sarabhai family|Ambalal Sarabhai]], [[Jamnalal Bajaj]] and [[J. R. D. Tata]], who adopted several of Gandhi's progressive ideas in managing labour relations while also personally participating in Gandhi's ashrams and socio-political work.&lt;ref&gt;Romesh K. Diwan and Mark A. Lutz, ''Essays in Gandhian economics'' (1987) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gandhian economics and ethics==
Gandhian economics do not draw a distinction between economics and ethics. Economics that hurts the moral well-being of an individual or a nation is immoral, and therefore sinful. The value of an industry should be gauged less by the dividends it pays to [[shareholders]] than by its effect on the bodies, soul and spirits of the people employed in it. In essence, supreme consideration is to be given to man than to money. In fact, the first basic principle of Gandhi’s economic thought is a special emphasis on ‘plain living’ which helps in cutting down your wants and being [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliant]]. Accordingly, increasing consumer appetite is likened to animal appetite which goes the end of earth in search of their satisfaction. Thus a distinction is to be made between '[[Standard of living|Standard of Living]]' and 'Standard of Life', where the former merely states the material and physical standard of food, cloth and housing. A higher standard of life, on the other hand could be attained only if, along with material advancement, there was a serious attempt to imbibe cultural and spiritual values and qualities.

==Social justice and equality==
Gandhi has often quoted that if mankind was to progress and to realize the ideals of equality and brotherhood, it must act on the principle of paying the highest attention to the prime needs of the weakest sections of the population. Therefore any exercise on economic planning on a national scale would be futile without uplifting these most vulnerable sections of the society in a direct manner. In the ultimate analysis, it is the quality of the human being that has to be raised, refined and consolidated. In other words, economic planning is for the citizen, and not the citizen for national planning. Everybody should be given the right to earn according to his capacity using just means. he was poor.

==Non-violent rural economy==
Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all economic spheres. In order to achieve this means he advocated [[Trusteeship (Gandhism)|trusteeship]], [[decentralization]] of economic activities, labour intensive technology and priority to weaker sections. Gandhi claims that to be non-violent an Individual needs to have a rural mindedness. It also helps in thinking of our necessities of our household in terms of rural mindedness. The revival of the economy is made possible only when it is free from exploitation, so according to Gandhi [[industrialization]] on a mass-scale will lead to passive or active exploitation of the people as the problem of competition and marketing comes in. Gandhi believes that for an economy to be self-contained, it should manufacture mainly for its use even if that necessitates the use of modern machines and tools, provided it is not used as a means of exploitation of others.
==Environmentalism==
Several of Gandhi's followers developed a theory of environmentalism. [[J. C. Kumarappa]] was the first, writing a number of relevant books in the 1930s and 1940s. He and Mira Behan argued against large-scale dam-and-irrigation projects, saying that small projects were more efficacious, that organic manure was better and less dangerous than man-made chemicals, and that forests should be managed with the goal of water conservation rather than revenue maximization.  The Raj and the Nehru governments paid them little attention. Guha calls Kumarappa, &quot;The Green Gandhian,&quot; portraying him as the founder of modern environmentalism in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramachndra Guha|title=Anthropologist Among the Marxists: And Other Essays|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hslnO7LGdRMC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=81-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept of socialism==
Gandhian economics brings a socialist perspective of overall development and tries to redefine the outlook of socialism. Gandhi espoused the notion of “[[Trusteeship (Gandhism)|trusteeship]]” which centered on denying material pursuits and coveting of wealth, with practitioners acting as “trustees” of other individuals and the community in their management of economic resources and property. Under the Gandhian economic order, the character of production will be determined by social necessity and not by personal greed. The path of socialism should only be through non-violence and democratic method and any recourse to class-war and mutual hatred would prove to be suicidal.

==Implementation in India==
During India's freedom struggle as well as after India's independence in 1947, Gandhi's advocacy of homespun ''khadi'' clothing, the ''khadi'' attire (which included the [[Gandhi cap]]) developed into popular symbols of [[Indian nationalism|nationalism]] and patriotism. India's first [[prime minister]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] totally differed with Gandhi, even before independence and partition of India. Gandhi did not participate in celebration of Indian independence, he was busy controlling the post partition communal violence.

Gandhian activists such as [[Vinoba Bhave]] and [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] were involved in the ''[[Sarvodaya]]'' movement, which sought to promote self-sufficiency amidst India's rural population by encouraging [[land redistribution]], socio-economic reforms and promoting [[cottage industries]]. The movement sought to combat the problems of class conflict, unemployment and poverty while attempting to preserve the lifestyle and values of rural Indians, which were eroding with [[industrialisation]] and modernisation. ''Sarvodaya'' also included ''Bhoodan'', or the gifting of land and agricultural resources by the landlords (called ''[[zamindar]]s'') to their tenant farmers in a bid to end the medieval system of ''zamindari''. Bhave and others promoted ''[[Bhoodan]]'' as a just and peaceful method of land redistribution in order to create economic equality, land ownership and opportunity without creating class-based conflicts. ''Bhoodan'' and ''Sarvodaya'' enjoyed notable successes in many parts of India, including [[Maharashtra]], [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Bhave would become a major exponent of discipline and productivity amongst India's farmers, labourers and working classes, which was a major reason for his support of the controversial [[Indian Emergency (1975–1977)]]. Jayaprakash Narayan also sought to use Gandhian methods to combat organised crime, [[alcoholism]] and other social problems.

==Modern interpretations==
The proximity of Gandhian economic thought to socialism has also evoked criticism from the advocates of [[free-market economics]]. To many, Gandhian economics represent an alternative to mainstream economic ideologies as a way to promote economic self-sufficiency without an emphasis on material pursuits or compromising human development. Gandhi's emphasis on peace, &quot;trusteeship&quot; and co-operation has been touted as an alternative to competition as well as conflict between different economic and income classes in societies. Gandhian focus on human development is also seen as an effective emphasis on the eradication of poverty, social conflict and backwardness in developing nations.
