A '''health department''' or '''health ministry''' is a part of [[government]] which focuses on issues related to the general [[health]] of the [[citizenry]]. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]], such as [[State (administrative division)|states]], [[county|counties]] and [[city|cities]], often also operate a health department of their own. Health departments perform [[food licensing]] and [[food inspection]] (the person who performs this job is often called a [[Health Inspector]]), [[vaccination]] programs, free [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] and [[HIV]] tests, and other [[medical]] assistance. Health departments also compile [[statistics]] about [[health issues]] of their area. In 1986, several of the worlds' national health departments met to establish an international guideline by which health departments operate. The meeting was in [[Ottawa, Canada]], and hence the guidelines established are known as the [[Ottawa Charter]]. The Ottawa Charter was designed to ‘achieve Health for All’.

&quot;Health department&quot; can also refer to a [[university]] health [[academic department|department]].
