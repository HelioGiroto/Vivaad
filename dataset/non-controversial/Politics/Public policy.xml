{{Politics}}

'''Public policy''' as government action is generally the principled guide to action taken by the administrative or [[Executive (government)|executive branches]] of the [[State (polity)|state]] with regard to a class of issues in a manner consistent with law and institutional customs. In general, the foundation is the pertinent national and substantial [[constitution]]al law and implementing legislation such as the US Federal code. Further substrates include both [[judicial]] interpretations and [[regulations]] which are generally authorized by legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qsilver.queensu.ca/~wolfer/General/Definition.html Wolf, Robert, &quot;Definitions of Policy Analysis&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Other scholars define it as a system of &quot;courses of action, [[regulation|regulatory]] measures, [[law]]s, and [[funding]] priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/policy/definition.shtml/ Kilpatrick, Dean, &quot;Definitions of Public Policy and Law&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Public policy is commonly embodied &quot;in constitutions, legislative acts, and judicial decisions.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1368469 Schuster II, W. Michael, &quot;For the Greater Good: The Use of Public Policy Considerations in Confirming Chapter 11 Plans of Reorganization&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], this concept refers not only to the result of policies, but more broadly to the [[decision-making]] and [[analysis]] of governmental decisions. As an [[academic discipline]], public policy is studied by professors and students at [[public policy schools]] of major [[universities]] throughout the country.  The U.S. professional association of public policy practitioners, researchers, scholars, and students is the [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Government actions==
Shaping public policy is a complex and multifaceted process that involves the interplay of numerous individuals and interest groups competing and collaborating to influence policymakers to act in a particular way.  These individuals and groups use a variety of tactics and tools to advance their aims, including advocating their positions publicly, attempting to educate supporters and opponents, and mobilizing allies on a particular issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilpatrick&quot;&gt;Kilpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an academic discipline==
{{Main|Public policy school}}
As an academic discipline, public policy brings in elements of many [[social science]] fields and concepts, including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[political economy]], [[program evaluation]], [[policy analysis]], and [[public management]], all as applied to problems of governmental administration, management, and operations.  At the same time, the study of public policy is distinct from political science or economics, in its focus on the application of theory to practice.  While the majority of [[public policy degrees]] are [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees, several universities also offer undergraduate education in public policy.

Policy schools tackle policy analysis differently. The [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies]] at the [[University of Chicago]] has a more quantitative and economics approach to policy, the [[Heinz College]] at [[Carnegie Mellon]] uses [[computational science|computational]] and [[empirical]] methods, while the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] has a more political science and leadership based approach. The [[Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs]] provides traditional public policy training with multidisciplinary concentrations available in the environmental sciences and nonprofit management. 

The [http://www.jsgp.edu.in Jindal School of Government and Public Policy] in India offers an interdisciplinary training in public policy with a focus on the policy making processes in developing and BRIC countries. In Europe, the [http://sog.luiss.it/programs/mipa/ School of Government of LUISS Guido Carli] offers a multidisciplinary approach to public policy combining economics, political sciences, new public management and policy analysis.

Traditionally, the academic field of public policy focused on [[domestic policy]]. However, the wave of economic [[globalization]], which ensued in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, created a need for a subset of public policy that focuses on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gppi.net/fileadmin/gppi/Global_Public_Policy_Foreign_Affairs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many traditional public policy schools had to tweak their curricula to adjust to this new policy landscape.
