'''Pharaonism''' is an [[ideology]] that rose to prominence in [[Egypt]] in the 1920s and 1930s.  It looked to Egypt's [[pre-Islamic]] past and argued that Egypt was part of a larger [[Mediterranean]] civilization.  This ideology stressed the role of the [[Nile River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  Pharaonism's most notable advocate was [[Taha Hussein]].
==Egyptian identity==
Egyptian identity since the [[Iron Age]] [[Egyptian Empire]] evolved for the longest period under the influence of native Egyptian culture, religion and identity (see [[Ancient Egypt]]). The Egyptians came subsequently under the influence of brief successions of foreign rulers including [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Berbers]], [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Nubians]], [[History of Persian Egypt|Persians]], [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Greeks]], [[Roman Egypt|Romans]], [[Arab Egypt|Arabs]], [[Ottoman Egypt|Turks]], [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|French]] and [[British occupation of Egypt|British]]. Under these foreign rulers, the Egyptians accommodated two new religions, [[Coptic Christianity|Christianity]] and [[Islam]], and a new language, [[Egyptian Arabic]].

==Nationalism==
Questions of identity came to the fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as &quot;Pharaonism&quot;). Pharaonism became the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists of the pre- and inter-war periods:

{{cquote|What is most significant [about Egypt in this period] is the absence of an Arab component in early Egyptian nationalism. The thrust of Egyptian political, economic, and cultural development throughout the nineteenth century worked against, rather than for, an &quot;Arab&quot; orientation... This situation—that of divergent political trajectories for Egyptians and [[Arab]]s—if anything increased after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, James. &quot;Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism&quot; in Rashid Khalidi, ed. ''The Origins of Arab Nationalism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990, pp. 244-45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1931, following a visit to Egypt, Syrian Arab nationalist [[Sati' al-Husri]] remarked that &quot;[Egyptians] did not possess an Arab nationalist sentiment; did not accept that Egypt was a part of the Arab lands, and would not acknowledge that the Egyptian people were part of the Arab nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;qtd in Dawisha, Adeed. ''Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century''. Princeton University Press. 2003, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The later 1930s would become a formative period for Arab nationalism in Egypt, in large part due to efforts by Syrian/Palestinian/Lebanese intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, &quot;Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism&quot;, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a year after the establishment of the [[Arab League|League of Arab States]] in 1945, to be headquartered in Cairo, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] historian H. S. Deighton was still writing:

{{cquote|The Egyptians are not Arabs, and both they and the Arabs are aware of this fact. They are Arabic-speaking, and they are Muslim —indeed religion plays a greater part in their lives than it does in those either of the Syrians or the Iraqi. But the Egyptian, during the first thirty years of the [twentieth] century, was not aware of any particular bond with the Arab East... Egypt sees in the Arab cause a worthy object of real and active sympathy and, at the same time, a great and proper opportunity for the exercise of leadership, as well as for the enjoyment of its fruits. But she is still Egyptian first and Arab only in consequence, and her main interests are still domestic.&lt;ref&gt;Deighton, H. S. &quot;The Arab Middle East and the Modern World&quot;, International Affairs, vol. xxii, no. 4 (October 1946), p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the most prominent Egyptian nationalists and anti-Arabists was Egypt's most notable writer of the 20th century, [[Taha Hussein]]. He expressed his disagreement with Arab unity and his beliefs in Egyptian nationalism on multiple occasions. In one of his most well known articles, written in 1933 in the magazine &quot;Kawkab el Sharq&quot;, he wrote saying:

{{cquote|Pharaonism is deeply rooted in the spirits of the Egyptians. It will remain so, and it must continue and become stronger. The Egyptian is Pharaonic before being Arab. Egypt must not be asked to deny its Pharaonism because that would mean: Egypt, destroy your Sphinx and your pyramids, forget who you are and follow us! Do not ask of Egypt more than it can offer. Egypt will never become part of some Arab unity, whether the capital [of this unity] were to be Cairo, Damascus, or Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taha Hussein]], &quot;Kwakab el Sharq&quot;, August 12th 1933: إن الفرعونية متأصلة فى نفوس المصريين ، وستبقى كذلك بل يجب أن تبقى وتقوى ، والمصرى فرعونى قبل أن يكون عربياً ولا يطلب من مصر أن تتخلى عن فرعونيتها وإلا كان معنى ذلك : اهدمى يا مصر أبا الهول والأهرام، وانسى نفسك واتبعينا ... لا تطلبوا من مصر أكثر مما تستطيع أن تعطى ، مصر لن تدخل فى وحدة عربية سواء كانت العاصمة القاهرة أم دمشق أم بغداد&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been argued that until the 1940s, Egypt was more in favor of territorial, Egyptian nationalism and distant from the pan-Arab ideology. Egyptians generally did not identify themselves as Arabs, and it is revealing that when the Egyptian nationalist leader [[Saad Zaghlul]] met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, claiming that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one.&lt;ref&gt;Makropoulou, Ifigenia. [http://www.ekem.gr/archives/2007/01/pan_arabism_wha.html Pan - Arabism: What Destroyed the Ideology of Arab Nationalism?]. Hellenic Center for European Studies. January 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab identity==
However, Egypt under [[King Farouk]] was a founding member of the [[Arab League]] in 1945, and the first Arab state to declare war in support of the Palestinians in the [[Palestine War]] of 1948. This Arab nationalist sentiment increased exponentially after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]. The primary leaders of the Revolution, [[Muhammad Naguib]], and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], were staunch Arab nationalists who stressed that pride in Egypt's individual indigenous identity was entirely consistent with pride in an overarching Arab cultural identity. It was during Naguib's tenure as leader that Egypt adopted the Arab Liberation Flag to symbolise the country's links to the rest of the Arab World.

For a while Egypt and [[Syria]] formed the [[United Arab Republic]].  When the union was dissolved, Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971, when Egypt adopted the current official name, the Arab Republic of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;1971 - Egypt's new constitution is introduced and the country is renamed the Arab Republic of Egypt.&quot; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/790978.stm Timeline Egypt]. BBC News, Timeline: Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians' attachment to Arabism, however, was particularly questioned after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives and the country became disillusioned with Pan-Arab politics.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser's successor [[Anwar Al Sadat]], both through public policy and his peace initiative with [[Israel]], revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. The terms &quot;Arab,&quot; &quot;Arabism,&quot; and &quot;Arab unity,&quot; save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, pp. 264-65, 267&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Republic]] sections.)

Although the overwhelming majority of Egyptians today continue to self-identify as Arabs in a cultural sense, a minority reject this, pointing to the failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies, and even publicly voicing objection to the present official name of the country.

In late 2007, ''el-Masri el-Yom'' daily newspaper conducted an interview at a bus stop in the working-class district of [[Imbaba]] to ask citizens what Arab nationalism (''el-qawmeyya el-'arabeyya'') represented for them. One Egyptian Muslim youth responded, &quot;Arab nationalism means that the Egyptian Foreign Minister in Jerusalem gets humiliated by the Palestinians, that Arab leaders dance upon hearing of Sadat's death, that Egyptians get humiliated in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], and of course that Arab countries get to fight Israel until the last Egyptian soldier.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Masry&quot;&gt;Ragab, Ahmed. El-Masry el-Yom Newspaper. [http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=61604 &quot;What is the definition of 'Arab Nationalism': Question at a bus stop in Imbaba&quot;]. May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another felt that,&quot;Arab countries hate Egyptians&quot;, and that unity with Israel may even be more of a possibility than Arab nationalism, because he believes that Israelis would at least respect Egyptians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masry&quot; /&gt; 

Some contemporary prominent Egyptians who oppose Arab nationalism or the idea that Egyptians are Arabs include Secretary General of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] [[Zahi Hawass]],&lt;ref&gt;In response to queries about Tutankhamun in a recent lecture, Hawass declared &quot;Egyptians are not Arabs...&quot; {{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Tutankhamun was not black: Egypt antiquities chief | date= | publisher= | url =http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB6u3XEMp9IrJfl-kH6FHNgZCg_A | work =AFP | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; popular writer [[Osama Anwar Okasha]], Egyptian-born Harvard University Professor [[Leila Ahmed]], Member of Parliament Suzie Greiss,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/cfsi-icse/cil-cai/magazine/0107/magazine-en.asp?txt=1-2&amp;lv=1 An Interculturalist in Cairo].

ArabicNews.com. 11/06.2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding is also expressed in other contexts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arab.net/egypt/et_people.htm Egyptian people section from Arab.Net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/web_exclusives/more/more_letters/letters_bernardlewis.html Princeton Alumni Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; such as Neil DeRosa's novel ''Joseph's Seed'' in his depiction of an Egyptian character &quot;who declares that Egyptians are not Arabs and never will be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlasphere.com/columns/050117-cohen-josephsseed.php Review by Michelle Fram Cohen]. The Atlasphere. January 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
Egyptian critics of Arab nationalism contend that it has worked to erode and/or relegate native Egyptian identity by superimposing only one aspect of Egypt's culture. These views and sources for collective identification in the Egyptian state are captured in the words of a linguistic anthropologist who conducted fieldwork in Cairo:

{{cquote|Historically, Egyptians have considered themselves as distinct from 'Arabs' and even at present rarely do they make that identification in casual contexts; ''il-'arab'' [the Arabs] as used by Egyptians refers mainly to the inhabitants of the Gulf states... Egypt has been both a leader of pan-Arabism and a site of intense resentment towards that ideology. Egyptians had to be made, often forcefully, into &quot;Arabs&quot; [during the Nasser era] because they did not historically identify themselves as such. Egypt was self-consciously a nation not only before pan-Arabism but also before becoming a colony of the British Empire. Its territorial continuity since ancient times, its unique history as exemplified in its pharaonic past and later on its Coptic language and culture, had already made Egypt into a nation for centuries. Egyptians saw themselves, their history, culture and language as specifically Egyptian and not &quot;Arab.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Haeri, Niloofar. ''Sacred language, Ordinary People: Dilemmas of Culture and Politics in Egypt''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2003, pp. 47, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Copts==
Many Coptic intellectuals hold to a version of Pharaonism which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early  20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. Most scholars today see Pharaonism as a late development shaped primarily by western [[Orientalism]], and they doubt its validity.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques  van der Vliet, The Copts: 'Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'? ''Church History &amp; Religious Culture'' (June 2009), Vol. 89 Issue 1-3, 279-290 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Malcolm Reid|title=Whose Pharaohs?: Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to World War I|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FeviPDy08e8C&amp;pg=PA258|year=2003|publisher=Uof California Press|pages=258ff, ch 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
