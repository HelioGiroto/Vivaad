The '''Camps for Climate Action''' are [[Political campaign|campaign]] gatherings (similar to [[peace camp]]s) that take place to draw attention to, and act as a base for [[direct action]] against, major [[Global warming#Causes|carbon emitters]], as well as to develop ways to create a [[zero-carbon]] society. Camps are run on broadly [[anarchist]] principles - free to attend, supported by donations and with input from everyone in the community for the day-to-day operation of the camp. Initiated in the [[UK]], camps have taken place in [[England]] at [[Drax power station]], [[Heathrow Airport]], [[Kingsnorth power station]] in [[Kent]], the [[City of London]] and [[The Royal Bank of Scotland]] Headquarters, near [[Edinburgh]]. During 2009 camps also took place in [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands]]/[[Belgium]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Australia]].

==General==
[[Image:Climate Camp 02.jpg|thumb|Electricity for the Camp is generated from [[Solar power|solar panels]]]]
Camps are organised through the preceding year with a series of monthly meetings, previously held in [[Manchester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Oxford]], [[Leeds]], [[Bristol]], [[London]], and Talamnh (near [[Glasgow]]). Anyone is welcome to attend a planning meeting and to join one of the working groups. There were no 'leaders' and meetings used [[consensus decision making]]. Camps are run entirely by volunteers and are funded by private donations.

Much of the material used to create structures for the camp is reclaimed waste from building sites which would otherwise have been sent to a [[landfill]]. [[Compost toilet]]s, comprehensive [[recycling]], [[grey water]] systems and a pedal-powered laundries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climateactionnetwork.org.uk/toolkit/outreach_ideas/materials_for_talks_and_workshops/handout_for_climatecamp_workshop.pdf|format=PDF|title=Handout for climate camp workshops}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the camp is divided into loosely bounded 'neighbourhoods', most corresponding to geographic region (one exception being the queer neighbourhood of the 2006 camp). Daily consensus-based meetings are held in each neighbourhood, with spokes-people sent to a central meeting. It is considered to be in the nature of the camp that organisational structures are loose and reflexive, so as to be open to change if they are not seen to be effective or efficient.

During the camp there's a lot of training on practical skills (including consensus decision-making) to be able to run such camps, different aspects of taking direct action, as well as a large number of workshops on themes of [[sustainability]] and climate-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/workshopsoffer.php|title=Workshops|publisher=Camp for Climate Action|accessdate=2007-12-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071201041543/http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/workshopsoffer.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power for lighting, radios, mobile phones, sound equipment and laptop computers was supplied by [[solar power|solar panels]] and a [[wind power|wind turbine]]. [[Biodiesel]] from recycled cooking oil was available for vehicles. Cooking used conventional [[propane]] cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/aug/15/theairlineindustry.transportintheuk|title=Rules, rotas and revolutionary song at climate action camp | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Helen | last=Pidd | date=2007-08-15 | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a satellite up-link was installed, together with a media tent with ten laptop computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecalm.org/drupal/index.php?q=node/35|title=A new weather front|publisher=Camp for climate action|author=Helen Pidd|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was also used to send media to the press as well as [[Indymedia|Indymedia UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/actions/2007/climatecamp Camp for Climate Action 2007 Newswire], ''[[Indymedia]] UK''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a new sound system made its first appearance at the Camp for Climate Action. All of the system was made from recycled materials, except its battery. During the stop searches the battery was dropped and damaged yet the sound system still worked throughout the camp. This sound system mainly played [[reggae]]/[[lovers rock]] and [[dubstep]] at Gate 5 throughout the night and during the raids. The sound system was powered by a 12-volt leisure battery, charged using solar power. A car amp was used to power the speakers the system was mono and the amp was bridged. The sound system was built by Onedread and Dec. 'Son of pedals' sound system was another sound system at the Camp for Climate Action [http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=23s3w3epZ84 Video].

There is a strong emphasis on the use of [[bicycle]]s and [[public transport]], including a [[Bicycology]] tour from London via [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycology.org.uk/events/2006_summer_tour.htm|title=2006 Bicycology sTOURy&amp;#124;accessed 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[United Nations]] has reported that &quot;livestock is a major threat to environment&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html|title=Livestock a major threat to environment|publisher=[[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|date=2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecalm.org/drupal/index.php?q=node/36|author=Steph Brown|title=Fight climate change! Go vegan!}}&lt;/ref&gt; all food is [[vegan]], mostly [[Organic food|organic]] and locally sourced to minimise [[food miles]], provided by communal neighbourhood kitchens, many associated with the [[UK Social Centre Network|Social Centres Network]].

A camp happened in October 2009 at [[Helensburgh]] near [[Sydney]], which is the site of [[Australia]]'s oldest coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecamp.org.au/helensburgh2009|title=Climate Camp 09: Oct 9 – 11.

==Drax 2006==
[[File:Climate camp drax.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Climate camp with [[Drax power station]] in the background]]
The camp was on a [[squatting|squatted]] site in the Vale of York, situated close to several large [[power station]]s including [[Drax Power Station|Drax]], a [[coal]]-fired power station which is the largest single emitter of [[carbon dioxide]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/5300560.stm|title=Power station protesters arrested|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2006-09-01 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over one hundred and sixty workshops ran throughout the camp, sharing practical skills on [[living sustainably]], on subjects such as the science of climate change, [[environmental justice]] and the effects of climate change on people in the [[global South]], corporate 'climate criminals', [[direct action]], children's workshops, and many more.

Music was turned off after 11pm - 'Power Down' - to allow campaigners (with or without families) to sleep. But on the last Monday of the camp music was allowed much later.

===Day of action===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Climate Camp 04.jpg|thumb|Protesters on their way to [[Drax power station]]|250px|right|Protesters on their way to Drax]] --&gt;

On 31 August 2006, up to 600 people attended a protest called ''Reclaim Power'' converging on Drax and attempting to shut it down. There was a 'kids march' to Drax Power Station, with a giant ostrich puppet, made by [[The Mischief Makers]]. Two protesters climbed a lighting pylon at the edge of the Drax site and four others broke through the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1862662,00.html|title=In the shadow of Drax, not so much a fight as a festival|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2006-09-01 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 3,000 police officers, from 12 forces from as far afield as Hampshire and London, were reported to have been drafted in for the duration of the protest. Thirty-eight protesters were arrested. The police reported that work at the power plant was not disrupted, though eye witnesses reported having locked-on to various machinery inside the power station, thus stopping work. No coal went into Drax that day, with the railway line in being blocked off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article1223134.ece|title=The Battle of Drax: 38 held as protest fails to close plant|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2006-09-01 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Brown | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other protests arising from the camp included a protest against a [[nuclear power station]] in [[Hartlepool]], [[Teesside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://environment.guardian.co.uk/energy/story/0,,1861035,00.html|title=Energy protesters blockade nuclear power station|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2006-08-30 | location=London | first=David | last=Ward | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media response===
[[The Guardian]] reported that the Camp marked a turning point in [[grass-roots]] campaigning against the causes of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1862625,00.html Green goes mainstream.] [[The Guardian]] - 1 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The network forged at the Camp continues to work on campaigns to highlight and tackle the causes of climate change, participating in actions drawing attention to (for example) road building&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowideningm1.org.uk/ No Widening M1 Network]&lt;/ref&gt; and the climate effects of cheap air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planestupid.com|title=Plane Stupid}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://daysofclimateaction.org.uk/ Days of climate action] on different themes have been called by this [http://networkforclimateaction.org.uk/ Network for Climate Action].

==Heathrow 2007==
[[File:Climate camp at Heathrow - Sipson RIP.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A 'memorial' to the village of [[Sipson]] which would be completely destroyed to make way for a new runway for [[Heathrow airport]]]]
The 2007 camp ({{coord|51|29|20|N|0|26|43|W|type:landmark}}) ran from 14 to 21 August 2007 near [[London Heathrow Airport]] next to the village of [[Sipson]] on a disused sports ground owned by [[Imperial College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/environment/climate+camp+at+heathrow/671777|title=Climate Camp at Heathrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sipson would disappear from the map if the third runway at Heathrow was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4731948.stm|publisher=BBC News Online|title=Village faces being wiped off map|date=2006-02-21|accessdate=2008-03-04 | first=Margaret | last=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was preceded by 'Our Place' arts weekend, a community arts project run by activists for local residents  on 11 &amp; 12 August at St Mary's Church Hall in [[Harmondsworth]], another village which would be severely affected by the building of a third runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourplace-arts.org.uk|publisher=Our Arts|title=Event report: Residents, artists unite to celebrate villages threatened by Heathrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the camp there were also protests by [[Plane Stupid]], who were injuncted from protesting at Heathrow. On 13 August Plane Stupid activists boarded a barge transporting an Airbus A380 wing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planestupid.com/airbus1|title=Plane Stupid occupy Airbus A380 wing - BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 16 August at [[London Biggin Hill Airport]]. 15 protesters chained themselves to its main gates and caused a &quot;long queue of luxury cars waiting to get into the airport to build up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Environmental-activists-arrested-at-Biggin-Hill--newsinkent4654.aspx|title=Environmental activists arrested at Biggin Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ClimateCampBAA.jpg|thumb|250px|Climate activists blockade [[British Airports Authority]]'s headquarters for day of action.]]
On 19 August, the final day of the camp some 1000-1400 people took part in a 'Day of Action' and 200 people blockaded [[British Airports Authority]] HQ.&lt;ref name=BBCend&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6954428.stm|title=Campaigners leave Heathrow camp|date=2008-08-20|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-03-05}} Including map of proposed third runway&lt;/ref&gt;

As protesters left on 20 August protests took place against two [[carbon offset]] companies, [[Climate Care]] and the [[Carbon Neutral Company]] on 20 August when campaigners dressed as &quot;red herrings&quot; protested at the offices in Oxford London, five people blocked the main gate at [[Sizewell B]] nuclear power station in [[Suffolk]], and a group invaded the London offices of [[Bridgepoint Capital]], a private equity firm which is behind the expansion of [[Leeds-Bradford Airport]], and a dozen protesters superglued their hands to entrance doors at BP's headquarters in central London. A total of 58 people were arrested.&lt;ref name=BBCend/&gt;

===Injunction===
[[File:Climate camp at Heathrow - Clowns with police photographer.JPG|thumb|250px|There was a relaxed atmosphere between police and protesters during parts of the camp]]
BAA's proposed injunction would have restricted the movements of 5&amp;nbsp;million people from 15 different organisations, including the [[RSPB]], [[Greenpeace]], the [[Campaign for the Protection of Rural England]], the [[Woodland Trust]], [[Friends of the Earth]], and the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], among others.&lt;ref name=IndependentInjunction&gt;{{cite news

The ruling was sought under the auspices of the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]], originally intended to help the victims of [[stalking]],&lt;ref name=InjunctionPolitics/&gt; but now frequently used against protesters. In the end BAA won a very much more limited injunction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6932519.stm|work=BBC News|title=Heathrow protesters ban | date=2007-08-06 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the camp went ahead amid considerable worldwide publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6943084.stm|work=BBC News|title=Heathrow protesters set up camp | date=2007-08-12 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Duncan Bonfield, BAA director of corporate affairs, and Mark Mann, BAA head of media relations, resigned without stating their reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUKL2231571420070822|title=Two top press officers resign from BAA=Work=Reuters | date=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policing===
Policing for the camp was estimated to have cost £7&amp;nbsp;million by [[Scotland Yard]], though this included £4.3m for costs such as [[salaries]] which would have been spent anyway.&lt;ref name=BBCcost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6982705.stm|title=Heathrow protest police cost £7m|date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2008-03-05 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' put the costs at £70&amp;nbsp;million without explaining how it reached that figure.&lt;ref name=ESanarchists/&gt;

[[File:Climate Camp at Heathrow - in the media tent.JPG|thumb|250px|The inside of the media tent and the climate camp at Heathow. 10 workstations, with live satellite up-link and powered on renewable energy]]
In 2007 the police made preventive searches under [[Police stop and search powers in the United Kingdom#Section 60 orders|Section 60]] of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. The camp was heavily attended by a force of 1,800 police, who carried out searches, including some vehicles, under Section 44 of the [[Terrorism Act 2006]], and took photos of protesters entering and leaving the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6944526.stm?dynamic_vote=ON#vote_news_hys_airports_67845|title=Eco-village with a stark warning|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-08-13|author=Jon Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the 2007 the [[National Union of Journalists]] issued a public statement expressing &quot;deep concern&quot; over a proposed draft policy toward media access during its 2007 event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuj.org.uk/inner.php?docid=1819|publisher=National Union of Journalists|title=NUJ warns Climate Camp over restrictions on media|date=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp media team replied to the NUJ criticism by stating: &quot;The policy is a compromise that attempts to provide reasonable media access whilst respecting participants' right to privacy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2007/08/377840.html|publisher=Indymedia|title=Climate camp response to NUJ Criticisms}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2007 the proposed policy was amended to remove any possibility of blacklisting some journalists or giving sympathetic journalists longer access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/newpress.php|title=Camp for climate action - Climate camp amended Press Policy, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kingsnorth 2008==
[[Image:MedwayKingsnorth4184.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Kingsnorth power station]], seen from across the [[River Medway]] estuary, [[Medway]], [[Kent]]]]
The 2008 camp ({{coord|51|26|23|N|-0|32|54|E|type:landmark}}) took place in Kent, near [[E.ON UK]]'s [[Kingsnorth power station]], and run from 4 to 11 August to highlight E.ON's plans to build another coal-fired power station, which would be the first to be built in thirty years in the UK.

The action was also to highlight what is seen as an expansion to the [[fossil fuel]] economy, by corporations and government, and what activists claim is a demand for the opposite by scientific consensus. Furthermore, the camp attempted to challenge the businesses which will profit from the [[agrofuel]] industry, which they see as false solutions to the problems of climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;climatecamp.org.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2008/03/392958.html Climate Camp 2008 to target Kingsnorth power station], ''[[Indymedia]] UK'' March 4th 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kingsnorth climate camp 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|The climate camp, looking towards Kingsnorth power station]]

The camp began with a one day event at [[Heathrow]], the site of the previous year's camp followed by a march across [[London]] to [[Kingsnorth power station]], in common with seven other camps globally that were targeting [[coal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;climatecamp.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/pr2-3-08.php|title=Climate Camp Press Release: Camp to target Kingsnorth|publisher=Climate Camp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 200 workshops and debates were held during the camp, including ones with [[George Monbiot]], [[Caroline Lucas]], [[Arthur Scargill]] and [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.redpepper.org.uk/index.php?topic=589.0|title=Arthur Scargill, Caroline Lucas kick off Climate Camp workshops Mon 4 Aug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Scargill, former General Secretary of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] and [[Dave Douglass]], attended the camp to represent many in the mining community who disagreed with the protesters' anti-coal position which they saw as a continuation of the state's assault against them stemming back to the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)]]. They addressed the campers highlighting the oppressive conditions that miners face all over the world put forth their arguments especially against [[nuclear power]]. They also expressed solidarity with the camp against police repression and urged a class perspective.

On Saturday 9 August the protesters attempted to shut down the power station. The day was organised to highlight the impact on climate change with activists marching to Kingsnorth power station. Violent scenes developed between the police and the protesters, with many non-threatening protesters being hit and knocked to the ground by police with batons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date= |title=Police at Climate Camp |url=http://blip.tv/file/1177381 |format= |medium=Documentary |publisher=http://blip.tv/file/1177381 |location=Kingsnorth, England |accessdate=2009-04-03 |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camp provided facilities that many of the people needed such as showers, cheap food, internet access, entertainment, a TV studio and medical services. Complaints were made about the excessive policing of the event which are now being investigated officially.

On August 11, 2008, several protesters from Oxford and [[Thames Valley Climate Action]] glued their hands to the doors of [[BHP Billiton]]'s headquarters in protest of the use of coal as a fuel.  BHP Billiton is the world's largest coal producer.   &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7554619.stm “Coal protest team glued to doors]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policing===
1,500 officers were involved at an estimated cost of £5.9m,&lt;ref name=Dec15&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/15/kingsnorth-climate-change-environment-police|title=Those Kingsnorth police injuries in full: six insect bites and a toothache|accessdate=2009-04-07|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Vidal | date=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were over 100 arrests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2530714/Kent-power-station-protest-Over-50-environmental-activists-arrested.html|title=Kent power station protest: Over 50 environmental activists arrested|work=The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Vikki | last1=Miller | first2=Ben | last2=Leach | date=2008-08-09 | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some 2000 'potentially harmful' items were confiscated&lt;ref name=Ob0903&gt;{{cite news|work=The Observer|date=2009-03-01|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/01/kingsnorth-power-station-climate-camp|title=Police 'over the top' at climate camp | location=London | first=Tracy | last=McVeigh | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time ministers at the time claimed that 70 officers had been injured in the course of their duties.&lt;ref name=Dec15/&gt; However data obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] in March 2009 showed that no injuries were sustained by the police in clashes with demonstrators and the claim was retracted by [[Vernon Coaker]], the Home Office minister stating that &quot;there were no recorded injuries sustained as a result of direct contact with the protesters&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dec15/&gt; It was also revealed later that amongst the confiscated items were balloons, crayons, and a clown outfit, cycle helmets, plastic buckets, books, life-jackets, inflatable dinghies, paddles and foot pumps.&lt;ref name=Ob0903/&gt;

At the time local MP [[Bob Marshall-Andrews]] said that some policing was &quot;provocative and heavy-handed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7544233.stm|title=Climate camp policing condemned|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-08-05 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Caroline Lucas]] MEP condemned police tactics, which included [[riot police]], [[pepper spray]] and routine [[stop and search]] of everyone entering and leaving the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange|title=Dirty tactics to defend a dirty industry|date=2008-08-04|author=Caroline Lucas | work=The Guardian | location=London | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] said there was significant public concern at the policing of the camp which should be addressed. These included issues about misconduct, but also in regard to operational tactics including claims that officers used loud music at night to disrupt protesters who were trying to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7968884.stm|title=Concern over Climate Camp police|work=BBC News|date=2009-03-27|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the camp started police had found weapons hidden in nearby woods which included knives, a replica throwing star and a large chain and padlock. Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge stated that while he believed the majority of the Climate Camp protesters to be peaceful, he was concerned that some had &quot;more sinister intentions&quot;. Protesters said the find had nothing to do with the camp and the police agreed that there was no firm evidence linking the them to the camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc0508&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7542592.stm|title='Weapons Stash' near Climate Camp|work=BBC News|date=2008-08-09|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2009, the ''Guardian'' released video evidence of alleged brutality by police officers at the camp against two women. They belonged to the campaign group, Fitwatch, who campaign against the use of [[forward intelligence team]]s. They spotted several officers who did not have visible [[epaulette]]s and when they asked the officers to reveal their identities they were arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2306&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/21/kingsnorth-protester-arrests-video-complaint|title=Surveillance protesters bundled to ground by police|date=2009-06-23|accessdate=2009-06-23 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Paul | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mailarticle-1170963&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1170963/Maybe-just-forgot-Scotland-Yards-incredible-excuse-police-officer-spotted-ID-street-protest.html|title=Numbers must be on display|accessdate=2009-07-03 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | date=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camp in the City ({{coord|51.5152|-0.0825|type:landmark}}) took place on 1 April 2009 was one of a [[2009 G-20 London summit protests|number of protests]] associated with the [[2009 G-20 London summit|G20 London Summit]]. The aim was to draw attention to [[carbon trading]], claiming that far from being a way of reducing release of climate change gasses in the atmosphere it is used as an excuse to continue doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/carbon-trading|title=Carbon trading|publisher=Climate Camp|accessdate=2009-04-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp took place outside the [[European Climate Exchange]] in [[Bishopsgate]] and was distinct from the G-20 Meltdown protest that took place outside the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/G20-Summit-Protests-Guide-To-Whats-Going-To-Happen-And-When/Article/200904115253140?videoSourceID=2fa12d8859160210VgnVCM1000005d04170aRCRD&amp;lpos=UK_News_Article_Inline_Player_List_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15253140_G20_Summit_Protests%3A_Guide_To_Whats_Going_To_Happen_And_When|title=Timetable Of Disruption: The Summit Protests|work=Sky News|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the actual camp a group of participants had played a game called 'capture the flag' in the area on 27 March which was used by the protesters to familiarise themselves with the locale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/uk/7961868.stm|title=Eco-activists prepare for protest|work=BBC News | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp for Climate Action organisers agreed to meet with police and exchange contact details shortly before the protest. The meeting was arranged by [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[David Howarth]], who was to mediate at the meeting which was to take place at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Scotland Yard confirmed that a meeting was to take place with Bob Broadhurst (police commander) and Ian Thomas (chief superintendent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/30/g20-police-agree-talks-protesters|title=Police agree to urgent talks with G20 protesters | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Paul | last=Lewis | date=2009-03-30 | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camp, which was intended to last for 24 hours, started at 12:30pm when a camp was established in a section of Bishopsgate between [[Threadneedle Street]] and [[London Wall]] with tents set up and [[Bunting (textile)|bunting]] across the road reading 'Nature doesn't do bailouts'.&lt;ref name=BBC_eyewitness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7977863.stm|title=Eyewitness: Climate Camp in the City|accessdate=2009-04-07|work=BBC news | date=2009-04-01 | first=Dominic | last=Casciani}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were solar-powered sound systems, musicians and a food stall and some 1,000-plus relaxed people.&lt;ref name=skypeace&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.news.sky.com/thedailyplanet/Post:82f1acc3-041a-48d7-a5aa-b8efc8c96522|title=Peace, love and riot police|work=Sky news|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmosphere was still relaxed at about 5pm when police with helmets, shields and batons began to surround areas of the camp using section 14 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].&lt;ref name=skypeace/&gt;
