A '''veto''' – Latin for &quot;I forbid&quot; – is the power (used by an officer of the state, for example) to unilaterally stop an official action, especially the enactment of legislation.

A veto can be absolute, as for instance in the [[United Nations Security Council veto power|United Nations Security Council]], whose permanent members ([[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]]) can block any resolution. Or it can be limited, as in the legislative process of the United States, where a two-thirds vote in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] may override a Presidential veto of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: From bills to law|Article I, Section 7, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A veto only gives power to stop changes, not to adopt them. Thus a veto allows its holder to protect the status quo.

The concept of a veto body originated with the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman consul|consul]]s and [[tribune]]s. Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the [[Roman Senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Robert J.|title=The presidential veto: touchstone of the American presidency|pages=1–2|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-88706-802-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman veto==

The institution of the veto, known as the ''intercessio'', was adopted by the [[Roman Republic]] in the 6th century BC to enable the tribunes to protect the interests of the [[plebs]] (common citizenry) from the encroachments of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], who dominated the Senate. A tribune's veto did not prevent the senate from passing a bill, but meant that it was denied the force of law. The tribunes could also use the veto to prevent a bill from being brought before the plebeian assembly. The consuls also had the power of veto, as decision-making generally required the assent of both consuls. If one disagreed, either could invoke the ''intercessio'' to block the action of the other. The veto was an essential component of the Roman conception of power being wielded not only to manage state affairs but to moderate and restrict the power of the state's high officials and institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzer&quot; /&gt;

==Westminster systems==
===Overview===
In [[Westminster System]]s and most [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the power to veto legislation by withholding the [[Royal Assent]] is a rarely used [[reserve power]] of the monarch. In practice, the Crown follows the convention of exercising its prerogative on the advice of its chief advisor, the prime minister.

===Australia===
Since the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (1931), the United Kingdom Parliament may not repeal any Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia on the grounds that is repugnant to the laws and interests of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=25 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date=9 October 1942 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Australia), such as Canada and New Zealand, are likewise affected. However, according to the [[Australian Constitution]] (sec. 59), the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] may veto a bill that has been given royal assent by the [[Governor-General]] within one year of the legislation being assented to.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.au&quot;/&gt; This power has never been used. The Australian Governor-General himself or herself has, in theory, power to veto, or more technically, withhold assent to, a bill passed by both houses of the [[Australian Parliament]], and contrary to the advice of the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/1997-98/98rn25.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done without consulting the sovereign as per Section 58 of the constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents in the Queen's name, or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure. The Governor-General may return to the house in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him, and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may recommend, and the Houses may deal with the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |title=Chapter I. The Parliament. Part V – Powers of the Parliament, Section 58 |work=[[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]: [[Australian Senate|Department of the Senate]] |accessdate=13 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[reserve power]] is however, constitutionally arguable, and it is difficult to foresee an occasion when such a power would need to be exercised. It is possible that a Governor-general might so act if a bill passed by the Parliament was criminal, illegal or in violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govhouse.wa.gov.au/powers.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; One might argue, however, that a government would be hardly likely to present a bill which is so open to rejection. Many of the vice-regal reserve powers are untested, because of the brief constitutional history of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the observance of the convention that the head of state acts upon the advice of his or her chief minister. The power may also be used in a situation where the parliament, usually a [[hung parliament]], passes a bill without the blessing of the executive. The governor general on the advice of the executive could withhold consent from the bill thereby preventing its passage into law.

With regard to the six governors of the states which are federated under the Australian Commonwealth, a somewhat different situation exists. Until the [[Australia Act]] 1986, each state was constitutionally dependent upon the British Crown directly. Since 1986, however, they are fully independent entities, although the Queen still appoints governors on the advice of the state head of government, the [[premier]]. So the Crown may not veto (nor the UK Parliament overturn) any act of a state governor or state legislature. Paradoxically, the states are more independent of the Crown than the federal government and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mediation Communications, Level 3, 414 Bourke Street, Melbourne Vic 3000, Phone 9602 2992, www.mediacomms.com.au |url=http://www.governor.vic.gov.au/role.htm |title=Government House |publisher=Governor.vic.gov.au |accessdate=2012-08-13}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; State constitutions determine what role a governor plays. In general the governor exercises the powers the sovereign would have, including the power to withhold the Royal Assent.

===Canada===
According to the [[Constitution of Canada|British North America Act, 1867]], the [[Governor General of Canada]] may veto a bill by refusing [[Royal Assent]]. If the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] withholds the Queen's assent, the sovereign may within two years disallow the bill, thereby vetoing the law in question. However, this power has never been used. 

Provincial viceroys, [[Lieutenants Governor]], however are able to reserve Royal Assent to provincial bills for the governor general; this clause was last invoked in 1961 by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;Bastedo, Frank Lindsay, [http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/bastedo_frank_lindsay_1886-1973.html Encyclopedia of Saskatachewan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{see also|President of India#Important presidential interventions}}

In India, the president has three veto powers i.e. absolute, suspension &amp; pocket. The president can send the bill back to parliament for changes, which constitutes a limited veto that can be overridden by a simple majority. The president can also take no action indefinitely on a bill, sometimes referred to as a pocket veto.The president can refuse to assent, which constitutes an absolute veto.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro india&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to the Constitution of India |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;pg=PA145 | publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Learning Pvt.

P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

In Spain, article 115 of the Constitution provides that the King shall give his assent to laws passed by the General Courts within 15 days after their final passing by them. The absence of the royal assent, although not constitutionally provided{{clarifyme|date=September 2012}}, would mean the bill did not become law.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the royal veto (&quot;withholding [[Royal Assent]]&quot;) was last exercised in 1708 by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] with the [[Scottish Militia Bill 1708]].

The [[House of Lords]] used to have the power of veto. However, reform first by a Liberal government and then by a Labour government has limited its powers. The [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949]] reduced its powers: they can now only amend and delay legislation. They can delay legislation for up to one year. Under the 1911 Act, money bills (those concerning finance) cannot be delayed, and under the Salisbury Convention, the Lords cannot delay any bills set out in the governing party's manifesto.

== United States ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Royal Assent]] --&gt;
===According to the Constitution===
{{See also|List of United States presidential vetoes|Line-item veto|Pocket veto}}
All legislation passed by both houses of Congress must be presented to the [[President of the United States|President]]. This presentation is in the President's capacity as Head of State. 

If the [[President of the United States|President]] approves of the legislation, he signs it into law. According to Article 1. Section 7 of the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RS22188.pdf | format = PDF | title = Regular Vetoes and Pocket Vetoes: An Overview  | first = Kevin R. |last = Kosar | date = 18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the president chooses, if he does not approve, he must return the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], unsigned, within ten days, excluding Sundays, to the house of the [[United States Congress]] in which it originated, while the Congress is [[wikt:in session|in session]]. The President is constitutionally required to state his objections to the legislation in writing, and the Congress is constitutionally required to consider them, and to reconsider the legislation. This action, in effect, is a veto.

If the Congress [[veto override|overrides]] the veto by a [[two-thirds majority]] in each house, it becomes law without the President's signature. Otherwise, the bill fails to become law unless it is presented to the President again and he chooses to sign it.

A bill can also become law without the President's signature if, after it is presented to him, he simply fails to sign it within the ten days noted. If there are fewer than ten days left in the session before Congress [[wikt:adjourn|adjourn]]s, and if Congress does so [[wikt:adjourn|adjourn]] before the ten days have expired in which the President might sign the bill, then the bill fails to become law.  This procedure, when used as a formal device, is called a [[pocket veto]].

===Modifications declared unconstitutional===
In 1982, the Supreme Court had struck down the one-house [[legislative veto]], on [[separation of powers]] grounds and on grounds that the action by one house of Congress violated the Constitutional requirement of bicameralism. The case was ''[[INS v. Chadha]]'', concerning a foreign exchange student in [[Ohio]] who had been born in Kenya but whose parents were from India.  Because he was not born in India, he was not an Indian citizen.  Because his parents were not Kenyan citizens, he was not Kenyan.  Thus, he had nowhere to go when his student visa expired because neither country would take him, so he overstayed his visa and was ordered to show cause why he should not be deported from the United States.

The Immigration and Nationality Act was one of many acts of Congress passed since the 1930s, which contained a provision allowing either house of that legislature to nullify decisions of agencies in the executive branch simply by passing a resolution. In this case, Chadha's deportation was suspended and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a resolution overturning the suspension, so that the deportation proceedings would continue. This, the Court held, amounted to the House of Representatives passing legislation without the concurrence of the Senate, and without presenting the legislation to the President for consideration and approval (or veto). Thus, the Constitutional principle of bicameralism and the separation of powers doctrine were disregarded in this case, and this legislative veto of executive decisions was struck down.

In 1996, the [[United States Congress]] passed, and President [[Bill Clinton]] signed, the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]]. This [[Act of Congress|act]] allowed the President to veto individual items of budgeted expenditures from appropriations bills instead of vetoing the entire bill and sending it back to the Congress. However, this [[line-item veto]] was immediately challenged by members of Congress who disagreed with it. In 1998, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] declared that the line-item veto was unconstitutional. The Court found the language of the Constitution required each bill presented to the President to be either approved or rejected as a whole. An action by which the President might pick and choose which parts of the bill to approve or not approve amounted to the President acting as a legislator instead of an executive and [[head of state]]—and particularly as a single legislator acting in place of the entire Congress—thereby violating the [[separation of powers]] doctrine.  (See ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', {{ussc|524|417|1998}}.)

In 2006, Senator [[Bill Frist]] introduced the [[Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006]] in the [[United States Senate]]. Rather than provide for an actual legislative veto, however, the procedure created by the Act provides that, if the President should recommend rescission of a budgetary line item from a budget bill he previously signed into law—a power he already possesses pursuant to U.S. Const. Art. II—the Congress must vote on his request within ten days. Because the legislation that is the subject of the President's request (or &quot;Special Message&quot;, in the language of the bill) was already enacted and signed into law, the vote by the Congress would be ordinary legislative action, not any kind of veto—whether line-item, legislative or any other sort. The House passed this measure, but the Senate never considered it, so the bill expired and never became law.

===Early federal history===
The [[President of the Continental Congress|Presidents]] of the [[Continental Congress]] (1774–1781) did not have the power of veto. The President could not veto an act of Congress under the [[Articles of Confederation]] (1781–1789), but he possessed certain recess and reserve powers that were not necessarily available to the predecessor President of Continental Congress. It was only with the enactment of the [[United States Constitution]] (drafted 1787; ratified 1788; fully effective since 4 March 1789) that veto power was conferred upon the person titled &quot;President of the United States&quot;.

The presidential veto power was first exercised on 5 April 1792&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Vetoes_vrd.htm | title = Vetoes | work = Virtual Reference Desk | publisher = United States Senate}} – includes lists of vetoes from 1789 to the current day.&lt;/ref&gt; when President [[George Washington]] vetoed a bill outlining a new apportionment formula submitted by then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. Apportionment described how Congress divides seats in the House of Representatives among the states based on the US census figures. President Washington thought the bill gave an unfair advantage to the northern states.

The Congress first overrode a presidential veto (passed a bill into law notwithstanding the President's objections)on 3 March 1845.&lt;ref name=veto_history&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf | title=Presidential Vetoes, 1789 to 1988 | format=PDF | date=February 1992 | publisher=The U.S. Government Printing Office | accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. states, veto powers, and override authority===
All U.S. states also have a provision by which legislative decisions can be vetoed by the governor. In addition to the ability to veto an entire bill as a &quot;package,&quot; many states allow the governor to exercise specialty veto authority to strike or revise portions of a bill without striking the whole thing.

'''Amendatory veto:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Allows a governor to amend bills that have been passed by the legislature. Revisions are subject to confirmation or rejection by the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vock&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Vock|first=Daniel|title=Govs enjoy quirky veto power|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/govs-enjoy-quirky-veto-power-85899386875|publisher=pewstates.org|accessdate=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Line item veto:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Allows a governor to remove specific sections of a bill that has been passed by the legislature. Deletions can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vock&quot;/&gt;

'''Pocket veto:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Any bill presented to a governor after a session has ended must be signed to become law. A governor can refuse to sign such a bill and it will expire. Such vetoes cannot be overridden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vock&quot;/&gt;

'''Reduction veto:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Allows a governor to reduce the amounts budgeted for spending items. Reductions can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vock&quot;/&gt;

'''Package veto:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Allows a governor to veto the entire bill. Package vetoes can be overridden by the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vock&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Veto power and override authority by state'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vock&quot;/&gt;

== European parliamentary republics ==
=== Presidential veto ===

Many parliamentary republics in Europe allow a form of limited presidential veto on legislation.  This include Italy, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Hungary.

The [[President of Austria]] technically has no veto power but may order a referendum on a bill passed by the legislature if he refuses to sign it.

The [[President of Iceland]] may refuse to sign a bill, which is then put to universal adult [[suffrage]]. This right was not exercised until 2004, by President [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], who has since refused to sign two other bills. The first bill was withdrawn, but the latter two resulted in referenda. 

The [[President of Hungary]] has two options to veto a bill: submit it to the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]] if he suspects that it violates the constitution or send it back to the [[National Assembly of Hungary|Parliament]] and ask for a second debate and vote on the bill. If the Court rules that the bill is constitutional or it is passed by the Parliament again, respectively, the President must sign it.

The [[President of Ireland]] may refuse to grant assent to a bill that he or she considers to be unconstitutional, after consulting the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]]; in this case, the bill is referred to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Irish Supreme Court]], which finally determines the matter. This is the most widely used reserve power. The President may also, on request of a majority of the Senate and a third of Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament), after consulting the Council of State, decline to sign a bill &quot;of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained&quot; in an [[ordinary referendum]] or a new Dáil reassembling after a general election held within eight months. This latter power has never been used because the government of the day almost always commands a majority of the Senate, preventing the third of Dáil Éireann that usually makes up the opposition from combining with it. 

The [[President of Italy]] may request a second deliberation of a bill passed by Parliament before it is promulgated. This is very weak form of veto as the Parliament can override the veto by an ordinary majority.  The same provision exists in France and Latvia. While such a limited veto cannot thwart the will of a determined parliamentary majority, it may have a delaying effect and may cause the parliamentary majority to reconsider the matter. The President of Republic can also call new Parliament elections.

The [[President of Estonia]] may effectively veto a law adopted by [[Riigikogu|Estonian parliament]] by refusing to proclaim it and demanding a new debate and decision. The parliament, in its turn, may overrride this veto by passing the law unamended for the second time (a simple majority is enough). In this case the President is obliged to proclaim the law or to request the [[Supreme Court of Estonia]] to declare the law unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court rules that the law does not violate the [[Constitution of Estonia|Constitution]], the President may not object any more and is obliged to finally proclaim the law. 

The [[President of Latvia]] may suspend a bill for a period of two months, during which it may be referred to the people in a referendum if a certain number of signatures are gathered. This is potentially a much stronger form of veto, as it enables the President to appeal to the people against the wishes of the Parliament and Government.

The [[President of Poland]] may submit a bill to the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] if he suspects that bill is unconstitutional or send it back to the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] for a second voting. If the Tribunal says that the bill is constitutional or if Sejm passes it by at least three-fifths of the votes, the President must sign the bill.

The [[President of Portugal]] may refuse to sign a bill or refer it or parts of it to the [[Portuguese Constitutional Court]]. If the President refuses to sign bill without it being declared unconstitutional, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] (parliament) may pass it again, in which case it becomes law.

The [[President of Ukraine]] may refuse to sign a bill and return it to Parliament with his proposals. If the parliament agrees on his proposals, the President must sign the bill. Parliament may overturn a veto by a two-thirds majority. If Parliament overturns his veto, the President must sign the bill within 10 days.

=== Liberum veto ===

In the constitution Poland or the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, there was an institution called the [[liberum veto]]. All bills had to pass the ''Sejm'' or &quot;Seimas&quot; (Parliament) by [[unanimous]] consent, and if any legislator voted ''nay'' on anything, this not only vetoed that bill but also dissolved that legislative session itself. The concept originated in the idea of &quot;Polish democracy&quot; as any Pole of noble extraction considered was as good as any other, no matter how low or high his material condition might be. It was never exercised, however, under the rule of the strong Polish royal dynasties, which came to an end in the mid-17th century. These were followed by an elective kingship. As might be expected, the more and more frequent use of this veto power paralyzed the power of the legislature and, combined with a string of weak figurehead kings, led ultimately to the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning and the dissolution of the Polish state]] in the late 18th century.
