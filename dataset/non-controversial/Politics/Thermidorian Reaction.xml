The '''Thermidorian Reaction''' was a revolt in the [[French Revolution]] against perceived excesses of the [[Reign of Terror]]. It was triggered by a vote of the [[National Convention]] to execute [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] and several other leading members of the Terror. This ended the most radical phase of the French Revolution.

The name ''Thermidorian'' refers to 9 [[Thermidor]] Year II (27 July 1794), the date according to the [[French Republican Calendar|French Revolutionary Calendar]] when Robespierre and other radical revolutionaries came under concerted attack in the National Convention.  ''Thermidorian Reaction'' also refers to the remaining period until the National Convention was superseded by the [[French Directory|Directory]]; this is also sometimes called the era of the '''Thermidorian Convention'''. Prominent figures of Thermidor include [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Paul Barras]], [[Jean-Lambert Tallien]] and [[Joseph Fouché]].

==Background==
{{Main|Reign of Terror}}
Thermidor represents the final throes of the [[Reign of Terror]]. With Robespierre the sole remaining strong man of the Revolution (following the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]], and the executions of [[Georges Danton]] and [[Jacques Hébert]]), his apparently total grasp on power was, in fact, increasingly illusory, especially insofar as he seemed to have support from factions to his [[right-wing politics|right]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. His only real political power at this time lay in the [[Jacobin Club]], which had extended itself beyond the borders of Paris and into the country as a network of &quot;Popular Societies&quot;. 

His tight personal control of the military and his distrust of military might and of banks, along with his opposition to corrupt individuals in government, made Robespierre the subject of a number of conspiracies. The conspiracies came together on 9 Thermidor (27 July) when members of the national bodies of the revolutionary government arrested Robespierre as well as the leaders of the Paris city government.

==Conspiratorial groups==

Not all of the conspiratorial groupings were ideological in motivation; many who conspired against Robespierre did so for strong practical and personal reasons, most notably self-preservation. The surviving [[Georges Danton|Dantonists]], such as [[Antoine Christophe Merlin|Merlin de Thionville]] for example, wanted revenge for the death of [[Georges Danton|Danton]] and, more importantly, to protect their own heads.

The [[Left-wing politics|Left]] were opposed to Robespierre on the grounds that he rejected [[atheism]] and was not sufficiently radical.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} 

The prime mover, however, for the events of 9 Thermidor (27 July) was a [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] conspiracy, led by [[Jean-Lambert Tallien]] and [[Bourdon de l'Oise]], which was gradually coalescing, and was to come to pass at the time when the Montagnards had finally swayed the deputies of the Right over to their side. (Robespierre and Saint-Just were, themselves, Montagnards.) Some authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Stefan Zweig in Joseph Fouché. Bildnis eines politischen Menschen. 1929&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the then leftist [[Joseph Fouché]] played a large role in the conspiracy. Fouché was likely to be convicted and executed for treason and atheism, since Robespierre himself was about to denounce him in a speech to the Convention, which would have been delivered the day after the coup d'état (28 July). Dwelling in the shadows, he made great efforts to convince the main surviving [[leftist]]s and moderates that they were meant to be the next victims of Robespierre's dictatorship, thus uniting them against Robespierre, and by those means saving his own life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the end, it was Robespierre himself who united all his enemies.   On 8 Thermidor (July 26), he gave a speech to the Convention in which he railed against enemies and conspiracies, some within the powerful committees,  as he did not give the names of ''these traitors'', all in the Convention had reason to fear that they were the targets.  Later he went and enlisted the support of the Jacobin Club, where he denounced Collot and Billaud.  These men then spent the night planning the following day’s coup with other members of the convention.

On 9 Thermidor (27 July), in the Hall of Liberty in [[Paris]], Saint-Just was in the midst of reading a report to the Committee of Public Safety when he was interrupted by Tallien, who impugned Saint-Just and then went on to denounce the tyranny of Robespierre. The attack was taken up by [[Billaud-Varenne]], and Saint-Just's typical eloquence fled him, leaving him subject to a withering verbal assault until Robespierre leapt to the defense of Saint-Just and himself. Cries went up of 'Down with the tyrant! Arrest him!' Robespierre then made his appeal to the deputies of the Right, &quot;Deputies of the Right, men of honour, men of virtue, give me the floor, since the assassins will not.&quot; However, the Right was unmoved, and an order was made to arrest Robespierre and his followers. 

Troops from the Paris Commune arrived to liberate the prisoners. The Commune troops, under General [[Jean-Baptiste Coffinhal|Coffinhal]], then marched against the Convention itself. The Convention responded by ordering troops of its own under [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Paul Barras]] to be called out. When the Commune's troops heard the news of this, order began to break down, and [[François Hanriot|Hanriot]] ordered his remaining troops to withdraw to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]. Robespierre and his supporters also gathered at the Hôtel de Ville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriman, John 2004 p 507&quot;&gt;Merriman, John(2004). &quot;Thermidor&quot;(2nd ed.). ''A history of modern Europe: from the Renaissance to the present'',p 507. W.W. Norton &amp; Company Ltd. ISBN 0-393-92495-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention declared them to be outlaws, meaning that upon verification the fugitives could be executed within 24 hours without a trial. As the night went on the Commune forces at the Hôtel de Ville deserted until none of them remained. The Convention troops under Barras approached the Hôtel around 2:00 am on 28 July. As they came, Robespierre's brother [[Augustin Robespierre|Augustin]] leapt out of a window in an escape attempt, broke his legs, and was arrested. [[Philippe-François-Joseph Le Bas|Le Bas]] committed suicide. [[Georges Couthon|Couthon]], who was paralysed from the waist down, was found lying at the bottom of a staircase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriman, John 2004 p 507&quot;/&gt; 

Robespierre was shot in the face, and his jaw was shattered. There are two accounts of how he received the wound. One states that, anticipating his own downfall and wanting to have the death of a hero, Robespierre attempted to kill himself and shattered his own jaw with a shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriman, John 2004 p 507&quot;/&gt; The contrary view is that he was shot by one of the Convention's troops. At the time, a ''[[Gendarmerie|gendarme]]'' named [[Charles-André Merda]] claimed to have pulled the trigger.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberstudios&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://carlyle.classicauthors.net/FrenchRevolution/FrenchRevolution151.html| title = The French Revolution A History|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saint-Just made no attempt at suicide or concealment. Hanriot tried to hide in the Hôtel de Ville's yard, by some sources {{Who|date=October 2009}} after being thrown out a window into a stack of [[latrine]] and [[hay]], but the Convention troops quickly discovered him and assaulted him badly, allegedly gouging one of his eyes out so that it hung from its socket.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Death of Robespierre==
[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|250px|The execution of Robespierre on July 28, 1794 marked the end of the first Reign of Terror.]]
Robespierre was declared an [[outlaw]], and condemned without judicial process. The following day, 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794), he was executed with 21 of his closest associates, including:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Consequences of the Reaction==
The events of 9 Thermidor were to prove a watershed in the revolutionary process. The Thermidorian regime that followed was, at the very least, less rigid, ending the Reign of Terror and allowing for more individual liberty, especially in areas of religion. At the same time, its economic policies paved the way for rampant inflation. Ultimately, power devolved to the hands of the Directory, an executive of five men who assumed power in France in year III of the French Revolution.

The Thermidorian regime excluded the remaining Montagnards from power, even those who had joined in conspiring against Robespierre and Saint-Just. The [[White Terror]] resulted in numerous imprisonments and several hundred executions, almost exclusively of people on the political left. These numbers, while significant, were considerably smaller than those associated with the previous Reign of Terror, which killed tens of thousands, however, even in smaller numbers, said executions were made for revenge against the Jacobins and mostly for political differences rather than due to a perceived or real threat to the people, as the previous terror was, and many of the victims were executed without a trial.

==Thermidorian regime==
“On July 29 the victor of the 9th Thermidor condemned seventy members of the Paris Commune to death; thereafter the Commune was subject to the Convention” &lt;ref&gt;Will and Ariel Durant, “The Age of Napoleon” (New York:[[Simon and Schuster]], 1975), 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of the reorganization of French politics, practitioners of the terror were called to defend their records, some such as [[Tallien]], [[Fouché]] and [[Louis-Marie Stanislas Fréron|Fréron]] rejoined the leadership.  Others such as [[Billaud-Varenne]], [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d’Herbois]], [[Barère]] &amp; [[Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier|Vadier]] were sentenced to exile in South America.  (Although the last two managed to evade arrest).  Many Jacobin clubs were closed.  Freedom of worship was extended first to the [[War in the Vendée|Vendée]] and later to all France.  On December 24, 1794, the [[General maximum|Maximum]], (Controls on prices and wages), was abolished. The government exacerbated this inflationary move by issuing more [[assignats]].

In April and May of 1795 protests and riots in support of the radicals broke out culminating in an invasion of the Convention by an insurrectionary mob on May 20.  On May 22 the Convention struck back, having troops under [[Pichegru]] surround the [[Faubourg St-Antoine]] and force the capitulation of the armed rebels. In May and June 1795, a ‘[[White Terror]]’ raged in which Jacobins were victims and the judges were bourgeois ‘Moderates’”.&lt;ref&gt;Will and Ariel Durant, “The Age of Napoleon” (New York:[[Simon and Schuster]], 1975), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout France the events of the [[September Massacres]] were repeated, however this time the victims were imprisoned officials of [[Reign of Terror|the terror]].  In Paris, Royalist sentiments were openly tolerated.

Meanwhile French Armies overran the Netherlands and established the [[Batavian Republic]], occupied the left bank of the Rhine and forced Spain, Prussia and several German States to sue for peace enhancing the prestige of the Convention.  [[constitution of 1795|A new constitution]] was drawn up which eased back some of the democratic elements of the [[constitution of 1793]] establishing an electoral college for the election of officials, a bicameral legislature and other provisions designed to protect the current holders of power.  On October 5, ([[13 Vendémiaire]]), a revolt lead by Royalists challenged the Convention.  It was put down by Napoleon with ''[[13 Vendémiaire#a whiff of grapeshot|a whiff of grapeshot]]''.  On October 25 the Convention declared itself dissolved and was replaced by the [[French Directory]] on November 2.

==Other Thermidorian Reactions==
For historians of revolutionary movements, the term ''Thermidor'' has come to mean the phase in some revolutions when power slips from the hands of the original revolutionary leadership and a radical regime is replaced by a more conservative regime, sometimes to the point where the political pendulum may swing back towards something resembling a pre-revolutionary state.  [[Leon Trotsky]], in his book ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'', alleges the rise of [[Joseph Stalin]] to power was a ''Soviet Thermidor''.
