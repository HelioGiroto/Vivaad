The '''foco''' theory of [[revolution]] by way of [[guerrilla warfare]], also known as '''focalism''' ({{lang-es|foquismo|links=no|links=no}} {{IPA-es|foˈkizmo|}}), was formulated by French intellectual and government official [[Régis Debray]], whose main source of inspiration was [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara]]'s experiences surrounding his rebel army's victory in the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]]. 

Its central principle is that [[vanguardism]] by [[cadres]] of small, fast-moving [[paramilitary]] groups can provide a focus (in Spanish, ''foco'') for popular discontent against a sitting regime, and thereby lead a general [[insurrection]].  Although the original approach was to mobilize and launch attacks from rural areas, many ''foco'' ideas were adapted into [[urban guerrilla warfare]] movements by the late 1960s.

== Background ==
Like other [[leadership|leader]]s of his time, such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Amilcar Cabral]], [[Che Guevara]] believed that people living in countries still ruled by colonial powers, or living in countries chained by what he saw as [[Neo-colonialism|a new form of economic exploitation]], could best defeat what he perceived as colonial powers by taking up arms. Like other theoreticians, Guevara also believed that armed resistance needed to be built not by concentrating one's forces in urban centers, but rather through accumulation of strength in mountainous and rural regions where the enemy's presence was weakest.&lt;ref name = &quot;SLG&quot;&gt;[http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/02/legacy-of-che-guevara-internationalism.html The Legacy of Che Guevara: Internationalism Today] by Dr. Peter Custers, ''Sri Lankan Guardian'', February 24, 2010
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuban Revolution ==
''Foquismo'', which was formally theorized by Régis Debray, draws on Ernesto Guevara's experience of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, where a small group of 82 members landed in Cuba on board of the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'', in December 1956, and initiated a guerrilla war in the [[Sierra Maestra]]. During two years, the poorly armed ''[[escopeteros]]'', at times fewer than 200 men, managed to win victories against [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]'s army and police force, which numbered between 30,000 and 40,000 in strength.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bockman2&quot;&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/BLJ.htm  Bockman], chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The small group finally managed to take [[Havana]] after the December 1958 [[Battle of Santa Clara]]. 

This surprising success led to the ''foquismo'' theory which, inspired by Mao's doctrine of [[people's war]], counted on the support of the people to win the war. But the foquismo theory stated that this popular support would be created during the [[armed struggle]] itself: thus, against predominant [[Marxist theory]], there was no need to wait for the &quot;objective conditions&quot; of a popular uprising to engage the last stage of the revolutionary struggle (i.e. armed struggle). In other words, a small group of revolutionaries was considered to be enough to jumpstart a revolution since this group could begin the revolutionary struggle while at the same time developing the conditions necessary for popular support for the revolution. This theory focused heavily on the notion of [[vanguardism]] and on the moral value of the example.

==Theory==

While focalism drew from previous [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideas, including a unique, adaptive blending of [[Stalinist]] tactics and the [[Maoist]] strategy of &quot;[[protracted people's war]]&quot;, it also broke with many of the mid-[[Cold War]] era's established [[communist parties]].  Despite [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s eager support for &quot;[[wars of national liberation]]&quot; and the focalists' own enthusiasm for [[Soviet]] patronage, Cuba's own [[Partido Socialista Popular (Cuba)|Partido Socialista Popular]] had retreated from active confrontation with the [[Fulgencio Batista]] regime, so Castroism/[[Guevarism]] substituted the ''foquista'' [[militia]] for the more traditional [[vanguard party]]. 

In ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|La Guerra de guerrillas]]'' (Guerrilla Warfare), Guevara did not count on a [[Leninist]] insurrection led by the [[proletariat]] as had happened during the 1917 [[October Revolution]], but on popular uprisings which would gain strength in rural areas and would overthrow the regime: the vanguard guerrilla was supposed to bolster the population's morale, not to take control of the [[State (polity)|state apparatus]] itself and this overthrow would occur without any external or foreign help. According to him, guerrillas were to be supported by [[conventional warfare|conventional armed forces]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It is well established that guerrilla warfare constitutes one of the phases of war; this phase can not, on its own, lead to victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Che Guevara (French ed.: ''Oeuvres'' I, ''Petite collection [[François Maspero|Maspero]]'', 34, 1968, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Guevara added that this theory was formulated for [[developing countries]], and that the ''guerrilleros'' had to look for support among both the workers and the [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1963/misc/guerrilla-war-method.htm Guevara, Che. &quot;Guerrilla War: A Method.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In power, Castro sided with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the 1961 [[Sino-Soviet split]], while Guevara sympathized with the [[People's Republic of China]].  Perhaps accelerated by this divide, the latter man shifted his energies away from Cuba to adventurism, promoting guerrilla ''focos'' overseas.  Though this method had triumphed in Cuba, Guevara saw it subsequently fail in Africa and Latin America. [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] put it in practice [[Congo Crisis|in Congo]]. Despite being backed by the Castro regime, Guevara's attempt to forge an [[Ñancahuazú Guerrilla|insurgency]] in [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia]] led to his capture and subsequent execution in 1967.

==Foco after Guevara==
Guevara's unsuccessful campaign in Bolivia dampened Cuba's overt support of focoist uprisings internationally for several years, and many revolutionary movements split into different factions, particularly [[New Left]], Maoist and/or urban guerrilla breakaways from previous Moscow-line parties and/or ''foco'' groups. By the mid-1970s, however, Cuba revived and further escalated its previous zeal, directly deploying its military in Africa before the collapse of ''[[détente]]''—e.g., propping up the [[MPLA]] guerrillas in [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]]—while reinvigorating its insurgent [[proxy war]] policy in the Caribbean region by the end of the decade.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

== ERP ==

In [[History of Argentina|Argentina]], the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP), led by Roberto Santucho, attempted to create a ''foco'' in the [[Tucumán Province]]. The attempt failed after the government of [[Isabel Perón]] signed in February 1975 the secret presidential decree 261, which ordered the army to neutralize and/or annihilate the ERP insurgency (which was not supported by a foreign power, and also lacked popular support). ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' gave power to the [[Argentine Armed Forces]] to &quot;execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the Province of Tucumán.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuncamas.org/document/decreto_261_75.htm Decree No. 261/75]. NuncaMas.org, ''Decretos de aniquilamiento''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

General Acdel Vilas immediately deployed over 3,000 soldiers, including conscripts from the Fifth Infantry Brigade and two companies of elite commandos. While fighting the guerrillas in the jungle, Vilas concentrated on uprooting the ERP support network in the towns, using [[state terror]] tactics, inspired by the 1961 [[Battle of Algiers]], later adopted nation-wide, as well as a civic action campaign. The ERP was quickly defeated, but this military campaign marked the beginning of the [[Dirty War]] in Argentina.

== Central America ==

After victories for a once-divided, recently-reunited [[Sandinista]] movement in [[History of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] and the [[United Front]]-style [[New Jewel Movement]] in [[History of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1979, Castro effectively supported the creation of the [[FMLN]] of [[History of El Salvador|El Salvador]] by pushing for the merge of five other communist factions between December, 1979 and October, 1980. Similarly, Cuba supported four rival guerrilla groups' decision to form the [[URNG]] coalition of [[History of Guatemala|Guatemala]] in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
