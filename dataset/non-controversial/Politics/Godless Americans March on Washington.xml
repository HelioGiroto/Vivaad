The '''Godless Americans March on Washington''' (GAMOW) occurred on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]] on November 2, 2002 with the participation of many [[atheists]], [[freethinkers]], [[agnostics]] and [[humanists]]. The public cable network, [[C-SPAN]] documented the event on video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Godless Americans Rally|year = 2002| url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/173662-1|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of the event==

The event started at 11:00 A.M. near the Washington Monument, led by the American Atheist's banner promoting the separation of church and state. About halfway down the Mall the people were confronted by counter-protesters. However, the people continued to proceed to the other end of the Mall in front of the Capitol. At 11:30 A.M., the rally started and featured over 20 speakers and musical entertainment. The rally lasted for about 4 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;worgar&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Orgar| first = Wayne| title = Godless Americans March on Washington|year = 2002| url = http://www.concentric.net/~Worgar/godless.htm|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogans==

The event was marked by many slogans and banners on shirts, badges, etc.
A few of the slogans include &quot;What Our Schools Need is a Moment of Science!&quot;, &quot;Atheism is Myth-Understood!&quot;, &quot;Secular Humanists for a Secular America.&quot;, &quot;Citizen - Atheist -Patriot.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;worgar&quot; /&gt;

The official T-shirt for the march showed a picture of the Capitol and the American Flag with the statement: &quot;Free, Proud and on the Move - GODLESS AMERICANS.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;worgar&quot; /&gt;

==Speeches==

Many speakers delivered speeches at the March. A few noted speakers were Frank Zindler, editor of the American Atheist magazine, Margaret Downey of the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia and Ed Buckner, executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism, etc.( see [[Godless_Americans_March_on_Washington#Event_speakers|Event Speakers]]  The speeches delivered were basically on [[theism]], [[atheism]] and related themes. Ed Buckner is reported to have attacked on the way theists think of the lack of morality of [[atheist]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;worgar&quot; /&gt;

==Aims and Objectives==

The event was reported as including over two thousand [[atheists]], [[freethinkers]], [[agnostics]] and [[humanists]] in a mile-long parade down [[The Mall (Washington, DC)|The Mall]] to rally for several causes, including:

* [[civil rights]]
* [[church-state separation]]
* a greater voice in the national political process

[[Ellen Johnson]], former president of [[American Atheists]] and director of the Godless Americans March On Washington Task Force announced at the event the formation of the [[Godless Americans Political Action Committee]], or GAMPAC. Later, the GAMPAC was renamed [[Enlighten the Vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Johnson| first = Ellen| title = Enlighten the Vote: About Us|year = 2004| url = http://enlightenthevote.com/about/| accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Atheist groups by and large considered the march a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Bourdonnay| first = Katherine| title = Godless Americans March a Success| year = 2003| url = http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/shb/bourdonnay_18_4.html|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = SSA Participates in Godless Americans March on Washington|year = 2002| url = http://www.secularstudents.org/node/298|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Adams| first = Clark| title = The Godless Americans March on Washingtonâ€”a Lesson in Godless Cooperation|year = 2002| url = http://www.infidels.org/kiosk/article248.html|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some within the atheist community did criticize the event for a number of reasons, including the exclusion of [[theists]] from being able to endorse the event, how [[atheism]] was defined for the purposes of the march, and the apparent attempt by organizers to use the march as a way of &quot;creating an identity for nonbelievers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Cline| first = Austin| title = Godless Americans March on Washington: What's Wrong With It?|year = 2002| url = http://atheism.about.com/library/weekly/aa102202a.htm|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization calling itself the [[Religious Freedom Coalition]] ran newspaper ads the day before the event characterizing the views of atheists and Satanists to be identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Religious Freedom Coalition| title = Week Ending November 1, 2002: RELIGIOUS FREEDOM COALITION RESPONDS TO &quot;GODLESS MARCH&quot;| year = 2002| url = http://www.rfcnet.org/news/default.asp?action=detail&amp;article=60| accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the event, the same organization called the event a success, but described it as &quot;ill timed&quot; and an indication of a dangerous brand of new atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Religious Freedom Coalition| title = Week Ending November 8, 2002: &quot;GODLESS MARCH ON WASHINGTON&quot;|year = 2002 | url = http://www.rfcnet.org/news/default.asp?action=detail&amp;article=63| accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the march, leaders of three atheist organizations - [[Atheist Alliance International]], the [[Institute for Humanist Studies]], and the [[Internet Infidels]] - met and set in motion the founding of the Secular Coalition for America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History: Secular Coalition of America| url = http://secular.org/history|accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemant Mehta of the blog  the [[Friendly Atheist]] and author of ''[[I Sold My Soul on eBay]]'' referenced the event in the context of the [[Reason Rally]] which was held on Saturday, March 24th, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Mehta| first = Hemant| title = Video of the 2002 Godless Americans March on Washington|year = 2012| url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/03/17/video-of-the-2002-godless-americans-march-on-washington/| accessdate = 18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
