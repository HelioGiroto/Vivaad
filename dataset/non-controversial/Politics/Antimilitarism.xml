[[File:It Shoots Further Than He Dreams.jpg|alt=|thumb|''It Shoots Further Than He Dreams'' antimilitarist cartoon by [[John F. Knott]]. First published in March 1918.]]
'''Antimilitarism''' is a doctrine commonly found in the [[anarchist]] and, more globally, in the [[socialist]] movement, which may both be characterized as [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] movements. It relies heavily on a [[critical theory]] of [[nationalism]] and [[imperialism]], and was an explicit goal of the [[First International|First]] and [[Second International]]. Whereas [[pacifism]] is opposition to [[violence]] in general, antimilitarism is opposed to [[war]] between [[State (polity)|states]] in particular and, of course, [[militarism]]. Historian Paul B. Miller defines anti-militarism as 
''&quot;ideology and activities...aimed at reducing the civil power of the military and ultimately, preventing international war&quot;''.
&lt;ref&gt;''From Revolutionaries to Citizens : Antimilitarism in France, 1870-1914'' by Paul B. Miller.
Duke University Press, 2002, ISBN 0-8223-2757-0 (p.8). &lt;/ref&gt;

While antimilitarism is an ideology typically associated with the left, it is also found among [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and libertarian elements, most notably in the United States{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

== Distinction between antimilitarism and pacifism ==

Pacifism has been historically associated with faith in [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] [[idea]]s, such as &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Humanity&quot;, which [[Stirner]], for example, criticized in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), a milestone of [[individualist anarchism]]. Pacifism is thus opposed to [[Atheism|atheistic]] antimilitarism, which is based on a critical analysis of the [[militarism|military state]] institution, the [[military-industrial complex]] and, in a broader sense, [[patriotism]] and the [[nationalist]] concept of [[nation-state]]s' [[sovereignty]]. Thus, [[Gandhi]] justified [[non-violence]] by an ideal of [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] with the idea that non-violence makes one morally stronger, while the early [[Martin Luther King]] based his [[civil disobedience]] techniques on his Christian faith (later his criticism of the [[Vietnam War]] was quite secular). On the contrary, antimilitarism was commonly found alongside [[anti-clericalism]], since the Church and the Army both represented repressive institutions (or [[Ideological State Apparatus]]es - ISA - as [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] called them).{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Antimilitarism, as a specific doctrine distinguished from pacifism, is not opposed to violence in general, but mainly to the state's control of [[police]] forces and the military institution. Antimilitarism is thus often a [[logical consequence]] of [[anti-statism]], and vice-versa. Finally, antimilitarism should not be confused either with the [[Clausewitz]]ian doctrine of [[civilian control of the military]], which considers that &quot;war is the continuation of politics by other means&quot; and that tactics and strategy must thus be controlled by [[diplomacy]] and political objectives. Although Clausewitz opposed [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]]'s advocacy of the autonomy of the military institution, which became a reality with [[Prussian militarism]] and the [[Schlieffen Plan]], the latter limiting the political choices available until war finally became the only solution available (and thus exploded in [[World War I]]), his doctrine of limitation of military power was clearly an effort to increase the power of the state, rather than to oppose inter-state wars&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Clausewitz's theory of the necessary control of military institutions by the civilian power versus Jomini's advocacy of the autonomy of the military institution and the separation between politics and war, and the application of Jomini's theories by the Prussian army, in particular in the Schlieffen Plan, and later by the [[RAND Corporation]], see [[Manuel de Landa]]'s ''War in the Age of the Intelligent Machines'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms on violence==
[[File:Detail of the Piano Score of Oscar Straus' The Chocolate Soldier.jpg|thumb|Cover of the Piano Score for the [[light opera]] ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'', based on [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' - both of which make fun of armies and militarist virtues and present positively a deserter who runs away  from the battlefield and who carries chocolate instead of ammunition.]] 
Following [[Hegel]]'s exploration of the relationship between [[history]] and violence, antimilitarists argue that there are different types of violence, some of which can be said to be legitimate and others non-legitimate. [[Anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]] advocated the use of violence as a form of [[direct action]], calling it &quot;revolutionary violence&quot;, which he opposed in ''Reflections on Violence'' (1908) to the violence inherent in [[class struggle]]. Sorel thus followed the International Workers' Association (IWA, aka the First International) theorization of [[propaganda of the deed]].

Later, [[Walter Benjamin]], in his ''Critique of Violence'' (1920) would also establish a difference between &quot;violence that founds the law&quot;, &quot;violence that conserves the law&quot;, and an additional last type, &quot;divine violence&quot; which breaks the &quot;magic circle&quot; between both types of &quot;state violence&quot;. The &quot;violence that conserves the law&quot; was roughly equivalent to the state's monopoly of legitimate violence, while the &quot;violence that founds the law&quot; was the original violence necessary to the creation of a state. The last type of violence, Benjamin also called it &quot;revolutionary violence&quot;, and it was totally separated from the juridical sphere.&lt;ref&gt;  Walter Benjamin, ''ZÃ¼r Kritik der Gewalt'' (1920) in ''Gesammelte Schriften'', vol. II, 1 (1977) (&quot;Criticisms on Violence&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Agamben]] showed that the theoretical link between the law and violence permitted Nazi thinker [[Carl Schmitt]] to justify the &quot;[[state of exception]]&quot; as the characteristic of [[sovereignty]]. Thus, indefinite suspension of the law, which is the way to include-exclude violence in the juridical sphere (this simultaneous inclusion and exclusion is characteristic of the structure of &quot;ex-ception&quot;), may only be blocked by breaking this link between violence and right. This explains why Agamben refers to Benjamin, whose theorization of a &quot;divine violence&quot; broke the theoretical structure of the state of exception, which is at the basis of the state's sovereignty{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

War, as violence, can be distinguished into inter-states' war and [[civil war]], in which case class struggle is, according to antimilitarists theorists, a primordial component. Hence, [[Marx]]'s influence on antimilitarist doctrine will come as no surprise, even though it would be doubtful to make Marx accountable for the whole antimilitarist tradition. However, it would also be unwise to believe in the myth of an eternal antimilitarist spirit, present in all places and time, since modern military institution is a historic achievement, related to the formation, in the 18th and 19th centuries, of nation-states. [[Napoleon]]'s invention of [[conscription]] is a fundamental progress in the organization of state armies. Later, [[German Empire|Prussian militarism]] would be revealed by a huge majority of 19th century social theorists{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

Militarism has always been intimately linked to [[propaganda]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. [[Machiavelli]] already considered popular armies to be superior to [[mercenary|mercenaries]], and Althusser demonstrated how he had thought the unification of Italy and therefore the creation of an Italian nation-state (aim which would only be attained in the 1860s) through the implementation of popular armies, leading to the creation of an ''[[esprit de corps]]'' which would form the basis for the future nation. [[Rousseau]] also thought the creation of the military institution as a form of education for the people. Finally, [[Michel Foucault]] would show in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' how the Army had invented the concept of &quot;disciplines&quot; to compose bodies together, thus paving the way for [[disciplinary institutions]] (barracks, prisons, hospitals, schools, etc.) and, ultimately, a &quot;disciplinary society&quot;.

== Henry David Thoreau's Anti-Military Views ==

[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s 1849 essay &quot; [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]&quot; ([[wikisource:Civil Disobedience|see text]]), originally titled &quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot;, can be considered an antimilitarist point of view. His refusal to pay taxes was justified as an act of protest against [[slavery]] and against the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846-48). 

==Capitalism and the military-industrial complex==

Antimilitarism has always been based on a political and social analysis of the state and the concept of sovereignty. Indeed, [[capitalism]] has often been thought by antimilitarist literature to be a major cause of wars, an influence which has been theorized by [[Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxembourg]] under the name of &quot;[[imperialism]]&quot;. The [[military-industrial complex]] has also been accused of &quot;pushing for war&quot; in pursuit of private economic or financial interests.

The [[Second International]] was therefore opposed to the participation of the working classes in war, which was analyzed as a competition between different national [[bourgeois]] classes and different state imperialisms. However, after the assassination of French [[Section FranÃ§aise de l'Internationale OuvriÃ¨re|socialist]] leader [[Jean JaurÃ¨s]] days before the proclamation of [[World War I]], nothing more was able to stop the masses from participating in the coming war. The [[proletariat]] thus remained divided into different nation-states. In ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] or the War Judged'' (1921), [[Ãmile Chartier|Alain]] would criticize the destruction brought about by militarism, and demonstrated that it wasn't [[patriotism]] that forced the soldiers to fight, but the [[bayonet]]s behind them.

After [[World War II]], US President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s 1961 warning on the influence of the &quot;[[military-industrial complex]]&quot; came as no surprise to many antimilitarist-minded people. However, it did underline the relationship between industrial power, economics, politics, etc. (in other words, &quot;capitalism&quot;), and the making of wars. See [[RAND Corporation]].

== Right-Wing antimilitarism in the United States ==

American right-wing antimilitarists draw heavily upon the statements of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] condemning standing armies and foreign entanglements. They tend to see militarism as in neither the best interests nor the real traditions of their country, giving them an ideological continuity with isolationism. They also note that the [[United States Constitution]] allows the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to raise and support armies &quot;but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years,&quot; making the [[United States Army]] possibly unconstitutional.

Right-wing antimilitarists in the [[United States]] generally believe that &quot;A well regulated [[militia]], composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country,&quot; as stated by [[James Madison]]. To this end, there is much overlap between the [[Militia movement]] and right-wing antimilitarists, although the two groups are not mutually inclusive. The term &quot;well regulated&quot; in the above quote (and in the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]) is taken by such antimilitarists not to mean &quot;regulated by the state&quot; but rather &quot;well equipped&quot; and &quot;in good working order,&quot; as was a common usage of the word &quot;regulated&quot; in the late 18th century.

== Antimilitarist groups ==

Also see: [[list of anti-war organizations]], [[peace movement]], etc..

Until its dissolution, the Second International, like the First, was antimilitarist. JaurÃ¨s' assassination on July 31, 1914, marks antimilitarism's failure in the socialist movement.
The [[American Union Against Militarism]] is an example of a US antimilitarist movement born in the midst of the first World War, from which the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) formed from after the war. Some [[Refusenik (Israel)|''Refuseniks'']] in Israel, who refuse the draft, and draft resisters in the USA [http://www.resisters.info] may be antimilitarist or pacifists, depending on the particular reasons for their opposition to conscription. Many pacifist organizations, such as the War Resisters International and the War Resisters League in the USA, are also antimilitarist.
