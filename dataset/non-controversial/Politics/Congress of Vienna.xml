[[File:CongressVienna.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Period oil painting of the delegates to the Congress of Vienna.|''The Congress of Vienna'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]], (1819).  Although representatives from all the states which had participated in the wars were invited, the principal negotiations were conducted by the &quot;Big Four&quot; (Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria) and, later on, royalist France.]]

The '''Congress of Vienna''' (''German: Wiener Kongress'')  was a conference of ambassadors of European [[State (polity)|states]] chaired by Austrian statesman [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]], and held in [[Vienna]] from November 1814 to June 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bloy | first = Marjie | title = The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815 | publisher=The Victorian Web | date = 30 April 2002 | url = http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html | accessdate = 2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective of the Congress was to settle the many issues arising from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. 

This objective resulted in the redrawing of the continent's political map, establishing the boundaries of [[France]], the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], the [[Netherlands]], the states of the [[Rhine]], the German province of [[Saxony]], and various [[Italy|Italian territories]], and the creation of [[spheres of influence]] through which [[Austria]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], France and [[Russia]] brokered local and regional problems.  The Congress of Vienna was the first of a series of international meetings that came to be known as the [[Concert of Europe]], which was an attempt to forge a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe, and served as a model for later organizations such as the [[League of Nations]] and [[United Nations]].

[[File:Berlin .Gendarmenmarkt .Deutscher Dom 010.jpg|thumb|250px|Frontispiece of the Acts of the Congress of Vienna.]]
The immediate background was [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France's]] defeat and [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|surrender in May 1814]], which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the [[Hundred Days]] of March–July, 1815. The Congress's &quot;Final Act&quot; was signed nine days before his final defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815.

In a technical sense, the &quot;Congress of Vienna&quot; was not properly a Congress: it never met in [[plenary session]], and most of the discussions occurred in informal, face-to-face, sessions among the [[Great power|Great Powers]] of Austria, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and sometimes [[Prussia]], with limited or no participation by other delegates. On the other hand, the Congress was the first occasion in history where, on a continental scale, national representatives came together to formulate treaties, instead of relying mostly on messengers and messages between the several capitals. The Congress of Vienna settlement, despite later changes, formed the framework for European international politics until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914.

==Preliminaries==
Partial settlements had already occurred at the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] between France and the [[Sixth Coalition]], and the [[Treaty of Kiel]] which covered issues raised regarding [[Scandinavia]]. The Treaty of Paris had determined that a &quot;general congress&quot; should be held in [[Vienna]], and that invitations would be issued to &quot;all the Powers engaged on either side in the present war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Article XXXII. See Harold Nicolson, ''The Congress of Vienna'', chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening was scheduled for July 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = King | first = David | title = Vienna 1814; how the conquerors of Napoleon made love, war, and peace at the Congress of Vienna | publisher=Crown Publishing Group | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-307-33716-0 | page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Four Great Powers and Bourbon France===
The Four Great Powers had previously formed the core of the [[Sixth Coalition]]. On the verge of Napoleon's defeat they had outlined their common position in the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (March 1814), and negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] with the [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbons]] during [[Bourbon Restoration|their restoration]]:
* [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] was represented by [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the Foreign Minister, and by his deputy, [[Baron Johann von Wessenberg-Ampringen|Baron Johann von Wessenberg]].  Given the Congress's sessions were in Vienna, Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]] was kept closely informed.
* The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] was represented first by its [[Foreign Secretary]], [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]]; then by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], after Castlereagh's return to England in February 1815; and in the last weeks, by the [[Richard Le Poer Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty|Earl of Clancarty]], after Wellington left to face Napoleon during the [[Hundred Days]].
* Although [[Russian Empire|Russia]]'s official delegation was led by the foreign minister, Count [[Karl Robert Nesselrode]], [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was also in Vienna and regarded himself – in fact as well as in name – its own sole [[plenipotentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicolson | first = Harold | title = The Congress of Vienna; a Study in Allied Unity, 1812–1822 | publisher=Constable &amp; co. ltd. | year = 1946 | page = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was represented by Prince [[Karl August von Hardenberg]], the Chancellor, and the diplomat and scholar [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].  King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] was also in Vienna, playing his role behind the scenes.
* [[Bourbon Restoration|France]], the &quot;fifth&quot; power, was represented by her foreign minister, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] as well as the Minister Plenipotentiary the Duke of Dalberg. Talleyrand had already negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] for [[Louis XVIII of France]]; the king, however, distrusted him and was also secretly negotiating with Metternich, by  mail.&lt;ref name=Malettke66&gt;{{cite book|last=Malettke|first=Klaus|title=Die Bourbonen 3.

** [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] – [[Maximilian von Montgelas|Maximilian Graf von Montgelas]]
** [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] – [[Georg Ernst Levin von Wintzingerode|Georg Ernst Levin Graf von Wintzingerode]]
** [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]], then in a personal union with the British crown – [[Georg zu Münster|Georg Graf zu Münster]]. (King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] had refused to recognize the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806 and maintained a separate diplomatic staff as [[Elector of Hanover]] to conduct the affairs of the family estate, the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], until the results of the Congress were concluded establishing the [[Kingdom of Hanover]].)
** [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] – [[Leopold von Plessen]]&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Apian-Bennewitz: ''Leopold von Plessen und die Verfassungspolitik der deutschen Kleinstaaten auf dem Wiener Kongress 1814/15.'' Eutin: Ivens 1933; Hochschulschrift: Rostock, Univ., Diss., 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually every state in Europe had a delegation in Vienna – more than 200 states and princely houses were represented at the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Page 2 of King (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, there were representatives of cities, corporations, religious organizations (for instance, abbeys) and special interest groups e.g. a delegation representing German publishers, demanding a copyright law and freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zamoyski | first = Adam | title = Rites of Peace; the Fall of Napoleon and the Congress of Vienna | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers | year = 2007 | pages = 258, 295 | isbn = 978-0-06-077518-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress  was noted for its lavish entertainment: according to a famous joke it did not move, but danced.

==Course of the Congress==
[[File:Talleyrand 02.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=oil painting of Tallyrand, the French ambassador| [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] proved an able negotiator for the defeated French]]

Initially, the representatives of the four victorious powers hoped to exclude the French from serious participation in the negotiations, but Talleyrand managed to skillfully insert himself into &quot;her inner councils&quot; in the first weeks of negotiations. He allied himself to a Committee of Eight lesser powers (including Spain, Sweden, and Portugal) to control the negotiations. Once Talleyrand was able to use this committee to make himself a part of the inner negotiations, he then left it,&lt;ref&gt;William, Sir Ward Adolphus (2009).  [http://books.google.com/books?id=cTxvfSPXz7sC&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=Talleyrand+left+Committee+of+Eight&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=dwaaTIzfIovNjAf9upQ0&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Talleyrand%20left%20Committee%20of%20Eight&amp;f=false ''The Period of Congresses''], BiblioLife, p. 13. ISBN 1-113-44924-1&lt;/ref&gt; once again abandoning his allies.

The major Allies' indecision on how to conduct their affairs without provoking a united protest from the lesser powers led to the calling of a preliminary conference on protocol, to which Talleyrand and the [[Pedro Gómez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador|Marquis of Labrador]], [[Spain|Spain's]] representative, were invited on 30 September 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicolson&quot;&gt;Nicolson, Sir Harold (2001). [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZTC3IWC_py8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=congress+of+vienna&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=5deZTM7GGI7KjAfCpsAO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Talleyrand%2030%20september&amp;f=false ''The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812–1822''] Grove Press; Rep. Ed. pp. 140–164. ISBN 0-8021-3744-X&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress Secretary [[Friedrich von Gentz]] reported, &quot;The intervention of Talleyrand and Labrador has hopelessly upset all our plans. Talleyrand protested against the procedure we have adopted and soundly [be]rated us for two hours. It was a scene I shall never forget.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Mary Alsop|title=The Congress Dances|location=New York|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|year=1984|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The embarrassed representatives of the Allies replied that the document concerning the protocol they had arranged actually meant nothing. &quot;If it means so little, why did you sign it?&quot; snapped Labrador.

Talleyrand's policy, directed as much by national as personal ambitions, demanded the close but by no means amicable relationship he had with Labrador, whom Talleyrand regarded with disdain.&lt;ref&gt;Wenceslao Ramírez de Villa-Urrutia, Marqués de Villa-Urrutia, ''España en el Congreso de Viena según la correspondencia de D. Pedro Gómez Labrador, Marqués de Labrador''. Segunda Edición Corregida y Aumentada (Madrid: Francisco Beltrán, 1928), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Labrador later remarked of Talleyrand: &quot;that cripple, unfortunately, is going to Vienna.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rodríguez-Moñino (ed.), ''Cartas Políticas'' (Badajoz: Imprenta Provincial, 1959), 14 (Letter IV, 10 July 1814). Labrador’s letters are full of such pungent remarks, and include his opinions on bad diplomats, the state of the postal system, the weather, and his non-existent salary and coach and accompanying livery for the Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Talleyrand skirted additional articles suggested by Labrador: he had no intention of handing over the 12,000 ''afrancesados'' – Spanish fugitives, sympathetic to France, who had sworn fealty to [[Joseph Bonaparte]] (with whom he had unscrupulous business connections) – nor the bulk of the documents, paintings, pieces of fine art, and works of [[hydrography]] and [[natural history]] that had been looted from the archives, palaces, churches and cathedrals of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Villa-Urrutia, ''España en el Congreso de Viena'', 61-2. The French had stripped an enormous amount of art from the country. Joseph had left Madrid with an enormous baggage train containing pieces of art, tapestries, and mirrors. The most rapacious of the French was Marshal [[Nicolas Soult]], who left Spain with entire collections, which disappeared to unknown, separate locations around the world. According to Juan Antonio Gaya Nuño, at least &quot;[the paintings] have come to spread the prestige of Spanish art around the whole word.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map congress of vienna.jpg|thumb|450px|Map of Europe after the Congress of Vienna, 1815.]]
The Final Act, embodying all the separate treaties, was signed on 9 June 1815 (a few days before the [[Battle of Waterloo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] &quot;Congress of Vienna&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Its provisions included:
*Russia was given most of the Duchy of Warsaw (Poland) and was allowed to keep [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] (which it had annexed from Sweden in 1809 and held until 1917).
*Prussia was given two fifths of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], parts of the Duchy of Warsaw (the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]]), [[Danzig]], and the [[Rhineland]]/[[Westphalia]].
*A [[German Confederation]] of 38 states was created from the previous 360 of the Holy Roman Empire, under the presidency of the Austrian Emperor. Only portions of the territory of Austria and Prussia were included in the Confederation.
*The Netherlands and the [[Southern Netherlands]] (approx. modern-day Belgium) were united in a constitutional monarchy, the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], with the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] providing the king (the [[Eight Articles of London]]).
*To compensate for the Orange-Nassau's loss of the Nassau lands to Prussia, the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] were to form a [[personal union]] under the House of Orange-Nassau, with Luxembourg (but not the Netherlands) inside the [[German Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Couvée | first =D.H. | coauthors =G. Pikkemaat | title =1813–15, ons koninkrijk geboren | publisher=N. Samsom nv | year =1963 | location =Alphen aan den Rijn | pages =127–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Swedish Pomerania]], given to Denmark a year earlier in return for [[Norway]], was ceded by Denmark to Prussia. [[France]] received back [[Guadeloupe]] from Sweden in return for yearly installments to the Swedish king.
*The neutrality of [[Switzerland]] was guaranteed.
*[[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] gave up the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] to Denmark, but was enlarged by the addition of former territories of the [[Bishop of Münster]] and by the formerly Prussian [[East Frisia]], and made a kingdom.
*Most of the territorial gains of [[Bavaria]], [[Württemberg]], [[Baden]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]], and [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] under the [[mediatization]]s of 1801–1806 were recognized. Bavaria also gained control of the [[Rhenish Palatinate]] and parts of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Würzburg]] and [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt]]. Hesse-Darmstadt, in exchange for giving up the Duchy of Westphalia to Prussia, received [[Rhenish Hesse]] with its capital at [[Mainz]].
*Austria regained control of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg]]; of the former [[Illyrian Provinces]]; of [[Tarnopol]] district (from Russia); received [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] in Italy and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] in [[Dalmatia]]. Former Austrian territory in Southwest Germany remained under the control of Württemberg and Baden, and the [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] were also not recovered.
*Habsburg princes were returned to control of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and the [[Duchy of Modena]].
*The [[Papal States]] were under the rule of the pope and restored to their former extent, with the exception of [[Avignon]] and the [[Comtat Venaissin]], which remained part of France.
*The United Kingdom was confirmed in control of the [[Cape Colony]] in Southern Africa; [[Tobago]]; [[Ceylon]]; and various other colonies in Africa and Asia. Other colonies, most notably the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[Martinique]], were restored to their previous owners.
*The King of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] was restored in [[Piedmont]], Nice, and [[Savoy]], and was given control of [[Genoa]] (putting an end to the brief proclamation of a restored [[Republic of Genoa|Republic]]).
*The [[Duchy of Parma|Duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla]] were given to [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]], Napoleon's wife.
*The Duchy of Lucca was created for the [[House of Bourbon-Parma]], which would have reversionary rights to Parma after the death of [[Marie Louise]].
*The Bourbon [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]], King of Sicily was restored to control of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] after [[Joachim Murat]], the king installed by Bonaparte, supported Napoleon in the [[Hundred Days]] and started the [[Neapolitan War]] by attacking Austria.
*The [[slave trade]] was condemned.
*Freedom of navigation was guaranteed for many rivers, notably [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine|the Rhine]] and the Danube.

===Polish-Saxon crisis===&lt;!-- the redirect Polish-Saxon crisis redirects to this section heading--&gt;
The most controversial subject at the Congress was the so-called Polish-Saxon Crisis. The Russians and Prussians proposed a deal in which much of the Prussian and Austrian shares of the partitions of Poland would go to Russia, which would create a Polish Kingdom in personal union with Russia and Alexander as king. In compensation, the Prussians would receive all of [[Saxony]], whose King was considered to have forfeited his throne as he had not abandoned Napoleon soon enough. The Austrians, French, and British did not approve of this plan, and, at the inspiration of Talleyrand, signed a secret treaty on 3 January 1815, agreeing to go to war, if necessary, to prevent the Russo-Prussian plan from coming to fruition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicolson&quot;/&gt;

Though none of the three powers was ready for war, the Russians did not call the bluff, and an amicable settlement was set on 24 October 1815, by which Russia received most of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw as a &quot;Kingdom of Poland&quot; – called [[Congress Poland]] – but did not receive the district of [[Poznań]], [[Grand Duchy of Poznań]], which was given to Prussia, nor [[Kraków]], which became a [[Free City of Kraków|free city]]. Prussia received 40% of Saxony – later known as the [[Province of Saxony]], with the remainder returned to King [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] – [[Kingdom of Saxony]].

[[File:Alkruger.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=The Tsar mounted on his horse|[[Alexander I of Russia]] (1812) considered himself a guarantor of European security. ]]The Congress's principal results, apart from its confirmation of France's loss of the territories annexed between 1795–1810, which had already been settled by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], were the enlargement of Russia, (which gained most of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]) and [[Prussia]], which acquired [[Westphalia]] and the northern Rhineland. The consolidation of Germany from the nearly 300 states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (dissolved in 1806) into a much more manageable thirty-nine states (4 of which were free cities) was confirmed. These states were formed into a loose [[German Confederation]] under the leadership of [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]].

Representatives at the Congress agreed to numerous other territorial changes. By the [[Treaty of Kiel]], Norway had been ceded by the king of [[Denmark-Norway]] to the king of [[Sweden]]. This sparked the nationalist movement which led to the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Norway (1814)|Kingdom of Norway]] on [[Norway in 1814|May 17, 1814]] and the subsequent personal [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Union]] with [[Sweden]].  Austria gained [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] in Northern Italy, while much of the rest of North-Central Italy went to Habsburg dynasties (the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the [[Duchy of Modena]], and the [[Duchy of Parma]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stearns-Langer&quot;&gt;Stearns, Peter N. – Langer, William Leonard (2001).

ISBN 0-395-65237-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Papal States]] were restored to the Pope. The Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored to its mainland possessions, and also gained control of the Republic of [[Genoa]]. In Southern Italy, Napoleon's brother-in-law, [[Joachim Murat]], was originally allowed to retain his [[Kingdom of Naples]], but  his support of Napoleon in the [[Hundred Days]] led to the restoration of the Bourbon [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|Ferdinand IV]] to the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stearns-Langer&quot;&gt;Stearns, Peter N. – Langer, William Leonard (2001).

ISBN 0-395-65237-5&lt;/ref&gt;

A large [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was created for the [[Prince of Orange]], including both the old [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the formerly Austrian-ruled territories in the Southern Netherlands. There were other, less important territorial adjustments, including significant territorial gains for the German Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (which gained [[East Frisia]] from Prussia and various other territories in Northwest Germany) and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] (which gained the [[Rhenish Palatinate]] and territories in [[Franconia]]). The [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] was transferred from Hanover to Denmark, and [[Swedish Pomerania]] was annexed by Prussia. [[Switzerland]] was enlarged, and Swiss neutrality was established.
Swiss mercenaries had played a significant role in European Wars for a couple of hundred years,
and the intention was to put a stop to these activities permanently.

During the wars, [[Portugal]] had lost its town of [[Olivenza|Olivença]] to Spain and moved to have it restored. Portugal is historically the oldest ally of the United Kingdom, and with its support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of [[Olivenza|Olivença]] decreed in Article 105 of the Final Act, which stated that the Congress &quot;understood the occupation of [[Olivenza|Olivença]] to be illegal and recognized Portugal's rights&quot;. Portugal ratified the Final Act in 1815 but Spain would not sign and this became the most important hold-out against the Congress of Vienna. Deciding in the end that it was better to become part of Europe than stand alone, Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, [[Olivenza|Olivença]] and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this question remains unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Richard James (1966).

ISBN 0-8047-0296-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] received parts of the [[West Indies]] at the expense of the Netherlands and Spain and kept the former Dutch colonies of [[Ceylon]] and the [[Cape Colony]] as well as [[Malta]] and [[Heligoland]]. Under the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], Britain obtained the protectorate over the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]] and the [[Seychelles]].

==Later criticism==
The Congress of Vienna was frequently criticized by nineteenth-century and more recent historians for ignoring national and liberal impulses, and for imposing a stifling [[reactionary|reaction]] on the Continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olson-Shadle&quot;&gt;Olson, James Stuart – Shadle, Robert (1991). [http://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=congress+of+vienna+criticised+by+historians&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=U-qZTLzpCJG7jAf5joHwDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Historical dictionary of European imperialism''], Greenwood Press, p. 149. ISBN 0-313-26257-8&lt;/ref&gt; It was an integral part in what became known as the [[Conservative Order]], in which the liberties and civil rights associated with the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s were de-emphasized, so that a fair balance of power, peace and stability, might be achieved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olson-Shadle&quot;/&gt;

In the 20th century, however, many historians have come to admire the statesmen at the Congress, whose work prevented another widespread European war for nearly a hundred years (1815–1914). Among these is [[Henry Kissinger]], who in 1954 wrote his doctoral dissertation, ''[[A World Restored]]'', on it. Prior to the opening of the Paris peace conference of 1918, the British Foreign Office commissioned a history of the Congress of Vienna to serve as an example to its own delegates of how to achieve an equally successful peace.&lt;ref&gt;Ragsdale, Hugh – Ponomarev, V. N. (1993). [http://books.google.com/books?id=bwvllKkPQtYC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;dq=Paris+peace+1918+British+Foreign+Office+history+of+the+Congress+of+Vienna&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=qfiZTLLMIY2OjAez3vgU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Paris%20peace%201918%20British%20Foreign%20Office%20history%20of%20the%20Congress%20of%20Vienna&amp;f=false ''Imperial Russian foreign policy''], [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1st ed. ISBN 0-521-44229-X&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the main decisions of the Congress were made by the Four Great Powers and not all the countries of Europe could extend their rights at the Congress. The Italian peninsula became a mere &quot;geographical expression&quot; as divided into seven parts: [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]], [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]], [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies|Naples-Sicily]], [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and the [[Papal States]] under the control of different powers.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Bertram (2008).

The arrangements made by the Four Great Powers sought to ensure future disputes would be settled in a manner that would avoid the terrible wars of the previous twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Willner, Mark – Hero, George – Weiner, Jerry Global (2006).

ISBN 0-7641-5811-2&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the Congress of Vienna preserved the balance of power in Europe, it could not check the spread of revolutionary movements across the continent [[Revolutions of 1848|some 30 years later]].
