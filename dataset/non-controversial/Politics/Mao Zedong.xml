'''Mao Zedong''' (also [[Wade–Giles|transliterated]] as '''Mao Tse-tung''' {{audio|Zh-Mao_Zedong.ogg|listen}}), commonly referred to as '''Chairman Mao''' (December 26, 1893{{spaced ndash}}September 9, 1976), was a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[Communism|communist]] revolutionary, political theorist and politician. The architect and [[founding father]] of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its establishment in 1949, he governed the country as Chairman of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] until his death in 1976. Politically a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]], his theoretical contribution to the ideology along with his military strategies and brand of policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/363395/Mao-Zedong Mao Zedong article] at ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Born the son of a wealthy farmer in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]], Mao adopted a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. Coming to adopt Marxism, he became an early member of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), soon rising to a senior position. In 1922, the Communists agreed to an alliance with the larger [[Kuomintang]], a nationalist revolutionary party, and Mao joined up to the latter, helping them to organize a revolutionary peasant army. In 1927, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the Kuomintang's military leader, set about on an anti-communist purge. Mao rose to power of the Communist Party by commanding the [[Long March]], forming a [[Second United Front|united front]] with the Kuomintang during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] to repel an [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] invasion, and leading the CPC to victory against [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Kuomintang (KMT) in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. After solidifying [[Chinese reunification|the reunification]] of China through his [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao enacted sweeping [[land reform]], by using violence and terror to overthrow the [[feudalism|feudal]] landlords before seizing their large estates and dividing the land into [[people's commune]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;MaoDoc&quot;&gt;[[Biography (TV series)]]—[http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi3081083673/ ''Mao Tse Tung: China's Peasant Emperor''], [[A&amp;E Network]], 2005, ASIN B000AABKXG&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationwide political campaigns led by Mao, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], are often considered catastrophic failures; and his rule is believed to have caused the deaths of 40 to 70 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathtoll&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Short |first=Philip |title=Mao: A Life |publisher=Owl Books |year=2001 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=4y6mACbLWGsC&amp;pg=PA631&amp;dq=mao+a+life+all+the+dead+of+the+second+world+war |isbn=0-8050-6638-1 |page=631}}; [[Jung Chang|Chang, Jung]] and [[Jon Halliday|Halliday, Jon]].

However, during the years when Mao was China's &quot;Great Helmsman&quot;, a range of positive changes also came to China. These included promoting the status of women, improving [[literacy]], doubling the school population, providing universal housing, increasing health care access, and dramatically raising life expectancy.&lt;ref name = &quot;MoboGao&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;China 2010, pp. 327&quot;&gt;''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', by Patricia Buckley Ebrey, Cambridge University Press, 2010, ISBN 0-521-12433-6, pp. 327&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, China's population almost doubled during the period of Mao's leadership&lt;ref&gt;''Atlas of World History'', by Patrick Karl O'Brien, Oxford University Press US, 2002, ISBN 0-19-521921-X, pp 254&lt;/ref&gt; (from around 550 to over 900 million).&lt;ref name=&quot;China 2010, pp. 327&quot;/&gt; As a result, Mao is still officially held in high regard by many Chinese as a great political strategist, military mastermind, and savior of the nation. [[Maoists]] further promote his role as a theorist, statesman, poet, and [[visionary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Short |first=Philip |title=Mao: A Life |publisher=Owl Books |year=2001 |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-8050-6638-1 |isbn=0-8050-6638-1 |page=630 |quote=Mao had an extraordinary mix of talents: he was visionary, statesman, political and military strategist of cunning intellect, a philosopher and poet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Anti-Revisionism|anti-revisionists]] continue to defend most of his policies.

Although Mao's stated goals of combating [[bureaucracy]], encouraging popular participation, and stressing China's [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]] are generally seen as laudable—and the rapid industrialization that began during Mao's reign is credited for laying a foundation for China's development in the late 20th century—the violent methods he used to pursue them have been widely rebuked as being ruthless and self-defeating.&lt;ref name = &quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt; Mao is still regarded as one of the most important figures in modern world history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/samplep02|title=Mao Zedong|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential]] people of the 20th century by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/time100/leaders/profile/mao.html Time 100: Mao Zedong] By Jonathan D. Spence, April 13, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1893–1911===
Mao was born on December 26, 1893 in a rural village in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan|Hunan Province]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 6&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Halliday 3&quot;&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Mao Shun-sheng (1870–1920), had been born into a poverty-stricken peasant family, and had gained two years worth of education before joining the army. Eventually returning to agriculture, he earned a living as both a moneylender and a grain merchant, buying up local grain and then selling it on in the city for a higher price, allowing him to become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan, with 20 acres of land. Mao Zedong would describe his father as a stern disciplinarian, who would often punish his son and other children – two boys, Tse-min (b.1896) and Tse-tan (b.1905), and an adopted girl – for any perceived wrongdoings, sometimes by beating them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Wen Ch'i-mei, was illiterate but a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude towards both his children and other locals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 20&quot;&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Halliday 4&quot;&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his mother's example, Mao also became a practising Buddhist from an early age, venerating a bronze statue of the [[Buddha]] which was in their home, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years. His father was largely irreligious, although after surviving an encounter with a tiger, began to give [[Chinese folk religion|offerings to the gods]] in thanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Halliday 5&quot;&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shaoshan 01.JPG|thumb|left|Mao's childhood home in Shaoshan, in 2010, by which time it had become a tourist destination.]]
Aged 8, Mao was sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School by his father, who recognised the financial value of a basic education. Here, Mao was taught the value systems of [[Confucianism]], one of the dominant moral ideologies in China, but he would later admit that he did not enjoy reading the [[Chinese classics|classical Chinese texts]] which preached Confucian morals, instead favouring popular novels such as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and ''[[Water Margin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting against his Confucian upbringing, aged 11 Mao ran away from home, heading for what he believed was a nearby town, but eventually his father found him and brought him home.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 15&quot;/&gt;

Aged 13, Mao finished primary education, and his father [[Arranged marriage|had him married]] to [[Luo Yixiu]] (1889–1910), a woman four years his senior, in order to unite their two land-owning families. They never lived together and Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic of arranged marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 10&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 18&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002. p. 23&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. pp. 3, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He began work on his father's farm, but continued to read voraciously in his spare time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 15&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 10&quot;/&gt; One of the most influential texts that he read was Cheng Kuan-ying's ''Sheng-shih Wei-yen'' (''Words of Warning to an Affluent Age''), a political tract that lamented the deterioration of Chinese power in East Asia, arguing for technological, economic and political reform, modelling China on the [[representative democracy|representative democracies]] of the western world. Mao would later claim that he first developed a &quot;political consciousness&quot; from that booklet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential book which he read at the time was a translation of ''Great Heroes of the World'', becoming inspired by the American revolutionary [[George Washington]] and French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], whose military prowess and nationalistic fervour greatly impressed him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His political views of the time were also shaped by popular protests that had erupted following a famine in [[Changsha]], the capital of Hunan; Mao supported the protester's demands, but the armed forces soon suppressed the dissenters and executed their leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 22&quot;&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The famine soon spread throughout Hunan, reaching Shaoshan; here, starving peasants seized some of his father's grain, and while Mao disapproved of their actions as morally wrong, he also claimed a great deal of sympathy for their situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 16, Mao moved on to study at a higher primary school in nearby Tungshan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 22&quot;/&gt; Here, he was taught alongside students of a higher social standing, and was often bullied for his scruffy appearance and peasant background; being much older than the other pupils, he failed to fit in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram 1966. p. 26&quot;&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 19&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Xinhai Revolution: 1911–1912===
In 1911, Mao convinced his father to allow him to attend middle school in the city of Changsha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram 1966. p. 26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the city was &quot;a revolutionary hotbed&quot;, with widespread animosity towards the governing Emperor [[Puyi]] (1906–1967) and the concept of [[absolute monarchy]] itself. While some advocated a reformist transition to a [[constitutional monarchy]], most revolutionaries advocated [[republicanism]], hoping to overthrow the Emperor and replace him with a democratically elected president. The primary figurehead behind this republican movement was [[Sun Yat-Sen|Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]] (1867–1925), the leader of a secret society known as the ''[[Tongmenghui]]'' who had spent time in the United States and converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; At Changsha, Mao first read a copy of Sun's newspaper, ''The People's Strength'' (''Min-lin-pao''), and was greatly influenced by it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 27&quot;&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Sun's example, Mao penned his first political essay, which he stuck to the school wall; later admitting that it was &quot;somewhat muddled&quot;, it involved a plan for overthrowing the monarchy and replacing it with a republic governed by the presidency of Sun, but with concessions made to the moderates by having [[Kang Youwei]] as premier and [[Liang Qichao]] as minister of foreign affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 19-20&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Halliday 10&quot;&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a symbol of rebellion against the [[Manchu]] monarch, he and a friend cut off their [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] pigtails – a sign of subservience to the emperor – before forcibly cutting off those of some of their classmates too.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 19-20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Halliday 10&quot;/&gt;

Later that year, the Chinese armed forces, inspired by the republican ideas of Sun, rose up in insurrection against the Emperor across southern China, sparking the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. The city of Changsha initially remained under the control of the monarch, with the governor proclaiming [[martial law]] on its streets to quell any popular protests. Soon however, the infantry brigade guarding the city proclaimed their support for the revolution, and the governor was forced to flee, leaving the city in republican hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 20&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eager to support the revolutionary cause, Mao joined the rebel army as a [[private soldier]], but was not involved in the fighting. The northern provinces had remained loyal to the Emperor, and hoping to avoid a civil war, Sun Yat-Sen – already proclaimed &quot;provisional president&quot; by his supporters – had come to a compromise with the Emperor's key ally [[Yuan Shikai]] (1859–1916); the monarchy would be abolished, and [[Late Imperial China]] would be converted into a new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], but it would be the royalist Yuan and not the revolutionary Sun who would become its first President. The Xinhai Revolution over, Mao resigned from the army in 1912, after six months of being a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Halliday 11&quot;&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been during this period that Mao had first learned of the imported western concept of socialism from a newspaper article, and intrigued, he read several pamphlets by [[Jiang Kanghu]] (1883–1954), a student who had founded the Chinese Socialist Party in November 1911. Nevertheless, while remaining convinced of the need of a republican government, he was not yet convinced by the need for a socialist economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Normal School of Changsha: 1912–1917===
{{double image|right|Sunyatsen1.jpg|152|Chen.jpg|150|In early life, Mao was influenced by the publications of two revolutionaries, Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] (left) and Dr. [[Chen Duxiu]] (right), both of whom argued that China had to adopt various western political philosophies in order to modernise.}}
Returning his attention to education, Mao enrolled and dropped out of a series of schools in quick succession; a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school and an economics school, the latter being the only course which his father approved of. However, the lectures were given in the English language, which Mao could not understand, and so he soon abandoned this and began attendance at the government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon dropped out of this too, finding its courses too rooted in old Confucian ideas and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang Halliday 11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding to undertake his studies independently, he spent much time in the newly opened public library at Changsha, reading the core works of [[classical liberalism]] such as [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers like [[Charles Darwin]], [[J.S. Mill]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 21&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing no use in his son's purely intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance, forcing Mao to move into a [[hostel]] for the destitute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deciding that he would like to become a professional teacher, Mao enrolled at a teacher training college, the Fourth Normal School of Changsha, which had high standards yet low fees and cheap accommodation. Several months later, it amalgamated with the prestigious First Normal School of Changsha, widely seen as the best school in Hunan province; Mao biographer [[Stuart Schram]] would later note that the environment of the school provided &quot;an ideal training ground for his apprenticeship as a political worker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He was heavily influenced by several teachers at the school, including the professor of ethics, Yang Changji, who urged Mao and his other students to read a radical newspaper, ''[[La Jeunesse|New Youth]]'' (''Hsien Ch'ing-nien''), which was the creation of his friend [[Chen Duxiu]] (1879–1942), Dean of the Faculty of Letters at [[Peking University]]. Although a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]], Chen argued that in order to progress, China must look to the west, adopting &quot;Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science&quot; in order to cleanse itself of superstition and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao would publish his first article, &quot;A Study of Physical Culture&quot;, in ''New Youth'' in April 1917, in which he instructed all Chinese people to increase their physical strength in order to serve the revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 22&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined another revolutionary organisation, The Society for the Study of Wang Fuzhi (''Chuan-shan Hsüeh-she'') which had been founded by a number of Changsha literati who wished to emulate [[Wang Fuzhi]] (1619–1692), a philosopher who had become a symbol of Han resistance to Manchu invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first year at the school, Mao befriended an older student, Siao Yu, and together they went on a walking holiday through the countryside, along the way begging in order to obtain food.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao also remained active in school politics, in 1915 becoming elected to the position of secretary of the Students Society. He used his position to forge an Association for Student Self-Government, leading protests against various rules then implemented in the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1917, he was also elected to command the students' volunteer army, set up to defend the school from potential attack after two warlords began fighting one another in Hunan.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; With two close friends, Mao began undertaking feats of physical endurance – such as sleeping outdoors and living on a frugal diet – and they began describing themselves as the &quot;Three Heroes&quot; after the rebels that featured in Chinese literature. They attracted other young people with radical political ideas around them, forming a society known as the New People's Study Society who debated Chen Duxiu's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Having passed his exams, Mao graduated from the school in the spring of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early revolutionary activity==

===Peking and Marxism: 1917–1919===
Leaving Changsha, Mao moved to the capital city of [[Peking]], where his school mentor Yang Changji had recently migrated to take up a job at Peking University.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 48&quot;&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 20&quot;/&gt; Yang was favourable towards Mao, writing in his journal that &quot;it is truly difficult to imagine someone so intelligent and handsome [as him].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Yang secured Mao employment at the university library, where he became assistant to the librarian [[Li Dazhao]] (1888–1927), an early Chinese communist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 20&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 39&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 25&quot;/&gt; Li authored a series of articles in ''New Youth'' on the subject of the [[October Revolution]] which had just occurred in Russia, during which the communist [[Bolshevik Party]] under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870–1924) had seized power. Lenin was an advocate of the socio-political theory of [[Marxism]], first developed by the German sociologists [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) in the mid-19th century, and Li's articles helped bring an understanding of Marxism to the Chinese revolutionary movement, even though he failed to fully understand it himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{double image|left|Marx old.jpg|160|Lenin CL.jpg|150|Following the success of the [[October Revolution]] in the Russian Empire, in which Marxists held a successful revolution, Mao came under the theoretical influence of [[Karl Marx]] (left) and [[Vladimir Lenin]] (right).}}

Mao would claim that although he did not accept Marxism at first, he had come under the influence of [[anarchism]] and was becoming &quot;more and more radical&quot; as the months went on. Beginning to read and discuss the work of Marx with Li and other like-minded radicals at a Marxist Study Group, he eventually &quot;developed rapidly toward Marxism&quot; under Li's tutelage during the winter of 1918–19, looking for ways to combine it with ancient Chinese philosophies that would be applicable to modern China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 41&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 26-27&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually coming to adopt an orthodox [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] position by accepting not only Marx's ideas but also those of Lenin, he came to view Chinese nationalism as a powerful tool in the [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation]] struggle against western and Japanese dominance, but unlike orthodox Marxist-Leninists also viewed nationalism as something intrinsically valuable in itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paid a low wage, Mao was forced to live in a cramped room near to the university with seven other Hunanese students, but believed that the beauty of Peking offered &quot;vivid and living compensation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 26&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his friends and future colleagues took advantage of the ''[[:fr:Mouvement Travail-Études|Mouvement Travail-Études]]'' to study in France, but Mao, perhaps because of a lack of ability to learn languages and the requirement to learn French, turned down the opportunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 25&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cha05|Chang and Halliday 2005]]. pp. 22–24, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining at the university, he tried to strike up conversations with academics working there, but most snubbed him because of his rural Hunanese accent and lowly position as librarian's assistant. Nonetheless, by joining the university's Philosophy and Journalism Societies, he was able to attend various lectures and seminars by the likes of [[Chen Duxiu]], [[Hu Shi]], and [[Qian Xuantong]], but various lecturers still treated him with contempt and refused to answer his questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 25&quot;/&gt; Mao's time in Peking came to an end in the spring of 1919, when he traveled to [[Shanghai]] with friends departing from the port for France. On the way visiting a number of historic sites such as [[Qufu]], the burial place of [[Confucius]], he traveled much of the journey on foot, at one point losing his shoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 27-28&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student rebellions: 1919–1920===
At the time, China had fallen victim to the expansionist policies of the [[Empire of Japan]], who had conquered large areas of Chinese-controlled territory, namely Taiwan, Korea and South Manchuria. The Japanese claim to these lands had been supported by the western powers of France, the U.K. and the U.S. at the [[Treaty of Versailles]], who also agreed that Japan could take control of all the territories in China that had formerly been under the dominion of the defeated German Empire. The Chinese [[Beiyang Government]], under the control of the warlord [[Duan Qirui]] (1865–1936), had accepted Japanese dominance, agreeing to their [[Twenty-One Demands]], despite popular opposition among the Chinese populace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 22-23&quot;/&gt; In May 1919, the [[May Fourth Movement]] had erupted in Peking, with Chinese patriots rallying against the Japanese occupation and Duan's collaborative government. Chinese troops were sent in to crush the protests, but the mass unrest spread throughout much of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 22-23&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 44&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Changsha, Mao took advantage of the unrest to help organize protests against the Governor of Hunan Province, [[Zhang Jinghui]], a supporter of Duan's. Mao was a founding member of the United Student Association and in July 1919 began production of a weekly radical magazine, ''Hsiang River Review'' (''Hsiang-chiang P'ing-lun''). Using vernacular language that would be understandable to the majority of China's populace, he put forward his socialist political views, calling for revolution against the government; in one notable article, he proclaimed the need for a &quot;Great Union of the Popular Masses&quot;, but failed to put forward an expressly Marxist analysis of how that revolution should proceed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 44&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:May Fourth.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Students in Beijing rallied during the May Fourth Movement.]]
Governor Zhang soon ordered the United Student Association and its associated weekly shut down, but Mao continued publishing his views after assuming editorship of the student magazine ''New Hunan'' (''Hsin Hunan''). When this in turn was also shut down by Zhang's provincial administration, he then began publishing his articles in the popular local newspaper ''Ta Kung Po''. Several of these articles advocated his staunchly [[feminism|feminist]] views, calling for the liberation of women in Chinese society; alongside his early experiences with forced arranged marriage, this was possibly influenced by the recent death of his mother and his increasing romantic involvement with [[Yang Kaihui]] (1901–1930), the daughter of Mao's recently deceased mentor Yang Changji.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002. p. 23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 29&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1919, Mao took a leading role in the re-organization of the banned United Student Association, and in December helped to organize a student strike in Changsha's schools, designed to cripple Zhang's control. The strike did secure some concessions, but Mao and other student leaders felt that they were now under threat from the furious Zhang, and were sent as representatives to China's provincial centers; thus, Mao once again traveled to Peking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 46&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Peking, Mao found that he had achieved a level of fame among the revolutionary movement for his fervent article writing, and he set about soliciting support in overthrowing Zhang's rule in Hunan. It was in the city that he also came across newly translated Marxist literature, further committing him to the revolutionary socialist cause: these included Thomas Kirkup's '' A History of Socialism'', [[Karl Kautsky]]'s ''Karl Marx's Ökonomische Lehren'' and most importantly, Marx and Engels' political pamphlet, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 47-48&quot;/&gt; From Peking, Mao moved along to Shanghai, working as a laundryman and meeting with [[Chen Duxiu]], who had been recently freed from prison; together, they discussed Marxism, which Chen was also beginning to accept. Mao later noted that Chen's adoption of Marxism  &quot;deeply impressed me at what was probably a critical period in my life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shanghai, Mao also met with one of his old teachers, Yi Peiji, a revolutionary and member of the [[Kuomintang]], or Chinese Nationalist Party, which at the time was gaining increasing support and influence across China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 47-48&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Yi Peiji introduced Mao to General [[Tan Yankai]], a senior Kuomintang member who held the loyalty of the troops stationed along the border between Hunan and [[Kwantung]]. Tan was plotting to overthrow Governor Zhang and his pro-Japanese Hunanese administration, and Mao aided him by organizing the students of Changsha. In June 1920, Tan led his troops into Changsha, while Zhang fled. In the subsequent reorganization of the provincial administration, Mao was appointed as the headmaster of the junior section of the First Normal School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 47-48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 57&quot;&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Now receiving a large income, he was able to marry Yang Kaihui in the winter of 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram. p. 57&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 30&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding the Communist Party of China: 1921–1922===

The [[Communist Party of China]] was founded by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]] in the [[French concession]] of [[Shanghai]] in 1921 as a study society and an informal network. Mao soon set up his own branch in Changsha, also establishing a branch of the Socialist Youth Corps. He furthermore opened a bookstore under the control of his new Cultural Book Society, whose purpose was to propagate revolutionary literature throughout Hunan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 50&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 31&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. pp. 23, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Helping to organise workers' strikes in the winter of 1920–1921,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao was also involved in the movement advocating autonomy for the province, a viewpoint shared by figures from a variety of different political persuasions. Mao's hope was that the creation of a Hunanese constitution would increase [[civil liberty|civil liberties]] in the province and thereby make his revolutionary activity easier; although it proved successful, in later life, he would subsequently deny any involvement in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. pp. 23–24, 28, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Location of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Xintiandi Shanghai July 1921.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Location of the first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921, in [[Xintiandi]], former [[French Concession]], Shanghai.]]

By 1921, small groups of Marxists existed in six Chinese cities: Shanghai, Peking, Changsha, Wuhan, Canton and Tsinan, with a further group having been founded by Chinese students in Paris. It was decided that they should send delegates for a central meeting, which began in Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The first session of the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China]] was attended by 13 delegates, Mao included, and initially met in a girls' school that had been closed for the summer. After the authorities learned of this meeting and sent a police spy to report on their subversive activities, the delegates instead moved their activities to a boat on South Lake near to Chiahsing, where they escaped detection by claiming to be on a holiday excursion. Although delegates from the Soviet Union and [[Comintern]] had attended, the first congress ignored Lenin's advice by refusing to accept a temporary alliance between the communists and the &quot;bourgeois democrats&quot; who also advocated national revolution; instead they stuck to the orthodox Marxist belief that only the urban proletariat could lead a socialist revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now the party secretary for Hunan, Mao stationed himself in Changsha, from where he went on a recruitment drive to gain support for the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram 1966. p. 68&quot;&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 52&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1921, Mao founded the Self-Study University, through which readers could gain access to Marxist and other revolutionary literature, and which was housed in the premises of the Society for the Study of Wang Fuzhi (''Chuan-shan Hsüeh-she'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Schram 1966. p. 68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 52&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He also took part in the mass education movement to fight illiteracy, founded in 1921 by members of the Chinese [[Young Men's Christian Association]] with U.S. backing. Opening a Changsha branch, Mao replaced the usual textbooks with revolutionary tracts in order to spread Marxist ideas among the illiterate peasantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 1976. p. 52&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued with his work in organizing the labour movement to strike in an attempt to damage the administration of Hunanese Governor [[Zhao Hengti]], particularly after the latter executed two anarchist activists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1922, the Second Congress of the Communist Party took place in Shanghai; while Mao lost the address and was unable to attend, the delegates decided to finally adopt the Leninist advice by agreeing to an alliance with the &quot;bourgeois democrats&quot; of the Kuomintang for the good of the &quot;national revolution&quot; to unite China and free it of foreign imperialist influence. As a result, members of the Communist Party began to join the Kuomintang, hoping to influence its politics in a leftward direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 33&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao agreed with this decision, vocally arguing for an anti-imperialist alliance which constituted all of China's socio-economic classes, and not merely the urban proletariat. In his writings, he lambasted the governments of Japan, Great Britain and the United States, describing the latter as &quot;the most murderous of hangmen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 55&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with the Kuomintang: 1922–1927===
[[File:Mao1927.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Mao the revolutionary in 1927; he had spent the prior two years training peasants in the tactics of war under the aegis of the Kuomintang.]]
At the Third Congress of the Communist Party, held in Shanghai in June 1923, the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to working with the Kuomintang to overthrow the [[Beiyang Government]] and the imperialist powers then occupying parts of China. A staunch supporter of this position, at the Congress Mao was elected to the Communist Party Committee, taking up residence in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 34&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; He became involved with the Kuomintang, attending their First Congress, held in Canton during January and February 1924. Soon elected an alternate member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, in February 1924 he put forward four resolutions that argued that power in the party was too centralized among a few cadres in Canton, and that power should instead he decentralized to urban and rural bureaus. His enthusiastic support for the nationalist party earned him the suspicion of some of the communists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 55&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 76–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 34&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Stuart Schram]] would later comment that during the period between 1925 and 1927, Mao was closer to the Kuomintang than he was to the Communist Party, something he attributed to Mao's belief that the good of China was more important than the cause of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 1924, Mao returned to his home village of Shaoshan for the first time in 15 years to recuperate from an illness. Here, he discovered that the peasantry were becoming increasingly restless as a result of the social and political upheaval of the past decade, with some seizing land from wealthy landowners and founding their own communes. These actions convinced him of the revolutionary potential of the peasants, an idea advocated by the Kuomintang but not the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 35&quot;/&gt; As a result, he was subsequently appointed to the leadership of the Kuomintang's Peasant Movement Training Institute, also becoming the Director of the Party's Propaganda Department. In doing so, he became the editor of the Kuomintang's newsletter, the ''Political Weekly'' (''Zhengzhi zhoubao'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 85, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 56, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 36&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Peasant Movement Training Institute, Mao took an active role in organizing the revolutionary Hunanese peasants and preparing them for militant activity, taking them through military training exercises and getting them to study various left-wing texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 82, 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1925, Mao fled to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] after his revolutionary activities attracted the attention of Zhao's regional authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 34&quot;/&gt; At the time, the country was once more facing violent upheaval; on May 30, 1925, police from the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] followed the orders of a British policeman and opened fire on a group of protesters, killing 10 and wounding 50. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce agreed on a strike in solidarity with the protesters, which in turn led to increasingly repressive measures by the authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 35&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao and the communists constituted the left wing of the Kuomintang, and were caught in power struggles with the party's right wing, some of whom urged a purge of the leftists. When party leader Sun Yat-Sen died in May 1925, he was succeeded by a rightist, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (1887–1977), who opposed Mao and other high ranking leftists, and who initiated moves to marginalize the position of the communists in the party.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 84,89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 34&quot;/&gt; Mao nevertheless was supportive of Chiang when he decided to overthrow the Beiyang Government warlords and their foreign imperialist allies, leading his [[National Revolutionary Army]] on the [[Northern Expedition]] in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 87, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 39&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the Northern Expedition, peasants continued to rise up, appropriating the land of the wealthy land-owners, whom were in many cases killed. Such peasant uprisings had angered many of the senior figures and generals in the Kuomintang, who were themselves wealthy land-owners, emphasising the class and ideological divide that was becoming increasingly apparent in the revolutionary movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao soon turned his attention to the issue of land appropriation and redistribution. In March 1927, he appeared at the Third Plenum of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to reorganize the party and strip General Chiang of the increasing amount of power that he had attained, instead appointing [[Wang Jingwei]] to the leadership. Mao played an active role in the discussions regarding the peasant issue at the Third Plenum, defending a set of &quot;Regulations for the Repression of Local Bullies and Bad Gentry&quot;, which advocated the [[death penalty]] or [[life imprisonment]] for anyone found guilty of [[counter-revolution]]ary activity. Mao argued that in a revolutionary situation, &quot;peaceful methods cannot suffice to overthrow the local bullies and bad gentry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 42&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1927, Mao was appointed as one of the five-member Central Land Committee of the Kuomintang, and he continued to urge peasants to refuse to pay rents to the landlords. Mao proceeded to lead another group of five to put together a &quot;Draft Resolution on the Land Question&quot;, which called for the confiscation of land belonging to &quot;local bullies and bad gentry, corrupt officials, militarists and all counter-revolutionary elements in the villages.&quot;  He proceeded to carry out a &quot;Land Survey&quot; in which he stated that anyone owning over 30 ''mou'' (four and a half acres), constituting 13% of the population, were uniformly counter-revolutionary. He nevertheless accepted that there was great variation in revolutionary enthusiasm across the country, and that a flexible policy of land redistrubution was therefore necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 99&amp;ndash;100.&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his conclusions at the Enlarged Land Committee meeting on 22 April, but many of those assembled expressed reservations, some believing that it went too far, and others expressing the opinion that it did not go far enough. Ultimately, Mao's suggestions were only partially implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings: 1927===

Fresh from the success of the Northern Expedition to overthrow the warlords, General Chiang Kai-shek turned on the communists, whom by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China. He ignored the orders sent to him by the Kuomintang civilian government based in Wuhan, instead marching on Shanghai, a city controlled by communist militias. Although the communists welcomed Chiang's arrival, believing him to be their ally, he turned on them, massacring 5000 with the aid of the [[Green Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 61&amp;ndash;62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Allies of Chiang across China began to do the same; in Peking, 19 leading communists were killed by General [[Zhang Zuolin]], while in Changsha, General Ho Chien's forces turned on the local communists, machine gunning several hundred peasant militiamen.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 106–109, 112&amp;ndash;113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 62&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; That May, tens of thousands of communists and radical peasants, workers and students were killed by nationalist forces, with the Communist Party losing approximately 15,000 of its 25,000 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 62&quot;/&gt; Chiang's army soon marched on Wuhan, but was prevented from taking the city by troops under the control of the communist General Yeh T'ing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of the marauding generals, the Communist Party continued its support of the Kuomintang civilian government in Wuhan, a position Mao initially publicly supported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 62&quot;/&gt; At the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party, the delegates ultimately decided to maintain this position, disgusting Mao, who wanted to stake all hope on the peasant militia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 63&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The question was rendered moot when the Wuhan government decided to expell all Communists from the Kuomintang on 15 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 63&quot;/&gt; The Communists subsequently agreed to raise their own army to battle Chiang, founding the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army of China, better known as the &quot;[[History of the People's Liberation Army#From the founding of the People's Liberation Army to the Korean War|Red Army]]&quot;. One group, under the leadership of General [[Zhu De]], was ordered to take the city of [[Nanchang]] on 1 August 1927 in what became known as the [[Nanchang Uprising]]; initially successful, they were forced into retreat after five days, marching south to [[Swatow]], and from there being driven into the wilderness of [[Fukien]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 63&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, having been appointed as commander-in-chief of the Red Army, Mao had led four regiments to undertake the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in Changsha, in the hope of sparking peasant uprisings across Hunan. On the eve of the attack, Mao composed a poem &amp;ndash; the earliest of his to survive &amp;ndash; that was entitled simply &quot;Changsha&quot;. His plan was to attack the nationalist-held city from three directions on 9 September, but they soon ran into trouble when his Fourth Regiment deserted to join the Kuomintang cause, attacking the Third Regiment. Despite this set back, Mao's army managed to make it to Changsha, but found the city to be heavily defended, and many of his men were gunned down my machine gun fire. By the 15 September, he accepted his defeat, and with his thousand surviving men marched east to the [[Jinggang Mountains]] of [[Jiangxi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 64&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 46-47&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Base in Chingkangshan: 1927&amp;ndash;1930===

In the aftermath of the failed Autumn Harvest Uprising, the Communist Party Central Committee, then hiding in Shanghai, decided to punish Mao for &quot;military opportunism&quot;, for focusing on rural rather than urban revolutionary activities, and for being too moderate in punishing &quot;bad gentry&quot;. As such, they removed Mao both from their rank and from the Hunan Provincial Committee. They nevertheless chose to adopt three policies that he had long championed: the immediate formation of [[Workers' council|soviet]]s, the confiscation of all land without exemption, and the complete rejection of the Kuomintang and their flag. Mao's response to their dissaproval was simply to ignore them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Setting up base in Chingkangshan, an area of the Jinggang Mountains, Mao united five villages as a self-governing state with its own independent government, and initiated measures to further land reform by supporting the confiscation of land from rich landlords, who were &quot;re-educated&quot; and in some cases executed, a punishment Mao supported. He nevertheless ensured that no massacres took place under the region he controlled, pursuing a more moderate approach than that called for by the Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 67&amp;ndash;68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feigon 2002 48&quot;&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao decided to form a union with two groups of armed bandits, led by Yüan Wen-ts'ai and Wang Tso, whom he believed could be converted to the communist cause. In doing so, he assembled together a force of around 1800 troops.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 126&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 66&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; He successfuly welcomed others to come and join his army, proclaiming that &quot;Even the lame, the deaf, and the blind could all come in useful for the revolutionary struggle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 69&quot;&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He laid down simple rules for his soldiers to follow: prompt obediance to orders, all confiscations from landlords and rich peasants were to be turned over to the government, and nothing was to be confiscated from the poor peasants. In doing so, he was able to mold his men into a disciplined, efficient fighting force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter. p. 69&quot;/&gt;

In the spring of 1928, the Central Committee ordered Mao to march his troops to southern Hunan, in the hope of sparking the Hunanese peasants in revolution. Mao was sceptical, but complied. When they reached Hunan, they were attacked by the Kuomintang and suffered heavy losses, being forced to flee. In the meantime, Kuomintang troops had also invaded Chingkangshan, leaving them without a base.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 68&amp;ndash;69.&lt;/ref&gt; Wandering the countryside, Mao's forces came across another communist army under the leadership of General [[Zhu De]] and [[Lin Biao]], and it was decided that they would combine forces and attempt to retake Chingkangshan. Although initially successful, the Kuomintang forces counter-attacked, pushing the communists back; over the next few weeks, they involved themselves in guerilla combat techniques against the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch66|Schram 1966]]. pp. 128, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Central Committee once again ordered Mao to march to south Hunan, but this time he refused, deciding to stay at his base. In contrast, Zhu had complied, leading his armies to fight. The Kuomintang took the opportunity to attack Mao's base, and although his troops were able to fend them off for 25 days, he realized that they would soon fail, and so Mao left the camp at night. He proceeded to reunite with Zhu's army, who had been decimated in Hunan, and together they returned to Chingkangshan and retook the base once more. They were joined by a Kuomintang regiment that had defected, but the mountainous area was unable to crop enough crops to feed everyone, leading to food shortages throughout the cold winter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. pp. 70&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Republic of China: 1931&amp;ndash;1934===
[[File:Mao1931.jpg|thumb|Mao in 1931.]]
From 1931 to 1934, Mao helped establish the [[Soviet Republic of China]] and was elected Chairman of this small republic in the mountainous areas in Jiangxi. Here, Mao was married to [[He Zizhen]]. His previous wife, [[Yang Kaihui]], had been arrested and executed in 1930, just three years after their departure. In Jiangxi, Mao's authoritative domination, especially that of the military force, was challenged by the Jiangxi branch of the CPC and military officers. Mao's opponents, among whom the most prominent was Li Wenlin, the founder of the CPC's branch and Red Army in Jiangxi, were against Mao's land policies and proposals to reform the local party branch and army leadership. Mao reacted first by accusing the opponents of opportunism and [[kulak]]ism and then set off a series of [[Anti-Bolshevik League incident|systematic suppressions]] of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Michael J|title=Mao|year=2004|isbn=0-415-21577-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fzVSkyaBIGEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao's first appearance in [[The Times]] was in August 1929:

{{quote|&quot;The name of Chu Mao&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chu Mao&quot; was Mao Zedong's nickname in the early years.&lt;/ref&gt; has been infamous on the borders of Fukien and Kwangtung for two years past. Twice he has been driven to refuge in the mountains, being too mobile to catch, but at the first sign of relaxed authority [...], he comes down again to ravage the plains. Chu Mao calls himself a Communist [...]; and wherever Chu Mao goes he begins by calling on the farmers to rise and destroy the capitalists and bourgeois. But he is really the worst kind of brigand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The article, based on letters to the Times' correspondent, continues with Mao's torture methods.&lt;/ref&gt;| The Times: ''Brigandage in China. In the name of Communism.'' August 3, 1929}}

Mao, with the help of [[Zhu De]], built a modest but effective army, undertook experiments in rural reform and government, and provided refuge for Communists fleeing the KMT purges in the cities. Mao's methods are normally referred to as guerrilla warfare; but he himself made a distinction between guerrilla warfare (''youji zhan'') and [[Mobile Warfare|mobile warfare]] (''yundong zhan''). Mao's doctrines of guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare were based upon the fact of the poor armament and military training of the Red Army which consisted mainly of impoverished peasants, who, however, were fired by revolutionary passions and the aspiration for a communist utopia.

Around 1930, there had been more than ten regions, usually entitled &quot;soviet areas&quot;, under control of the CPC.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cambridge History of China (vol. 13, pt. 2)| url=http://books.google.com/?id=Fxs3ROaIhPMC| last=Fairbank| first=John K| coauthors=Albert Feuerwerker| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-24338-6 | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative prosperity of &quot;soviet areas&quot; startled and worried [[Chiang Kai-shek]], chairman of the Kuomintang government, who waged five waves of besieging campaigns against the &quot;central soviet area.&quot; More than one million Kuomintang soldiers were involved in these five campaigns, four of which were defeated by the Red Army led by Mao. By June 1932 (the height of its power), the Red Army had no less than 45,000 soldiers, with a further 200,000 local militia acting as a subsidiary force.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobmass&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Mobilizing the Masses: Building Revolution in Henan| url=http://books.google.com/?id=1BN9dAqprX8C| last=Ying-kwong Wou| first=Odoric| year=1994| publisher=Stanford University Press| isbn=0-8047-2142-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under increasing pressure from the KMT [[Encirclement Campaigns]], there was a struggle for power within the Communist leadership. Mao was removed from his important positions and replaced by individuals (including [[Zhou Enlai]]) who appeared loyal to the orthodox line advocated by Moscow and represented within the CPC by a group known as the [[28 Bolsheviks]]. Chiang, who had earlier assumed nominal control of China due in part to the Northern Expedition, was determined to eliminate the Communists. By October 1934, he had them surrounded, prompting them to engage in the &quot;[[Long March]]&quot;, a retreat from Jiangxi in the southeast to [[Shaanxi]] in the north west of China. It was during this {{convert|9600|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}}, year-long journey that Mao emerged as the top Communist leader, aided by the [[Zunyi Conference]] and the defection of Zhou Enlai to Mao's side. At this Conference, Mao entered the Standing Committee of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]].
[[File:1946 Mao and Chiang.jpg|thumb|In an effort to defeat the Japanese Mao agreed to collaborate with [[Chiang Kai-shek]].]]

In 1936 [[Manchuria]]n warlord and Chiang's former ally [[Zhang Xueliang]] decided to conspire with the CPC and [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]] to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT was forced to agree to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the forming of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance took place with salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC after relentless attacks by Chiang's forces. CPC agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] which were nominally under the command of the [[National Revolutionary Army]].

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], Mao advocated a strategy of avoiding open confrontations with the Japanese army and concentrating on [[On Guerrilla Warfare|guerrilla warfare]] from his base in [[Yan'an]], while leaving the KMT to take on the brunt of the fighting and suffer tremendous casualties.&lt;ref name=Lam&gt;&quot;[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/13999.html Willy Lam: China's Own Historical Revisionism]&quot;, [[History News Network]], August 11, 2005. Retrieved May 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Mao directed the CPC forces to concentrate on absorbing, and eliminating if necessary, Chinese militia behind enemy lines. This led to intensified conflicts between KMT and CPC forces, and the fragile alliance broke down after the [[New Fourth Army incident]] in January 1941. Mao further consolidated power over the Communist Party in 1942 by launching the [[Shu Fan movement]], or &quot;Rectification&quot; campaign against rival CPC members such as [[Wang Ming]], [[Wang Shiwei]], and [[Ding Ling]].

Mao also greatly expanded CPC's sphere of influence in areas outside of Japanese control, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favouring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.&lt;ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE&gt;{{Cite news

In 1944, the Americans sent a special diplomatic envoy, called the [[Dixie Mission]], to the Communist Party of China. According to Edwin Moise, in ''Modern China: A History 2nd Edition'':

: ''Most of the Americans were favourably impressed. The CPC seemed less corrupt, more unified, and more vigorous in its resistance to Japan than the KMT. United States fliers shot down over North China...confirmed to their superiors that the CPC was both strong and popular over a broad area. In the end, the contacts with the USA developed with the CPC led to very little.''

After the end of World War II, the U.S. continued their military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and his KMT government forces against the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) led by Mao Zedong in the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] for control of China. Likewise, the [[Soviet Union]] gave quasi-covert support to Mao by their occupation of north east China, which allowed the PLA to move in en masse and took large supplies of arms left by the Japanese's [[Kwantung Army]].

In 1948, under direct orders from Mao, the People's Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying the city of [[Changchun]]. At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the [[Siege of Changchun|siege]], which lasted from June until October. PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, who documented the siege in his book ''[[White Snow, Red Blood]]'', compared it to [[Hiroshima]]: ''&quot;The casualties were about the same.

In the early morning of December 10, 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chengdu, the last KMT-held city in [[mainland China]], and Chiang Kai-shek evacuated from the mainland to Taiwan.

==Leadership of China==
[[File:China, Mao (2).jpg|thumb|left|280px|Mao Zedong declares the founding of the modern People's Republic of China, October 1, 1949]]

The People's Republic of China was established on October 1, 1949. It was the culmination of over two decades of civil and international wars. From 1943 to 1976, Mao was the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]]. During this period, Mao was called Chairman Mao ({{lang|zh-cn|毛主席}}, ''Máo Zhǔxí'') or the Great Leader Chairman Mao ({{lang|zh-cn|伟大领袖毛主席}}, ''Wěidà Lǐngxiù Máo Zhǔxí''). Mao famously announced: &quot;The Chinese people have stood up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is often mistakenly said to have been delivered during the speech from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, but was first used ''on September 21, at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference'', then repeated on several occasions. Timothy Cheek, ed., ''Mao Zedong and China's Revolutions: A Brief History with Documents''  (NY: Palgrave,  2002) p. 125. Also

Mao took up residence in [[Zhongnanhai]], a compound next to the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing, and there he ordered the construction of an indoor swimming pool and other buildings. Mao often did his work either in bed or by the side of the pool, preferring not to wear formal clothes unless absolutely necessary, according to Dr. [[Li Zhisui]], his personal physician. (Li's book, ''[[The Private Life of Chairman Mao]]'', is regarded as controversial, especially by those sympathetic to Mao.)

In October 1950, Mao made the decision to send the [[People's Volunteer Army]] into Korea and fight against the United Nations forces led by the U.S. Historical records showed that Mao directed the PVA campaigns in the [[Korean War]] to the minute details.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkitt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Starting in 1951, Mao initiated two successive movements in an effort to rid urban areas of corruption by targeting wealthy capitalists and political opponents, known as the [[three-anti/five-anti campaigns]]. A climate of raw terror developed as workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses, and children informed on their parents; the victims often were humiliated at [[Struggle Session|struggle sessions]], a method designed to intimidate and terrify people to the maximum. Mao insisted that minor offenders be criticized and reformed or sent to labor camps, &quot;while the worst among them should be shot.&quot; These campaigns took several hundred thousand additional lives, the vast majority via suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Short |first=Philip |title=Mao: A Life |publisher=Owl Books |year=2001 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=4y6mACbLWGsC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=mao+while+the+worst+among+them+should+be+shot |isbn=0-8050-6638-1 |page=437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shanghai, suicide by jumping from tall buildings became so commonplace that residents avoided walking on the pavement near skyscrapers for fear that suicides might land on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808241-5,00.html|title=High Tide of Terror|date=March 5, 1956|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biographers have pointed out that driving those perceived as enemies to suicide was a common tactic during the Mao-era.

[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|280 px|left|Mao at [[Joseph Stalin]]'s 70th birthday celebration in Moscow, December 1949 ]]
Following the consolidation of power, Mao launched the First [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] (1953–58). The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become a world power. With the [[Soviet Union]]'s assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support. The success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]], the Great Leap Forward, in 1958. Mao also launched a phase of rapid [[collectivization]]. The CPC introduced price controls as well as a [[Simplified Chinese character|Chinese character simplification]] aimed at increasing literacy. Large-scale industrialization projects were also undertaken.

Programs pursued during this time include the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], in which Mao indicated his supposed willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed. Given the freedom to express themselves, liberal and intellectual Chinese began opposing the Communist Party and questioning its leadership. This was initially tolerated and encouraged. After a few months, Mao's government reversed its policy and persecuted those, totalling perhaps 500,000{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}, who criticized, as well as those who were merely alleged to have criticized, the party in what is called the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]]. Authors such as [[Jung Chang]] have alleged that the Hundred Flowers Campaign was merely a ruse to root out &quot;dangerous&quot; thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jung; Halliday, Jon. 2005. ''Mao: The Unknown Story''. New York: Knopf. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dalai-mao-oct13-1954.jpg|thumb|[[14th Dalai Lama]] shaking hands with Mao, October 13, 1954]]
Others such as Dr Li Zhisui have suggested that Mao had initially seen the policy as a way of weakening those within his party who opposed him, but was surprised by the extent of criticism and the fact that it began to be directed at his own leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Zhisui (1994). The Private Life of Chairman Mao: The Memoirs of Mao's Personal Physician. pp. 198, 200, 468–469. Random House.. ISBN 0-7011-4018-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only then that he used it as a method of identifying and subsequently persecuting those critical of his government. The Hundred Flowers movement led to the condemnation, silencing, and death of many citizens, also linked to Mao's Anti-Rightist Movement, with death tolls possibly in the millions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Great Leap Forward===
In January 1958, Mao Zedong launched the second [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]], known as the [[Great Leap Forward]], a plan intended as an alternative model for economic growth to the Soviet model focusing on heavy industry that was advocated by others in the party. Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives which had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned; livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.

Under the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. Combined with the diversion of labor to steel production and infrastructure projects, these projects combined with cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% reduction in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Spence p 553&quot;&gt;Jonathan Spence, ''Mao Zedong'', p 553&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to win favor with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based on the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of the true harvest for state use, primarily in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The net result, which was compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, left rural peasants with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the largest [[famine]] known as the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. This famine was a direct cause of the death of some 30 million Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962 and about the same number of births were lost or postponed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/319/7225/1619 China's great famine: 40 years later]&quot;. ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' 1999;319:1619–1621 (December 18 )&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many children who became emaciated and malnourished during years of hardship and struggle for survival died shortly after the Great Leap Forward came to an end in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Spence p 553&quot;/&gt;

The extent of Mao's knowledge of the severity of the situation has been disputed. According to some, most notably Dr. [[Li Zhisui]], Mao was not aware that the situation amounted to more than a slight shortage of food and general supplies until late 1959.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[File:People's commone canteen3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In the beginning, commune members were able to eat for free at the commune canteens. This changed when food production slowed to a halt.]]

Hong Kong-based historian [[Frank Dikötter]], who conducted extensive archival research on the Great Leap Forward in local and regional Chinese government archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/opinion/16iht-eddikotter16.html | title=Mao's Great Leap to Famine | author=Dikötter, Frank | newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=15 December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the notion that Mao did not know about the famine until it was too late:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The idea that the state mistakenly took too much grain from the countryside because it assumed that the harvest was much larger than it was is largely a myth – at most partially true for the autumn of 1958 only. In most cases the party knew very well that it was starving its own people to death. At a secret meeting in the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai dated March 25, 1959, Mao specifically ordered the party to procure up to one third of all the grain, much more than had ever been the case. At the meeting he announced that 'When there is not enough to eat, people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.'&quot;

In ''Hungry Ghosts'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that [[rightists]] and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker81&quot;&gt;[[Jasper Becker]].

Holt Paperbacks, 1998. ISBN 0-8050-5668-8 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; and instead launched a series of &quot;anti-grain concealment&quot; drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jasper Becker]]. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iC4g0gXBmIkC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Mao+peasants+were+lying#v=onepage&amp;q=Mao%20peasants%20were%20lying&amp;f=false Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine].'' Holt Paperbacks, 1998. ISBN 0-8050-5668-8 p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Becker. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iC4g0gXBmIkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=peasants+beaten+tortured+to+death&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=peasants%20beaten%20tortured%20to%20death&amp;f=false Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine].'' Holt Paperbacks, 1998. ISBN 0-8050-5668-8 p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, journals such as the ''[[Monthly Review]]'' have disputed the reliability of the figures commonly cited, the qualitative evidence of a &quot;massive death toll&quot;, and Mao's complicity in those deaths which occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monthlyreview.org/commentary/did-mao-really-kill-millions-in-the-great-leap-forward Did Mao Really Kill Millions in the Great Leap Forward?] by Joseph Ball, ''[[Monthly Review]]'', September 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the case, the Great Leap Forward caused Mao to lose esteem among many of the top party cadres and was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, while losing some political power to moderate leaders, notably [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the process. However, Mao, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.

The Great Leap Forward was a disaster for China. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbors did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin A. Valentino.

===Consequences===
At the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several leaders expressed concern that the ''Great Leap Forward'' had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Mao, fearing loss of his position, orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as &quot;right opportunists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jasper Becker]]. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=iC4g0gXBmIkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=terrible+famine+mao+right+opportunist&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=terrible%20famine%20mao%20right%20opportunist&amp;f=false Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine].'' Holt Paperbacks, 1998. ISBN 0-8050-5668-8 pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign against right opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to camps where many would subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that 6 million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin A. Valentino. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=LQfeXVU_EvgC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=6+million+wrongly+punished&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Final Solutions: Mass Killing and Genocide in the Twentieth Century]'' [[Cornell University Press]], 2004. p. 127.

The number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid 1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must be localized or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totaling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang Jisheng&quot;/&gt; exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker81&quot;/&gt;

Censuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data in order to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958–61, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths, as given by [[Hu Yaobang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Short |first=Philip |title=Mao: A Life |publisher=Owl Books |year=2001 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=4y6mACbLWGsC&amp;pg=PA631&amp;dq=mao+a+life+all+the+dead+of+the+second+world+war |page=761 |isbn=978-0-8050-6638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang Jisheng&quot;&gt;Mark O'Neill.

On the international front, the period was dominated by the further isolation of China. The [[Sino-Soviet split]] resulted in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s withdrawal of all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split was triggered by arguments over the control and direction of world communism and other disputes pertaining to foreign policy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Most of the problems regarding communist unity resulted from the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in March 1953 and his replacement by Khrushchev. Only [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] openly sided with China against the Soviets, which began an alliance between the two countries which would last until the [[Sino-Albanian split]] after Mao's death in 1976.

Stalin had established himself as the successor of &quot;correct&quot; [[Marxist]] thought well before Mao controlled the [[Communist Party of China]], and therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps because of seniority) that the leadership of the &quot;correct&quot; Marxist doctrine would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favorable Soviets were now denounced as &quot;revisionists&quot; and listed alongside &quot;American imperialism&quot; as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Partly surrounded by hostile American military bases (in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]]), China was now confronted with a new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat from the north and west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of the People's Republic were in hostile confrontation with each other.

At a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the &quot;Conference of the Seven Thousand,&quot; State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;&gt;Chang, Jung and Jon Halliday, ''Mao: The Unknown Story'' (2006), pp. 568, 579.&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;/&gt; A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;/&gt; Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Cultural Revolution===
{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}
[[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|thumb|200px|Chinese propaganda poster from the Cultural Revolution: &quot;Destroy the old world. Forge the new world.&quot; A Red Guard crushes the crucifix, Buddha, and classical Chinese texts with a hammer; 1967.]]

Mao was concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution had replaced an old elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were supposed to serve.{{Tone|date=April 2012}} Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the &quot;ruling class&quot; and keep China in a state of &quot;perpetual revolution&quot; that served the interests of the  majority, not a tiny elite.&lt;ref&gt;Mao a Reinterpretation by Lee Feigon, page 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]], then the State Chairman and General Secretary, respectively, had favored the idea that Mao should be removed from actual power but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalize Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1966. Some scholars, such as Mobo Gao, claim the case for this is perhaps overstated.&lt;ref&gt;For a full treatment of this idea see- Mobo Gao, &quot;The Battle for China's Past&quot;, Pluto Press, London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Frank Dikötter]], hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Mirsky. [http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/mirsky_09_10.html ''Livelihood Issues.''] [[Literary Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that certain liberal bourgeois elements of society continued to threaten the socialist framework, groups of young people known as the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] struggled against authorities at all levels of society and even set up their own tribunals. Chaos reigned in many parts of the country, and millions were persecuted, including a famous philosopher, Chen Yuen. During the Cultural Revolution, the schools in China were closed and the young intellectuals living in cities were ordered to the countryside to be &quot;re-educated&quot; by the peasants, where they performed hard manual labor and other work.

The Revolution led to the destruction of much of China's traditional cultural heritage and the imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as creating general economic and social chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined during this period, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into every part of Chinese life, depicted by such Chinese films as ''[[To Live (film)|To Live]]'', ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]''. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, perished in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;maostats&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Mao |title=Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm | publisher = Historical Atlas of the Twentieth Century | accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mao was informed of such losses, particularly that people had been driven to suicide, he is alleged to have commented: &quot;People who try to commit suicide&amp;nbsp;— don't attempt to save them!&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. China is such a populous nation, it is not as if we cannot do without a few people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roderick MacFarquhar|last=MacFarquhar|first=Roderick|coauthors=Schoenhals, Michael|title=Mao's Last Revolution|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-674-02332-3|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities allowed the Red Guards to abuse and kill opponents of the regime.

It was during this period that Mao chose [[Lin Biao]], who seemed to echo all of Mao's ideas, to become his successor. Lin was later officially named as Mao's successor. By 1971, however, a divide between the two men became apparent. Official history in China states that Lin was planning a military coup or an assassination attempt on Mao. Lin Biao died in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably on his way to flee China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao, and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures. The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] described his conversation with [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] who told him about a plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of [[Lin Biao]] organized by the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacepa0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ=|title=The Kremlin's Killing Ways|author=Ion Mihai Pacepa|publisher=National Review Online|date=November 28, 2006|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution to be over, although the official history of the People's Republic of China marks the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 with Mao's death. In the last years of his life, Mao was faced with declining health due to either [[Parkinson's disease]] or, according to Li Zhisui, [[motor neuron disease]], as well as lung ailments due to smoking and heart trouble. Some also attributed Mao's decline in health to the betrayal of Lin Biao. Mao remained passive as various factions within the Communist Party mobilized for the power struggle anticipated after his death.

This period is often looked at in official circles in China and in the West as a great stagnation or even of reversal for China. While many—an estimated 100 million—did suffer,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Chirot. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=e-kVgozyE8gC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=100+million+persecution+cultural+revolution&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Modern tyrants: the power and prevalence of evil in our age].'' [[Princeton University Press]], 1996.

During the Cultural Revolution, China exploded its [[Test No. 6|first H-Bomb]] (1967), launched the [[Dong Fang Hong]] satellite (January 30, 1970), commissioned its first nuclear submarines and made various advances in science and technology. Healthcare was free, and living standards in the countryside continued to improve.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
{{Tone|section|date=April 2012}}
&lt;!-- Much of this section sounds editorialized, and at the very least is missing a lot of citations --&gt;Mao had been in poorer health for several years and had declined visibly for at least six months prior to his death. There are unconfirmed reports that he possibly had ALS or [[Lou Gehrig's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holcombe|first=Charles|title=A history of East Asia : from the origins of civilization to the twenty-first century|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0-521-73164-5|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's last public appearance was on May 27, 1976, where he met the visiting Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] during the latter's one-day visit to Beijing.

At around 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm on September 2, 1976, Mao suffered a heart attack, far more severe than his previous two and affecting a much larger area of his heart. X-rays indicated that his current lung infection had worsened, and his urine output dropped to less than 300 cc a day.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Mao was awake and alert throughout the crisis and asked his team of doctors, several times, whether he was in danger. His condition continued to fluctuate and his life hung in the balance. Three days later, on September 5, Mao's condition was still critical, and Hua Guofeng called Jiang Qing back from her trip.{{which|date=April 2012}} She spent only a few minutes visiting him in Building 202 (where Mao was staying) before returning to her own residence in the Spring Lotus Chamber.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
On the afternoon of September 7, Mao's condition took a turn for the worse. Jiang Qing went to Building 202 where she learned the news. Mao had just fallen asleep and needed the rest, but she insisted on rubbing his back and moving his limbs, and she sprinkled powder on his body. The medical team protested that the dust from the powder was not good for his lungs, but she instructed the nurses on duty to follow her example later. The next morning, September 8, she went again. She demanded the medical staff to change Mao's sleeping position, claiming that he had been lying too long on his left side.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The doctor on duty objected, knowing that he could breathe only on his left side, but she had him moved nonetheless.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Mao's breathing stopped and his face turned blue.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Jiang Qing left the room while the medical staff put him on a respirator and performed emergency [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]. Mao barely revived and [[Hua Guofeng]] urged Jiang Qing not to interfere further with the doctors' work, as her actions were detrimental to Mao's health and helped cause his death faster.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Mao's organs failed quickly and he fell into a coma shortly before noon where he was put on life support machines. He was taken off life support over 12 hours later quarter to midnight and was pronounced dead at 12:10&amp;nbsp;am on September 9, 1976. September 9 was chosen as the day to let Mao die because it was seen as an easy day to remember, being the ninth day of the ninth month of the calendar.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

His body lay in state at the [[Great Hall of the People]]. A memorial service was held in [[Tiananmen Square]] on September 18, 1976. There was a three-minute silence observed during this service. His body was later placed into the [[Mausoleum of Mao Zedong]], even though he had wished to be cremated and had been one of the first high-ranking officials to sign the &quot;Proposal that all Central Leaders be Cremated after Death&quot; in November 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China After Mao's Death: Nation of Rumor and Uncertainty |url= |quote=Hong Kong, October&amp;nbsp;5, 1976.

As anticipated after Mao's death, there was a power struggle for control of China. On one side was the left wing led by the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]], who wanted to continue the policy of revolutionary mass mobilization. On the other side was the right wing opposing these policies. Among the latter group, the right wing restorationists, led by Chairman [[Hua Guofeng]], advocated a return to central planning along the Soviet model, whereas the right wing reformers, led by Deng Xiaoping, wanted to overhaul the Chinese economy based on market-oriented policies and to de-emphasize the role of Maoist ideology in determining economic and political policy. Eventually, the reformers won control of the government. Deng Xiaoping, with clear seniority over Hua Guofeng, defeated Hua in a bloodless power struggle a few years later.

==Legacy==
[[File:Tiananmen Mao.jpg|thumb|A large portrait of Mao by [[Zhang Zhenshi]] at [[Tiananmen]]]]

{{quote|&quot;[Mao] turned China from a feudal backwater into one of the most powerful countries in the World ... The Chinese system he overthrew was backward and corrupt; few would argue the fact that he dragged China into the 20th century. But at a cost in human lives that is staggering.&quot;| '' Mao Tse Tung: China's Peasant Emperor'', [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] [[Biography (TV series)|Biography]], 2005&lt;ref name = &quot;MaoDoc&quot; /&gt;}}

Mao remains a controversial figure and there is little agreement over his legacy both in China and abroad.  He is generally credited and praised with having unified China and ending the previous decades of civil war. He is also credited with having improved the status of women in China and improving literacy and education.  His policies caused the deaths of tens of millions of people during his 27-year reign, more than any other Twentieth Century leader, however supporters point out that in spite of this, life expectancy improved during his reign.  Supporters claim that he rapidly industrialized China, but detractors claim that his policies, particularly the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, were impediments to industrialization and modernization.  Supporters claim that his policies laid the groundwork for China's later rise to become an economic superpower, while detractors claim that his policies delayed economic development and that China's economy only underwent its rapid growth after Mao's policies had been widely abandoned.  Mao's revolutionary tactics continue to be used by insurgents, and his political ideology continues to be embraced by many communist organizations around the world.  

In mainland China, Mao is still revered by many supporters of the Communist Party and respected by a majority of the general population as the &quot;[[List of national founders|Founding Father]] of modern China&quot;, credited for giving &quot;the Chinese people dignity and self-respect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaoDoc&quot;/&gt; Mobo Gao in his 2008 book ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'', credits Mao for raising the average life expectancy from 35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing &quot;unity and stability to a country that had been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions&quot;, and laying the foundation for China to &quot;become the equal of the great global powers&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;MoboGao&quot; /&gt; Gao also lauds Mao for carrying out massive [[land reform]], promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, and positively &quot;transform(ing) Chinese society beyond recognition.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;MoboGao&quot;&gt;''The battle for China's past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'', by Mobo C. F. Gao, Pluto Press, 2008, ISBN 0-7453-2780-X, pg 81&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Mao has many Chinese critics, both those who live inside and outside China. Opposition to Mao is subject to restriction in mainland China, but is especially strong elsewhere, where he is often reviled as a brutish ideologue. In the West, his name is generally associated with tyranny and his economic theories widely discredited – though to some political activists he remains a symbol against capitalism, [[imperialism]] and western influence. Even in China, key pillars of his economic theory have been largely dismantled by market reformers like [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]], who succeeded him as leaders of the Communist Party.

Though the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which Mao led to power, has rejected in practice the economic fundamentals of much of Mao's ideology, it retains for itself many of the powers established under Mao's reign: it controls the Chinese army, police, courts and media and does not permit multi-party elections at the national or local level, except in Hong Kong. Thus it is difficult to gauge the true extent of support for the Chinese Communist Party and Mao's legacy within mainland China. For their part, the Chinese government continues to officially regard Mao as a national hero. In 2008, China opened the Mao Zedong Square to visitors in his hometown of central Hunan Province to mark the 115th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-12/25/content_7341714.htm Chairman Mao square opened on his 115th birth anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mao Zedong still draws crowds on 113th birth anniversary http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200612/27/eng20061227_336033.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao's English interpreter [[Sidney Rittenberg]] wrote in his memoir ''The Man Who Stayed Behind'' that whilst Mao &quot;was a great leader in history&quot;, he was also &quot;a great criminal because, not that he wanted to, not that he intended to, but in fact, his wild fantasies led to the deaths of tens of millions of people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reut09&quot; /&gt; [[Li Rui (Communist Party of China)|Li Rui]], Mao's personal secretary, goes further and claims he was dismissive of the suffering and death caused by his policies: &quot;Mao's way of thinking and governing was terrifying.

While discussing labor-intensive projects such as waterworks and making steel, Chang claims Mao said to his inner circle in November 1958: &quot;Working like this, with all these projects, half of China may well have to die. If not half, one-third, or one-tenth – 50 million – die.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jung Chang|Chang, Jung]] and [[Jon Halliday|Halliday, Jon]]. ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]].''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chinese original, however, is not quite as shocking. In the speech, Mao talks about massive earthmoving irrigation projects and numerous big industrial ones, all requiring huge numbers of people. If the projects, he said, are all undertaken simultaneously &quot;half of China's population unquestionably will die; and if it's not half, it'll be a third or ten percent, a death toll of 50 million people.&quot; Mao then pointed to the example of Guangxi provincial Party secretary, Chén Mànyuǎn (陈漫远) who had been dismissed in 1957 for failing to prevent famine in the previous year, adding: &quot;If with a death toll of 50 million you didn't lose your jobs, I at least should lose mine; whether I should lose my head would also be in question. Anhui wants to do so much, which is quite all right, but make it a principle to have no deaths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0305741006000221 |last=Bernstein |first=Thomas III |title=Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness |journal=The China Quarterly |volume=186 |year=2006 |month=Julu |pages=421–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chang and Halliday take literally Mao's penchant for talking about mass death in highly irresponsible, provocative, callous and reckless ways, exemplified by his famous remark that in a nuclear war, half of China's population would perish but the rest would survive and rebuild. In 1958, when ruminating about the dialectics of life and death, he thought that deaths were beneficial, for without them, there could be no renewal.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Imagine, he asked, what a disaster it would be if Confucius were still alive.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} &quot;When people die there ought to be celebrations.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In December 1958 he remarked that &quot;destruction (''mièwáng'' 灭亡, also extinction) [of people] has advantages. One can make fertilizer. You say you can't, but actually you can, but you must be spiritually prepared.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The authors note that these kinds of remarks could well have justified the indifference of lower-level cadres to peasant deaths.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Jasper Becker]] and Frank Dikötter reach a similar conclusion. Becker notes that &quot;archive material gathered by Dikötter... confirms that far from being ignorant or misled about the famine, the Chinese leadership were kept informed about it all the time. And he exposes the extent of the violence used against the peasants&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;[[Jasper Becker]]. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/6296363/part_2/systematic-genocide-.thtml ''Systematic genocide'']. [[The Spectator]], September 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mass killings are not usually associated with Mao and the Great Leap Forward, and China continues to benefit from a more favourable comparison with Cambodia or the Soviet Union. But as fresh and abundant archival evidence shows, coercion, terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap, and between 1958 to 1962, by a rough approximation, some 6 to 8 per cent of those who died were tortured to death or summarily killed – amounting to at least 3 million victims.

Countless others were deliberately deprived of food and starved to death. Many more vanished because they were too old, weak or sick to work – and hence unable to earn their keep. People were killed selectively because they had the wrong class background, because they dragged their feet, because they spoke out or simply because they were not liked, for whatever reason, by the man who wielded the ladle in the canteen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Mausoleo de Mao Zedong-Tianang Mei-Pekin-China8452.JPG|thumb|250px|Sculptures in front of Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, Beijing, China]]
Dikötter argues that CPC leaders &quot;glorified violence and were inured to massive loss of life. And all of them shared an ideology in which the end justified the means. In 1962, having lost millions of people in his province, Li Jingquan compared the Great Leap Forward to the [[Long March]] in which only one in ten had made it to the end: 'We are not weak, we are stronger, we have kept the backbone.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dikotter299&quot;&gt;Dikötter, Frank.

Regarding the large-scale irrigation projects, Dikötter stresses that, in spite of Mao being in a good position to see the human cost, they continued unabated for several years, and ultimately claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of exhausted villagers. He also notes that &quot;In a chilling precursor of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, villagers in Qingshui and Gansu called these projects the 'killing fields'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dikotter33&quot;&gt;Dikötter, Frank.

The United States placed a trade embargo on the People's Republic as a result of its involvement in the [[Korean War]], lasting until [[Richard Nixon]] decided that developing relations with the PRC would be useful in dealing with the Soviet Union.

[[Roderick MacFarquhar]] has stated: &quot;What Mao accomplished between 1949 and 1956 was in fact the fastest, most extensive, and least damaging socialist revolution carried out in any communist state.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;MacF 348&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Yihua |first1= Jiang |last2= MacFarquhar |first2= Roderick |author2-link= Roderick MacFarquhar |year= 2010 |chapter= Two Perspectives on Mao Zedong |editor-last= Cheek |editor-first= Timothy |title= A Critical Introduction to Mao |location= Cambridge |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |page= [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ru90WzwzlfYC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=%22what+Mao+accomplished%22 348] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao's military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in manners of guerrilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} As an example, the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] followed Mao's examples of guerrilla warfare to considerable political and military success even in the 21st century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Mao's major contribution to the military science is his theory of [[People's War]], with not only guerrilla warfare but more importantly, [[Mobile Warfare]] methodologies. Mao had successfully applied Mobile Warfare in the Korean War, and was able to encircle, push back and then halt the UN forces in Korea, despite the clear superiority of UN firepower.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Mao also gave the impression that he might even welcome a [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1226.html Mao Tse-Tung: Father of Chinese Revolution]&quot;. ''The New York Times''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Let us imagine how many people would die if war breaks out. There are 2.7 billion people in the world, and a third could be lost. If it is a little higher it could be half ...

But historians dispute the sincerity of Mao's words. [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] says that Mao &quot;was deadly serious,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]].

Mao's poems and writings are frequently cited by both Chinese and non-Chinese. The official Chinese translation of President [[Barack Obama]]'s inauguration speech used a famous line from one of Mao's poems.&lt;ref&gt;

The ideology of Maoism has influenced many communists, mainly in the [[Third World]], including revolutionary movements such as [[Cambodia]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jackson Alexander.

The [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]] also claims Marxism-Leninism-Maoism as its ideology, as do other Communist Parties around the world which are part of the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]]. China itself has moved sharply away from Maoism since Mao's death, and most people outside of China who describe themselves as Maoist regard the Deng Xiaoping reforms to be a betrayal of Maoism, in line with Mao's view of &quot;[[Capitalist roader]]s&quot; within the Communist Party.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

As the Chinese government instituted free market economic reforms starting in the late 1970s and as later Chinese leaders took power, less recognition was given to the status of Mao. This accompanied a decline in state recognition of Mao in later years in contrast to previous years when the state organized numerous events and seminars commemorating Mao's 100th birthday. Nevertheless, the Chinese government has never officially repudiated the tactics of Mao. Deng Xiaoping, who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, has to a certain extent rejected Mao's legacy, famously saying that Mao was &quot;70% right and 30% wrong&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Mao Zedong's picture began to appear on all new [[renminbi]] (人民幣) currency from the People's Republic of China. This was officially instituted as an anti-counterfeiting measure as Mao's face is widely recognized in contrast to the generic figures that appear in older currency. On March 13, 2006, a story in the ''[[People's Daily]]'' reported that a proposal had been made to print the portraits of [[Sun Yat-sen]] and Deng Xiaoping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200603/13/eng20060313_250192.html|work=People's Daily Online|title=Portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Deng Xiaoping proposed adding to RMB notes|date=March 13, 2006|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao gave contradicting statements on the subject of [[Cult of personality|personality cults]]. In 1955, as a response to the [[Khrushchev Report]] that criticized [[Joseph Stalin]], Mao stated that personality cults are &quot;poisonous ideological survivals of the old society&quot;, and reaffirmed China's commitment to [[collective leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mao Zedong: A Political and Intellectual Portrait|first=Maurice|last=Meisner|publisher=Polity|year=2007|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at the 1958 Party congress in Chengdu, Mao expressed support for the personality cults of genuinely worthy figures; not those that expressed &quot;blind worship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.thinkquest.org/26469/cultural-revolution/cult.html |title= Cult of Mao | publisher = library.thinkquest.org | accessdate= August 23, 2008 |quote= This remark of Mao seems to have elements of truth but it is false.

In 1962, Mao proposed the Socialist Education Movement (SEM) in an attempt to educate the peasants to resist the &quot;temptations&quot; of feudalism and the sprouts of capitalism that he saw re-emerging in the countryside from Liu's economic reforms{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Large quantities of politicized art were produced and circulated&amp;nbsp;— with Mao at the center.

In October 1966, Mao's ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao|Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung]]'', which was known as the ''Little Red Book'' was published. Party members were encouraged to carry a copy with them and possession was almost mandatory as a criterion for membership. Over the years, Mao's image became displayed almost everywhere, present in homes, offices and shops. His quotations were [[Emphasis (typography)|typographically emphasized]] by putting them in boldface or red type in even the most obscure writings. Music from the period emphasized Mao's stature, as did children's rhymes.

==Genealogy==

===Ancestors===
His ancestors were:
* Máo Yíchāng (毛贻昌, born [[Xiangtan]] October 15, 1870, died [[Shaoshan]] January 23, 1920), father, [[courtesy name]] Máo Shùnshēng (毛顺生) or also known as Mao Jen-sheng
* Wén Qīmèi(文七妹, born Xiangxiang 1867, died October 5, 1919), mother. She was illiterate and a devout Buddhist.  She was a descendant of [[Wen Tianxiang]].
* Máo Ēnpǔ (毛恩普, born May 22, 1846, died November 23, 1904), paternal grandfather
* Luó Shì (罗氏), paternal grandmother
* Máo Zǔrén (毛祖人), paternal great-grandfather

===Wives===
[[File:Mao Jiang Qing and daughter Li Na.jpg|thumb|200px|Mao with [[Jiang Qing]] and daughter [[Li Na (daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Na]], 1940s]]
Mao Zedong had four wives who provided a total of 10 children. These were:
# [[Luo Yixiu]] (罗一秀, October 20, 1889 – 1910) of [[Shaoshan]]: married 1907 to 1910
# [[Yang Kaihui]] (杨开慧, 1901–1930) of [[Changsha]]: married 1921 to 1927, executed by the KMT in 1930; mother to Mao Anying, Mao Anqing, and Mao Anlong
# [[He Zizhen]] (贺子珍, 1910–1984) of Jiangxi: married May 1928 to 1939; mother to Mao Anhong, [[Li Min (politician)|Li Min]], and four other children
# [[Jiang Qing]]: (江青, 1914–1991), married 1939 to Mao's death; mother to [[Li Na (daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Na]]

===Siblings===
He had several siblings:
* [[Mao Zemin]] (毛泽民, 1895–1943), younger brother, executed by a warlord
* [[Mao Zetan]] (毛泽覃, 1905–1935), younger brother, executed by the KMT
* [[Mao Zejian]] (毛泽建, 1905–1929), adopted sister, executed by the KMT

:Mao Zedong's parents altogether had five sons and two daughters. Two of the sons and both daughters died young, leaving the three brothers Mao Zedong, Mao Zemin, and Mao Zetan. Like all three of Mao Zedong's wives, Mao Zemin and Mao Zetan were communists. Like Yang Kaihui, both Zemin and Zetan were killed in warfare during Mao Zedong's lifetime.
Note that the character ''zé'' (泽) appears in all of the siblings' given names. This is a common Chinese naming convention.

From the next generation, Zemin's son, [[Mao Yuanxin]], was raised by Mao Zedong's family. He became Mao Zedong's liaison with the Politburo in 1975. Sources like Li Zhisui (''[[The Private Life of Chairman Mao]]'') say that he played a role in the final power-struggles.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketches'' in ''[[The Private Life of Chairman Mao]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Mao Zedong had a total of ten children,&lt;ref name=Spence&gt;Jonathan Spence.  ''Mao Zedong''.  Penguin Lives, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* [[Mao Anying]] (毛岸英, 1922–1950): son to Yang, married to Liú Sīqí (刘思齐), who was born Liú Sōnglín (刘松林), [[killed in action]] during the [[Korean War]]
* [[Mao Anqing]] (毛岸青, 1923–2007): son to Yang, married to [[Shao Hua]] (邵华), grandson [[Mao Xinyu]] (毛新宇), great-grandson Mao Dongdong
* Mao Anlong (1927–1931): son to Yang, died during the [[Chinese Civil War]]
* Mao Anhong (b. 1932): son to He, left to Mao's younger brother [[Mao Zetan|Zetan]] and then to one of Zetan's guards when he went off to war, was never heard of again
* [[Li Min (politician)|Li Min]] (李敏, b. 1936): daughter to He, married to Kǒng Lìnghuá (孔令华), son Kǒng Jìníng (孔继宁), daughter Kǒng Dōngméi (孔冬梅)
* [[Li Na (Daughter of Mao Zedong)|Li Na]] (李讷, Pinyin: Lĭ Nà, b. 1940): daughter to Jiang (whose birth given name was Li, a name also used by Mao while evading the KMT), married to Wáng Jǐngqīng (王景清), son Wáng Xiàozhī (王效芝)

Mao's first and second daughters were left to local villagers because it was too dangerous to raise them while fighting the [[Kuomintang]] and later the Japanese. Their youngest daughter (born in early 1938 in Moscow after Mao separated) and one other child (born 1933) died in infancy.  Two English researchers who retraced the entire Long March route in 2002–2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/23/content_283948.htm|title= Stepping into history|work=China Daily|date=November 23, 2003|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; located a woman whom they believe might well be one of the missing children abandoned by Mao to peasants in 1935. Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwen hope a member of the Mao family will respond to requests for a DNA test.&lt;ref&gt;''The Long March'', by Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwen. Constable 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mao's private life was very secretive at the time of his rule. However, after Mao's death, his personal physician [[Li Zhisui]] published [[The Private Life of Chairman Mao|a memoir which mentions some aspects of Mao's private life]], such as chain-smoking cigarettes, rare bathing or dental habits, laziness, addiction to sleeping pills and large number of sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Private Life of Chairman Mao: The Memoirs of Mao's Personal Physician | last = Li | first = Zhisui  | publisher=Random House. | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-7011-4018-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having grown up in [[Hunan]], Mao spoke [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with a heavy [[Xiang Chinese]] accent that is very pronounced on recordings of his speeches.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Journalist [[Clare Hollingworth]] noted that Mao was proud of his &quot;peasant ways and manners&quot;, having a strong Hunanese accent and providing &quot;earthy&quot; comments on sexual matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollingworth 29-30&quot;&gt;[[#Hol85|Hollingworth 1985]]. pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, historian Lee Feigon noted that Mao's &quot;earthiness&quot; meant that he remained connected to &quot;everyday Chinese life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fei02|Feigon 2002]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Peter Carter noted that throughout his life, Mao had the ability to gain people's trust, and that as such he gathered around him &quot;an extraordinarily wide range of friends&quot; in his early years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car76|Carter 1976]]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and calligraphy==
[[File:Baidi Mao.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Mao's [[calligraphy]]: A bronze plaque of a poem by [[Li Bai]]. ({{zh|c=白帝城毛泽东手书李白诗铜匾 }}]]

Mao was a prolific writer of political and philosophical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/themes/mao-thought.php |title=Mao Zedong Thought – Part 1 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the attributed author of ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao|Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung]]'', known in the West as the &quot;Little Red Book&quot; and in Cultural Revolution China as the &quot;Red Treasure Book&quot; (红宝书): this is a collection of short extracts from his speeches and articles, edited by [[Lin Biao]] and ordered topically. Mao wrote several other philosophical treatises, both before and after he assumed power. These include:
* ''[[On Guerrilla Warfare]]'' (《游击战》); 1937
* ''[[On Practice]]'' (《实践论》); 1937
* ''[[On Contradiction]]'' (《矛盾论》); 1937
* ''[[On Protracted War]]'' (《论持久战》); 1938
* ''[[Norman Bethune#Legacy|In Memory of Norman Bethune]]'' (《纪念白求恩》); 1939
* ''On [[New Democracy]]'' (《新民主主义论》); 1940
* ''[[Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art]]'' (《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》); 1942
* ''[[Serve the People]]'' (《为人民服务》); 1944
* ''The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains'' (《愚公移山》); 1945
