'''Individualist anarchism''' refers to several traditions of thought within the [[anarchist]] movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and his or her [[will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. &quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of [[individualism|individualistic]] philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. Thereafter, it expanded through [[European individualist anarchism|Europe]] and the [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|United States]]. [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], a famous 19th century individualist anarchist, held that &quot;if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Benjamin R.

==Overview==
[[File:Liberty OldPeriodical.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|''[[Liberty (1881–1908)]]'', US individualist anarchist publication edited by Benjamin Tucker]]Among the early influences on individualist anarchism were [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=godwinsep&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]] ([[transcendentalism]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;thoreau&quot;&gt;&quot;Paralelamente, al otro lado del atlántico, en el diferente contexto de una nación a medio hacer, los Estados Unidos, otros filósofos elaboraron un pensamiento individualista similar, aunque con sus propias especificidades. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren]] (&quot;[[sovereignty of the individual]]&quot;), [[Lysander Spooner]] (&quot;[[natural law]]&quot;), [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] ([[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]), [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]],&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]], ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]] (&quot;[[law of equal liberty]]&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeden, Micheal pp. 313-314&quot;&gt;Freeden, Micheal. Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-829414-X. pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Stirner]] ([[Egoist anarchism|egoism]]).&lt;ref name=stirnersep&gt;{{sep entry|max-stirner|Max Stirner|David Leopold|2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are:

1. The concentration on the [[individual]] and his/her will in preference to any construction such as [[morality]], [[ideology]], social custom, [[religion]], metaphysics, [[Invention|ideas]] or the will of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;individualism&quot;&gt;&quot;En la vida de todo único, todo vínculo, independientemente de la forma en que éste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condición de persona libre. Ello supone dos consecuencias; la libertad se mantendrá al margen de toda categoría moral. Este último concepto quedará al margen del vocabulario estirneriano, puesto que tanto ética como moral serán dos conceptos absolutos que, como tales, no pueden situarse por encima de la voluntad individual. La libertad se vive siempre al margen de cualquier condicionamiento material o espiritual, &quot;más allá del bien y del mal&quot; como enunciará Nietzsche en una de sus principales obras. Las creencias colectivas, los prejuicios compartidos, los convencionalismos sociales serán, pues, objeto de destrucción.&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;Voluntary non-submission. Spanish individualist anarchism during dictatorship and the second republic (1923–1938)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;individualism2&quot;&gt;&quot;Stirner himself, however, has no truck with &quot;higher beings.&quot; Indeed, with the aim of concerning himself purely with his own interests, he attacks all &quot;higher beings,&quot; regarding them as a variety of what he calls &quot;spooks,&quot; or ideas to which individuals sacrifice themselves and by which they are dominated. First amongst these is the abstraction &quot;Man&quot;, into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, &quot;liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God . . . it sets me beneath Man.&quot; Indeed, he &quot;who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.&quot; [p. 176 and p.79] Among the many &quot;spooks&quot; Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner's critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism.&quot;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 &quot;G.6 What are the ideas of Max Stirner&quot; in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The rejection of or reservations about the idea of [[revolution]], seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead they favor more [[evolutionary]] methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about [[immediatism|today]].&lt;ref name=&quot;evolutionary&quot;&gt;&quot;The first is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks, unions, communes, etc.. Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists' use of direct action to create revolutionary situations.&quot;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3#seca31 &quot;A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?&quot; in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution2&quot;&gt;&quot;Toda revolución, pues, hecha en nombre de principios abstractos como igualdad, fraternidad, libertad o humanidad, persigue el mismo fin; anular la voluntad y soberanía del individuo, para así poderlo dominar.&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also because it is not seen as desirable for individuals to wait for revolution to start experiencing alternative experiences outside what is offered in the current social system.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalists&quot;&gt;&quot;The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s... and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War... were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital. The illegalist comrades were tired of waiting for the revolution. The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;propaganda by the deed&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;individual reappropriation&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary , invitations to revolt.&quot;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm THE &quot;ILLEGALISTS&quot; by Doug Imrie]&lt;/ref&gt;

3. The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one's own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended [[Union of egoists|associations of egoists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;association&quot;&gt;Finalmente, y este es un tema poco resuelto por el filósofo bávaro, resulta evidente que, a pesar de todo culto a la soberanía individual, es necesario y deseable que los individuos cooperen. Pero el peligro de la asociación conlleva la reproducción, an escala diferente, de una sociedad, y es evidente que en este contexto, los individuos deban renunciar a buena parte de su soberanía. Stirner propone &quot;uniones de egoístas&quot;, formadas por individuos libres que pueden unirse episódicamente para colaborar, pero evitando la estabilidad o la permanencia.&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf La insumisión voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda república (1923–1938)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;association2&quot;&gt;&quot;The unions Stirner desires would be based on free agreement, being spontaneous and voluntary associations drawn together out of the mutual interests of those involved, who would &quot;care best for their welfare if they unite with others.&quot; [p.&amp;nbsp;309] The unions, unlike the state, exist to ensure what Stirner calls &quot;intercourse,&quot; or &quot;union&quot; between individuals. To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual's self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, &quot;intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals.&quot; [p.&amp;nbsp;218] Its aim is &quot;pleasure&quot; and &quot;self-enjoyment.&quot; Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:

:&quot;But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist?... The person who loves a human being is, by virtue of that love, a wealthier man that someone else who loves no one.&quot; [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 23]&quot;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secG6.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:43:10  What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized.

[[Egoist anarchism|The egoist form of individualist anarchism]], derived from the [[philosophy of Max Stirner]], supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases – taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller |first=David |title=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought |year=1987 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=11|isbn=0631227814}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Stirner, rights were ''[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]'' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;– he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…&quot; From ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', quoted in {{cite book|last=Ossar |first=Michael |year=1980 |title=Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |page=27|isbn=0873953932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw &quot;associations of egoists&quot; drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|last=Woodcock |first=George |year=2004 |title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements |publisher=Broadview Press |page=20|isbn=0140206221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, [[american individualist anarchism]] &quot;stresses the isolation of the individual—his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is &quot;[[aesthetic]]&quot; anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the [[transcendentalism]], [[humanitarianism]], and [[romanticism]] of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''NATIVE AMERICAN ANARCHISM  A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster]&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account &quot;the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society...the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs.&quot; and so &quot;Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of [[artisan]]al [[socialism]]... while [[communist anarchism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]] are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 &quot;G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?&quot; in ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:L'anarchie (1907).png|thumb|right|''[[L'Anarchie]]'', [[French language|French]] [[individualist anarchist]] journal established in April 1905 by [[Albert Libertad]].]]
In [[European individualist anarchism]] a different social context helped the rise of European individualist [[illegalism]] and as such &quot;The illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive  nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of  dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation  through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid  conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.archive.org/download/bonnot_gang/bonnotgangfull.pdf Richard Parry. ''The Bonnot Gang: The Story of the French Illegalists'']&lt;/ref&gt; And so a European tendency of individualist anarchism advocated violent individual acts of [[individual reclamation]], [[propaganda by the deed]] and criticism of organization. Such individualist anarchist tendencies include French [[illegalism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;The Illegalists&quot;&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm The &quot;Illegalists&quot;], by Doug Imrie (published by [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15&quot;&gt;Parry, Richard. The Bonnot Gang. Rebel Press, 1987. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian anti-organizational [[Insurrectionary anarchism#19th century|insurrectionarism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports the incident in which the important Italian [[social anarchist]] [[Errico Malatesta]] became involved &quot;in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant.&quot; Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th &quot;it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted &quot;amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;/&gt;
As such [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who &quot;expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bohemian individualism&quot;&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 &quot;2. Individualist Anarchism and Reaction&quot; in Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism – An Unbridgeable Chasm]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way [[free love]]&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt; currents and other radical lifestyles such as [[naturism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo&quot;/&gt; had popularity among individualist anarchists.

For Catalan historian [[Xavier Diez]], individualist anarchism &quot;under its [[iconoclastic]], antiintelectual, [[antitheist]] run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or values it entailed, a philosophy of life which could be considered a reaction against the sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of [[Nationalism|nation]], it opposed its [[Cosmopolitanism|internationalism]]. Against the exaltation of authority embodied in the [[military]] intitution, it opposed its [[antimilitarism]]. Against the concept of [[industrial civilization]], it opposed its [[naturist]] vision&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.tesisenxarxa.net/TESIS_UdG/AVAILABLE/TDX...//txdr1de2.pdf Xavier Diez. L'anarquisme Individualista a Espanya 1923–1938]&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to economic questions, there are diverse positions. There are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] (Proudhon, [[Émile Armand]], early [[Benjamin Tucker]]), [[Egoist anarchism|egoist]]ic disrespect for &quot;ghosts&quot; such as private property and markets (Stirner, [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]], later Tucker), and adherents to [[anarcho-communism]] ([[Albert Libertad]], [[illegalism]], [[Renzo Novatore]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.htm ''Towards the creative nothing''] by [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] finds a tendency in individualist anarchism of a &quot;distrust (of) all co-operation beyond the barest minimum for an [[Simple living|ascetic life]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of violence opinions have gone from a violentist point of view mainly exemplified by [[illegalism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]] to one that can be called [[anarcho-pacifist]]. In the particular case of Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], he went from illegalist practice in his youth&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Selon l’historien Vladimir Muñoz, son véritable nom aurait été Miguel Ramos Giménez et il aurait participé au début du 20è siècle aux groupes illégalistes.&quot;[http://militants-anarchistes.info/spip.php?article2199&amp;lang=fr &quot;GIMÉNEZ IGUALADA, Miguel&quot; at Diccionaire International des Militants Anarchistes]&lt;/ref&gt; towards a pacifist position later in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Igualada argued for an anarchism that was &quot;pacifist, poetic, which creates goodness, harmony and beauty, which cultivates a healthy sense of living in peace, sign of power and fertility...from there anyone which is un-harmonious (violent-warrior), everyone that will pretend, in any form, to dominate anyone of his similars, is not an anarchist, since the anarchist respects in such a way personal integrity, so that he could not make anyone a slave of his thoughts so as to turn him into an instrument of his, a man-tool.&quot;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in ''[[Political Justice]]'' that &quot;everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil.&quot;&lt;ref name=godwineb/&gt; The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good.

Godwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as &quot;the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry.&quot;&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. ''[[gift economy]]''). Thus, while people have the right to private property, they ''should'' give it away as enlightened [[altruists]]. This was to be based on [[utilitarian]] principles; he said: &quot;Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated.&quot;&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual &quot;private judgement.&quot; He did not advocate a community of goods or assert collective ownership as is embraced in [[communism]], but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of [[anarchist communism]].

Godwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence; writers of the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'', organ of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist;&lt;ref name=&quot;Godwin&quot;&gt;&quot;William Godwin, Shelly and Communism&quot; by ALB, The Socialist Standard&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarcho-capitalist]] [[Murray Rothbard]] did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the &quot;founder of [[communist anarchism]]&quot;;&lt;ref name=rothbard/burke&gt;Rothbard, Murray. &quot;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html Edmund Burke, Anarchist].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and historian [[Albert Weisbord]] considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;conquest8&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[William Godwin]]'s influenced &quot;the socialism of [[Robert Owen]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was [[Josiah Warren]] (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini. &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''History of Economics Review'', No.31 Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists; in the 1840s and 1850s, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]],&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his &quot;Bank of the People&quot;] (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William B. Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the [[United States]]. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin R. Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., &quot;On Picket Duty&quot;, ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881–1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online
pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former &quot;possession&quot; and the latter &quot;property.&quot; For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.

Proudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of [[anarchist-communism]], with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot; An individualist rather than [[anarchist communist]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton 1995 79&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Faguet 1970 147&quot;/&gt; Proudhon said that &quot;communism...is the very denial of society in its foundation...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism''. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). ISBN 1-4264-0908-7 pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and famously declared that &quot;[[property is theft]]!&quot; in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.

After Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists, who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon, and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]], while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. &quot;Mutualism.&quot; The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying &quot;the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 22.&lt;br /&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;br /&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: &quot;... I never meant to ... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Solution of the Social Problem'', 1848–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proudhonpropietat.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''[[What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government by Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]'' by [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]]]Insofar as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support [[market]]s and [[private property]] in the product of labor.  However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called &quot;possession.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee.

Mutualists, following Proudhon, originally considered themselves to be libertarian socialists.  However, &quot;some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term &quot;socialist.&quot; But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the [[libertarian right]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mutualist.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists?]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists have distinguished themselves from [[state socialism]], and don't advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon, that &quot;though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, [[Proudhon]] aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few...by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin, ''State Socialism and Anarchism,'' [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html State Socialism and Anarchism]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Max Stirner===
{{Main|Max Stirner}}
[[Image:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Stirner]]. Portrait by [[Friedrich Engels]].]]Johann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the ''[[nom de plume]]'' he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in [[German language|German]] 'Stirn'), was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]], who ranks as one of the literary fathers of [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]], especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, which translates literally as ''The Only One and his Property''). This work was first published in 1844 in [[Leipzig]], and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.

[[Max Stirner]]'s philosophy, sometimes called &quot;egoism,&quot; is a form of individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=David Goodway|last=Goodway |first=David |title=Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2006 |page=99|isbn=1846310261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Stirner was a [[Young Hegelians|Hegelian]] philosopher whose &quot;name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; In 1844, his ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (''Der Einzige and sein Eigentum'' which may literally be translated as ''The Unique Individual and His Property'')&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas.

Cambridge University Press. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; was published, which is considered to be &quot;a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one's autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one's interests.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to &quot;a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling,&quot; saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather &quot;lives themselves out&quot; without regard to &quot;how well or ill humanity may fare thereby.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is that individual's power to obtain what he desires.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society—were mere ''spooks'' in the mind. Stirner wants to &quot;abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [[Egoist anarchism#Union of Egoists|Unions of Egoists]], non-systematic associations, which Stirner proposed in as a form of organization in place of the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = [[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]] | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0710206852 |pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will.&lt;ref name=woodcock20/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nonserviam&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13 |title=The union of egoists |journal=Non Serviam |volume=1 |first=Svein Olav |last=Nyberg |pages=13–14 |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg |oclc=47758413 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even murder is permissible &quot;if it is right for me,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas.

For Stirner, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot; He says, &quot;I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of &quot;egoistic property&quot; not only a lack of moral restraint on how own obtains and uses ''things'', but includes other people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; His embrace of [[egotism|egoism]] is in stark contrast to Godwin's [[altruism]]. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual.

This position on property is much different from the native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor&lt;ref&gt;Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. 1997. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and trade. However, in 1886 Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, &quot;with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

[[File:Ein1844v2.png|200px|thumb|right|''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' by [[Max Stirner]]]]In Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as [[Lev Chernyi]], as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.&lt;ref name=levy&gt;Levy, Carl. &quot;[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_1/Anarchism.html Anarchism]&quot;.

Though Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. &quot;For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management&quot; discusses Stirner and speaks of a &quot;communist egoism,&quot; which is said to be a &quot;synthesis of individualism and collectivism,&quot; and says that &quot;greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For Ourselves, [http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm] ''The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of libertarian communism such as [[Situationist International|Situationism]] are influenced by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-communist [[Emma Goldman]] was influenced by both Stirner and [[Peter Kropotkin]] and blended their philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as ''Anarchism And Other Essays''.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren was a follower of [[Robert Owen]] and joined Owen's community at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. Josiah Warren termed the phrase &quot;[[Cost the limit of price]],&quot; with &quot;cost&quot; here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A watch has a ''cost'' and a ''value''.

The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. These included &quot;[[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]]&quot; and &quot;[[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]].&quot; Warren said that [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]' ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]] but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,&lt;ref name=&quot;thoreau&quot;/&gt; [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle&lt;ref name=thoreau/&gt; and [[self-sufficiency]] were Thoreau's goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. &quot;Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]] this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo&quot;/&gt;

The essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with [[slavery]] and the [[Mexican-American War]]. The essay later influenced [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Martin Buber]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] through its advocacy of [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence RESISTING THE NATION STATE the pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the main precedent for [[anarcho-pacifism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;/&gt; The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the [[non-aggression principle]] and [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madison, Charles A. |year=1945 |title=Anarchism in the United States |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=46–66 |doi=10.2307/2707055 |jstor=2707055 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individualist anarchists, such as Thoreau,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ellwood.

===Free Love, anarcha-feminism and LGBT issues===

[[Image:Lucifer, The Light-Bearer.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'', an influential American free love journal]]An important current within individualist anarchism is [[free love]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]]&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|''The Word'']]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; Later [[John William Lloyd]], a collaborator of [[Benjamin Tucker]]´s periodical ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', published in 1931 a sex manual that he called ''The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reuniting.info/karezza_method_lloyd &quot;The Karezza Method&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Émile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf E. Armand and &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot;. Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy]&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In France, there was also feminist activity inside individualist anarchism as promoted by individualist feminists Marie Küge, Anna Mahé, [[Rirette Maitrejean]], and Sophia Zaïkovska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://endehors.org/news/individualisme-anarchiste-et-feminisme-a-la-belle-epoque &quot;Individualisme anarchiste et féminisme à la « Belle Epoque »&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazil]]ian [[individualist anarchist]] [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] lectured on topics such as education, [[women's rights]], [[free love]], and [[antimilitarism]]. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nodo50.org&quot;&gt;http://www.nodo50.org/insurgentes/textos/mulher/09marialacerda.htm &quot;Maria Lacerda de Moura – Uma Anarquista Individualista Brasileira&quot; by&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote for the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Al Margen'' alongside [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada, al escritor Gonzalo Vidal, u otros habituales de la prensa individualista como Costa Iscar, Mariano Gallardo o la periodista brasileña Maria Lacerda de Moura.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering [[campaigners]] for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]].

=== Freethought ===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in both North American and European individualist anarchism.

In the United States &quot;freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf [[Wendy McElroy]]. &quot;The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

In Europe a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. &quot;Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)''  Virus Editorial. 2007. pg. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' &quot;there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain [[atheist]] and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez.

===Anarcho-naturism===
{{Main|Naturism|anarcho-naturism}}
[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|180px|thumb|right|''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Influential early [[eco-anarchist]] work]]Another important current, especially within French and Spanish&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo&quot;&gt;&quot;Proliferarán así diversos grupos que practicarán el excursionismo, el naturismo, el nudismo, la emancipación sexual o el esperantismo, alrededor de asociaciones informales vinculadas de una manera o de otra al anarquismo. Precisamente las limitaciones a las asociaciones obreras impuestas desde la legislación especial de la Dictadura potenciarán indirectamente esta especie de asociacionismo informal en que confluirá el movimiento anarquista con esta heterogeneidad de prácticas y tendencias. Uno de los grupos más destacados, que será el impulsor de la revista individualista ''[[Iniciales|Ética]]'' será el Ateneo Naturista Ecléctico, con sede en Barcelona, con sus diferentes secciones la más destacada de las cuales será el grupo excursionista Sol y Vida.&quot;[http://www.nodo50.org/ekintza/article.php3?id_article=310 http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;La insumisión voluntaria: El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923–1938)&quot; by Xavier Díez&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism and the different Naturist views have always been related.&quot;[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html &quot;Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism&quot; by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid.

Winter 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; individualist anarchist groups was [[naturism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;From the 1880s, anarcho-individualist publications and teachings promoted the social emancipatory function of naturism and denounced deforestation, mechanization, civilization, and urbanization as corrupting effects of the consolidating industrial-capitalist order.&quot; [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2011_toclevel_ss1-10 &quot;Naturism&quot; by Stefano Boni in The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest Edited by Immanuel Ness. Wiley-Blackwell. 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small [[ecovillage]]s, and most prominently [[nudism]] as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial [[mass society]] of modernity. Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and avoided, and tried to eliminate, social determinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo&quot;&gt;&quot;el individuo es visto en su dimensión biológica -física y psíquica- dejándose la social.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890–1939)&quot; by Josep Maria Rosell&lt;/ref&gt; An early influence in this vein was [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his famous book ''[[Walden]]''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea de que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural.&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;La insumisión voluntaria: El anarquismo individualista español durante la Dictadura y la Segunda República (1923–1938)&quot; by Xavier Díez]&lt;/ref&gt; Important promoters of this were [[Henri Zisly]] and [[Emile Gravelle]] who collaborated in ''La Nouvelle Humanité'' followed by ''Le Naturien'', ''Le Sauvage'', ''L'Ordre Naturel'', &amp; ''La Vie Naturelle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo2&quot;&gt;

This relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html &quot;Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism&quot; by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid. Published on Revista ''ADN''. Winter 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The linking role played by the ‘Sol y Vida’ group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, ‘Ecléctico’, in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First ''Etica'' and then ''[[Iniciales]]'', which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the [[Spanish Civil War]]. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ‘Iniciales’ He writes it under the odd pseudonym of ‘silvestre del campo’, (wild man in the country). &quot;I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo.org&quot;/&gt; &quot;The relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of [[Han Ryner]]) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, ([[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]])&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo.org&quot;/&gt;

=== Individualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche ===
{{See also|Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche#Individualist anarchism}}
The thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been influential in individualist anarchism specifically in thinkers such as the French [[Émile Armand]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The life of Émile Armand (1872–1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson. Later in life, Nietzsche and Stirner became important to his way of thinking.&quot;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emile_Armand__The_Anarchism_of_Emile_Armand.html Introduction to ''The Anarchism of Émile Armand'' by [[Émile Armand]]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Renzo Novatore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;novatore&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html ''Toward the Creative Nothing'' by [[Renzo Novatore]]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Colombian [[Biofilo Panclasta]], and also &quot;translations of Nietzsche's writings in the United States very likely appeared first in ''Liberty'', the anarchist journal edited by [[Benjamin Tucker]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ Robert C.

==== American mutualism and individualist utopianism====
[[File:Stephen Pearl Andrews.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]]]For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster &quot;It is apparent...that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]...[[William B. Greene]] presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;againstallauthority.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Batchelder Greene]] (1819–1878) is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking''(1850), which proposed an interest-free banking system, and ''Transcendentalism'', a critique of the [[Trancendentalism|New England philosophical school]]. He saw mutualism as the synthesis of &quot;liberty and order.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;againstallauthority.org&quot;/&gt; His &quot;associationism...is checked by individualism...&quot;Mind your own business,&quot; &quot;Judge not that ye be not judged.&quot; Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands &quot;mutuality&quot; in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;againstallauthority.org&quot;/&gt;

Contemporary American anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] reports that &quot;[[Stephen Pearl Andrews|Steven Pearl Andrews]]...was not a fourierist (see [[Charles Fourier]]), but he lived through the brief craze for [[Phalansterium|phalansteries]] in America &amp; adopted a lot of fourierist principles &amp; practices...a maker of worlds out of words. He syncretized [[Abolitionism]], [[Free Love]], spiritual universalism, [[Josiah Warren|(Josiah) Warren]], &amp; [[Charles Fourier|(Charles) Fourier]] into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy...He was instrumental in founding several “intentional communities,” including the “Brownstone Utopia” on 14th St. in New York, &amp; “[[Modern Times (intentional community)|Modern Times]]” in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known [[Fourierism|fourierist]] communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts &amp; the North American Phalanx in New Jersey) — in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for “[[Free Love]]”) &amp; finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity. Andrews (&amp; [[Victoria Woodhull]]) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the [[1st International]], expelled by [[Marx]] for its anarchist, feminist, &amp; spiritualist tendencies. &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;/&gt;

====The &quot;Boston Anarchists&quot;====
[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lysander Spooner]]]]Another form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States, as advocated by the &quot;Boston anarchists.&quot;&lt;ref name=levy /&gt; By default, American individualists had no difficulty accepting the concepts that &quot;one man employ another&quot; or that &quot;he direct him,&quot; in his labor but rather demanded that &quot;all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Madison, Charles A. &quot;Anarchism in the United States.&quot; ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol 6, No 1, January 1945, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voltairine de Cleyre]], summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists &quot;are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;de Cleyre, Voltairine.

Some &quot;Boston anarchists&quot;, including Benjamin Tucker, identified themselves as &quot;[[socialist]]s&quot;, which in the 19th century was often used in the sense of a commitment to improving conditions of the working class (i.e. &quot;[[the labor problem]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. 1994.

==== American individualist anarchism and the labor movement ====
[[File:Dyer D Lum.jpg||right|thumb|180px|[[Dyer Lum]]]]Two individualist anarchists who wrote in [[Benjamin Tucker]]´s ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]'' were also important labor organizers of the time. [[Joseph Labadie]] (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist, and poet. In 1883 Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with &quot;the great natural laws...without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes.&quot; However, he supported community cooperation, as he supported community control of water utilities, streets, and railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, James J. (1970). ''Men Against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America, 1827–1908.'' Colorado Springs: Ralph Myles Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the [[Haymarket Riot|Haymarket anarchists]], he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetators.

====American egoism====
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]Some of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], abandoned natural rights positions and converted to [[Max Stirner]]'s [[Egoist anarchism]]. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, &quot;the right of might&quot; and &quot;the right of contract.&quot; He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, &quot;In times past...it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off....Man's only right to land is his might over it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;layout=html#chapter_100896 Wendy Mcelroy. &quot;Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Several periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism. They included: ''I'' published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of ''Liberty''); ''The Ego'' and ''The Egoist'', both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''Der Eigene'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]], and ''The Eagle'' and ''The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology{{'&quot;}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcelroy&quot;&gt;McElroy, Wendy. [http://libertariannation.org/a/f62m1.html A Reconsideration of Trial by Jury], ''Forumulations'', Winter 1998–1999, Free Nation Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

American anarchists who adhered to egoism include [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[James L. Walker]] and [[Victor Yarros]] and [[E.H. Fulton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcelroy&quot;/&gt; John Beverley Robinson wrote an essay called &quot;Egoism&quot; in which he states that &quot;Modern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and [[Nietzsche]], and expounded by [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/John_Beverley_Robinson__Egoism.html &quot;Egoism&quot; by [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Individualist anarchism#Italy|Italian anti-organizationalist individualist anarchism]] was brought to the United States&lt;ref&gt;&quot;it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy.&quot; [http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; by Italian born individualists such as [[Giuseppe Ciancabilla]] and others who advocated for violent [[propaganda by the deed]] there. Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports the incident in which the important Italian [[social anarchist]] [[Errico Malatesta]] became involved &quot;in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enrico Arrigoni]] (pseudonym: Frank Brand) was an [[Italian American]] [[individualist anarchist]] Lathe operator, house painter, bricklayer, dramatist and political activist influenced by the work of [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;recollectionbooks.com&quot;&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm#EnricoArrigoni Enrico Arrigoni at the Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8z8mdUYp-6gC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=enrico+arrigoni+totalitarian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cWwnaU_6sG&amp;sig=Nc944GY6DvsWr0vHpVKcJd6z_Kw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_p4KTovsE8Tq0gGNrJGTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=enrico%20arrigoni%20totalitarian&amp;f=true [[Paul Avrich]].

====Anarcho-capitalism====
[[Image:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|right|(Rothbard circa 1955).]]
{{Main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
19th century individualist anarchists espoused the [[labor theory of value]]. Some believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th century American individualist anarchists: &quot;Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as [[anarcho-capitalists]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;outhwaite&quot;&gt;Outhwaite, William. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, Anarchism entry, [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2003, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of [[classical economics]] was superseded by the [[subjective theory of value]] of [[neo-classical economics]]. 

[[Murray Rothbard]], a student of [[Ludwig von Mises]], combined the [[Austrian school]] economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that &quot;we are not anarchists...but not archists either...Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist,&quot; concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard167.html Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'?]. ''LewRockwell.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rothbard later chose the term &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; for his philosophy and referred to himself as an anarchist.

=====Agorism=====
{{Main|Agorism}}
Agorism is a radical [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]]{{Ref label|D|δ|none}} form of anarchism, developed from anarcho-capitalism in the late 20th-century by [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] (a.k.a. SEK3). The goal of agorists is a society in which all &quot;[[Voluntaryism|relations between people are voluntary exchanges]] – a [[free market]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newlibman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Konkin III |first=Samuel Edward |authorlink=Samuel Edward Konkin III |title=New Libertarian Manifesto |publisher=KoPubCo |url=http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/new_libertarian_manifesto.pdf |format=PDF|year=2006 |isbn=0977764923 |origyear=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agorists are [[market anarchism|market anarchists]]. Most Agorists consider that property rights are [[natural right]]s deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement. However, Agorists are divided on the question of [[intellectual property]] rights.{{Ref label|E|δ|none}}

==== Post-left anarchy and insurrectionary anarchism ====
{{Main|Lifestyle anarchism|Post-left anarchy|Insurrectionary anarchism}}
[[Murray Bookchin]] has identified [[post-left anarchy]] as a form of individualist anarchism in ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'' where he identifies &quot;a shift among Euro-American anarchists away from social anarchism and toward individualist or lifestyle anarchism. Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist [[nihilism]], antirationalism, neo-[[anarchoprimitivism|primitivism]], anti-technologism, neo-[[Situationist International|Situationist]] 'cultural terrorism', mysticism, and a 'practice' of staging [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] 'personal insurrections'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm'' by [[Murray Bookchin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Post-left anarchist [[Bob Black]] in his long critique of Bookchin's philosophy called ''Anarchy after leftism'' said about post-left anarchy that &quot;It is, unlike Bookchinism, “individualistic” in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individual — i.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murray — is not the measure of the good society, what is?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Anarchy_after_Leftism.html#toc13 ''Anarchy after Leftism''] by [[Bob Black]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bey hakim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hakim Bey]], contemporary [[egoist anarchism|egoist]] &quot;[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestyle anarchist]]&quot;]]
A strong relationship does exist between post-left anarchism and the work of individualist anarchist [[Max Stirner]]. [[Jason McQuinn]] says that &quot;when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuchuflito&quot;&gt;&quot;What is Ideology?&quot; by [[Jason McQuinn]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Bob Black]] and [[Feral Faun]]/[[Wolfi Landstreicher]] strongly adhere to stirnerist [[egoist anarchism]]. Bob Black has humorously suggested the idea of &quot;marxist stirnerism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;groucho marx&quot;&gt;[http://sniggle.net/Manifesti/groucho.php &quot;Theses on Groucho Marxism&quot; by [[Bob Black]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hakim Bey]] has said &quot;From Stirner's &quot;[[Union of egoists|Union of Self-Owning Ones]]&quot; we proceed to [[Nietzsche]]'s circle of &quot;Free Spirits&quot; and thence to [[Charles Fourier]]'s &quot;Passional Series&quot;, doubling and redoubling ourselves even as the Other multiplies itself in the eros of the group.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.left-bank.org/bey/default3.htm ''Immediatism'' by Hakim Bey. AK Press. 1994. pg. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Bey also wrote that &quot;The Mackay Society, of which Mark &amp; I are active members, is devoted to the anarchism of Max Stirner, [[Benjamin Tucker|Benj. Tucker]] &amp; [[John Henry Mackay]]...The Mackay Society, incidentally, represents a little-known current of individualist thought which never cut its ties with revolutionary labor. [[Dyer Lum]], [[Ezra Heywood|Ezra]] &amp; Angela Haywood represent this school of thought; [[Jo Labadie]], who wrote for Tucker’s ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]'', made himself a link between the American “plumb-line” anarchists, the “philosophical” individualists, &amp; the syndicalist or communist branch of the movement; his influence reached the Mackay Society through his son, Laurance. Like the Italian Stirnerites (who influenced us through our late friend [[Enrico Arrigoni]]) we support all anti-authoritarian currents, despite their apparent contradictions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__An_esoteric_interpretation_of_the_I.W.W._preamble.html Hakim Bey. &quot;An esoteric interpretation of the I.W.W. preamble&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as posterior individualist anarchists, [[Jason McQuinn]] for some time used the pseudonym [[Lev Chernyi]] in honor of the Russian individualist anarchist of the same name while [[Feral Faun]] has quoted Italian individualist anarchist [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfinovatore2&quot;&gt;[http://www.anti-politics.net/feral-faun/whither-now.html Anti-politics.net], &quot;Whither now?

[[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary [[Mutualism (economy)|mutualist]] economist and author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id47.html [[Kevin Carson]].''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'']&lt;/ref&gt; Another important current mutualist is [[Joe Peacott]]. Contemporary mutualists are among those involved in the [[Alliance of the Libertarian Left]] and in the [[Voluntary Cooperation Movement]]. A recent mutualist collective was the Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/polin/polin184.htm &quot;Contemporary Individualist Anarchism: The Broadsides of the Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade 1988–2000&quot; by Joe Peacott, Jim Baker, &amp; Others&lt;/ref&gt;

Egoism has had a strong influence on [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as can be seen in the work of [[Wolfi Landstreicher]]. [[Feral Faun]] wrote in 1995 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the game of insurgence—a lived guerilla war game—it is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them. So I, [[Feral Faun]], became&amp;nbsp;... an anarchist&amp;nbsp;... a writer&amp;nbsp;... a Stirner-influenced, post-[[Situationist International|situationist]], anti-civilization theorist&amp;nbsp;... if not in my own eyes, at least in the eyes of most people who've read my writings.&lt;ref name=&quot;feral faun&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Feral_Faun__Essays.html#toc10 &quot;The Last Word&quot; by Feral Faun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;Parallel to the social, [[collectivist]] anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individual freedom and advised other individuals to do the same. Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to [[authoritarian]] society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet.&quot; Thus [[theft]], [[counterfeiting]], swindling and [[robbery]] became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of [[proletarian]]s. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s ([[Auguste Vaillant]], Ravachol, [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], [[Sante Caserio]]) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War ([[Clément Duval]], Pini, [[Marius Jacob]], the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as [[Albert Libertad]], [[André Lorulot]], [[Émile Armand]], [[Victor Serge]], [[Zo d'Axa]] and [[Rirette Maitrejean]], who developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, ''[[L'Anarchie]]''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On the fringe of the movement, and particularly in the individualist faction which became relatively strong after 1900 and began to publish its own sectarian paper, −315- L'Anarchie ( 1905–14), there were groups and individuals who lived largely by crime. Among them were some of the most original as well as some of the most tragic figures in anarchist history.&quot; Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1905. Outside this journal, [[Han Ryner]] wrote ''Petit Manuel individualiste'' (1903). Later appeared the journal [[L'EnDehors]] created by Zo d'Axa in 1891.

[[File:Zo d'Axa portrait.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Zo d'Axa]]]] French individualist anarchists exposed a diversity of positions (per example, about violence and non-violence). For example, Émile Armand rejected [[violence]] and embraced mutualism while becoming an important propagandist for [[free love]], while [[Albert Libertad]] and [[Zo d'Axa]] were influential in violentists circles and championed violent [[propaganda by the deed]] while adhering to [[communitarianism]] or [[anarcho-communism]] &lt;ref name=&quot;libertadcommuniste&quot;&gt;&quot;Libertad était un révolté, qui luttait non en dehors (tel les communautaires/colonies) ni à côté de la société (les éducationnistes), mais en son sein. Il sera énoncé comme une figure de l'anarchisme individualiste, néanmoins, il ne se revendiquera jamais ainsi, même si il ne rejetait pas l'individualisme, et que Libertad se revendiquait du communisme ; plus tard, Mauricius, qui était un des éditeurs du journal &quot;l'Anarchie&quot; dira &quot;Nous ne nous faisions pas d'illusions, nous savions bien que cette libération totale de l'individu dans la société capitaliste était impossible et que la réalisation de sa personnalité ne pourrait se faire que dans une société raisonnable, dont le communisme libertaire nous semblait être la meilleure expression.&quot;. Libertad s'associait à la dynamique de révolte individuelle radicale au projet d'émancipation collective. Il insistait sur la nécessité de développer le sentiment de camaraderie, afin de remplacer la concurrence qui était la morale de la société bourgeoise. &quot;[http://savoir.pingouin.org/index.php/Albert_Libertad &quot;Albert Libertad&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Refusal of work|rejecting work]]. Han Ryner on the other side conciled anarchism with [[stoicism]]. Nevertheless French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. [[Naturism]] and [[free love]] contents started to have a strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt; &quot;Along with feverish activity against the social order, [[Libertad|(Albert) Libertad]] was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the “[[joy of living]]” and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Articles_from__Machete___1.html#toc1 “Machete” #1. &quot;Bonnot and the Evangelists&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist naturism was promoted by [[Henri Zisly]], [[Emile Gravelle]] &lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo2&quot;/&gt; and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist &quot;partisan of the ''[[intentional communities|milieux libres]]'', publisher of &quot;Flambeau&quot; (&quot;an enemy of authority&quot;) in 1901 in Vienna. Most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm &quot;1926 – France: Georges Butaud (1868–1926) dies, in Ermont.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist [[naturism]], the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of &quot;[[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]]&quot; with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in symphathy within some, and a strong rejection within others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;La insumisión voluntaria.

In 2002, an anarchist, Libertad organized a new version of the ''[[L'EnDehors]]'', collaborating with ''[[Green Anarchy]]'' and including several contributors, such as [[Lawrence Jarach]], [[Patrick Mignard]], [[Thierry Lodé]], [[Ron Sakolsky]], and Thomas Slut. Numerous articles about capitalism, human rights, [[free love]] and social fights were published. ''The EnDehors'' continues now as a website, EnDehors.org.

====Illegalism====
{{Main|Illegalism}}
[[File:Band a bonnot desenho.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Caricature of the [[Bonnot gang]] ]]
Illegalism&lt;ref name=&quot;The Illegalists&quot;/&gt; is an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of Stirner's individualist anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;inanrcillegal&quot;&gt;&quot;Parallel to the social, collectivist anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individu�al freedom and advised other individuals to do the same. Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to authoritarian society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet.&quot;Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individual�ists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Émile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of &quot;might&quot; rather than &quot;right&quot;; for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15&quot;/&gt; although some committed crimes as a form of [[propaganda of the deed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Illegalists&quot;/&gt;  The illegalists embraced [[direct action]] and [[propaganda of the deed]].&lt;ref&gt;http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as well as [[Proudhon]] (his view that [[Property is theft!]]), [[Clément Duval]] and [[Marius Jacob]] proposed the theory of la ''reprise individuelle'' (Eng: [[individual reclamation]]) which justified robbery on the rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system.,&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15&quot;/&gt;

Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which [[Ravachol]], [[Émile Henry]], [[Auguste Vaillant]], and [[Sante Geronimo Caserio|Caserio]] committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism,&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalanticap&quot;&gt;&quot;Pre-WWI France was the setting for the only documented anarchist revolutionary movement to embrace all illegal activity as revolutionary practice. Pick-pocketing, theft from the workplace, robbery, confidence scams, desertion from the armed forces, you name it, illegalist activity was praised as a justifiable and necessary aspect of class struggle.&quot;[http://www.defenestrator.org/roblosricos/writings/illegalism.htm &quot;Illegalism&quot; by Rob los Ricos]&lt;/ref&gt; in what is known as [[propaganda of the deed]]. France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

====Italy====
[[File:Novatore.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Renzo Novatore]]]]In Italy individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards [[illegalism]] and violent [[propaganda by the deed]] similar to French individualist anarchism but perhaps more extreme&lt;ref name=&quot;italyindiv&quot;&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarco-individualismolink &quot;anarco-individualismo&quot; in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At this point, encouraged by the disillusionment that followed the breakdown of the general strike, the terrorist individualists who had always – despite Malatesta's influence – survived as a small minority among Italian anarchists, intervened frightfully and tragically.&quot; [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; which emphazised criticism of organization be it anarchist or of other type.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant.&quot; [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect we can consider notorious magnicides carried out or attempted by individualists [[Giovanni Passannante]], [[Sante Caserio]], [[Michele Angiolillo]], [[Luigi Luccheni]], [[Gaetano Bresci]] who murdered king [[Umberto I]]. Caserio lived in France and coexisted within French illegalism and later assassinated French president [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]]. The theoretical seeds of current [[Insurrectionary anarchism]] were already laid out at the end of 19th century Italy in a combination of individualist anarchism criticism of permanent groups and organization with a socialist class struggle worldview.&lt;ref name=&quot;indinss&quot;&gt;&quot;Essa trova soprattutto in America del Nord un notevole seguito per opera del Galleani che esprime una sintesi fra l'istanza puramente individualista di stampo anglosassone e americano (ben espressa negli scritti di Tucker) e quella profondamente socialista del movimento anarchico di lingua italiana. Questa commistione di elementi individualisti e comunisti – che caratterizza bene la corrente antiorganizzatrice – rappresenta lo sforzo di quanti avvertirono in modo estremamente sensibile l'invadente burocratismo che pervadeva il movimento operaio e socialista.&quot;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarchismo_insurrezionale &quot;anarchismo insurrezionale&quot; in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; During the rise of fascism this thought also motivated [[Gino Lucetti]], Michele Schirru and Angelo Sbardellotto in attempting the assassination of [[Benito Mussolini]].

During the early 20th century, the intellectual work of individualist anarchist [[Renzo Novatore]] came to importance; he was influenced by Stirner, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Georges Palante]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in [[futurism]] avant-garde currents. In his thought, he adhered to Stirnerist disrespect for private property, only recognizing property of one's own spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;novatore&quot;&gt;&quot;Novatore non era contrario all'abolizione della proprietà privata, poichè riteneva che l'unica proprietà inviolabile fosse solo quella spirituale ed etica. Il suo pensiero è esplicitato in &quot;Verso il nulla creatore&quot;:

    Bisogna che tutto ciò che si chiama &quot;proprietà materiale&quot;, &quot;proprietà privata&quot;, &quot;proprietà esteriore&quot; diventi per gli individui ciò che è il sole, la luce, il cielo, il mare, le stelle. E ciò avverrà!Avverrà perchè noi – gli iconoclasti – la violenteremo!Solo la ricchezza etica espirituale è invulnerabile. E' vera proprietà dell'individuo. Il resto no! Il resto è vulnerabile! E tutto ciò che è vulnerabile sarà vulnerato.&quot;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Renzo_Novatore &quot;Renzo Novatore&quot; in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal ''Iconoclasta!'' alongside the young [[stirner]]ist [[illegalism|illegalist]] [[Bruno Filippi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfi&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bruno_Filippi__The_rebel_s_dark_laughter__the_writings_of_Bruno_Filippi.html ''The rebel's dark laughter: the writings of Bruno Filippi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The individualist philosopher and poet [[Renzo Novatore]] belonged to the leftist section of the [[avant-garde]] movement of [[Futurism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatore.it/Una_biografia.html Novatore: una biografia]&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other individualist anarcho-futurists such as [[Dante Carnesecchi]], Leda Rafanelli, [[Auro d'Arcola]], and Giovanni Governato. Also there was Pietro Bruzzi who published the journal ''L'Individualista'' in the 1920s alongside Ugo Fedeli and Francesco Ghezzi but who fell to fascist forces later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/gallery/galleryindex.htm#Indivi-dualista &quot;L’Indivi-dualista&quot;�]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ita.anarchopedia.org&quot;&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Pietro_Bruzzi &quot;Pietro Bruzzi&quot; at italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Pietro Bruzzi also collaborated with the [[Italian American]] individualist anarchist publication ''Eresia'' of [[New York City]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ita.anarchopedia.org&quot;/&gt; edited by [[Enrico Arrigoni]].

In Italy in 1945, during the Founding Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]], there was a group of individualist anarchists led by Cesare Zaccaria&lt;ref&gt;http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Storia_del_movimento_libertario_in_Italia &quot;Storia del movimento libertario in Italia&quot; in anarchopedia in Italian&lt;/ref&gt; who was an important anarchist of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/73n6nh Cesare Zaccaria (19 August 1897 – October 1961)
Pier Carlo Masini and Paul Sharkey&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the IX Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] in [[Carrara]] in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the ''Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica''. In the seventies, it was mostly composed of &quot;veteran individualist anarchists with an of [[anarcho-pacifism|pacifism]] orientation, [[anarcho-naturism|naturism]], etc,...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Los anarco-individualistas, G.I.A...Una escisión de la FAI producida en el IX Congreso (Carrara, 1965) se pr odujo cuando un sector de anarquistas de tendencia humanista rechazan la interpretación que ellos juzgan disciplinaria del ''pacto asociativo&quot; clásico, y crean los GIA (Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica) . Esta pequeña federación de grupos, hoy nutrida sobre todo de veteranos anarco-individualistas de orientación pacifista, naturista, etcétera defiende la autonomía personal y rechaza a rajatabla toda forma de intervención en los procesos del sistema, como sería por ejemplo el sindicalismo. Su portavoz es L'Internazionale con sede en Ancona. La escisión de los GIA prefiguraba, en sentido contrario, el gran debate que pronto había de comenzar en el seno del movimiento&quot;[http://www.almeralia.com/bicicleta/bicicleta/ciclo/01/17.htm &quot;El movimiento libertario en Italia&quot; by ''Bicicleta.

In the famous Italian [[insurrectionary anarchist]] essay written by an anonymous writer, &quot;At Daggers Drawn with the Existent, its Defenders and its False Critics&quot;, there reads &quot;The workers who, during a wildcat strike, carried a banner saying, 'We are not asking for anything' understood that the defeat is in the claim itself ('the claim against the enemy is eternal'). There is no alternative but to take everything. As Stirner said: 'No matter how much you give them, they will always ask for more, because what they want is no less than the end of every concession'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ai ferri corti&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Anonymous__At_Daggers_Drawn_with_the_Existent__its_Defenders_and_its_False_Critics.html &quot;At Daggers Drawn with the Existent, its Defenders and its False Critics&quot; by anonymous]&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary imprisoned Italian [[insurrectionary anarchist]] philosopher [[:it:Michele Fabiani#Chi è Michele Fabiani|Michele Fabiani]] writes from an explicit individualist anarchist perspective in such essays as &quot;Critica individualista anarchica alla modernità&quot; (Individualist anarchist critique of modernity)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarchaos.it/?p=184 &quot;Critica individualista anarchica alla modernità&quot; by Michele Fabiani]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horst Fantazzini]] (March 4, 1939 Altenkessel, [[Saarland]], [[West Germany]]–December 24, 2001, [[Bologna]], Italy),&lt;ref name=&quot;Horst Biography&quot;&gt;[http://www.horstfantazzini.net/biography.htm &quot;Horst Biography&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian-German [[individualist anarchist]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;He always considered himself an individualist anarchist.&quot;[http://www.horstfantazzini.net/biography.htm &quot;Horst Biography&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; who pursued an illegalist lifestyle and practice until his death in 2001. He gained media notoriety mainly due to his many bank robberies through Italy and other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horst Biography&quot;/&gt; In 1999 the film ''[[Ormai è fatta!]]'' appeared based on his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177073/ &quot;Ormai è fatta!&quot; (1999) at the IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
While [[Spain]] was influenced by American individualist anarchism, it was more closely related to the French currents. Around the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, [[Ricardo Mella]], [[Federico Urales]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], Mariano Gallardo, and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt; Important in this respect were also magazines such as ''La Idea Libre'', ''[[La revista blanca]]'', ''Etica'', ''[[Iniciales]]'', ''Al margen'', ''Estudios'' and ''Nosotros''. The most influential thinkers there were [[Max Stirner]], [[Émile Armand]] and [[Han Ryner]]. Just as in France, the spread of [[Esperanto]] and [[anationalism]] had importance just as [[naturism]] and [[free love]] currents.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt; Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish invidualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating [[polyamory]] as realization of the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt;

Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of [[anarcho-communist]] groups and by members of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as [[Federico Urales]] and [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] who were members of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923–1938.'' ISBN 978-84-96044-87-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]] wrote the lengthy theory book called ''Anarchism'' espousing his individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/guest8dcd3f/anarquismo-miguel-gimenez-igualada ''Anarquismo'' por [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1937 and February 1938 he was editor of the individualist anarchist magazine ''Nosotros'',&lt;ref name=&quot;spain&quot;&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública (1923–1938) por Xavier Diez]&lt;/ref&gt; in which many works of [[Han Ryner]] and  [[Émile Armand]] appeared. He also participated in the publishing of another individualist anarchist maganize ''Al Margen: Publicación quincenal individualista''.&lt;ref name=&quot;spain2&quot;&gt;&quot;Entre los redactores y colaboradores de Al Margen, que trasladará su redacción a Elda, en Alicante, encontraremos a Miguel Giménez Igualada...[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923–1938) por Xavier Diez]&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he engaged in [[illegalist]] activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.tesisenxarxa.net/TESIS_UdG/AVAILABLE/TDX...//txdr1de2.pdf Xavier Diez.  ''L'ANARQUISME INDIVIDUALISTA A ESPANYA 1923–1938'']&lt;/ref&gt; His thought was deeply influenced by [[Max Stirner]], of which he was the main popularizer in Spain through his own writings. He published and wrote the preface&lt;ref name=&quot;spain&quot;/&gt; to the fourth edition in Spanish of ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' from 1900. He proposed the creation of a ''[[Union of egoists|Union of Egoists]]'', to be a Federation of Individualist Anarchists in Spain, but did not succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;spain2&quot;&gt;&quot;A partir de la década de los treinta, su pensamiento empieza a derivar hacia el individualismo, y como profundo estirneriano tratará de impulsar una federación de individualistas&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf &quot;La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923–1938) por Xavier Diez]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 he published an extensive treatise on Stirner, dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist [[Émile Armand]]&lt;ref name=&quot;kclibertaria.comyr.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l147.pdf &quot;Stirner&quot; por Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he traveled and lived in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;/&gt;

[[Federico Urales]] was an important individualist anarchist who edited ''[[La Revista Blanca]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;/&gt; The individualist anarchism&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;/&gt; of Urales was influenced by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]] and [[Stirner]] for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;/&gt; He was highly critical of [[anarcho-syndicalism]], which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy, and thought that it tended towards reformism.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;/&gt; Instead he favored small groups based on ideological alignement.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;/&gt; He supported and participated in the establishment of the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI)]] in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesisenxarxa.net&quot;/&gt;

====Germany====
[[File:John Henry Mackay.gif|right|thumb|140px|[[John Henry Mackay]]]]In [[Germany]], the Scottish-German [[John Henry McKay]] became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, ''[[Die Anarchisten]]'' and ''[[Der Freiheitsucher]]'', contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker.&lt;ref name=&quot;mckay&quot;&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html &quot;New England Anarchism in Germany&quot; by Thomas A. Riley]&lt;/ref&gt; McKay is also known as an important European early activist for [[Gay]] rights.

Using the [[pseudonym]] '''Sagitta''', Mackay wrote a series of works for [[pederasty|pederastic]] [[emancipation]], titled ''Die Buecher der namenlosen Liebe'' (''Books of the Nameless Love''). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the ''Fenny Skaller'', a story of a pederast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.pacbell.net/hubertk/Strauss.pdf thamyris 02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the same pseudonym he also published fiction, such as ''Holland'' (1924) and a pederastic novel of the [[Berlin]] boy-bars, ''Der Puppenjunge'' (''The Hustler'') (1926).

[[File:Der Eigene - 1896.jpg|left|thumb|140px|''[[Der Eigene]]'' [[stirner]]ist pioneer Gay activist publication]][[Adolf Brand]] (1874–1945) was a [[Germany|German]] [[writer]], [[stirner]]ist [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and pioneering [[campaigner]] for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. Brand published a German [[homosexual]] periodical, ''[[Der Eigene]]'' in 1896. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] had begun a journal called ''Prometheus'' in 1870, but only one issue was published. (Kennedy, Hubert, ''Karl Heinrich Ulrichs: First Theorist of Homosexuality'', In: 'Science and Homosexualities', ed. Vernon Rosario pp. 26–45). New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was taken from writings of egoist philosopher [[Max Stirner]], who had greatly influenced the young Brand, and refers to Stirner's concept of &quot;[[self-ownership]]&quot; of the individual. ''[[Der Eigene]]'' concentrated on cultural and scholarly material, and may have had an average of around 1500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included [[Erich Mühsam]], [[Kurt Hiller]], [[John Henry Mackay]] (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists [[Wilhelm von Gloeden]], [[Fidus]] and [[Sascha Schneider]]. Brand contributed many poems and articles himself. [[Benjamin Tucker]] followed this journal from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German [[Der Eigene]], edited by [[Adolf Brand]]...&quot;http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=796&amp;Itemid=259 &quot;Benjamin Tucker and Liberty: A Bibliographical Essay&quot; by Wendy McElroy&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Der Einzige]]'' was a German [[individualist anarchist]] magazine. It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseud. for [[Salomo Friedlaender]]). Its title was adopted from the book ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' (engl. trans. ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'') by [[Max Stirner]]. Another influence was the thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Parvulescu.

In the late 19th century in the United Kingdom, there existed individualist anarchists such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], Joseph Hiam Levy, Joseph Greevz Fisher, John Badcock, Jr., Albert Tarn, and [[Henry Albert Seymour]] &lt;ref name=&quot;UK&quot;&gt;[http://www.uncletaz.com/liberty/english.html &quot;The English Individualists As They Appear In Liberty&quot; by Carl Watner]&lt;/ref&gt; who were close to the United States group around [[Benjamin Tucker]]´s magazine ''Liberty''. In the mid 1880s Seymour published a journal called ''The Anarchist''.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK&quot;/&gt; and also later took a special interest in [[free love]] as he participated in the journal ''The Adult: A Journal for the Advancement of Freedom in Sexual Relationships''.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK&quot;/&gt; &quot;''The Serpent'', issued from London...the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcelroy&quot;&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Herbert Read]] was influenced highly by [[egoist anarchism|egoism]] as he later approached [[existentialism]] (see [[existentialist anarchism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;herbert read&quot;&gt;''Herbert Read Reassessed'' by David Goodway.

In the hybrid of [[post-structuralism]] and anarchism called [[post-anarchism]] the [[British people|British]] [[Saul Newman]] has written a lot on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. [[Andrew Koch]], for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;newman&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Saul_Newman__War_on_the_State__Stirner_and_Deleuze_s_Anarchism.html &quot;War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism&quot; by [[Saul Newman]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Russia====
[[File:Lev Chernyi.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Lev Chernyi]]]]Individualist anarchism was one of the three categories of [[anarchism in Russia]], along with the more prominent [[anarchist communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref name=avruss&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Paul Avrich |last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = [[AK Press]] | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1904859488 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the [[intelligentsia]] and the [[working class]].&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt; For anarchist historian [[Paul Avrich]] &quot;The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in [[Moscow]], were [[Alexei Borovoi|Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi]] and [[Lev Chernyi]] (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From [[Nietzsche]], they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois societypolitical, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by [[Max Stirner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]], the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society.&quot;&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

Some Russian individualists anarchists &quot;found the ultimate expression of their [[social alienation]] in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained [[Philosophical anarchism|&quot;philosophical&quot; anarchists]] who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books.&quot;&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

[[Lev Chernyi]] was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolshevik Party. He adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of [[Benjamin Tucker]]. In 1907, he published a book entitled ''Associational Anarchism'', in which he advocated the &quot;free association of independent individuals.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chernyi&quot;&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html &quot;Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;chernyi&quot;/&gt; He was an advocate &quot;for the seizure of private homes&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;chernyi&quot;/&gt; which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;chernyi&quot;/&gt;

Chernyi advocated a [[Nietzschean]] [[transvaluation of values|overthrow of the values]] of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary [[Mir (social)|communes]] of [[anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] as a threat to the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name=Avrich180&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aa&gt;{{cite book |last=Chernyi |first=Lev |title=Novoe Napravlenie v Anarkhizme: Asosiatsionnii Anarkhism |origyear=1907 |edition=Moscow; 2nd |year=1923 |publisher=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Max Stirner]], and [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref name=sub&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antliff |first=Allan |year=2007 |title=Anarchy, Power, and Poststructuralism |journal=SubStance |volume=36 |issue=113 |pages=56–66 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/substance/v036/36.2antliff.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-10 |doi=10.1353/sub.2007.0026 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in [[Siberia]] under the Russian [[Czar]]ist regime for his revolutionary activities.&lt;ref name=match&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Terry |year=1984 |month=Fall |journal=[[The Match!]] |url=http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |issue=79 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |title=Lev Chernyi |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin American individualist anarchism===
Argentine anarchist historian [[Angel Cappelletti]] reports that in Argentina &quot;Among the workers that came from Europe in the 2 first decades of the century, there was curiously some stirnerian individualists influenced by the philosophy of [[Nietzsche]], that saw syndicalism as a potential enemy of anarchist ideology. They established...[[affinity groups]] that in 1912 came to, according to [[Max Nettlau]], to the number of 20. In 1911 there appeared, in [[Colón, Buenos Aires|Colón]], the periodical ''El Único'', that defined itself as ´Publicación individualista´&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=WUGgis_VWtEC&amp;pg=PR157&amp;lpg=PR157&amp;dq=anarquismo+nietzsche&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D6wJL-JAgg&amp;sig=7rX6CNgVLMQwDbVlngBR5aQBMoU&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=f__gTMjzJoO88ga5veS8Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=anarquismo%20nietzsche&amp;f=false ''El Anarquismo en América Latina'' por Carlos M.

In 1904 he begins using the name Biofilo Panclasta. &quot;Biofilo&quot; in Spanish stands for &quot;lover of life&quot; and &quot;Panclasta&quot; for &quot;enemy of all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;PANCLASTA, Biófilo (1928): ''Comprimidos psicológicos de los revolucionarios criollos''.

Among his written works there are ''Siete años enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela: Horripilante relato de un resucitado''(1932) and ''Mis prisiones, mis destierros y mi vida'' (1929) which talk about his many adventures while living his life as an adventurer, activist and [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]], as well as his thought and the many times he was imprisoned in different countries.

[[Image:Mlacerda.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] individualist [[anarcha-feminist]]]]
[[Maria Lacerda de Moura]]  was a [[Brazil]]ian [[teacher]], [[journalist]], [[anarcha-feminist]], and [[individualist anarchist]]. Her ideas regarding education were largely influenced by [[Francisco Ferrer]]. She later moved to [[São Paulo]] and became involved in journalism for the anarchist and labor press. There she also lectured on topics including education, [[women's rights]], [[free love]], and [[antimilitarism]]. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. In February 1923, she launched ''Renascença'', a periodical linked with the anarchist, [[progressivism|progressive]], and [[freethought|freethinking]] circles of the period. Her thought was mainly influenced by [[individualist anarchist]]s such as [[Han Ryner]] and [[Émile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nodo50.org&quot;/&gt; She maintained contact with Spanish individualist anarchist circles.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:George bernard shaw.jpg|thumb|125px|right|George Bernard Shaw expressed doubts about the [[distribution of wealth]] under individualist anarchism.]]
{{See also|Criticisms of anarchism}}
Philosopher [[Murray Bookchin]] criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to [[democracy]] and its embrace of &quot;[[lifestyle anarchism|lifestylism]]&quot; at the expense of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |title=[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=1995 |isbn=9781873176832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only [[negative liberty]] and rejects the idea of [[positive liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. &quot;Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism&quot;. ''Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998''. [[AK Press]], 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Albert Meltzer]] proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism, and that it &quot;is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'.&quot; He claimed that [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the &quot;employer's 'freedom'&quot;) is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as &quot;no government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]]. ''Anarchism: Arguments For and Against''. AK Press, 2000. pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[George Bernard Shaw]] initially had flirtations with individualist anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was &quot;the negation of socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical conclusion as any sane man dare carry it.&quot; Shaw's argument was that even if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming unequal because it would permit private appropriation and accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Gareth. ''Socialism and Superior Brain: The Political Thought of George Bernard Shaw''. Routledge (UK). 1993. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they &quot;do not see that as an injustice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Carlotta R. ''All-American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement'', Wayne State University Press, 1998, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker explained, &quot;If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. ''Economic Rent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;'''α'''&lt;/sup&gt;{{note label|A|α|none}} The term &quot;individualist anarchism&quot; is often used as a classificatory term, but in very different ways. Some sources, such as [[An Anarchist FAQ]] use the classification &quot;[[social anarchism]] / individualist anarchism&quot;. Some see individualist anarchism as distinctly non-socialist, and use the classification &quot;socialist anarchism / individualist anarchism&quot; accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ostergaard|Ostergaard, Geoffrey]]. &quot;Anarchism&quot;. ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought''. Blackwell Publishing. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Other classifications include &quot;mutualist/communal&quot; anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin A. Carson|Carson, Kevin]], [http://www.mutualist.org/id24.html &quot;A Mutualist FAQ&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;'''β'''&lt;/sup&gt;{{note label|B|β|none}} Michael Freeden identifies four broad [[Personality type|type]]s of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with [[William Godwin]] that advocates [[self-government]] with a &quot;progressive [[rationalism]] that included benevolence to others.&quot; The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[egotism|Egoism]], as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is &quot;found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution.&quot; The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeden, Micheal pp. 313-314&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;'''γ'''&lt;/sup&gt;{{note label|C|γ|none}}See, for example, the Winter 2006 issue of the ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', dedicated to reviews of Kevin Carson's ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy.'' Mutualists compose one bloc, along with agorists and geo-libertarians, in the recently formed Alliance of the Libertarian Left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;'''δ'''&lt;/sup&gt;{{note label|D|δ|none}}Though this term is non-standard usage – by &quot;left&quot;, agorists mean &quot;left&quot; in the general sense used by [[left-libertarianism|left-libertarians]], as defined by [[Roderick T. Long]], as ''&quot;... an integration, or I'd argue, a reintegration of libertarianism with concerns that are traditionally thought of as being concerns of the left. That includes concerns for worker empowerment, worry about plutocracy, concerns about feminism and various kinds of social equality.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick. T.

''An Essay on the Modern State''. Cambridge University Press. p. 61. (Used synonymously with &quot;individualist anarchism&quot; when referring to individualist anarchism that supports a [[market economy|market society]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One is anarcho-capitalism, a form of libertarian anarchism which demands that the state should be abolished and that private individuals and firms should control social and economic affairs&quot; (Barbara Goodwin, &quot;Using Political Ideas&quot;, fourth edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1987), p. 137-138)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;the 'libertarian anarchist' could on the face of it either be in favour of capitalism or against it...Pro-capitalist anarchism, is as one might expect, particularly prevalent in the U.S. where it feeds on the strong individualist and libertarian currents that have always been part of the American political imaginary. To return to the point, however, there are individualist anarchists who are most certainly not anti-capitalist and there are those who may well be.&quot; Tormey, Simon, Anti-Capitalism, A Beginner's Guide, Oneworld Publications, 2004, p. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.Friedman presents practical and economic arguments for both libertarianism in general and libertarian anarchism, which he calls anarcho-capitalism.&quot; Burton, Daniel C.
