'''Victoria University of [[Wellington]]''' ({{lang-mi|Te Whare Wānanga o Te Ūpoko o Te Ika a Māui}}) was established in 1897 by Act of [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]], and was a former constituent college of the [[University of New Zealand]]. It is particularly well known for its programmes in law, the humanities, and some scientific disciplines, but offers a broad range of other courses as well. Entry to all courses at first year is open, although entry to second year in some programmes (e.g. law, criminology, creative writing, architecture) is restricted. Victoria had the fourth highest average research grade in the New Zealand Government's [[Performance-Based Research Fund]] exercise in 2006, having been ranked 3rd in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbrf-2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/research/pbrf/assessment2003.htm Performance-Based Research Fund—Evaluating Research Excellence: the 2003 assessment], retrieved 27 December 2006. Specifically [http://www.tec.govt.nz/downloads/a2z_publications/pbrf_report.pdf this PDF] at p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria has been ranked 225th in the World's Top 500 universities by the [[QS World University Ranking]](2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2010 |title=QS World University Rankings |work=topuniversities.com |year=2011 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria is named after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], as 1897 was the 60th anniversary of her coronation. There was initially a dispute as to where to site it, and it opened in temporary facilities in Thorndon. It was eventually decided to place it in [[Kelburn, New Zealand|Kelburn]], where it still has its primary campus. This decision was influenced by the [[Wellington Cable Car|Cable Car company]]'s offer of a donation of £1000 if Victoria were located in Kelburn so students would patronise the car between the city and the University.&lt;ref name=&quot;bar99-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Victoria University of Wellington 1899 ~ 1999 A History|last=Barrowman|first=Rachel|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BarVict-c1.html#n25|accessdate=2008-04-14|year=1999|publisher=Victoria University Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0-86473-369-0|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation stone of the historic [[Hunter Building]] was laid in 1904. The original name was Victoria University College, but on the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961 Victoria or &quot;Vic&quot; became the independent Victoria University of Wellington, conferring its own degrees.

An extramural branch of Victoria was founded at [[Palmerston North]] in 1960. It merged with Massey College on 1 January 1963. The merged college itself, having become a branch of Victoria upon the University of New Zealand's 1961 demise, became an independent [[Massey University]] on 1 January 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;mas07-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Massey University history|url=http://calendar.massey.ac.nz/information/mu.htm#history|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=2008-04-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080218042620/http://calendar.massey.ac.nz/information/mu.htm#history &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Victoria University celebrated the 100th birthday of its first home, the Hunter Building.

In recent years, Victoria has had to expand out of its original campus in Kelburn, and new campuses have been set up in [[Te Aro]] (architecture and design), Pipitea (opposite [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]], housing the law, and commerce and administration schools) and [[Karori]] (education) - the [[Wellington College of Education]], established in 1880, merged with the University to become its revived [[Victoria University of Wellington Faculty of Education|Faculty of Education]] on 1 January 2005.

==General information==
Its main campus is in Kelburn, a suburb on a hill overlooking the Wellington central business district, where its administration and humanities &amp; social science and science faculties are based. The law and commerce and administration faculties are in the Pipitea Campus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vuw.ac.nz/home/about_victoria/campus_pipitea.html Pipitea Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[New Zealand Parliament Buildings|Parliament Buildings]], which consists of Rutherford House, the restored [[Old Government Buildings, Wellington|Old Government Buildings]], and the West Wing of the [[Wellington Railway Station]]. A smaller campus in the Te Aro&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vuw.ac.nz/home/about_victoria/campus_te_aro.html Te Aro Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; district of Wellington is the base for the architecture and design schools. The Faculty of Education is in the Karori campus.  The University's newest facility, the [[Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory]] supports research programmes in marine biology and coastal ecology on Wellington's rugged south coast.

Day-to-day governance is in the hands of the University Council, which consists of 20 people: five elected by the Court of Convocation, three elected by the academic staff, one elected by the general staff, two appointed by the student union executive, four appointed by the [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]], four selected by the Council itself, and the Vice-Chancellor. The Court of Convocation is composed of all graduates who choose to participate.

For New Zealand residents entry to most courses is open, with a few exceptions. Performance Music requires an audition. There is selection for entry into the second year in degrees such as the LLB, BArch and BDes. BA in criminology and creative writing is also based on selection.

The University is one of only three institutions ([[University of Auckland]] and [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]] being the others) to offer a degree in Architecture in New Zealand.

Victoria, in conjunction with [[Massey University]], also owns the [[New Zealand School of Music]].
