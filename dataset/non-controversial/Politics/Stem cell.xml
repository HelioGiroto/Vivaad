'''Stem cells''' are [[cell (biology)|biological cells]] found in all multicellular [[organisms]], that can [[cell division|divide]] (through [[mitosis]]) and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into diverse specialized cell types and can self-renew to produce more stem cells. In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: [[embryonic stem cell]]s, which are isolated from the [[inner cell mass]] of [[blastocyst]]s, and [[adult stem cell]]s, which are found in various tissues. In [[adult]] organisms, stem cells and [[progenitor cell]]s act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells (these are called pluripotent cells), but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.

There are three accessible sources of [[autologous]] adult stem cells in humans:
# Bone marrow, which requires extraction by ''harvesting'', that is, drilling into bone (typically the [[femur]] or [[iliac crest]]),
# Adipose tissue (lipid cells), which requires extraction by liposuction, and
# Blood, which requires extraction through [[pheresis]], wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from [[umbilical cord blood]] just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.

Highly plastic adult stem cells are routinely used in medical therapies, for example in [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplantation]]. Stem cells can now be artificially grown and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves through [[cell culture]]. Embryonic [[cell line]]s and [[autologous]] embryonic stem cells generated through [[therapeutic cloning]] have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Tuch BE | title=Stem cells—a clinical update | journal=[[Australian Family Physician]] | volume=35 | issue=9 | pages=719–21 | year=2006 | pmid=16969445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into stem cells grew out of findings by [[Ernest McCulloch|Ernest A.

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possess two properties:
*''Self-renewal'': the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell division]] while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
*''Potency'': the capacity to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either [[totipotency|totipotent]] or [[pluripotency|pluripotent]]—to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although [[multipotent]] or [[unipotent cell|unipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.

===Self-renewal===
Two mechanisms to ensure that a stem cell population is maintained exist:
# [[Asymmetric cell division|Obligatory asymmetric replication]]: a stem cell divides into one [[father cell]] that is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell that is differentiated
# Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell develops into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes [[mitosis]] and produces two stem cells identical to the original.

===Potency definitions===
{{Main|Cell potency}}
[[Image:Stem cells diagram.png|400px|thumb|right|Pluripotent, embryonic stem cells originate as inner cell mass (ICM) cells within a blastocyst. These stem cells can become any tissue in the body, excluding a placenta. Only cells from an earlier stage of the embryo, known as the [[morula]], are totipotent, able to become all tissues in the body and the extraembryonic placenta.]]
[[Image:Human embryonic stem cells.png|thumb|250px|Human [[embryo]]nic stem cells &lt;br /&gt; A: Cell colonies that are not yet differentiated. &lt;br /&gt; B: [[Nerve]] cell]]

''Potency'' specifies the differentiation potential (the potential to differentiate into different cell types) of the stem cell.&lt;ref name=Schoeler&gt;{{cite book |title=Humanbiotechnology as Social Challenge |editor=Nikolaus Knoepffler, Dagmar Schipanski, and Stefan Lorenz Sorgner |page=28 |chapter=The Potential of Stem Cells: An Inventory |author=Hans R. Schöler |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7546-5755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Totipotency|Totipotent]] (a.k.a. omnipotent) stem cells can differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. Such cells can construct a complete, viable organism.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; These cells are produced from the fusion of an egg and sperm cell. Cells produced by the first few divisions of the fertilized egg are also totipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Totipotency, pluripotency and nuclear reprogramming |author=Mitalipov S, Wolf D |journal=Adv.

*[[Multipotency|Multipotent]] stem cells can differentiate into a number of cells, but only those of a closely related family of cells.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt;
*[[Oligopotency|Oligopotent]] stem cells can differentiate into only a few cells, such as lymphoid or myeloid stem cells.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt;
*[[Unipotency|Unipotent]] cells can produce only one cell type, their own,&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; but have the property of self-renewal, which distinguishes them from non-stem cells (e.g., muscle stem cells).

===Identification===
The practical definition of a stem cell is the functional definition—a cell that has the potential to regenerate tissue over a lifetime. For example, the defining test for a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is the ability to transplant one cell and save an individual without HSCs. In this case, a stem cell must be able to produce new blood cells and immune cells over a long term, demonstrating potency. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ''[[in vitro]]'', using methods such as [[mesenchymal stem cell|clonogenic assay]]s, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stem cells can also be isolated by their possession of a distinctive set of cell surface markers. However, ''in vitro'' culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells will behave in a similar manner ''[[in vivo]]''. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.

==Embryonic==
{{Main|Embryonic stem cell}}

Embryonic stem (ES) cell lines are cultures of cells derived from the [[epiblast]] tissue of the [[inner cell mass]] (ICM) of a [[blastocyst]] or earlier [[morula]] stage embryos.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blastocyst is an early stage [[embryo]]—approximately four to five days old in humans and consisting of 50–150 cells. ES cells are [[pluripotent]] and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult [[human body|body]] when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the [[placenta]]. The endoderm is composed of the entire gut tube and the lungs, the ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and skin, and the mesoderm gives rise to muscle, bone, blood—in essence, everything else that connects the endoderm to the ectoderm.

Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES).  Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of [[gelatin]] as an [[extracellular matrix]] (for support) and require the presence of [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; embryonic stem cells will rapidly differentiate.

A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors [[Oct-4]], [[Nanog]], and [[Sox2]] form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency.&lt;ref&gt;

The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]] as the use of [[embryonic stem cell]]s, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an [[embryo]]. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an [[autograft]]), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;

Because of extreme ease in collection at 8–10 years of age before calcification and minimal to no morbidity, these will probably constitute a major source of cells for personal banking, research and current or future therapies. These stem cells have been shown capable of producing hepatocytes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Amniotic==
Multipotent stem cells are also found in [[amniotic fluid]]. These stem cells are very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorigenic. [[Amniotic stem cells]] are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.&lt;ref&gt;

Use of stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] overcomes the ethical objections to using human embryos as a source of cells.

As a result of the success of these experiments, [[Ian Wilmut]], who helped create the first cloned animal [[Dolly the Sheep]], has announced that he will abandon [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] as an avenue of research.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His inspiration comes from the research by Prof Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University, which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement.&quot;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html|title=Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning|author=Roger Highfield|date=2007-11-16|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==
{{Main|Stem cell line}}
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in ''Drosophila'' germarium have identified the signals [[decapentaplegic]] and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell}}
The signals that lead to reprogramming of cells to an embryonic-like state are also being investigated. These signal pathways include several [[transcription factor]]s including the [[oncogene]] [[Myc|c-Myc]]. Initial studies indicate that transformation of mice cells with a combination of these anti-differentiation signals can reverse differentiation and may allow adult cells to become pluripotent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takahashi2006&quot; /&gt; However, the need to transform these cells with an oncogene may prevent the use of this approach in therapy.
{{Main|Induced stem cells}}
Challenging the terminal nature of cellular differentiation and the integrity of lineage commitment, it was recently determined that the somatic expression of combined [[transcription factor]]s can [[Induced stem cells#Induced progenitor stem cells|directly induce]] other defined somatic cell fates; researchers identified three neural-lineage-specific transcription factors that could directly convert mouse [[fibroblasts]] (skin cells) into fully functional [[neuron]]s. This &quot;induced neurons&quot; (iN) cell research inspires the researchers to induce other cell types implies that ''all'' cells are [[totipotent]]: with the proper tools, all cells may form all kinds of tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, there still exists a great deal of social and scientific uncertainty surrounding stem cell research, which could possibly be overcome through public debate and future research, and further education of the public.

One concern of treatment is the risk that transplanted stem cells could form tumors and become cancerous if cell division continues uncontrollably.&lt;ref&gt;

Supporters of embryonic stem cell research argue that such research should be pursued because the resultant treatments could have significant medical potential. It has been proposed that surplus embryos created for [[in vitro fertilization]] could be donated with consent and used for the research.

The recent development of [[iPS cells]] has been called a bypass of the legal controversy. Laws limiting the destruction of human embryos have been credited for being the reason for development of iPS cells, but it is still not completely clear whether hiPS cells are equivalent to hES cells. Recent work demonstrates hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in hiPS cells (Lister, R., et al., 2011).

==Toxicity Screening==
[[Hepatotoxicity]] and drug-induced liver injury account for a substantial number of failures of new drugs in development and market withdrawal, highlighting the need for screening assays such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the [[drug development]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;stem2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Greenhough S, Hay DC. |title=Stem Cell-Based Toxicity Screening: Recent Advances in Hepatocyte Generation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26020/Stem_Cell_Based_Toxicity_Screening__Recent.2.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=85–89 |year=2012 |doi= 10.1007/BF03256896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research patents==
The [[patent]]s covering a lot of work on human embryonic stem cells are owned by the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF). WARF does not charge academics to study human stem cells but does charge commercial users. WARF sold [[Geron Corp.]] exclusive rights to work on human stem cells but later sued Geron Corp. to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron Corp. would keep the rights to only three cell types. In 2001, WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology.&lt;ref name = &quot;stemcellPatent&quot;&gt;Regalado, Antonio, David P. Hamilton (July 2006).

A request for reviewing the WARF patents 5,843,780; 6,200,806; 7,029,913 [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] were filed by non-profit patent-watchdogs [http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/ The Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights], and the [[Public Patent Foundation]]  as well as molecular biologist Jeanne Loring of the Burnham Institute. According to them, two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1993 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge states that these techniques, developed by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James A. Thomson]], are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks. Based on this challenge, patent 7,029,913 was rejected in 2010. The two remaining hES WARF patents are due to expire in 2015.

The outcome of this legal challenge is particularly relevant to the Geron Corp. as it can only license patents that are upheld.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kintisch&quot;&gt;Kintisch, Eli (July 18, 2006) [http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2006/07/18-02.html &quot;Groups Target Stem Cell Patents.&quot;] ''ScienceNOW Daily News''.
