'''He who does not work, neither shall he eat''' is a [[Biblical]] aphorism derived from {{Biblesource|II Thessalonians|3:10}}, which became a slogan for new colonies and socialist societies.

== New Testament ==
This concept is derived directly from the [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|Second Epistle]] of [[Paul the Apostle]] (with [[Saint_Silvanus|Silvanus]] and [[Saint_Timothy|Timothy]]) to the Thessalonians, in which Paul writes:
:εἴ τις οὐ θέλει ἐργάζεσθαι μηδὲ ἐσθιέτω
that is,
:If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.&lt;ref&gt;[[English Standard Version]] translation&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greek phrase οὐ θέλει ἐργάζεσθαι means “is not willing to work”. Other English translations render this as “would”&lt;ref&gt;[[King James Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; or “will not work”&lt;ref&gt;[[American Standard Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt;, which may confuse readers unaccustomed to this use of the verb [[wikt:will#Verb|&quot;will&quot;]] in the archaic sense of “want to, desire to”.

== Jamestown ==
The slogan is said to have been used by [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] when establishing the English colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia]] after an experiment with a common store system was abandoned (1607-1609).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wnd.com/2007/04/41081/ |date=April 13, 2007 |author=Doug Philips |title=Our most politically incorrect Founding Father |work=[[WorldNetDaily|wnd.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jamestown and Plymouth Town |url=http://www.aproundtable.org/history-blog/blog.cfm?ID=493&amp;AUTHOR_ID=9 |author=Jeff Sanders |date=November 25, 2009 |work=aproundtable.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Union ==
According to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], “He who does not work shall not eat” is a necessary principle under [[socialism]], the preliminary phase of the evolution towards communist society. The phrase appears in his 1917 work, ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. Through this slogan Lenin explains that in [[socialist states]] only productive individuals could be allowed access to the articles of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]].

{{Quotation|The socialist principle, &quot;He who does not work shall not eat&quot;, is already realized; the other socialist principle, &quot;An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor&quot;, is also already realized. But this is not yet communism, and it does not yet abolish &quot;bourgeois law&quot;, which gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products.&lt;br&gt;

This is a “defect”, says Marx, but it is unavoidable in the first phase of communism; for if we are not to indulge in utopianism, we must not think that having overthrown capitalism people will at once learn to work for society without any rules of law. (Chapter 5, Section 3, “The First Phase of Communist Society”)}}

In accordance with Lenin’s understanding of the socialist state, article twelve of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] states: {{Quotation|In the USSR work is a duty and a matter of honor for every able-bodied citizen, in accordance with the principle: “He who does not work, neither shall he eat.”}}

In Lenin’s writing, this was not so much directed at lazy or unproductive workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/dec/25.htm |chapter=How to Organise Competition? |publisher=Progress Publishers |author=Vladimir Lenin |authorlink=Vladimir Lenin |title=Collected Works |volume=26 |pages=404-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/may/22b.htm |title=On The Famine |chapter=Letter to the Petrograd Soviet |author=Vladimir Lenin |date=22 May 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather the [[bourgeoisie]]. (Marxist theory defines the bourgeoisie as the group of those who buy the labor-power of workers and engage it in the process of production, deriving profits from the surplus value thus expropriated. Once communism was realised, that is, after the abolition of property and the [[law of value]], no-one would live off the labor of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DMXwGdV29jwC&amp;dq=Class+Theory+and+History&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=blauS7efL4P-8Ab1wZy9DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Class Theory and History |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2002 |authors=[[Richard D. Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Neither did the principle apply to those rendered incapable of work by old age or disability. These groups would have a right to society's products because they were not at fault for their condition. The elderly, in particular, had worked during their youth, and so could not be denied life’s basic necessities. The Soviet state accordingly provided a basic level of [[social security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12574.html |title=Social Security in the Soviet Union |work=country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The principle has been fundamental to attempts so far to affect the [[mode of production|communist mode of production]]. Examples? Discussion? --&gt;

In reality, the resulting lack of motivation and productivity was illustrated by one of the more famous [[Russian political jokes]], &quot;the authorities pretend they are paying wages, workers pretend they are working.&quot;
