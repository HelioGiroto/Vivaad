'''White nationalism''' is a [[political ideology]] that advocates a [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racial]] definition of [[national identity]] for [[white people]]. It has been argued that [[white separatism]] and [[white supremacy|white supremacism]] may be considered subgroups within white nationalism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In a 2003 interview, political scientist [[Carol M. Swain|Carol Swain]] described research she had done undertaken on the subject, suggesting American white nationalists believed &quot;the interests of each of these groups (Hispanic, black, and white citizens of America) would be better served if each had a separate nation-state of its own&quot;. The white nationalist school of thought tends to avoid the term ''supremacy'', because of its negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The New Nativism; The Alarming Overlap Between White Nationalists and Mainstream Anti-immigrant Forces&quot;, The American Prospect (November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitenationalism.com/wn/wn-06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary white nationalist movement in the United States could be regarded as a reaction to what is perceived as a decline in white demographics, politics and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Things&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=2047 |title=The New White Nationalism in America |first=Scott |last=McConnell |authorlink=Scott McConnell |publisher=[[First Things]] |date=August/September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samuel P. Huntington]], the contemporary white nationalist movement is increasingly cultured, intellectual and academically trained.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;&quot;The Hispanic challenge&quot;, Foreign Policy (March 1, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that rather than espousing violence, white nationalists tend to use statistics and [[social science]] data to argue for a self-conscious white identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Despite new leaders, and with them new tactics and new ideas, the goal of white separatists remains to convince Americans that racial separation is the only way to survive. National Public Radio (August 14, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; By challenging established policies on immigration, civil rights and racial integration, white nationalists seek to build bridges with moderately [[conservativism|conservative]] white citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i45/45a01201.htm Can We Improve Race Relations by Giving Racists Some of What They Want?] The Chronicle of Higher Education July 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
White nationalists argue that every nationality feels a natural affection for its own kind.&lt;ref name=dark/&gt; They advocate racial self-preservation and claim that culture is a product of race.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; According to white nationalist [[Samuel T. Francis]], it is &quot;a movement that rejects equality as an ideal and insists on an enduring core of human nature transmitted by heredity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;White Nationalists Seek Respectability in Meeting of 'Uptown Bad Guys'&quot;, Newhouse News Service (April 4, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Taylor]], a white nationalist, claims that similar racial views were held by many mainstream American leaders before the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

[[Jared Taylor]] has argued that a natural hierarchy should triumph over the &quot;false promise of [[egalitarianism]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; and that the downfall of white dominance spells doom for representative government, the rule of law and freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jared Taylor, A Racist In The Guise Of 'Expert'&quot;, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania January 23, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Samuel P. Huntington]], white nationalists argue that the demographic shift in the United States towards non-whites brings a new culture that is intellectually and morally inferior.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; They argue that with this demographic shift comes [[affirmative action]], [[immigrant]] ghettos and declining educational standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Most American white nationalists say immigration should be restricted to people of European ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Dating the White Way ''Newsweek'' August 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

White nationalists embrace a variety of religious and [[irreligion|non-religious]] beliefs, including various [[Christian denominations|denominations]] of [[Christianity]], generally [[Protestant]], although some specifically overlap with white nationalist ideology ([[Christian Identity]], for example, is a family of white supremacist denominations), [[Germanic Neopaganism]] (e.g. [[Wotanism]]) and [[atheism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atheism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5uWOTeSkCamw0QH7m92bCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=competing%20atheistic%20white%20racist%20movement&amp;f=false|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–134).|accessdate = 2011–03–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions of whiteness===
Most white nationalists define [[white people]] in a restricted way. In the United States, it often—though not exclusively—implies [[European ethnic groups|European ancestry]] of non-Jewish descent. White nationalists draw primarily on 19th-century [[Race science|racial taxonomy]], which neither reached a consensus on racial categories nor is accepted by contemporary [[genetics|geneticists]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Times: ''Race Is Seen as Real Guide to Track Roots of Disease'', 2002. [http://web.mit.edu/racescience/in_media/race_disease_nyt_july2002.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Some white nationalists, such as [[Jared Taylor]], have argued that [[Jew]]s can be considered &quot;white&quot;.&lt;ref name=differences&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=644&amp;printable=1|title=Schism Threatens White Nationalist Group|publisher=[[Intelligence Report]]|date=Summer 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2010|author=[[Mark Potok]] and Heidi Beirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most white nationalists oppose [[Israel]] and [[Zionism]], several white nationalists (such as [[William Daniel Johnson]]) have expressed support for Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/racism_colors_judicial_bid_20080528/|title=Racism colors judicial bid: Candidate Bill Johnson advocates deportation of ‘non-whites’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different racial theories, such as [[Nordicism]] and [[Pan-Germanism|Germanism]], define different groups as white, both excluding some southern and eastern Europeans because of a perceived racial taint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.white-history.com/refuting_rm&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-[[Aryanism]] defines whites as individuals native to Europe, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the [[Middle East]] and Central/West Asia who are wholly of [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] descent or are overwhelmingly from the following Caucasoid subraces, or any combination thereof: Indo-European (&quot;[[Aryan race|Aryan]]&quot;-including the [[Iranian peoples]] but not the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]]), Old European (e.g. [[Basque people|Basque]]),  or [[Hamitic]] (in modern times supposedly confined to [[Berbers]]). Other white nationalists use the term ''Pan-Europeanism'' to include all European [[ethnic group]]s.

==History==
According to one view, white nationalism is a product of the modern centralized state's emergence in the West, like all nationalisms.&lt;ref&gt;Can Nationalism studies and ethnic, ''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies'' July 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated as a self-description by some groups, primarily in the United States{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, to describe their belief in a [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racially defined]] collective identity of [[white people]].

In the 19th and early 20th century, racial definitions of the American nation were common, resulting in race-specific immigration restrictions, such as the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]]. The 1915 film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' is an example of an allegorical invocation of white nationalism during this time.&lt;ref name=dark&gt;In its darkness, 'Kong' shows the human heart. Newsday (New York: December 15, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Thule-Society developed out of the &quot;Germanic Order&quot; in 1918, and those who wanted to join the ''Order'' in 1917 had to sign a special &quot;blood declaration of faith&quot; concerning the lineage: &quot;The signer hereby swears to the best of his knowledge and belief that no Jewish or coloured blood flows in either his or in his wife's veins, and that among their ancestors are no members of the coloured races.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf von Sebottendorff, Bevor Hitler kam, 1933, page 42 (original: &quot;Blutbekenntnis&quot;: &quot;Unterzeichner versichert nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen, daß in seinen und seiner Frau Adern kein jüdisches oder farbiges Blut fließe und daß sich unter den Vorfahren auch keine Angehörigen der farbigen Rassen befinden.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; As the Nazi ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] said on the 29th of May 1938 on the Steckelburg in [[Schlüchtern]]: &quot;It is however certain that all of us share the fate of Europe, and that we shall regard this common fate as an obligation, because in the end the very existence of White people depends on the unity of the European continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trotzdem aber bleibt bestehen, daß wir alle unter dem gleichen Schicksal Europas stehen, und daß wir dieses gemeinsame Schicksal als Verpflichtung empfinden müssen, weil am Ende die Existenz des weißen Menschen überhaupt von dieser Einheit des europäischen Kontinents abhängt.&quot; Feier anläßlich des 450. Geburtstages von Hutten, 29.5.1938&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White Australia]] ideal was semi-official policy in Australia until 1975. In South Africa, white nationalism was championed by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]&lt;ref&gt;Apartheid-era party is ending its existence, ''The International Herald Tribune'' August 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; starting in 1948, as opposition to [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] heated up.&lt;ref&gt;Kani explores a post-apartheid world on stage. ABC Transcripts (Australia: May 11, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1960s, white nationalism grew in the United States as the conservative movement developed in mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Black Politics are in a Black Hole&quot;, ''Newsday'' (New York, January 14, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel P. Huntington]] argues that it developed as a reaction to a perceived decline in the essence of American identity as European, Anglo-Protestant and English-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bush and Kerry Show Opposing Faces of Two Different Americas. ''Business Day'' (South Africa: October 21, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan &quot;white power&quot; was coined by [[American Nazi Party]] leader [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], who used the term in a debate with [[Stokely Carmichael]] of the [[Black Panther Party]], after Carmichael issued a call for &quot;[[black power]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In recent years, the Internet has provided an expansion of audiences for white nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Patriotism in Black and White&quot;, The American Prospect (January 13, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Anti-racism|Anti-racist]] organizations generally have argued that ideas such as [[white pride]] and white nationalism exist merely to provide a sanitized public face for [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Moriz, Justin J. [http://www.adversity.net/USPTO/ethnic_pride/ &quot;Case 45: 'White Pride' vs. U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office&quot;]. Adversity.net for Victims of Reverse Discrimination. 2005. Retrieved September 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kofi Buenor Hadjor argues that [[black nationalism]] is a response to racial discrimination, while white nationalism is the expression of white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Another America: The Politics of Race and Blame |last=Hadjor |first=Kofi Buenor |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Haymarket Books |location= |isbn=1-931859-34-5 |page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have described white nationalism as a &quot;...somewhat paranoid ideology&quot; based upon the publication of pseudo-academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caliendo, S.M &amp; McIllwan, C.D.|title=The Routledge Companion to Race and Ethnicity|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=233–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol M. Swain argues that the unstated goal of white nationalism is to appeal to a larger audience, and that most white nationalist groups promote [[white separatism]] and racial violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration |last=Swain |first=Carol M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-80886-3 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents accuse white nationalists of hatred, racial bigotry and destructive [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Things&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/Sustainers/content/2002-12/16wise.cfm Wise, Tim, &quot;Making Nice With Racists: David Horowitz and The Soft Pedaling Of White Supremacy&quot;, Znet (December 16, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; White supremacist groups have a history of perpetrating [[hate crime]]s, particularly against people of Jewish or African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, C.M., The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp. 114-117&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[lynching]] of black people by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK).

Some critics argue that white nationalists — while posturing as [[civil rights]] groups advocating the interests of their racial group — frequently draw on the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] traditions of the KKK and the British [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= BNP: A party on the fringe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1507680.stm |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=August 24, 2001 |accessdate=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have noted the [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] rhetoric used by white nationalists, as highlighted by the promotion of conspiracy theories such as [[Zionist Occupation Government]].&lt;ref&gt;Boler, M., Digital Media and Democracy: Tactics in Hard Times,
(MIT Press, 2008) pp. 440-443.&lt;/ref&gt;
