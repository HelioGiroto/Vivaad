[[File:Scherbengericht.png|thumb|200px|Pieces of broken pottery as voting tokens. The persons nominated are [[Pericles]], [[Cimon]] and [[Aristides]], each with his [[patronymic]] (top to bottom).]]
'''Ostracism''' ({{lang-grc|ὀστρακισμός}}, ''ostrakismos'') was a procedure under the [[Athenian democracy]] in which any [[citizen]] could be [[exile|expelled]] from the [[city-state]] of [[Athens]] for ten years. While some instances clearly expressed popular anger at the victim, ostracism was often used preemptively. It was used as a way of neutralizing someone thought to be a threat to the state or potential [[tyrant]]. Crucially, ostracism had no relation to the processes of justice. There was no charge or defense, and the exile was not in fact a penalty; it was simply a command from the Athenian people that one of their number be gone for ten years.

A modern use developed from the term is to describe informal exclusion from a group through [[social rejection]].  Although the psychology of ostracism takes this further, where it has been defined as “…any behaviour in which a group or individual excludes and ignores another group or individual”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Beest|first=Ilja|coauthors=Williams, K; Van Dijk, E|title=Cyberbomb: Effects of being ostracized from a death game.|journal=Group processes &amp; intergroup relations|year=2011|volume=14|pages=581-596}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could therefore be an intentional act or an unintentional one.

==Procedure==
The name is derived from the ''[[ostracon|ostraka]]'', (singular ''ostrakon '', ὄστρακον), referring to the [[sherd|pottery sherd]]s that were used as voting tokens. Broken pottery, abundant and virtually free, served as a kind of scrap paper (in contrast to [[papyrus]], which was imported from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] as a high-quality writing surface, and was thus too costly to be disposable).

Each year the Athenians were asked in the [[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly]] whether they wished to hold an ostracism. The question was put in the sixth of the [[Attic_calendar#State_calendar|ten months used for state business under the democracy]] (January or February in the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). If they voted &quot;yes&quot;, then an ostracism would be held two months later. In a section of the [[agora]] set off and suitably barriered,&lt;ref&gt;According to some sources, part of the [[agora]] was roped-off, according to others it was temporarily immured with wooden planks.&lt;/ref&gt; citizens scratched the name of a citizen they wished to expel on pottery sherds, and deposited them in [[urn]]s. The presiding officials counted the ''ostraka'' submitted and sorted the names into separate piles. The person whose pile contained the most ''ostraka'' would be banished, provided that an additional criterion of a [[quorum]] was met, about which there are two principal sources:
* According to [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0009%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D5] Life of Aristides 7.5&lt;/ref&gt; the ostracism was considered valid if the total number of votes cast was at least 6,000.
* According to a fragment of [[Philochorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/translate/philochorus.html] See n. 30&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;winner&quot; of the ostracism must have obtained at least 6,000 votes.
Plutarch's evidence for a quorum of 6,000, on [[a priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] grounds a necessity for ostracism also per the account of Philochorus, accords with the number required for grants of citizenship in the following century and is generally preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy and Participation in Athens |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |author=Sinclair, R. K. |isbn=0-521-42389-9 |year=1988 |pages=114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greek and Roman Voting and Elections |author=Staveley, E.S. |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=1972 |pages=89ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Classical Athenian Democracy |author=Stockton, David |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-814697-3 |year=1990 |pages=33ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |author=Ober, Josiah |isbn=0-691-02864-8 |year=1988 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The person nominated had ten days to leave the city. If he attempted to return, the penalty was [[capital punishment|death]]. Notably, the property of the man banished was not confiscated and there was no loss of status. After the ten years, he was allowed to return without stigma. It was possible for the assembly to recall an ostracised person ahead of time; before the [[Persian Wars|Persian invasion]] of [[479 BC]], an amnesty was declared under which at least two ostracised leaders&amp;mdash;[[Pericles]]' father Xanthippus and [[Aristides]] 'the Just'&amp;mdash;are known to have returned.  Similarly, [[Cimon]], ostracised in 461 BC, was recalled during an emergency.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifesimon17_2_6&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Cim.:chapter=17 ''Life of Cimon'' 17.2&amp;ndash;6].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from other Athenian democratic processes==
Ostracism was crucially different from [[Athenian law court (classical period)|Athenian law]] at the time; there was no charge, and no defence could be mounted by the person expelled. The two stages of the procedure ran in the reverse order from that used under almost any trial system &amp;mdash; here it is as if a jury are first asked ''&quot;Do you want to find someone guilty?&quot;'', and subsequently asked ''&quot;Whom do you wish to accuse?&quot;''. Equally out of place in a judicial framework is perhaps the institution's most peculiar feature: that it can take place at most once a year, and only for one person. In this it resembles the Greek ''[[pharmakos]]'' or [[scapegoat]] &amp;mdash; though in contrast, ''pharmakos'' generally ejected a lowly member of the community.

A further distinction between these two modes (and one not obvious from a modern perspective) is that ostracism was an automatic procedure that required no initiative from any individual, with the vote simply occurring on the wish of the electorate &amp;mdash; a diffuse exercise of power. By contrast, an Athenian trial needed the initiative of a particular citizen-prosecutor. While prosecution often led to a counterattack (or was a counterattack itself), no such response was possible in the case of ostracism as responsibility lay with the polity as a whole. In contrast to a trial, ostracism generally reduced political tension rather than increased it.

Although ten years of exile would have been difficult for an Athenian to face, it was relatively mild in comparison to the kind of sentences inflicted by courts; when dealing with politicians held to be acting against the interests of the people, Athenian juries could inflict very severe penalties such as death, unpayably large fines, confiscation of property, permanent exile and loss of citizens' rights through [[atimia (loss of citizen rights)|''atimia'']]. Further, the elite Athenians who suffered ostracism were rich or noble men who had connections or [[xenos (guest-friend)|''xenoi'']] in the wider Greek world and who, unlike genuine exiles, were able to access their income in [[Attica]] from abroad. In [[Plutarch]], following as he does the anti-democratic line common in elite sources, the fact that people might be recalled early appears to be another example of the inconsistency of [[majoritarianism]] that was characteristic of Athenian democracy. However, ten years of exile usually resolved whatever had prompted the expulsion. Ostracism was simply a pragmatic measure; the concept of serving out the full sentence did not apply as it was a preventative measure, not a punitive one.

One curious window on the practicalities of ostracism comes from the cache of 190 [[ostraka]] discovered dumped in a well next to the [[Acropolis, Athens|acropolis]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} From the handwriting they appear to have been written by fourteen individuals and bear the name of [[Themistocles]], ostracised before [[471 BC]] and were evidently meant for distribution to voters. This was not necessarily evidence of [[electoral fraud]] (being no worse than modern voting instruction cards), but their being dumped in the well may suggest that their creators wished to hide them. If so, these ostraka provide an example of organized groups attempting to influence the outcome of ostracisms. The two-month gap between the first and second phases would have easily allowed for such a campaign. 

There is another interpretation, however, according to which these ostraka were prepared beforehand by enterprising businessmen who offered to them for sale to citizens who could not easily inscribe the desired names for themselves or who simply wished to save time.&lt;ref&gt;See Surikov, pp. 284–294&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-month gap is a key feature in the institution, much as in [[election]]s under modern [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. It first prevented the candidate for expulsion being chosen out of immediate anger, although an Athenian general such as Cimon would have not wanted to lose a battle the week before such a second vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifesimon17_2_6&quot;/&gt; Secondly, it opened up a period for discussion (or perhaps agitation), whether informally in daily talk or [[public speaking|public speeches]] before the Athenian assembly or Athenian courts &lt;span class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;ref_Oration&quot; class=&quot;plainlinksneverexpand&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Ostracism}}#endnote_Oration *]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In this process a consensus, or rival consensuses, might emerge. Further, in that time of waiting, ordinary Athenian citizens must have felt a certain power over the greatest members of their city; conversely, the most prominent citizens had an incentive to worry how their social inferiors regarded them.

==Period of operation==
Ostracism was not in use throughout the whole period of Athenian democracy (circa 506&amp;ndash;322 BCE), but only occurred in the fifth century. The standard account, found in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] Athenian Constitution 22.3,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0046:chapter=22 Aristotle, Athenian Constitution 22.3]&lt;/ref&gt; attributes the establishment to [[Cleisthenes]], a pivotal reformer in the creation of the democracy. In that case ostracism would have been in place from around [[506 BC]]. The first victim of the practice, however, was not expelled until [[487 BC]] &amp;mdash; nearly twenty years later. Over the course of the next sixty years some twelve or more individuals followed him. The list may not be complete, but there is good reason to believe the Athenians did not feel the need to eject someone in this way every year. The list of known ostracisms runs as follows:
[[File:Athen Stoa Ostrakismos 2.jpg|thumb|Themistocles]]
*487 Hipparchos son of Charmos, a relative of the [[tyrant]] [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]]
*486 [[Megacles]] son of [[Hippocrates]]; Cleisthenes' nephew (possibly ostracised twice &lt;ref name=&quot;Lysias&quot;&gt;Lysias 14.39&lt;/ref&gt;)
*485 [[Kallixenos]] Nephew of [[Cleisthenes]] and head of the Alcmaeonids at the time (not known for certain)
*484 [[Xanthippus]] son of Ariphron; [[Pericles|Pericles']] father
*482 [[Aristides]] son of Lysimachus
*471 [[Themistocles]] son of Neocles (last possible year)
*461 [[Cimon]] son of [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]]
*460 Alcibiades son of Kleinias; grandfather of [[Alcibiades]] (possibly  ostracised twice &lt;ref name=&quot;Lysias&quot;/&gt;)
*457 Menon son of Meneclides [less certain]
*442 [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]] son of Milesias
*440s Callias son of Didymos [less certain]
*440s [[Damon (ancient Greek musicologist)|Damon]] son of Damonides [less certain]
*416 [[Hyperbolos]] son of Antiphanes (±1 year)

Around twelve thousand political ostraka have been excavated in the Athenian agora and in the [[Kerameikos]] {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The second victim, Cleisthenes' nephew Megacles, is named by 4647 of these, but for a second undated ostracism not listed above. The known ostracisms seem to fall into three distinct phases: the 480s BC, mid-century 461&amp;ndash;443 BC and finally the years 417&amp;ndash;415: this matches fairly well with the clustering of known expulsions, although Themistocles before 471 may count as an exception. This suggests that ostracism fell in and out of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mabel Lang]], (1990). ''Ostraka'': 3–6, Athens.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last known ostracism was that of [[Hyperbolos]] in circa [[417 BC]]. There is no sign of its use after the [[Peloponnesian War]], when democracy was restored after the [[oligarchic]] coup of [[Thirty Tyrants|the Thirty]] had collapsed in [[403 BC]]. However, while ostracism was not an active feature of the 4th-century version of democracy, it remained; the question was put to the assembly each year, but they did not wish to hold one.

==Purpose of ostracism==
Because ostracism was carried out by thousands of people over many decades of an evolving political situation and culture, it did not serve a single monumental purpose. Still, observations can be made about outcomes, as well as the initial purpose for which it was created.

The first rash of people ostracised in the decade after the defeat of the first [[Persian Empire|Persian]] invasion at [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] in 490 BC were all related or connected to the [[tyrant]] [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]], who had controlled Athens for 36 years up to [[527 BC]]. After his son [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] was deposed with [[Sparta]]n help in 510 BC, the family sought refuge with the Persians, and nearly twenty years later Hippias landed with their invasion force at Marathon. [[Tyranny]] and Persian aggression were paired threats facing the new democratic regime at Athens, and ostracism was used against both.

Tyranny and democracy had arisen at Athens out of clashes between regional and factional groups organised around politicians, including Cleisthenes. As a reaction, in many of its features the democracy strove to reduce the role of factions as the focus of citizen loyalties. Ostracism, too, may have been intended to work in the same direction: by temporarily decapitating a faction, it could help to defuse confrontations that threatened the order of the State.

In later decades when the threat of tyranny was remote, ostracism seems to have been used as a way to decide between radically opposed policies. For instance, in [[443 BC]] [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides son of Milesias]] (not to be confused with [[Thucydides|the historian of the same name]]) was ostracised. He led an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] opposition to Athenian [[imperialism]] and in particular to [[Pericles|Perikles']] building program on the acropolis, which was funded by taxes created for the wars against [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. By expelling Thucydides the Athenian people sent a clear message about the direction of Athenian policy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Per.:chapter=11 Life of Pericles 11]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Per.:chapter=11 12],[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Per.:chapter=14 14].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar but more controversial claims have been made about the ostracism of [[Cimon]] in [[461 BC]].

The motives of individual voting citizens cannot, of course, be known. Many of the surviving ostraka name people otherwise unattested. They may well be just someone the submitter disliked, and voted for in moment of private spite. As such, it may be seen as a secular, civic variant of Athenian [[curse]] tablets, studied in scholarly literature under the Latin name [[defixio (curse tablet)|''defixiones'']], where small dolls were wrapped in lead sheets written with curses and then buried, sometimes stuck through with nails for good measure.

In one anecdote about Aristides, known as &quot;the Just&quot;, who was ostracised in 482, an illiterate citizen, not recognising him, came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostrakon. When Aristides asked why, the man replied it was because he was sick of hearing him being called &quot;the Just&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0182:text=Arist.:chapter=7 Life of Aristides 7.7]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps merely the sense that someone had become too arrogant or prominent was enough to get someone's name onto an ostrakon.

==Fall into disuse==
The last ostracism, that of [[Hyperbolos]] in or near 415 BC, is elaborately narrated by Plutarch in three separate ''lives'': Hyperbolos is pictured urging the people to expel one of his rivals, but they, [[Nicias]] and Alcibiades, laying aside their own hostility for a moment, use their combined influence to have him ostracised instead. According to Plutarch, the people then become disgusted with ostracism and abandon the procedure forever.

In part ostracism lapsed as a procedure at the end of the fifth century because it was replaced by the ''[[graphe paranomon]]'', a regular court action under which a much larger number of politicians might be targeted, instead of just one a year as with ostracism, and with greater severity. But it may already have come to seem like an anachronism as factional alliances organised around important men became increasingly less significant in the later period, and power was more specifically located in the interaction of the individual speaker with the power of the assembly and the courts. The threat to the democratic system in the late 5th century came not from [[tyranny]] but from [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] coups, threats of which became prominent after two brief seizures of power, in [[411 BC|411]] by [[Athenian coup of 411 BC|&quot;the Four Hundred&quot;]] and in [[404 BC]] by [[Thirty Tyrants|&quot;the Thirty&quot;]], which were not dependent on single powerful individuals. Ostracism was not an effective defence against the oligarchic threat and it was not so used.

==Analogues==

Other cities are known to have  set up forms of ostracism on the Athenian model, namely [[Megara]], [[Miletos]], [[Argos]] and [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. In the last of these it was referred to as ''petalismos'', because the names were written on [[olive]] leaves. Little is known about these institutions. Furthermore, [[sherd|pottery sherd]]s identified as ''ostraka'' have been found in [[Chersonesos Taurica]], leading historians to the conclusion that a similar institution existed there as well, in spite of the silence of the ancient records on that count.&lt;ref name=&quot;Surikov_ch&quot;&gt;see Surikov, pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar modern practice is the [[recall election]], in which the electoral body removes its representation from an elected officer. There have also been comparisons drawn in the [[United Kingdom]] with appointment to the [[European Commission]], which has the effect of removing political figures from the country for a period of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyandpolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-43.html|title=Ostracism: selection and de-selection in ancient Greece|last=Cartledge|first=Paul|date=July 2006|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|language=[[English language|English]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interesting to note that unlike under modern voting procedures, the Athenians did not have to adhere to a strict format for the inscribing of ''ostraka''. Many extant ''ostraka'' show that it was possible to write expletives, short epigrams or cryptic injunctions beside the name of the candidate without invalidating the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Surikov&quot;&gt;see Surikov, pp. 73–80, and references therein.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* Kallixenes, son of Aristonimos, &quot;the traitor&quot;.
* Archen, &quot;lover of foreigners&quot;.
* Agasias, &quot;the donkey&quot;.
* Megacles, &quot;the adulterer&quot;.

==Notes and references==
===Notes===
{{note|Oration}} Oration IV of [[Andocides]] purports itself to be speech urging the ostracism of Alcibiades in 415 BC,  but it is probably not authentic.

{{note|Lysias}} The second ostracisms of Megacles and of Alcibiades son of Kleinias are reported only by Lysias in the quoted passage – no other ancient author refers to them. Thus, Lysias's report is regarded as probably spurious by many modern historians.

&lt;small&gt;Note that the ancient sources on ostracism are mostly 4th century or much later and often limited to brief descriptions such as notes by [[lexicographer]]s. Most of the narrative and analytical passages of any length come from Plutarch writing five centuries later and with little sympathy for democratic practices. There are no contemporary accounts that can take one into the experiences of participants: a dense account of Athenian democracy can only be made on the basis of the much fuller sources available in the 4th century, especially the [[Attic orators]],  after ostracism had fallen into disuse. Most of such references are a 4th-century memory of the institution.&lt;/small&gt;
