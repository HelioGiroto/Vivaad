      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7161">[[Image:United Kingdom labelled map7.png||right|thumb|242px|A map of the Home Nations of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;br/&gt; White: [[England]]; Yellow: [[Northern Ireland]]; Blue: [[Scotland]]; and Red: [[Wales]]]]

'''Home Nations''' is a collective term, that depending on the context in which it is used, either means the nations of the [[constituent country|constituent countries]] of the United Kingdom ([[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]); or if a sport is governed by a council representing the [[island of Ireland]], such as the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], the term can refer to the nations of the constituent countries on the island of [[Great Britain]] (England, Scotland and Wales) and the collective Irish nation. This dual meaning has persisted in existence despite the partition of Ireland in 1922 as historically the term included all of [[Ireland]], which between 1800 and 1922 was wholly a part of the United Kingdom. The term '''home countries''' (not to be confused with the &quot;[[home counties]]&quot;) is also sometimes used, and is synonymous.&lt;ref name=BritishCycling&gt;[http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/web/site/BC/gbr/CommonwealthGames2006/20060316_CG_Home_Nations.asp &quot;historic rivalries between the home nations and the Commonwealth were once again centre stage with the Home Countries having great success&quot;], [[British Cycling]], March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used by [[British Cycling]] to refer to the seven representative teams of the United Kingdom and the [[Crown Dependencies]] (the [[Isle of Man]], [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]]) that participate in the [[Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref name=BritishCycling/&gt; The [[Crown Dependencies]] are not part of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_10012517|title=Key facts about the United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-26|work=Government, citizens and rights|publisher=[[Directgov]]|quote=The full title of this country is 'the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'. 'The UK' is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 'Great Britain' (or just 'Britain') does not include Northern Ireland. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==
In [[association football]], the Home Nations originally referred to the then four national teams of the [[United Kingdom]]: [[England national football team|England]], [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Today, the [[Irish Football Association]] organises the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] while the [[Football Association of Ireland]] organises the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]]; the latter is not referred to as a Home Nation.  

A debate took place among the football associations that govern the sport in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, over whether they will allow their members to participate in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] as a single [[Great Britain Olympic football team|UK team]]. The English Football Association and the news media used the term Home Nations to describe the parties to the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/WhoWeAre/ContactUs/Player/PossibleTeamGB |title=Possible Team GB? |publisher=official website of the English FA|quote=Ideally we would like to work with the other Home Nations but even if they decide not to take part our commitment is unchanged.|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/london2012/7768436/London-2012-Hugh-Robertson-puts-Home-Nations-football-team-on-agenda.html|title=London 2012: Hugh Robertson puts Home Nations football team on agenda |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby union==
In 1883, the first [[1883 Home Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]] was played between [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. At this point in Ireland's history, the country was still under British rule and therefore these teams were referred to as the Home Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/history.php |title=Official RBS 6 Nations Rugby : History |publisher= [[International Rugby Board|IRB]]|accessdate=12 October 2010|quote=Victory by any Home Nation over the other three Home Nations is a 'Triple Crown'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, [[France national rugby union team|France]] officially joined the competition and it was renamed the Five Nations Championship.  Despite the [[partition of Ireland]] into [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Irish Free State]] (including subsequent political developments leading to the [[Republic of Ireland]]), Ireland continues to have a single team representing the entire island and is therefore sometimes still referred to as a Home Nation - despite not being a Home Nation of the United Kingdom. When France was expelled from the international championship in 1932, the tournament reverted back to being known simply as the Home Nations tournament until the readmission of France immediately after the 1939 tournament, just before World War II caused its suspension until 1947. Since the admission of [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] in 2000, the tournament has been known by its current name, the [[Six Nations Championship]].

Victory by any Home Nation over the other three Home Nations is a [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]]. The Home Nations also contribute players to a unified team known as the [[British and Irish Lions]]. Southern Hemisphere teams who beat all four home nations in one tour are said to have a [[Grand_Slam_(rugby_union)#Grand Slam tours|Grand Slam Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James |last=Mortimer |date=5 April 2010 |url=http://www.allblacks.com/news/12609/A-look-at-the-All-Blacks-touring-Grand-Slams |title=A look at the All Blacks touring Grand Slams|publisher=allblacks.com, the official website of the All Blacks and NZ Rugby|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby League==
The [[Skanska Amateur Four Nations|Amateur Four Nations]] competition in rugby league, run annually from 2002 to 2007 for the A sides of [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]], [[England national rugby league team|England]], [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] and [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]], was also referred to as the &quot;home nations championship&quot;.
