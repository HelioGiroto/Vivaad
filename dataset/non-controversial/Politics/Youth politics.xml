      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8455">'''Youth politics''' is a category of issues which distinctly involve, affect or otherwise impact [[youth]].

==History==
===USA===
With roots in the early [[youth activism]] of the [[Newsboys Strike of 1899|Newsboys]] and [[Mary Harris Jones|Mother Jones]]' [[child labor]] protests at the turn of the 20th century, youth politics were first identified in American politics with the formation of the [[American Youth Congress]] in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 60s organizations such as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] were closely associated with youth politics, despite the broad social statements of documents including the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Port Huron Statement]] and the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Sharon Statement]] and leaders such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. Other late-period figures associated with youth politics include [[Tom Hayden]], [[Marian Wright Edelman]] and [[Bill Clinton]].

{{cquote|Our answer is the world's hope; it is to rely on youth. The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement of danger. It demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. - ''[[Robert F. Kennedy]], South Africa, 6-6-1966''}}

===Europe===
Youth politics have an extensive history in Europe, as well. [[Free German Youth]] was founded in 1936 as a [[communist]] alternative to the [[Nazi Youth]] movement.

In the UK there is a strong youth politics movement, consisting primarily of the [[British Youth Council]], the [[UK Youth Parliament]] and the [[Scottish Youth Parliament]]. Although they have no direct power, the young people in these organisations have a close working relationship with Members of Parliament and are fairly influential, albeit ineffectual at bringing about direct change or tangible objectives.

===Globally===
Other continents have experienced a variety of youth politics and political movements.
Mexico:
In the recent Mexico’s presidence election another manifestation of how the youth take the politics in the actual world were see, the students movement called “Yo soy 132” made a very notory change in how the elections developed, showing proofs of the electoral fraud they thought will happen, they changed the percentage of acceptation of the PRI candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto and they achieved to decrease it around 12 percentage points between the highest poll results for the candidate and the final results of the elections.

==Present==
Between the influence of [[mainstream media]] and [[politicians]], youth politics in the United States has been illegitimated and deprioritized{{Fact|date=March 2008}}. Organizations such as [[National Youth Rights Association]] and [[The Freechild Project]] continue to advocate and educate for issues that affect young people specifically, while other organizations, including [[Youth Service America]] and [[Advocates for Youth]] work for issues that affect youth directly.  The [[children's rights movement]] is widely credited with keeping youth politics on the national radar{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, while other fledgling movements such as [[youth voice]] and [[youth participation]] have yet to gain the spotlight{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.Even with the efforts of these organizations, many college students do not see politics as an important part of their lives.  Only 33% of college freshman think being knowledgeable about politics to be important.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, J.H., Hurtado, S., DeAngelo, L., Palucki Blake,L., &amp; Tran, S. (2009). The American freshman: National norms fall 2009. Los Angeles: Higher Education Research Institute, UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt; Data collected in by the National Center for Education Statistics found that overall young Americans care more about entertainment and sports than political and foreign news. &lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Kathryn. &quot;Students Interest in National News and Its Relation to School Courses.&quot; National Center for Education Statistics (1997): 1-2. National Center for Education Statistics. U.S Department of Education, July 1997. &lt;/ref&gt;Despite these statistics there is a positive outlook on youth involvement in the future because of the 2008 election when President Barack Obama ran.
