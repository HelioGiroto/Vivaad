'''Kingmaker''' is a term originally applied to the activities of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]] — &quot;Warwick the Kingmaker&quot; — during the [[Wars of the Roses]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8568319.stm BBC News: &quot;What is a 'kingmaker'?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has come to be applied more generally to a person or group that has great influence in a [[monarchy|royal]] or political succession, without being a viable candidate.  Kingmakers may use political, monetary, religious, and/or military means to interfere in the succession. They may also be assigned as [[Minister of State without Portfolio]]. Examples include:

*[[Chanakya]] in the [[Mauryan Empire]].
*[[Sayyid Brothers]] in the [[Mughal Empire]].
*[[Vidyaranya]] in the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].
*[[Ricimer]] in the Late [[Western Roman Empire]].
*[[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]] in the [[Wars of the Roses]].
*[[Nogai Khan|Nogai]], [[Mamai]], and [[Edigu]] in the [[Golden Horde]].
*[[Carl Otto Mörner|Baron Carl Otto Mörner]] in the [[House of Bernadotte]] ([[King of Sweden]]).
*[[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]] in late [[Anglo-Saxon England]].
*[[Wiremu Tamihana]] in the [[Māori King Movement]].
*Citizens of [[West Africa]]'s sub-national [[Monarchy|monarchies]] often use the word ''kingmaker'' to refer to the members of the electoral colleges that choose their sovereigns because they also usually officiate during the coronation rituals and rites of purification, the word in this particular case taking on a literal meaning i.e.: a ''Maker'' of the king.

==In game theory==
{{main|Kingmaker scenario}}

In [[game theory]], a kingmaker is a player who lacks sufficient resources or position to win at a given game, but possesses enough remaining resources to decide which of the remaining viable players will eventually win.

==Contemporary usage==
By analogy, &quot;Kingmaker&quot; is also used in some countries to refer to those individuals with the ability to influence the selection of political leaders. The term though always unofficial, has tended to gain more importance in places of power struggle e.g. politics, sports organizations etc. Consequently, bestowement of such a title is looked upon significantly and more often as a means of indirect gratification for individuals wanting to silently dictate the affairs of the organization. The term is also occasionally used in a pejorative sense during elections, where a small number of independent political candidate(s) who hold a sizeable sway in the 'vote bank', can most likely decide the course of an outcome.

Instead of referring to an individual, the term can also be applied to an institution or think tank(s) whose opinions are held in great regard by the interested organization. The influence of the religious orders like the Roman Catholic Church in running the affairs of the state during medieval times (through the King) is a well known example. Kingdoms and Empires in the Indian sub-continent often relied on their religious heads. Besides religious orders, even countries can fit into this terminology when they can dicate the affairs of the other country (either directly or indirectly). In current political scenarios across the world the term can expand its scope to include powerful lobbying groups, whose role is often seen as a defining factor on major issues.

*[[Sarah Palin]] - During the 2010 midterm elections, Sarah Palin endorsed 64 Republicans nationwide.

[[Karen Handel]] and [[Nikki Haley]] to take the lead in the Republican gubernatorial primaries in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]]. This trend, that a candidate went from being in obscurity to leading the primary polls through Sarah Palins endorsement, caused some to claim that Palin is a kingmaker in Republican politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/palin_tracker/ |title=Palin Endorsements Tracker |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christina Bellantoni August 26, 2010, 12:27 PM |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/08/from-grizzlies-to-goatees-sarah-palin-becomes-2010-kingmaker.php |title=Kingmaker: Why Sarah Palin’s Endorsements Really Are That Big A Deal &amp;#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Defrank |first=Thomas |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2009-11-25/news/17938725_1_sarah-palin-kingmaker-gop-establishment |title=Sarah Palin, Kingmaker?
