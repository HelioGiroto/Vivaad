      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20095">'''Slavophilia''' was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the [[Russian Empire]] to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. Slavophiles were especially opposed to the influences of Western Europe in Russia.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068172/Slavophile Encyclopædia Britannica Slavophile article]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also similar movements in Poland, Hungary and Greece. Its opposite is [[Slavophobia]].

== History ==
'''Slavophilism''', as an intellectual movement, was developed in the 19th-century [[Russia]]. In a sense there was not one but many Slavophile movements, or many branches of the same movement. Some were to the left of the political spectrum, noting that progressive ideas such as [[democracy]] were intrinsic to the Russian experience, as proved by what they considered to be the rough democracy of medieval [[Novgorod]]. Some were to the right of the spectrum and pointed to the centuries-old tradition of the [[autocratic]] [[Tsar]] as being the essence of the Russian nature. The Slavophiles were determined to protect what they believed were unique Russian traditions and culture. In doing so, they rejected [[individualism]]. The role of the [[Orthodox Church]] was seen by them as more significant than the role of the state. [[Socialism]] was opposed by Slavophiles as an alien thought, and Russian [[mysticism]] was preferred over &quot;[[Western Europe|Western]] [[rationalism]]&quot;. Rural life was praised by the movement, opposing [[industrialization]] as well as urban development, while protection of the &quot;[[Obshchina|mir]]&quot; was seen as an important measure to prevent growth of the working class.&lt;ref name=Nye&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1877864161&amp;id=_e-eHEVlBJEC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;vq=slavophiles&amp;dq=from+nyet+to+da&amp;sig=rVaMbKlztRBZ04MQXdwAszBiQf8&amp;hl=en From Nyet to Da: understanding the Russians, page 65] by Yale Richmond, Intercultural Press; 3rd edition (January 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement originated in [[Moscow]] in the 1830s. Drawing on the works of Greek [[Church Fathers|patristics]], the poet [[Aleksey Khomyakov]] (1804–60) and his devoutly [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] colleagues elaborated a traditionalistic doctrine that claimed Russia has its own distinct way, which doesn't have to imitate and mimic &quot;Western&quot; institutions. The Russian Slavophiles denounced modernization by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], and some of them even adopted traditional pre-Petrine dress.

[[Andrei Okara]] argues that the 19th century classification of social thought into three groups, the Westernizers, the Slavophiles and the Conservatives also fits well into the realities of the political and social situation in modern Russia. According to him, examples of modern-day slavophiles include the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], [[Dmitry Rogozin]] and [[Sergei Glazyev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/number/n_9123|last1=Okara|first1=Andrei|journal=Russia in Global Affairs|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doctrine ==
The doctrines of [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], [[Ivan Kireevsky]] (1806–56), [[Konstantin Aksakov]] (1817–60) and other Slavophiles had a deep impact on Russian culture, including the [[Russian Revival]] school of architecture, [[The Five (composers)|The Five]] of Russian composers, the novelist [[Nikolai Gogol]], the poet [[Fyodor Tyutchev]], the lexicographer [[Vladimir Dahl]], and others. Their struggle for purity of the [[Russian language]] had something in common with ascetic views of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. The doctrine of [[Sobornost]], the term for organic unity, intregration, was coined by Ivan Kireevsky and Aleksey Khomyakov. This was to underline the need for cooperation between people, at the expense of individualism on the basis that the opposing groups focus on what is common between them.

In the sphere of practical politics, the Slavophilism manifested itself as a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic movement]] for the unification of all Slavic people under leadership of the Russian [[tsar]] and for the independence of the [[Balkan]] Slavs from Ottoman rule. The [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78]] is usually considered a high point of this militant Slavophilism, as expounded by the charismatic commander [[Mikhail Skobelev]]. The attitude towards other nations with Slavic origins varied, depending on the group involved. Classical Slavophiles believed that &quot;Slavdom&quot;, that is the alleged by Slavophile movement common identity to all people of Slavic origin, was based on [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religion.&lt;ref name=Meta&gt;&quot;Classical Russian Slavophiles often conflated language and religion, equating Slavdom with Orthodoxy&quot;

Lewis, Kären E. Wigen, University of California Press; 1 edition (August 11, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Empire, besides containing Russians, ruled over millions of Ukrainians, Poles and Belarussians, who had their own national identities, traditions and religions. Towards Ukrainians and Belarussians, the Slavophiles developed the view that they were part of the same &quot;Great Russian&quot; nation, Belarussians being the &quot;White Russians&quot; and Ukrainians &quot;Little Russians&quot;. Slavophile thinkers such as [[Mikhail Katkov]] believed that both nations should be ruled under Russian leadership and were an essential part of the Russian state.&lt;ref name=Volod&gt;[http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/acta/16/volodymyr/volodymyr-1.html The Image of Ukraine and the Ukrainians in Russian Political Thought (1860-1945)] by Volodymyr A. Potulnytskyi, ACTA SLAVICA IAPONICA, Volume 16 (1998) Journal of Slavic Research Center, Hokkaido University&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time they denied the separate cultural identity of Ukrainian and Belarussian people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Volod&quot;/&gt; believing their national as well as language and literary aspirations were a result of &quot;Polish intrigue&quot; that aimed at separating them from Russians.&lt;ref name=Tow&gt;
[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0838630138&amp;id=1JGTkzEk79oC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=polish+intrigue&amp;sig=B_9NfVr1oTTKJQJLOJzF0lCV_Yk Toward a United States of Russia: Plans and Projects of Federal Reconstruction of Russia in the Nineteenth Century page 137] by Dimitri Von Mohrenschildt, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Other Slavophiles like Ivan Aksakov recognized the right of Ukrainians to use the [[Ukrainian language]], however seeing it as completely unnecessary and harmful.&lt;ref name=Leto&gt;Sovremennaia Letopis', No. XVII, 1861, pp. 124-125. &quot;I do not believe in a possibility of creating a Malorussian common literary language, except for purely popular works of art, and I do not see any possibility of that, and I do not want and I cannot want any artificial attempts to destroy the wholeness of common Russian development, the attempts to lead the Malorussian artists away from writing in the Russian language. Thank God, that Gogol' had lived and worked before these demands appeared: we would have no &quot;Mertvye Dushi&quot;; you, or Kulish, would have fettered him with a tribal egoism and would have narrowed his horizon with the outlook of a single tribe! But, of course, no one of us has ever wanted or intended to stand in your way. Write as much as you please, translate Shakespeare and Schiller into the Malorussian dialect, dress Homer's characters and Greek gods in a Malorussian free-and-easy sheepskin coat (kozhukh)!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
Aksakov, however, did see some practical use for the &quot;Malorussian&quot; language: it would be beneficial in the struggle against the &quot;Polish civilizational element in the western provinces&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volod&quot;/&gt;

Besides Ukrainians and Belarussians, the Russian Empire also included Poles, whose country had disappeared after being [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by three neighboring states, including Russia, which after decisions of the [[Congress of Vienna]] expanded into more Polish-inhabited territories. Poles proved to be a problem for the ideology of Slavophilism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dmitry&quot;&gt;&quot;For generations Poles had been a sort of embarrassment for Russian nationalism. Indeed the core of Russian nationalism since the middle of the nineteenth century was an idea of Slavophilism. This ideology (as many others) was inconsistent. On the one hand their representatives emphasized [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodoxy]] as the essential characteristic of the Slav, credited for the Slavs' benign characteristics. On the other hand, the very term Slavophilism implied that the benign characteristics of the Slavs stemmed from their ethnicity which had nothing to do with Orthodoxy. This explanation also implied the political unity of the Slavs, or at least their mutual gravitation Cliff Hanger to each other, and here Poles were an endless embarrassment.&quot;
Reassessment of the Relationship: Polish History and the Polish Question in the Imperial Duma Journal article by Dmitry Shlapentokh; East European Quarterly, Vol. 33, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The very name Slavophiles indicated that the characteristics of the Slavs were based on their ethnicity, but at the same time Slavophiles believed that [[Orthodoxy]] equaled Slavdom. This belief was belied by very existence of Poles within the Russian Empire, who - while having Slavic origins - were also deeply [[Roman Catholic]], the Catholic faith forming one of the core values of Polish national identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedro&quot;&gt;&quot;It was after the partitions that the Polish church became the symbol of Polishness in the eyes of practically all Poles. Massive [[Russification]] following the uprising in 1832 practically eliminated all Polish institutions and made Russian dominance of public life in Russian life in the Russian areas practically universal. What was left was the Catholic church. It became the symbol of Polishness and Polish resistance, with every move taken by St. Petersburg to weaken it interpreted as a further attempt to eradicate the Polish nation from the face of the earth(...). Under those circumstances being Catholic was not only a religious but also nationalistic &quot;duty&quot;.&quot;
[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0822308916&amp;id=50GTIhntKvYC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=polish+church+1863+symbol&amp;sig=PdderXGDJHXAZ_64wvroPuAiUzU Religion and Nationalism in Soviet and East European Politics Page 51] by Pedro Ramet, Duke University Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while Slavophiles praised the leadership of Russia over other nations of Slavic origin, the Poles' very identity was based on Western European culture and values, and resistance to Russia was seen by them as resistance to something representing an alien way of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Country&quot;&gt;
&quot;From its beginning, Poland drew its primary inspiration from Western Europe and developed a closer affinity with the French and Italians, for example, than with nearer Slavic neighbors of Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine heritage. Gladas Hanger This westward orientation, which in some ways has made Poland the easternmost outpost of Latinate and Catholic tradition, helps to explain the Poles' tenacious sense of belonging to the &quot;West&quot; and their deeply rooted antagonism toward Russia as the representative of an essentially alien way of life.&quot; [http://countrystudies.us/poland/5.htm U.S. Library of Congress, Country Study Poland]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result Slavophiles were particularly hostile to the Polish nation, often emotionally attacking it in their writings&lt;ref name=&quot;Dmitr&quot;&gt;&quot;The Slavophiles were quite virulent in their attacks on the Poles. According to Iurii F. Samarin, Poland was transformed into a &quot;sharp wedge driven by Latinism&quot; into the very heart of the Slavonic soul with the aim of &quot;splitting it into fragments.&quot;(1) Nikolai Ia. Danilevsky, the late Slavophile, dubbed Poland the &quot;Jesuitical gentry state of Poland&quot; and that &quot;Judas of Slavdom,&quot; which he compared to a hideous tarantula greedily devouring its eastern neighbor but unaware that its own body is being eaten by its Western neighbors.(2) Fedor I. Tiutchev, one of the leading Russian poets, also called Poles &quot;Judas of Slavdom.&quot;(3)&quot;

When [[January Uprising|the Polish uprising of 1863]] started, Slavophiles used [[anti-Polish sentiment]] to create feelings of national unity in the Russian people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;&gt;The popular anti-Polish and anti-European feelings were captured by Slavophile writers such as Katkov, to create national solidarity. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0275953378&amp;id=Lvjw9K8zRwIC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=anti-Polish+and+anti-European+feelings&amp;sig=gvdZKKiJ6app_WJmYLpKzPUVZ8c Russian Imperialism: Development and Crisis page 54] by Ariel Cohen, Praeger Publishers (August 30, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea of cultural union of all Slavs was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foreign&quot;&gt;..rather than emphasizing the cultural union of all Slavs (as the Slavophiles did until the idea fell apart amid the Polish uprisings of the 1860s) [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19990301facomment963/charles-clover/dreams-of-the-eurasian-heartland-the-reemergence-of-geopolitics.html Dreams of the Eurasian Heartland: The Reemergence of Geopolitics Charles Clover March/April 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; With that Poland became firmly established to Slavophiles as symbol of Catholicism and Western Europe, that they detested,&lt;ref name=&quot;Impr&quot;&gt;&quot;
The Polish nation from this time on was to Slavophiles the embodiment of the detested Western Europe Dale and of the detested Catholicism.&quot;
[http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC00467165&amp;id=h4HY3nt1fCoC&amp;q=slavophiles+Poland&amp;dq=slavophiles+Poland&amp;pgis=1 Impressions of Russia] by Georg Morris Cohen Brandes, T. Y. Crowell &amp; co 1889&lt;/ref&gt; and as Poles were never assimilated within the Russian Empire, constantly resisting Russian occupation of their country, in the end Slavophiles came to believe that annexation of Poland was a mistake due to the fact that the Polish nation could not be [[Russification|Russified]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trenin&quot;&gt;
&quot;Of course, the Poles were never really integrated, and were a constant thorn in the side for St. Petersburg. Regular uprisings and revolutions made Russian control of the Vistula provinces tenuous at best. True Slavophiles like [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] regarded the annexation of Poland as a mistake, saddling Russia with a powerful and hostile element, never to be truly Russified.&quot; [http://www.carnegie.ru/en/pubs/books/2129dt0103all.pdf The End of Eurasia: Russia on the Border Between Geopolitics and Globalization] by Dmitri Trenin, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;After the struggle with Poles, Slavophiles expressed their belief, that notwithstanding the goal of conquering Constantinople, the future conflict would be between the &quot;[[Nordic race|Teutonic race]]&quot; (Germans), and &quot;Slavs&quot;, and the movement turned into [[Germanophobia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coh&quot;&gt;
&quot;Once the Polish threat was over, the Slavophiles formulated another set of goals. Without renouncing the 300-year-long objective of seizing Constantinople and the Straits, they argued that the coming clash would be between the Slavs and Teutons(Germans).&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0275953378&amp;id=Lvjw9K8zRwIC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;vq=teutons&amp;dq=russian+imperialism&amp;sig=gvdZKKiJ6app_WJmYLpKzPUVZ8c Russian Imperialism: Development and Crisis page 54],
&quot;Thus Slavophilia transformed itself into Germanophobia.&quot;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0275953378&amp;id=Lvjw9K8zRwIC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;vq=germanophobia&amp;dq=russian+imperialism&amp;sig=gKpbFW4PUBmuYU7dd9IeFao5Qx0 page 55] by Ariel Cohen, Praeger Publishers 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that most Slavophiles were [[Liberalism|liberals]] and ardently supported the emancipation of serfs, which was finally realized in the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. Press [[censorship]], [[serfdom]], and [[capital punishment]] were viewed as baneful influences of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky ISBN 978-0-8236-8074-0 p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Their political ideal was a [[parliamentary monarchy]], as represented by the medieval [[Zemsky Sobor]]s.

== Post serfdom ==
After serfdom was abolished in Russia and the end of the uprising in Poland, Slavophilism began to degenerate and turned into narrow-minded Russian aggressive nationalism.{citation needed} New Slavophile thinkers appeared in the 1870s and 1880s, represented by scholars such as N. [[Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev|K. Leontiev]]. Danilevsky promoted autocracy and imperialistic expansion as part of Russian national interest. Leontiev believed in a police state ideology aimed at preventing European influences from reaching Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parland&quot;&gt;
&quot;After abolition of serfdom in 1861, and the Polish rebellion of 1863 Slavophilism began to degenerate and became narrow-minded and aggressive kind of Russian nationalism.
The second generation of Slavophilism appeared in the 1870s and 1880s in the shape of N. Danilevsky and K. Leontiev. The former equated Russia's national interests with autocracy and expansionistic imperialism. K. Leontiev-the leading ideologist in the 1880s-launched some kind of police state ideology in order to save Russia from West European influences.&quot;

== ''Pochvennichestvo'' ==
{{main|Pochvennichestvo}}
Later writers [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Konstantin Leontyev]], and [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] developed a peculiar conservative version of Slavophilism called ''[[pochvennichestvo]]'' (from the Russian word for soil). This teaching, as articulated by [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]] ([[Ober-Procurator]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]), was adopted as the official [[Tsarist]] [[ideology]] during the reigns of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Even after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], it was further developed by the [[émigré]] religious philosophers like [[Ivan Ilyin]] (1883–1954).

Many of the Slavophiles influenced prominent [[Cold War]] thinkers such as [[George F. Kennan]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, instilling in them a love for the [[Russian Empire]] as opposed to the [[Soviet Union]]. This in turn influenced their foreign policy ideas, such as Kennan's belief that the revival of the [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Russian Orthodox Patriarchate]] in 1943 would lead to the reform or overthrow of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s dictatorship.
