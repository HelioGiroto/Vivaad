      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28691">'''Leaderless resistance''', or '''phantom cell''' structure, is a [[Rebellion|political resistance]] [[strategy]] in which small, independent groups ([[Clandestine cell system|covert cells]]), including individuals (solo cells), challenge an established adversary such as a government. Leaderless resistance can encompass anything from non-violent disruption and [[civil disobedience]] to [[bomb]]ings, [[assassination]]s and other violent [[agitator|agitation]]. Leaderless cells lack bidirectional, vertical command links and operate without hierarchal command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Simson Garfinkel]] | title = Leaderless resistance today | url = http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1040| accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it lacks a central command, the concept does not necessarily imply lack of cooperation.

Given the simplicity of the strategy, as well as the fact that it is difficult to stamp out, leaderless resistance has been employed by a wide-range of movements, from [[terrorism|terrorist]] and [[hate group]]s, to the [[animal-liberation movement]], [[radical environmentalism|radical environmental movement]], as well as [[anti-globalization movement|anti-corporate]] and [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]] activists.

==General characteristics==
A typical covert cell operates as anything from a lone individual to a small group. The basic characteristic of the structure is that there is no explicit communication between cells which are otherwise acting toward the same goals. Members of one cell usually have little or no specific information on who else is agitating on behalf of their cause.

Leaderless movements may have symbolic figureheads. It can be a public figure or an inspirational author, who picks generic targets and objectives, but does not actually manage or execute plans. [[Mass media|Media]], in this case, often create a [[positive feedback loop]]: the publishing of declarations of a movement’s role model instills motivation, ideas and assumed sympathy in the minds of potential agitators who lend further authority to the figurehead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} While this may be loosely viewed as a vertical command structure, it is notably unidirectional: a titular leader makes pronouncements, and activists may respond, but there is no established contact between the two levels of organization.

As a result, leaderless resistance cells are largely insusceptible to [[informant]]s and [[traitor]]s. As there is neither a center that may be destroyed, nor links between the cells that may be infiltrated, it is more difficult for established authorities to arrest the development of a leaderless resistance movement than more conventional hierarchies.

Given its asymmetrical character and the fact that it is often strategically adopted in the face of an obvious institutional power imbalance, leaderless resistance has much in common with [[guerrilla warfare]]. The latter strategy, however, usually retains some form of organized, bidirectional leadership and is often more broad-based than the individualized actions of leaderless cells. In some cases, a largely leaderless movement may evolve into a coherent [[insurgency]] or guerrilla movement, as successfully occurred with the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav partisans]] of [[World War II]]. In the same conflict, the [[United Kingdom|British]] leadership had extensive plans for the use of such resistance in the event of a successful [[Operation Sealion|German invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = British Resistance Organisation | title = History | url = http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/brohistory.html | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of leaderless resistance is often based on resistance by violent means, it is not limited to them. The same structure can be used by [[nonviolence|non-violent]] groups authoring, printing, and distributing [[samizdat]] literature, using the internet to create self-propagating [[boycotts]] against political opponents, maintaining an alternative electronic currency outside of the reach of the taxing governments and transaction-logging banks, etc. &lt;!-- cf. cypherpunks --&gt;

==History==
The concept of leaderless resistance was reportedly developed by Col. [[Ulius Louis Amoss]], a former [[U.S. intelligence]] officer, in the early 1960s. An [[anti-communist]], Amoss saw leaderless resistance as a backup for the possibility of a [[communist]] seizure of power in the [[United States]].

The concept was revived and popularized in an essay published by the anti-government [[Ku Klux Klan]] member [[Louis Beam]] in 1983 and again in 1992. Beam advocated leaderless resistance as a technique for [[white nationalism|white nationalists]] to continue the struggle against the [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. government]], despite an overwhelming imbalance in power and resources. In the same year, the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) was formed as an [[eco-resistance]] movement.

Beam argued that conventional [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] pyramidal organizations are extremely dangerous for their participants, when employed in a resistance movement against government, because of the ease of disclosing the [[chain of command]]. A more workable approach would be to convince the like-minded individuals to form independent cells, without close communication between each other, but generally operating in the same direction.

==In practice==

===Animal liberation===

[[Image:Hornebeagles.jpg|right|thumb|An [[Animal Liberation Front|ALF]] raid removing 82 beagles and 26 rabbits from [[Harlan (company)|Interfauna]] in Cambridge on [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick's Night]] 1990.&lt;ref name=Arkangel&gt;[http://www.directaction.info/barry/barry.htm &quot;The man, the activist&quot;], first published in ''[[Arkangel (magazine)|Arkangel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Huntingdonmarch.jpg|thumb|A protest march in [[Huntingdon]] by [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]], November 10, 2007.]]

The first recorded [[direct action]] for [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] which progressed into a movement of leaderless resistance was by the ''original'' Band of Mercy in 1824 to thwart [[fox hunters]].&lt;ref name=Best&gt;Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters'', Lantern Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this group and after seeing a pregnant deer driven into the village by fox hunters to be killed, John Prestige decided to actively oppose this sport and formed the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] (HSA) in 1964. Within a year, a leaderless model of hunt-sabotage groups was formed across the country.&lt;ref name=Best/&gt;

The [[Band of Mercy]] was then formed in 1972 using direct action to liberate animals and cause economic sabotage against those thought to be abusing animals. [[Ronnie Lee]] and others then changed the name to the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) in 1976 and the leaderless resistance model focusing broadly on animal liberation was born.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Robin. &quot;Animal Liberation — By 'Whatever Means Necessary',&quot; in Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 77.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth First!]] and the [[environmental movement]] in the 1980s adopted the leaderless resistance model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Southern Poverty Law Center | title = From Push to Shove | url = http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst those in the animal liberation movement advocating violence emerged with activists using the name [[Animal Rights Militia]] (ARM) in 1982. Letter bombs were sent to the then [[British Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], with two years later the name [[Hunt Retribution Squad]] (HRS) also being used.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. [http://www.utilitarian.org/texts/alm.html The Animal Liberation Movement: Its philosophy, its achievements and its future]. ''Retrieved on 2007-11-09.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article495376.ece?token=null&amp;offset=24 &quot;Focus: Desecrated&quot;], ''Times Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) was then formed in 1992, which broke from Earth First! when the organization decided to focus on advocating public direct action, instead of [[ecotage]] that the ELF participated in,&lt;ref&gt;Alleyne, Richard. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/01/19/ncam119.xml &quot;Terror tactics that brought a company to its knees&quot;], ''The Daily Telegraph'', January 19, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; whilst a [[violent]] group was established called the [[Justice Department (animal rights group)|Justice Department]] in 1993, who in 1994, sent razor blades to hunters such as [[Prince Charles]] and [[animal research]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/902751.stm &quot;Animal rights, terror tactics&quot;, ''BBC News'', 30 August, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 &quot;From push to shove&quot;, ''Southern Poverty Law Group Intelligence Report'', Fall 2002, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the strategy was then actively employed by animal liberation organisations [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC), formed from the [[Consort beagles]] campaign and [[Save the Hill Grove Cats]] to close down [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (HLS). Despite claiming successes &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shac.net/MISC/quantum Quantum Analytics: Drop HLS], ''[[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty|SHAC]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; leaderless animal liberation and environmental movements generally lack the broad popular support that often occurs in strictly political or military conflicts. The [[Revolutionary Cells (RCALB)|Revolutionary Cells--Animal Liberation Brigade]] (RCALB) then appeared in 2003 and sent pipe bombs to [[Chiron Corporation]] as well as using [[incendiary device]]s against similar campaign targets, whilst a year later on the south coast of [[Dorset]] in 2004, the [[Lobster Liberation Front]] (LLF) was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/dorset/3939111.stm &quot;Activists' 'war' to save lobsters&quot;, ''BBC News'', July 30, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years of the victories claimed by the SHAC, other campaigns against animal testing laboratories emerged. At the same time, [[SPEAK (animals)|SPEAK Campaigns]] and the more radical ALF militants, [[Oxford Arson Squad]] began their campaigns for the same goal; to end [[Oxford University]]'s animal research.

In April 2009, the [[Militant Forces Against Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (MFAH) became active, when along with the ALF, they began targeting HLS customer and financial Directors, as well as company property. Since then, groups have reported over a dozen actions in Europe, including painting homes, burning cars and grave desecration. Militants, however oppose ALF ideology, instead believing in [[By any means necessary|any necessary action]] to prevent suffering at HLS' laboratories.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfah1&quot;&gt;[http://www.directaction.info/news_apr07_09.htm MFAH Communique: April 7th 2009], ''[[Bite Back Magazine]]'', 7th April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamists===
Leaderless resistance is also often well-suited to terrorist objectives. The [[Islamist terrorism|Islamist]] organization [[Al-Qaeda]] provides a prototypical figurehead/leaderless cell structure. The organization itself may be pyramidal, but sympathizers who act on its pronouncements often do so spontaneously and independently.

Given the small, clandestine character of terrorist cells, it is easy to assume they necessarily constitute leaderless resistance models. Where a bidirectional affiliation occurs, however, the label is inappropriate. The men who executed the bombings of the [[London Underground]] on July 7, 2005 constituted a leaderless resistance cell in that they purportedly acted out of sympathy for [[Islamic fundamentalism]] but under their own auspices. The hijackers involved in the [[September 11 attacks]], by contrast, allegedly received training, direction, and funding from Al-Qaeda, and are not properly designated a leaderless cell.

===Internet activism===
{{Main|Internet activism}}
The Internet, being an easy and instant way to communicate, makes it an excellent tool for leaderless resistance. [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]'s [[Project Chanology]] used the Internet to plan protests against the [[Church of Scientology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
{{See also|Patriot hacking}}

===Neo-Nazis===
The concept of leaderless resistance remains important to much far right thinking in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Paul de Armond | title = Putting the Far Right into Perspective | url = http://www.publicgood.org/reports/spectrum/ | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both in response to Amoss' initial fear (foreign forces on U.S. soil) but increasingly also — in line with Beam — as a response to perceived federal government over-reach at the expense of individual rights. The actions of [[Timothy McVeigh]] are perhaps the most extreme example in the [[United States]]. McVeigh acted largely alone, but based on motivations widespread amongst the far-right anti-government and militia movement.

Leaderless resistance is not only used toward anti-government ends on the far right. Xenophobic organizations such as [[White Aryan Resistance]] and the British neo-Nazi [[Combat 18]] have adopted and advocate the tactic. The modern [[Ku Klux Klan]] is also credited with having developed a leaderless resistance model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = University of Michigan | title = Right-Wing Domestic Terrorism | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/agenda/9909/06.pdf | accessdate = May 7, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Troy Southgate]] also advocated forms of leaderless resistance during his time as a leading activist in the [[National Revolutionary Faction]] and a pioneer of [[National-Anarchism]].

[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]], [[Aryan Nations]], and [[Hammerskin Nation]] link to Beam's ''Leaderless Resistance''. These extremist groups promote a lone wolf mentality. While nominally decrying violence, the sites praise the man who &quot;practices what he preaches, and who backs up his words with his deeds.&quot;&lt;ref name=recruitment&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Recruitment by Extremist Groups on the Internet | accessdate = January 18, 2009| url = http://outreach.lib.uic.edu/www/issues/issue6_2/ray/ |journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |month=February |year=2001 |first=Beverly |last=Ray |coauthors=George E. Marsh II}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stormfront, while regretting the loss of life, explains how [[Benjamin Nathaniel Smith]]'s 1998 killing spree was compelled by circumstances. The [[World Church of the Creator]] presents a mixed message, calling Smith &quot;a selfless man who gave his life in the resistance to Jewish/mud tyranny,&quot; but noting &quot;the Church does not condone his acts.&quot;&lt;ref name=recruitment/&gt;

===Radical environmentalism===
{{Main|Radical environmentalism}}
:''Further information: [[Ecotage]], [[Eco-terrorism]], [[Monkeywrenching]], and [[Earth liberation]]''
The first identified leaderless resistance in the environmental movement was when explosive and [[incendiary device]]s were used in 1976, by [[John Hanna (activist)|John Hanna]] and others as the [[Environmental Life Force]] (ELF), also now known as the ''original ELF''. The group conducted a campaign of armed actions in northern [[California]] and [[Oregon]], later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna's arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the [[Salinas, California]] airport on [[May Day]], 1977.&lt;ref name=elf&gt;[http://www.originalelf.org Original ELF]&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until over a decade and a half later that this form of [[guerrilla warfare]] resurfaced using the same [[acronym]].
[[Image:Earthfirstmonkeywrench.gif|thumb|right|180px|The symbol of [[Earth First!]]: a Monkey wrench and stone hammer.]]

In 1980 [[Earth First!]] was then founded by [[Dave Foreman]] and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the [[Edward Abbey]] novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;, Earth First! made use of such techniques as [[treesitting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penbay.org/ef/treesit_first1985.html Earth First's first treesitting civil disobedience action], ''Earth First! 1985'', Oregon, June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[treespiking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html Tree Spiking Memo], ''Earth First!'', April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; to stop [[logging]] companies, as well as other activities targeted towards [[mining]], [[road]] construction,&lt;ref name=&quot;wall&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Earth First! and the Anti-Roads Movement: Radical Environmentalism and Comparative Social Movements | last = Wall | first = Derek | year = 1999 | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[suburb]]an development and [[Energy development|energy companies]].

The organization were committed to nonviolent [[ecotage]] techniques from the group's inception, with those that split from the movement in the 1990s including the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) in 1992, naming themselves after the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) who formed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/tree/16/fire.html ELF Burns Down Vail], ''FIRE'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in [[Canada]], inspired by the ELF in [[Europe]] the first ''Earth Liberation'' [[direct action]] occurred, but this time as the [[Earth Liberation Army]] (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and [[monkeywrenching]] as a tool, although no guidelines had been published.
The ELF gained national attention for a series of actions which earned them the label of [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://prfamerica.org/EarthLiberationFrontNo1onFBIList.html Earth Liberation Front is now FBI's No. 1 Domestic Terrorist Threat], ''Property Rights of America Foundation Inc'', March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthliberationfront.com/elf_news.htm ELF News], ''Earth Liberation Front''&lt;/ref&gt; including the burning of a [[ski]] resort in [[Vail, Colorado]] in 1998, and the burning of an [[SUV]] dealership in [[Oregon]] in 1999. In the same year the ELA had made headlines by setting fire to the [[Vail Resorts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], causing $12 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_36_15/ai_56063251 waste &amp; abuse - controversy over a temporary dirt road built by Vail Resortsand its effect on wetlands], ''BNet'', September 27th 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants in the case were later charged in the [[FBI]]'s &quot;[[Operation Backfire (FBI)|Operation Backfire]]&quot;, along with other arsons and cases, which were later named by environmentalists as the [[Green Scare]]; alluding to the [[Red Scare]], periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S.&lt;ref name=opb&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm Eco-Terror Indictments: &quot;Operation Backfire&quot; Nets 11], [[FBI]], January 20th 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedom4um.com/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=69570 Resentencing date set for Jeff Luers], ''Freedom4um'', 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] several laws were passed increasing the penalty for ecoterrorism, and hearings were held in Congress discussing the activity of groups such as the ELF. To date no one has been killed as a result of an ELF or ALF action since both groups forbid harming human or non-human life.&lt;ref name=rel&gt;[[Bron Taylor]], 1998. Religion, Violence and Radical Environmentalism: From Earth First! to the Unabomber to the Earth Liberation Front, &lt;cite&gt;Terrorism and Political Violence&lt;/cite&gt; 10(4):1-42&lt;/ref&gt; It was then announced in 2003 that ''&quot;[[eco-terrorist]]&quot;'' attacks, known as ''&quot;[[ecotage]]&quot;'', had increased from the ELF, ELA and the ''&quot;Environmental Rangers&quot;'', another name used be activists when engaging in similar activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1101/1101ecoterrorist.htm The eco-terrorist anthrax connection], ''ESR'', October 21st 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005 the FBI announced that the ELF, is America's greatest domestic terrorist threat, responsible for over 1,200 &quot;criminal incidents&quot; amounting to tens of millions of dollars in damage to property,&lt;ref name=sb3&gt;[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] and Best &amp; Nocella. ''Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth'', [[Lantern Books]], 2006, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; with the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] confirming this regarding the ALF and ELF.&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/19/domestic.terrorism/index.html FBI, ATF address domestic terrorism], ''[[CNN]]'', May 19th 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plane Stupid]] then was launched in 2005, in an attempt to combat the growing airport expansions in the UK using [[direct action]] with a year later the first [[Camp for Climate Action]] being held with 600 people attending a protest called ''Reclaim Power'' converging on [[Drax power station|Drax Power Station]] in [[North Yorkshire]] and attempted to shut it down. There were thirty-eight arrests, with four breaching the fence and the railway line being blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article1223134.ece|title=The Battle of Drax: 38 held as protest fails to close plant|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2006-09-01 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Brown | accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1862662,00.html|title=In the shadow of Drax, not so much a fight as a festival|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2006-09-01 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-abortion militancy===
Anti-abortion [[militant (disambiguation)|militant]]s The [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]] uses leaderless resistance as its organizing principle.

==Countermeasures==
&lt;!-- Based on the [[Simson Garfinkel]]'s &quot;Leaderless Resistance Today&quot; paper. --&gt;

===Network analysis in classical setting===
The [[social network]]s based on leaderless resistance are potentially vulnerable to [[social network analysis]] and its derivative [[link analysis]]. Link analysis of social networks is the fundamental reason for the ongoing legislative push in the [[U.S.]] and the [[European Union]] &lt;!-- and elsewhere (where?) --&gt; for mandatory [[Telecommunications data retention|retention of telecommunication traffic data]] and limiting access to [[Anonymity|anonymous]] [[Prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]] [[Mobile phone|cellphones]], as the stored data contain important network analysis clues.
{{See also|NSA call database}}

Network analysis was successfully used by French Colonel [[Yves Godard (French officer)|Yves Godard]] to break the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|Algerian resistance]] between 1955 and 1957 and force them to cease the [[bombing]] campaigns. The Algerian conflict maybe better described as guerrilla in nature rather than leaderless resistance (see ''Modern Warfare'' by Col. Roger Trinquier). The mapping data was obtained by the use of [[informant]]s and [[torture]] and were used to obtain the identities of important individuals in the resistance; these were then [[assassination|assassinated]], disrupting the Algerian resistance networks. The more distinctive the individual is in the adversary's network, the more difficult it is to replace them and the greater the damage. France declared Algeria independent on July 3, 1962.

===Advantages for leaderless resistance===
Traditional organizations leave behind much evidence of their activities, such as money trails, and training and recruitment material. Leaderless resistances, as they are as much [[ideology|ideologies]] as organizations, generally lack such traces. The effects of their operations, globally reported by the [[mass media]], act as a sort of messaging and recruitment advertising.

The internet provides investigators with further challenges. The individual cells (and even a single person can be a cell) can communicate over the internet, anonymously or semi-anonymously publishing and sharing information online, to be found by others through well-known websites. Even where legally and technically possible to ascertain who accessed what, it is often practically impossible to discern in reasonable timeframe who is a real threat and who is just curious, a journalist, or a [[web crawler]].

Despite these advantages, leaderless resistance is often unstable. If the actions are not frequent enough or not successful, the stream of public messages, serving as the recruiting, motivation and coordination drives for other cells, diminishes. If the actions are too successful, the result will be formation of [[support group]]s and other [[social structure]]s—structures vulnerable to network analysis.
