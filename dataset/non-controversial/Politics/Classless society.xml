{{Anarcho-communism}}

'''Classless society''' refers to a [[society]] in which no one is born into a [[social class]]. Such distinctions of [[wealth]], [[income]], [[education]], [[culture]], or [[social network]] might arise and would only be determined by individual experience and achievement in such a society.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

Since these distinctions are difficult to avoid, advocates, such as [[Anarchists]], [[communists]], etc. of a classless society propose various means to achieve and maintain it and attach varying degrees of importance to it as an end in their overall programs/philosophy.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

==Classlessness==

The term '''classlessness''' has been used to describe different social phenomena.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

In societies where classes have been abolished it is usually the result of a voluntary decision by the membership to form such a [[society]], to abolish a pre-existing class structure in an existing society or to form a new one without any. This would include [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]s, of the modern period, such as various Utopian communities, the [[kibbutz]]im, etc. as well as revolutionary and political acts at the [[nation-state]] level such as the [[Paris Commune]], [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], etc. The abolition of social classes and the establishment of a classless society is the primary  goal of [[communism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and most forms of [[anarchism]].{{cn|date=January 2012}}

Classlessness also refers to the state of mind required in order to operate effectively as a [[social anthropology|social anthropologist]]. Anthropological training includes making assessments of and therefore becoming aware of one's own class assumptions, so that these can be set aside from conclusions reached about other societies. This may be compared to [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] biases or the &quot;[[axiology|neutral axiology]]&quot; required by [[Max Weber]]. Otherwise conclusions reached about studied societies will likely be coloured by the anthropologist's own class values.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

Classlessness can also refer to a society that has acquired pervasive and substantial [[social justice]]; where the economic [[upper class]] wields no special political power and [[poverty]] as experienced historically is virtually nonexistent. Some [[Scandinavia]]n countries are held to have reached this state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Marxist definition==
In [[Marxist]] theory, tribal [[hunter-gatherer]] society, [[primitive communism]], was [[social class|classless]]. Everyone was equal in a basic sense as a member of the tribe and the different functional assignments of the primitive mode of production, howsoever rigid and stratified they might be, did not and could not, simply because of the numbers, produce a class society as such. With the transition to [[agriculture]], the possibility to make a [[surplus product]], i.e. to produce more than what is necessary to satisfy one's immediate needs, developed in the course of development of the [[productive forces]]. According to Marxism, this also made it possible for a [[class society]] to develop, because the surplus product could be used to nourish a ruling class, which did not participate in production.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

The surplus product was stored for a time of distress in special repositories, which then also had to be guarded. Especially during these times the stored products had to be defended against the immediate fears of the population, so that they were not all consumed right away. The people who did this, could, therefore, also decide if someone was not to be fed. They had to be more powerful than the masses of the population. The ruling class was born – hence the [[negation]] of the classless society, or the first negation.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

There are three societies that followed the classless tribal society.  First, there was ancient society, in which the major class distinction was between master and slave.  Then, there was feudal society, in which lord and serf played the roles of class war.  The last stage of class society is bourgeois society, or capitalism, in which it has been simplified to owner and worker. According to Marx, there should be a classless society once again at the end of the development of [[productive forces]], specifically through the development of infrastructure and production technology. Class society, would be ''[[Aufheben|sublated]]'', the Hegelian circuit completed, as the productive forces burst their confinement in bourgeois society as they did those of feudal- and orientalism, and the contradiction of class society is finally resolved into a version of the prior classless state but at the much higher level of human development that would be in effect then. Similar to primitive communism, where everyone must do useful work to have access to the things they need, in communism, everyone can use the [[means of production]] to fulfill their needs, to the extent that a [[ruling class]] is no longer controlling access to these; this final stage of production is the negation of the negation of classless society, in [[Hegel]]ian terms.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

This society would be a co-operative union of free producers, who are both owners of the [[means of production]] and self-employed, i.e. with [[disintermediation|no intermediary]] between themselves and the society that consumes their labor. There is no private ownership of the means of production. These are the property of the whole society. Because all decisions are made in a [[grassroots democracy|grassroots democratic]] system, there is no longer a need for a [[Sovereign state|state]] as an instrument of class rule and it would die off, when it has in fact become superfluous. Because after the [[proletarian revolution]] the economic system would no longer be plagued by rivalry and [[Crisis (economic)|crises]], and rationalized production is assumed to increase greatly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Critique of capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] polemics assume/assert that post-capitalist production will both be vastly more efficient in the production of current goods and services with redundendcies eliminated but also with areas of production which capitalism cannot or will not address initiated on new socialized basis.&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture would also be rationalized, because it would be practiced on larger farms. It would be possible to get rid of all shortages, so that the reasonable needs of all people could be satisfied. Socially necessary [[Wage labour|work]] is no longer [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]], and individuals become free to pursue their individual personal interests with time freed from the life-or-death struggle that [[false consciousness|bourgeois thought]] poses as a false need for workers to compete for capitalist remuneration (in money which represents that which they, the worker/producers, as a class, created in the first place) in order to secure the necessities of life.{{cn|date=January 2012}}
