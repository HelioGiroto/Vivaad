The '''Old Right''' is a branch of [[conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] that was most active in the early 20th Century and opposed both [[New Deal]] domestic programs of the 1930s and U.S. entry into [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. 

Many members of this faction were associated with the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] of the interwar years led by [[Robert Taft]] and [[Herbert Hoover]]. Some were [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. They were called the &quot;Old Right&quot; to distinguish them from their [[New Right#The first New Right|New Right]] successors, such as [[Barry Goldwater]], who came to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s and favored an interventionist foreign policy to battle international communism. Many members of the Old Right favored [[laissez faire]] [[classical liberalism]]; some were business-oriented conservatives; others were ex-radicals who moved sharply to the right, like the novelist [[John Dos Passos]]; still others, like the [[Southern Agrarians]], were [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalists]] who dreamed of restoring a premodern communal society.&lt;ref&gt;Allitt, Patrick. ''The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History'' (2009), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Right ''per se'' has faded as an organized movement, but many similar ideas are found amongst [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]] and [[paleolibertarianism|paleolibertarians]]. 

==Views==
The Old Right emerged in opposition to the [[New Deal]] of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  Hoff says, &quot;moderate Republicans and leftover Republican Progressives like Hoover composed the bulk of the Old Right by 1940, with a sprinkling of former members of the Farmer-Labor party, Non-Partisan League, and even a few midwestern prairie Socialist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Hoff|title=Herbert Hoover, forgotten progressive|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gwl3AAAAMAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Little, Brown|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1937 they formed a [[Conservative coalition]] that controlled Congress until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson, &quot;A Conservative Coalition Forms in Congress, 1933–1939,&quot; ''The Journal of American History,'' Vol. 52, No. 4. (Mar., 1966), pp.&amp;nbsp;757–772. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1894345 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt; They were consistently non-interventionist and opposed entering WWII, a position exemplified by the [[America First Committee]]. Later, most opposed U.S. entry into [[NATO]] and intervention in the [[Korean War]]. &quot;In addition to being staunch opponents of war and militarism, the Old Right of the postwar period had a rugged and near-[[Libertarianism|libertarian]] honesty in domestic affairs as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]]. [http://mises.org/daily/2755 Swan Song of the Old Right], ''[[Mises Institute]]'' {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This anti–New Deal movement was a coalition of multiple groups:
* intellectual [[individualism|individualists]] and [[libertarianism|libertarians]], including [[H. L. Mencken]] {{fact|date=November 2011}}, [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]], [[Garet Garrett]],&lt;ref&gt;Garet Garrett and Bruce Ramsey, '' Defend America First: The Antiwar Editorials of the Saturday Evening Post, 1939-1942'' (2003) [http://www.amazon.com/Defend-America-First-Editorials-1939-1942/dp/0870044338/  excerpt and text search] &lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Moley]], and [[Walter Lippmann]];&lt;ref&gt;Harry C. McPherson, Jr.,   &quot;Walter Lippmann and the American century&quot; [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/34278/harry-c-mcpherson-jr/walter-lippmann-and-the-american-century?page=show ''Foreign Affairs'' Fall 1980] &lt;/ref&gt;
* laissez-faire liberals, especially the heirs of the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s like [[Albert Ritchie]] of Maryland and Senator [[James A. Reed]] of Missouri;
* pro-business or anti-union Republicans, such as [[Robert Taft]];
* [[conservative Democrat]]s from the South, such as [[Josiah Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;By Troy L. Kickler, &quot;The Conservative Manifesto&quot; [http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/12/entry ''North Carolina History Project''] &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harry F. Byrd]];
* pro-business Democrats such as [[Al Smith]] and the founders of the [[American Liberty League]]&lt;ref&gt;George Wolfskill, ''The Revolt of the Conservatives: A History of the American Liberty League 1934-1940'' (1962) &lt;/ref&gt;
* powerful newspaper and magazine publishers, such as [[William Randolph Hearst]] of the Hearst chain&lt;ref&gt;David Nasaw, ''The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst'' (2001) &lt;/ref&gt; and Colonel [[Robert R. McCormick]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Norton Smith, ''The Colonel: The Life and Legend of Robert R. McCormick, 1880-1955'' (2003) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For others see Gary Dean Best, ''The Critical Press and the New Deal: The Press versus Presidential Power, 1933-1938'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
* reformed radicals who had supported FDR in 1932, such as [[William Randolph Hearst]] and Father [[Charles Coughlin]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Brinkley, ''Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin, &amp; the Great Depression'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Riggenbach]] argues that some members of the Old Right were actually classical liberals and &quot;were accepted members of the 'Left' before 1933. Yet, without changing any of their fundamental views, all of them, over the next decade, came to be thought of as exemplars of the political 'Right.{{Single double}}&lt;ref&gt;Riggenbach, Jeff. &quot;The Mighty Flynn,&quot; ''Liberty'' January 2006 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
:{{Category see also|Old Right (United States)}}

Other influential members of the Old Right included:
* politicians: [[Bennett Champ Clark]], [[Hamilton Fish III]], [[Howard Buffett]], [[Kenneth S. Wherry]], [[Eugene Siler]], [[Robert Taft]], [[Herbert Hoover]]
* businessmen: [[Robert E. Wood]], [[John J. Raskob]]
* publishers: [[Frank Gannett]], [[R.C. Hoiles]]
* journalists: [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], [[Garet Garrett]], [[John T. Flynn]], and [[Westbrook Pegler]]
* scholars: [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] and [[Frank Lawrence Owsley]]
* celebrities: [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Lillian Gish]]
* tax resistance leaders: [[John M. Pratt]]
* authors: [[Robert Frost]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[Frank Chodorov]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Louis Bromfield]], [[Leonard Read]], [[Francis Neilson]], [[Felix Morley]], [[Rose Wilder Lane]]
** the Southern Agrarians, notably [[Frank Lawrence Owsley]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]] and [[William Faulkner]].

==Southern Agrarians ==
The Southern Agrarian wing drew on some of the values and anxieties being articulated on the anti-modern right, including the desire to retain the social authority and defend the autonomy of the American states and regions, especially the South.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]] was one of the most politically active of the agrarians, especially in his criticisms of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]] in his native [[Tennessee]]. As Murphy (2001) shows, the [[Southern Agrarians]] articulated old values of [[Jeffersonian Democracy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rejected industrial capitalism and the culture it produced. In ''I'll Take My Stand'' they called for a return to the small-scale economy of rural America as a means to preserve the cultural amenities of the society they knew. Ransom and Tate believed that only by arresting the progress of industrial capitalism and its imperatives of science and efficiency could a social order capable of fostering and validating humane values and traditional religious faith be preserved. Skeptical and unorthodox themselves, they admired the capacity of orthodox religion to provide surety in life.&lt;ref&gt;Paul V. Murphy, ''The Rebuke of History: The Southern Agrarians and American Conservative Thought'' (2001) pp. 5, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Paleoconservatism|Paleoconservatives]] and [[paleolibertarianism|paleolibertarians]] are often considered the successors and torchbearers of the Old Right view in the late 20th century and the 21st century. Both of these groups often rally behind Old Right slogans such as &quot;America First&quot; while sharing similar views to the Old Right opposition to the [[New Deal]]. Recently, the ideas of the Old Right have seen a resurgence due to the presidential campaign of [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Making the Old Right New|author = W.
