'''Monash University''' (or simply '''Monash''') is a [[public university]] based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. It was founded in 1958 and is the second oldest university in the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Monash is a member of Australia's [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]] and the [[ASAIHL]].

Monash enrolls approximately 45 000 undergraduate and 17 000 graduate students,&lt;ref name=&quot;opq.monash.edu.au&quot;&gt;http://www.opq.monash.edu.au/us/summary/campus-profiles-2012-prelim-aug12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; making it the university with the largest student body in Australia. It also has more applicants than any university in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/newsline/story/1401| title=Monash preferred by majority of school leavers| publisher=Monash University| date=19 January 2009| accessdate=1 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monash is home to major research facilities, including the [[Australian Synchrotron]], the [[Monash Science Technology Research and Innovation Precinct]] (STRIP), the [[Australian Stem Cell Centre]], 100 research centres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/dec07-scholarships-2008.html| title=Top VCE students choose Monash| publisher=Monash University| date=17 December 2007| accessdate=1 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17 co-operative research centres. In 2011, its total revenue was over $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion, with external research income around $282&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.opq.monash.edu.au/us/summary/pocket-statistics-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has eight [[campus]]es, six of which are in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] ([[Monash University, Clayton campus|Clayton]], [[Monash University, Caulfield campus|Caulfield]], [[Monash University, Berwick campus|Berwick]], [[Monash University, Peninsula campus|Peninsula]], [[Monash University, Parkville Campus|Parkville]], and [[Monash University, Gippsland campus|Gippsland]]), one in [[Monash University Malaysia Campus|Malaysia]], and one in [[Monash University, South Africa campus|South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/about/| title=About Monash University| publisher=Monash University| date=19 February 2010| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monash also has a research and teaching centre in [[Monash University, Prato Centre|Prato]], [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ita.monash.edu/| title=Monash University Prato Centre| publisher=Monash University| date=21 March 2007| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate research school in [[IITB-Monash Research Academy|Mumbai]], [[India]]&lt;ref name=&quot;IITB&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iitbmonash.org/about.html| title=IITB-Monash Research Academy| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a graduate school in [[Southeast University-Monash University Joint Graduate School|Jiangsu]] Province, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;/http://afr.com/p/national/education/monash_first_to_move_into_china_0SWbm3q5qjqmtXnz6ThswO&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Monash University}}

===Beginnings===
Monash University is a commissioned Victorian university. It was established by an Act of the State [[Parliament of Victoria]] in 1958 as a result of the Murray Report which was commissioned in 1957 by then Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] to establish the second university in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The university was named after the prominent Australian general [[John Monash|Sir John Monash]]. This was the first time in Australia that a university had been named after a person, rather than a city, region or state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/vc/ate/pdf/univfacts.pdf| title=List of Australian Universities with date of foundation| publisher=Griffith University| format=PDF| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:mrs lake.jpg|right|thumb|250px|One of the lakes at the University's main campus, Clayton]]
The original campus was in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]] (falling in what is now the [[City of Monash]]). The first University Council, led by Monash's first Chancellor [[Sir Robert Blackwood]], selected Sir [[Louis Matheson]], to be the first Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, a position he held until 1976. The University was granted an expansive site of 100 hectares of open land in Clayton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/campuses/clayton/history.html| title=History of the Clayton campus| publisher=Monash University| date=10 February 2010| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 100 hectares of land consists of the former Talbot Epileptic Colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~whsvic/schools.htm| title=Waverley - Mulgrave - Monash City Schools| publisher=Waverley Historical Society accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its first intake of 347 students at Clayton on 13 March 1961, the university grew rapidly in size and student numbers so that by 1967, it had enrolled more than 21,000 students since its establishment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In its early years, it offered undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering, medicine, science, arts, economics, politics, education and law. It was a major provider for international student places under the [[Colombo Plan]], which saw the first Asian students enter the Australian education system.

In its early years of teaching, research and administration, Monash was not disadvantaged by entrenched traditional practices. Monash was able to adopt modern approaches without resistance from those who preferred the status quo. A modern administrative structure was set up; Australia's first research centres and scholarships devoted to [[Indigenous Australians]] were established, and, thanks to Monash's entirely new facilities, students in wheelchairs could enrol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===1970s onwards===
From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Monash became the centre of [[student activism|student radicalism]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/communism/xcommunismcat.html| title=&quot;Communism&quot; - An exhibition of highlights from the Monash University Library Rare Books Collection| publisher=Monash University Library| date=21 October 2010| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.usyd.edu.au/about/publication/gazette/april03/features/pub/rebels.shtml| title=Where have all the rebels gone?| publisher=The University of Sydney| 20 June 2007| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071210221622/http://www.usyd.edu.au/about/publication/gazette/april03/features/pub/rebels.shtml| archivedate=10 December 2007| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of many mass student demonstrations, particularly concerning Australia's role in [[Vietnam War]] and [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://menzieslecture.org/trust.html| title=About the Trust| first=Alan| last=Gregory| publisher=Sir Robert Menzies Lecture Trust| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, several student organisations, some of which were influenced by or supporters of communism, turned their focus to Vietnam, with numerous blockades and sit-ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/monmag/issue16-2005/around-monash/around-activism.html| title=Those were the days| first=Robyn| last=Anns| work=Monash Magazine| publisher=Monash University| date=20 October 2005| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one extraordinary event that came to be known as the Monash Siege, students forced then Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to hide in a basement at the Alexander Theatre, in a major protest over the [[Whitlam dismissal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/once-were-campus-warriors-20120903-25a4f.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Monash's most publicised research came through its pioneering of [[in-vitro fertilisation]] (IVF). Led by Professors [[Carl Wood]] and [[Alan Trounson]], the Monash IVF Program achieved the world's first clinical IVF pregnancy in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/timeline/1973-IVF.html| title=1973 - World's first IVF pregnancy| publisher=Monash University| date=3 July 2009| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, they delivered the first IVF baby in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monashivf.com/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=21660 | title=History of IVF - Our Contribution| publisher=Monash IVF Australia| accessdate=1 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually became a massive source of revenue for the University at a time when university funding in Australia was beginning to slow down.

In the late 1980s, the [[Dawkins Reforms]] changed the landscape of higher education in Australia. Under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor [[Mal Logan]], Monash transformed dramatically. In 1988, Monash University had only one campus, [[Monash University, Clayton campus|Clayton]], with around 15, 000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Monash: Remaking the University| first=Simon| last=Marginson| year=2000| publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin| location=St Leonards, NSW, Australia| isbn=978-1-86508-268-6{{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}| page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just over a decade later, it had 8 campuses (including 2 overseas), a European research and teaching centre, and more than 50,000 students, making it the largest and most internationalised Australian university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/about/overview/brief-history.html| title=Brief history of Monash| publisher=Monash University| date= 10 November 2009| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in the 1990s===
The expansion began in 1990, with a series of mergers between Monash, the Chisholm Institute of Technology, and the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. In 1991 a merger with the Victorian College of Pharmacy created a new faculty of the University. Monash University's expansion continued in 1994, with the establishment of the [[Monash University, Berwick campus|Berwick campus]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1998, the University opened the [[Monash University Malaysia campus|Malaysia campus]], its first overseas campus and the first foreign university in [[Malaysia]]. In 2001, Monash South Africa opened its doors in Johannesburg, making Monash the first foreign university in South Africa. The same year, the University secured an 18th Century Tuscan Palace to open a research and teaching centre in [[Prato]], Italy.

At the same time, Australian universities faced unprecedented demand for international student places, which Monash met on a larger scale than most, to the point that today around 30% of its students are from outside Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;MonashStats&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/about/stats.html| title=Monash Statistics| publisher=Monash University| date=10 November 2009| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Monash students come from over 100 different countries, and speak over 90 different languages. The increase in international students, combined with its expansion, meant that Monash's income skyrocketed throughout the 1990s, and it is now one of Australia's top 200 exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00993b.htm| title=Monash University| first=Simon| last=Marginson| work=The Encyclopedia of Melbourne Online| publisher=School of Historical Studies| date=25 February 2010| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 onwards===
[[Image:Monash University Clayton Campus.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A panoramic view of [[Robert Menzies]] Building in Clayton Campus]]
In recent years, the University has been prominent in medical research. A highlight of this came in 2000, when Professor [[Alan Trounson]] led the team of scientists which first announced to the world that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells, a discovery which led to a dramatic increase in interest in the potential of [[stem cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/798c8b072d117a01ca256c8c0019bb01/773344f4c4f794baca25714e0005c518!OpenDocument| title=VICTORIA TO HOST KEY SEMINARS AT BIO2006| date=10 April 2006| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led to Monash being ranked in the top 20 universities in the world for biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/news/monashmemo/stories/20070509/medicine-institute.html| title=Monash academic to head Victoria's Regenerative Medicine Institute| work=Monash Memo| publisher=Monash University| date=9 May 2007| accessdate=1 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{details|Monash University shooting}}

On 21 October 2002 Huan Yun &quot;Allen&quot; Xiang, a paranoid delusional man, shot two people dead and injured five others on the Clayton campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/21/1034561430119.html| title=Gunman 'indiscriminately' kills students| work=The Age| date=21 October 2002| accessdate=7 April 2010| location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2008, Monash University celebrated its 50th Anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/timeline/text-version.html| title=Our history, achievements and milestones| publisher=Monash University| date=3 July 2009| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Vice-Chancellor and President of Monash University is Professor [[Edward Byrne (academic)|Edward Byrne AO]] (since 6 July 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;ViceChan&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monash.edu.au/about/vcmessage.html| title=Vice-Chancellor's message, Monash University| first=Edward| last=Byrne| publisher=Monash University| date=10 December 2009| accessdate=1 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

===Clayton campus===

[[Image:Aust.-Synchrotron-outside,-14.06.2007.jpg|thumb|225px|left|The [[Australian Synchrotron]] is located at the University's Clayton Campus]]

The [[Monash University, Clayton campus|Clayton campus]] covers an area over 1.1&amp;nbsp;km² and is the largest of the Monash campuses. Clayton is the flagship campus for Monash, demanding higher ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) scores than all the other campuses, with the exception of Parkville. Clayton is home to the faculties of Arts, Business &amp; Economics, Education, Engineering, IT, Law, Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences and Science. The Clayton campus has its own suburb and postcode (3800).

Various major scientific research facilities are located on or adjacent to the campus.

The campus is also home to numerous restaurants and retail outlets, as well as student bars Sir John's (located in the Campus Centre) and the Notting Hill Hotel (founded in 1891),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=thenott |url=http://www.thenott.com.au/home.php |title=Home of the Notting Hill Hotel - Melbourne, Australia |publisher=The Nott |date=18 August 2003 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are hubs of social life on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournepubs.com/venue/522/ |title=~ Notting Hill Hotel, Notting Hill, Melbourne ~ Review and Details |publisher=Melbournepubs.com |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is also home to a number of halls of residence, colleges and other on-campus accommodation that house several thousand students. Six [[hall of residence|halls of residence]] are located at the [[Monash University, Clayton campus|Clayton campus]] in [[Clayton, Victoria]]. There is an additional private residential college affiliated with the University.
{{-}}

====Halls of Residence====

* '''Howitt Hall''' is the tallest Monash residential building, standing 12 stories high, with a good view of the other halls and the university. Howitt Hall is the third oldest hall, and was opened in September 1966. The hall is named after [[Alfred William Howitt|Alfred Howitt]], a scholar and prominent figure in early Gippsland.

* '''Farrer Hall''' is divided into two buildings, Commons and Lords, with an annex to Commons called Chastity which is located above the common room. The Hall has more focus on floors, with kitchens, laundries and common rooms shared across them. The hall is named after [[William James Farrer|William Farrer]], who developed many strains of wheat suited to Australian conditions.

* '''Richardson Hall''' (Richo) is the newest of the Halls of Residence at Monash University. Richardson is home to 190 residents. Richardson has been known as the &quot;International Hall&quot;{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} to residents of other halls, due to the high numbers of international students residing in Richardson. The hall is named after Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson, a prominent Australian author who adopted the male pseudonym [[Henry Handel Richardson]].

* '''Deakin Hall''' was the first [[residence hall]] established at Monash University in Australia, in September 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.adm.monash.edu.au/records-archives/archives/cgi-alias/monpix?IMAGE_NUMBER=2494| title=Monash Records and Archives Image Database Search: Image 2494| publisher=Monash University| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residence hall was named after [[Alfred Deakin]], Prime Minister from 1903–1910 and father of the [[Australian Constitution]].

* '''Roberts Hall''' is named after Tom Roberts, an Australian artist who was affectionately known as &quot;the bulldog&quot;. The mascot of Roberts Hall is a bulldog in recognition of this.

* '''Jackomos Hall''' and '''Briggs Hall''', twin residences opened in 2012, are the most recent halls at Monash. They are named after two prominent Indigenous women, Merle Jackomos and Geraldine Briggs.

* '''[[Mannix College (Monash University)|Mannix College]]''' is a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] residential college affiliated with Monash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mannix.monash.edu.au/| title=Mannix College| publisher=Mannix College| date=25 February 2010| accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; located near the south-western corner of the university's Clayton campus. The College motto [[List of Latin phrases: O#omnia_omnibus|&quot;Omnia Omnibus&quot;]] means &quot;All things to all People&quot;. The shield of Mannix College combines elements of [[Daniel Mannix|Archbishop Daniel Mannix]], [[John Monash|Sir John Monash]] and the [[Dominican Order]]. From the shield of Dr. Mannix the Gryphon and Crescents are taken together with the motto. The shield of Sir John Monash, used by the University named after him, shows the inverted chevron, the Southern Cross, the open book and sword in pale blue surrounded by a crown of laurel. The black and white border is drawn from the shield of the Dominican Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mannix.monash.edu.au/about/history.html|title=A Short History of Mannix College|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
