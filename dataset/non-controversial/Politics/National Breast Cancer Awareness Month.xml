      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13966">'''Breast Cancer Awareness Month''' ('''BCAM'''), also referred to in America as '''National Breast Cancer Awareness Month''' ('''NBCAM'''), is an annual international health campaign organized by major [[breast cancer]] charities every '''October''' to increase [[breast cancer awareness|awareness of the disease]] and to [[fundraising|raise funds]] for research into its cause, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure. The campaign also offers information and support to those affected by breast cancer. 

As well as providing a platform for breast cancer charities to raise awareness of their work and of the disease, BCAM is also a prime opportunity to remind women to be breast aware for earlier detection.

==History==
[[Image:PinkWhiteHouseOctober.jpg|200px|thumb|[[White House]] decorated pink in honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October 2008]]
NBCAM was founded in 1985 as a partnership between the [[American Cancer Society]] and the pharmaceutical division of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (now part of [[AstraZeneca]], maker of several anti-breast cancer drugs).  The aim of the NBCAM from the start has been to promote mammography as the most effective weapon in the fight against breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcam.org/about_faq.cfm Official National Breast Cancer Awareness Month (NBCAM) Frequenlty Asked Questions]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1993 [[Evelyn Lauder]], Senior Corporate Vice President of the [[Estée Lauder Companies]] founded [[The Breast Cancer Research Foundation]] and established the [[pink ribbon]] as its symbol, though this was not the first time the ribbon was used to symbolize breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esteelauder.com/templates/products/multiproduct.tmpl?ngextredir=1&amp;CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY5887 |title=Estée Lauder Official Site |publisher=Esteelauder.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1991, the Susan G. Komen Foundation had handed out pink [[ribbon (award)|ribbons]] to participants in its New York City race for breast [[cancer survivor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkbeforeyoupink.org/Pages/PrettyInPink.html ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and events==
===The National Race for the Cure===
In October 1983 the [[Race for the Cure]] was held for the first time in Dallas, Texas, where 800 people participated.  According to the organizers, by 2002 the number of participants reached 1.3 million and the event was held in over 100 US cities.  The event is also being organized in several other parts of the World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.komen.org/Komen/NewsEvents/RacefortheCure/index.htm Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure] Susan G.

=== Pink days ===

During Breast Cancer Awareness Month each October, people raise money by organizing activities such as theme parties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiltersofsc.org/artfullbras/artfullbras.htm|title=The Artful Bras Project|last=Baker|first= Sandra|accessdate=2009-03-14}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a &quot;pink day&quot; (when employees wear pink clothing or accessories) at work. The money raised is donated to the organizers' choice of breast cancer care or research programs. An increasingly prominent &quot;pink day&quot; is [[Global Pink Hijab Day]] celebrated by many to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer.

=== National Football League ===
During the month of October, the [[National Football League]] promotes breast cancer awareness by incorporating pink on its websites, graphics, and advertisements. Players also show support by wearing pink gloves, cleats, captains patches, and other apparel during games.

=== Pink comic strips ===
Over 50 [[comic strip]] artists used pink on October 10, 2010, using the pink ribbon with the words &quot;Cartoonists Care&quot;. [[King Features Syndicate]] inspired the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/lifestyles/2010/oct/10/pink10-ar-553154/|title=Comic strips go pink for breast-cancer awareness|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male breast cancer==
[[Male breast cancer]], which is rare, is generally overlooked.  In 2009 the male breast cancer advocacy groups Out of the Shadow of Pink, A Man's Pink, and the Brandon Greening Foundation for Breast Cancer in Men joined together to globally establish the third week of October as &quot;Male Breast Cancer Awareness Week&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Male Breast Cancer Awareness Week
  | url = http://www.outoftheshadowofpink.com/Male-Breast-Cancer-Awareness-Week-Campaign.html
  | accessdate = 2009-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
=== Corporate Sponsorship ===

It has been alleged that &quot;the BCAM idea 'was conceived and paid for by a British chemical company that both profits from this epidemic and may be contributing to its cause...'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Janette D. Sherman, M.D.(New York and London: Taylor and
Francis, 2000). ISBN 1-56032-870-3. Life's Delicate Balance  [http://www.safe2use.com/drsherman/life/15.htm ''THE CANCER MOVEMENT: Independent, Sold-Out, or Bought Up? '' ].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes referred to as ''National Breast Cancer Industry Month'', critics of NBCAM point to a conflict of interest between corporations sponsoring [[breast cancer awareness]] while profiting from diagnosis and treatment. The breast cancer advocacy organization, [[Breast Cancer Action]], has said repeatedly in newsletters and other information sources that October has become a [[public relations]] campaign that avoids discussion of the causes and prevention of breast cancer and instead focuses on “awareness” as a way to encourage women to get their mammograms. The term ''[[pinkwashing]]'' has been used by Breast Cancer Action to describe the actions of companies which manufacture and use chemicals which show a link with breast cancer and at the same time publicly support charities focused on curing the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkbeforeyoupink.org/Pages/FocusOnPinkwashers.html Focus on Pinkwashers], Breast Cancer Action's ''think before you pink'' campaign site. Retrieved November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other criticisms center on the marketing of &quot;pink products&quot; and tie ins, citing that more money is spent marketing these campaigns than is donated to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkbeforeyoupink.org/PDF/NYTimesAd.pdf Who's Really Cleaning Up Here] Breast Cancer Action's ''think before you pink'' campaign site. Retrieved November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cure as &quot;Treatment&quot; vs. &quot;Prevention&quot; ===
The [[Cancer Prevention Coalition]] has criticized the basic message of NBCAM as a form of [[victim blaming]] because it focuses on &quot;early detection and treatment&quot; while ignoring environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.preventcancer.com/patients/mammography/awareness.htm Chemical Industry Funds Breast Cancer Campaign]'', Cancer Prevention Coalition website. Retrieved September 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According Aaron Blair, Ph.D., chief of the Occupational Epidemiology Branch in [[National Cancer Institute]]'s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, ''For breast cancer, hormone use is one of the major factors affecting risk.''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/benchmarks-vol4-issue3/page1 The Majority of Cancers Are Linked to the Environment]'', National Cancer Institute website, June 4, 2004.&lt;!--Retrieved September 27 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rose Marie Williams, a columnist for the [[Townsend Letter]], drug, chemical, and biotechnology companies have a vested interest in treating the disease rather than finding ways to minimize its rate of incidence.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Marie Williams ''[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISW/is_256/ai_n6258845 Breast cancer and xenoestrogens]'', Findarticles reprint of Townsend Letter, November 2004 article.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent studies show that breast cancer is linked to several environmental and genetic factors which can be controlled or mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Evans (Ed.)
