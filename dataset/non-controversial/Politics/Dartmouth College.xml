'''Dartmouth College''' (commonly referred to as '''Dartmouth''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|d|ɑr|t|m|ə|θ}} {{respell|DART|məth}}) is a [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Doctoral university|research university]] located in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], New Hampshire, United States. The institution consists of a liberal arts college, the [[Geisel School of Medicine]], the [[Thayer School of Engineering]], and the [[Tuck School of Business]], as well as 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnwr-aag&quot;/&gt; Incorporated as &quot;the Trustees of Dartmouth College,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;/&gt; it is one of the nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt; With an undergraduate enrollment of 4,248 and a total student enrollment of 6,141, Dartmouth is the smallest school in the Ivy League.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Dartmouth&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth College was established in 1769 by [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister [[Eleazar Wheelock]]. After a long period of financial and political struggles, Dartmouth emerged in the early 20th century from relative obscurity.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; Dartmouth alumni, from [[Daniel Webster]] to the many donors in the 19th and 20th centuries, have been famously involved in their college.&lt;ref name=&quot;ihe-alum&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth is located on a rural {{convert|269|acre|km2}} campus in the [[Upper Valley (Connecticut River)|Upper Valley]] region of New Hampshire. The campus is isolated, and participation in athletics and the school's [[Dartmouth College Greek organizations|Greek system]] is strong.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-greek&quot;/&gt; Dartmouth's 34 varsity sports teams compete in the [[Ivy League]] conference of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I. Students are well known for preserving a variety of strong campus traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Frat Party Is:; a) Milk and Cookies; b) Beer Pong&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill Winds, Granite Brains, and Other Dartmouth Traditions&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Our Mission&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth: Forever New An address by President James Wright: On the Occasion of his Inauguration as the 16th President of Dartmouth College&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|List of presidents of Dartmouth College}}
Dartmouth was founded by [[Eleazar Wheelock]], a [[Puritan]] minister from Columbia, Connecticut, who had previously sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with [[Mohegan]] Indian [[Samson Occom]]. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to [[Long Island]] to preach to the Montauks.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;

Wheelock founded [[Moor's Charity School|Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleazar Wheelock's Two Schools&quot;/&gt; The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school’s operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. Occom, accompanied by Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt; The head of the trust was a [[Methodist]] named [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]].

[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-02 03 - Charter.jpg.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in [[Baker Memorial Library]]. The Charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]].]]
Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, [[John Wentworth (governor)|John Wentworth]], provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued the charter in the name of [[King George III]] establishing the College. That charter created a college &quot;for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land ... and also of English Youth and any others.&quot; The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]]&amp;nbsp;— an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it&amp;nbsp;— Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Dartmouth&amp;nbsp;– History&quot;/&gt; The College granted its first degrees in 1771 .&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleazar Wheelock and the Adventurous Founding of Dartmouth College&quot;/&gt;

Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new College as one primarily for whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chi&quot;/&gt; Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called [[Brothertown Indians]] in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chi&quot;/&gt;

In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Dartmouth College case]], which challenged [[New Hampshire]]'s 1816 attempt to amend the College's royal charter to make the school a public university. An institution called [[Dartmouth University]] occupied the College buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the College continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt; [[Daniel Webster]], an [[alumnus]] of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an [[Contract Clause|illegal impairment of a contract]] by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the College. Webster concluded his [[peroration]] with the famous words: &quot;It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the College had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; Under the presidency of [[William Jewett Tucker]] (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor [[John Ordronaux (doctor)|John Ordronaux]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Many Bequests to Carity; Will of Dr. Ordronaux D...&quot;/&gt; 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having &quot;refounded Dartmouth&quot; and bringing it into national prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Jewett Tucker&quot;/&gt; [[File:Dartmouth Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Lithograph of the President's House, Thornton Hall, Dartmouth Hall, and Wentworth Hall, circa 1834.]]Presidents [[Ernest Fox Nichols]] (1909–16) and [[Ernest Martin Hopkins]] (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing [[College admissions in the United States|selective admissions]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; [[John Sloan Dickey]], serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;John Sloan Dickey&quot;/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;navyarchives-v-12&quot;/&gt;

In 1970, longtime professor of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] [[John George Kemeny]] became president of Dartmouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;kemeny-bio&quot;/&gt; Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the College. Dartmouth, previously serving as a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;When did Dartmouth become co-educational?&quot;/&gt; At about the same time, the College adopted its &quot;[[#The Dartmouth Plan|Dartmouth Plan]]&quot; of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;kemeny-bio&quot;/&gt;

During the 1990s, the College saw a major academic overhaul under President [[James O. Freedman]] and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed.&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;James O. Freedman&quot;/&gt; The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.3 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the College's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedartmouth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thedartmouth1&quot;/&gt; The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Capital Projects&quot;/&gt; In 2004, [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance &quot;whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial,&quot; citing ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booz Allen Hamilton Lists the World's Most Enduring Institutions&quot;/&gt;

Since the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the [[Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College|Board of Trustees]] starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle for Board leaves boardroom&quot;/&gt; President [[James Wright (historian)|James Wright]] announced his retirement in February 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;President Wright to step down in June 2009&quot;/&gt; and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician [[Jim Yong Kim]] on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dr. Jim Yong Kim appointed 17th President of Dartmouth College&quot;/&gt;

In May 2010 Dartmouth joined the [[Matariki Network of Universities]] (MNU) together with [[Durham University]] (UK), [[Queen’s University]] (Canada), [[University of Otago]] (New Zealand), [[University of Tübingen]] (Germany), [[University of Western Australia]] (Australia) and [[Uppsala University]] (Sweden).&lt;ref name=&quot;Members of the Matariki Network of Universities&quot;/&gt;

In 2011, 22,385 students applied for approximately 1,100 places, and 9.7% of applicants were admitted. Of those admitted whose high schools reported a [[class rank]], 94% were ranked in the top 10% of their high school graduating class, 40%  were valedictorians, and 10% were salutatorians. The mean SAT scores of admitted students by section were 734 for verbal, 740 for math, and 744 for writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015-admissions&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the College, and currently admits all students, including internationals, on a [[Need-blind admission|need-blind basis]]. Beginning in the 2008–2009 academic year, Dartmouth instituted a new [[Student financial aid|financial aid]] policy extending need-blind admission to international students and replaced all [[Student loans in the United States|student loans]] with scholarships and grants. Students from families with a combined annual income of less than $75,000 are not charged any tuition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth announces new financial aid initiative&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Financial aid program kicks off&quot;/&gt; However, in early 2010, the College announced that it would re-introduce loans to its financial aid packages beginning in the 2011–2012 school year due to its changed financial situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;censky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Most Colleges Plan to Stick With Pledges to Limit Loans in Student Aid&quot;/&gt;

In order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program.&lt;ref name=&quot;requirements&quot;/&gt; Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten &quot;distributive requirements&quot; in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;requirements&quot;/&gt; Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in &quot;independent, sustained work,&quot; culminating in the production of a [[thesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;requirements&quot;/&gt; In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Programs&amp;nbsp;– List All&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Types of Programs&quot;/&gt;

Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts &amp; Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs trace their origins to the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: [[Dartmouth Medical School]] (established 1797), [[Thayer School of Engineering]] (1867)&amp;nbsp;— which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences&amp;nbsp;— and [[Tuck School of Business]] (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of &quot;Dartmouth University&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt; however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]''), the school uses the name &quot;Dartmouth College&quot; to refer to the entire institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-lesson&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt; Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the [[Dartmouth Conferences]], the [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]], [[Dartmouth BASIC]], and [[Dartmouth ALGOL 30]]. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academics &amp; Research&quot;/&gt;

Dartmouth serves as the host institution of the [[University Press of New England]], a [[university press]] founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes Brandeis University, the University of New Hampshire, Northeastern University, Tufts University and the University of Vermont.&lt;ref name=&quot;About UPNE&quot;/&gt;

=== The Dartmouth Plan ===
[[File:BakerLibrary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baker Memorial Library]] at Dartmouth College]]
Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week [[academic term]]s. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply &quot;D-Plan&quot;) is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-plan-admin&quot;/&gt; During all other terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-plan-admin&quot;/&gt; The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Working Rules and Procedures&quot;/&gt;

The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as &quot;a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trd-wheelock&quot;/&gt; Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.

=== Board of Trustees ===
{{Main|Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College}}
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Dartmouth Hall 02.JPG|thumb|right|Dartmouth Hall, built in 1784]]
Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the College president (''ex officio''), the state governor (''ex officio''), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called &quot;charter trustees&quot;), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (&quot;alumni trustees&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Trustees vote to expand size of board&quot;/&gt; The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.

Although the Board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;Board of trustees vote to change how Dartmouth College is run&quot;/&gt; the Board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Board adds 8 seats, ends century-old parity&quot;/&gt; In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided Association of Alumni sues College&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thedartmouth2&quot;/&gt; In 2008, the Board added five new charter trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth College's Board of Trustees Elects Five Alumni as New Trustees&quot;/&gt;

=== Athletic facilities ===
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Memorial Field 02.JPG|thumb|right|175px|[[Memorial Field (Dartmouth College)|Memorial Field]]]]
Dartmouth's original sports field was [[The Green (Dartmouth College)|the Green]], where students played [[cricket]] and [[old division football]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;dartmo-green&quot;/&gt; Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;dcaf&quot;/&gt; The center of athletic life is the [[Alumni Gymnasium (Dartmouth College)|Alumni Gymnasium]], which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a state of the art fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123&amp;nbsp;m) indoor track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alumni Gym&quot;/&gt; Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts ([[Leede Arena]]), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berry Sports Center&quot;/&gt; Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is [[Memorial Field (Dartmouth College)|Memorial Field]], a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorial Field&quot;/&gt; The nearby [[Thompson Arena]], designed by Italian engineer [[Pier Luigi Nervi]] and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson Arena&quot;/&gt; Also visible from Memorial Field is the {{convert|91800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena.

Dartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the [[Hanover Country Club]], Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899),&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rugby Fires It Up With New Clubhouse&quot;/&gt; The College also maintains the [[Dartmouth Skiway]], a {{convert|100|acre|km2}} skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in [[Lyme Center, New Hampshire]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Skiway&quot;/&gt; that serves as the winter practice grounds for the nationally dominant Dartmouth ski team.

=== Housing and student life facilities ===
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Lord Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Lord Hall in the Gold Coast Cluster]]
Instead of ungrouped dormitories or [[residential colleges]], Dartmouth has nine residential communities located throughout campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt; The dormitories vary in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt; Since 2006, the College has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Assembly reworks UFC membership guidelines&quot;/&gt; More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by College.&lt;ref name=&quot;orl&quot;/&gt;

Campus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus Map&quot;/&gt; Four of them are located at the center of campus in Thayer Dining Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dining Locations&quot;/&gt;

The Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the &quot;student union&quot; or &quot;campus center.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collis Center&quot;/&gt; It contains a café, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the [[Dartmouth College Academic Skills Center|Academic Skills Centre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collis Floor Plans&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Administrative Departments in Collis Center&quot;/&gt; Robinson Hall, next door to both Collis and Thayer, contains the offices of a number of student organizations including the [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] and ''[[The Dartmouth]]'' daily newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson Hall&quot;/&gt;

== Student life ==
In 2006, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' ranked Dartmouth third in its &quot;Quality of Life&quot; category, and sixth for having the &quot;Happiest Students.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Best 361 Colleges&quot;/&gt; Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-greek&quot;/&gt; in all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Student Life&quot;/&gt; The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations.

=== Student groups ===
{{Main|Dartmouth College student groups|Dartmouth College publications|Dartmouth College Greek organizations}}
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-03 Robinson Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Robinson Hall houses many of the College's student-run organizations, including the [[Dartmouth Outing Club]]. The building is a designated stop along the [[Appalachian Trail]].]]

Dartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus Life: Clubs and Organizations&quot;/&gt; In 2007, the College hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 &quot;issue-oriented&quot; groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;COSO Student Organizations&quot;/&gt; Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the [[Dartmouth Outing Club]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DOCalumnimag&quot;/&gt; which includes the nationally recognized&lt;ref name=&quot;Big Green Bus in the News&quot;/&gt; [[The Big Green Bus|Big Green Bus]], the controversial conservative newspaper ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Reagan's Disappearing Bureaucrats&quot;/&gt; and ''[[The Dartmouth]]'', arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;nlestk&quot;/&gt; ''The Dartmouth'' describes itself as &quot;America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;nlestk&quot;/&gt;

Partially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek system]] dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-greek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halls, Tombs and Houses: Student Society Architecture at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Coed, Fraternity, and Sorority Administration&quot;/&gt; In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belong to a Greek organization;&lt;ref name=&quot;Transgenders try to navigate Greek system&quot;/&gt; since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of CFS Organizations at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to [[desegregate]] fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create [[coeducational]] Greek houses in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle&quot;/&gt; In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a Board of Trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become &quot;substantially coeducational&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth to Abolish Fraternities and Sororities&quot;/&gt; this attempt to the change the Greek system eventually failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interrogating the S.L.I.&quot;/&gt; The College has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as [[Dartmouth College student groups#Undergraduate societies|undergraduate societies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Senior and Undergraduate Society Administration&quot;/&gt;

The fraternities have an extensive history of [[hazing]] and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Reitman, [http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/confessions-of-an-ivy-league-frat-boy-inside-dartmouths-hazing-abuses-20120328?print=true &quot;Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy: Inside Dartmouth's Hazing Abuses&quot;], ''Rolling Stone'', 12 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Athletics ===
{{Main|Dartmouth Big Green}}
[[File:Darthmouth vs Princeton 1.jpg|thumb|left|A Dartmouth varsity hockey game against Princeton at [[Thompson Arena]]]]

Approximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics.&lt;ref name=&quot;What percentage of Dartmouth students play a varsity sport?&quot;/&gt; In 2007, Dartmouth College fielded 34 intercollegiate varsity teams: 16 for men, 16 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] eight-member [[Ivy League]] conference; some teams also participate in the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC).&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-athletics&quot;/&gt; As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-athletics&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;What is the Ivy League?&quot;/&gt; In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt;

The College also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-dartmouth-facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Club Sports&quot;/&gt; The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has also been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport over many years. The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Wins Fourth Consecutive National Title&quot;/&gt;  In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a {{convert|50|yd|m|sing=on}} swim and three terms of physical education.&lt;ref name=&quot;General Academic Requirements for Graduation&quot;/&gt;

=== Technology ===
[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-09-24 Baker-Berry Library 02.JPG|thumb|right|Students at a bank of Blitz terminals in Baker-Berry Library.]]
Technology plays an important role in student life, as Dartmouth has been ranked as one of the most technologically advanced colleges in the world (as in ''[[Newsweek]]'''s 2004 ranking of &quot;Hottest for the Tech-Savvy&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;/&gt; and [[Yahoo!]]'s 1998 &quot;Wired Colleges&quot; list&lt;ref name=&quot;About BlitzMail&quot;/&gt;). [[BlitzMail]], the campus [[e-mail]] network, plays a tremendous role in social life, as students tend to use it for communication in lieu of [[cellular phones]] or [[instant messaging]] programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cell phones make inroads on Blitz-centric College campus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-blitz&quot;/&gt; Student reliance on BlitzMail (known colloquially as &quot;Blitz,&quot; which functions as both noun and verb&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-blitz&quot;/&gt;) is reflected by the presence of about 100 public computer terminals intended specifically for BlitzMail use.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-blitz&quot;/&gt; Since 1991, Dartmouth students have been required to own a personal computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Students required to get wired&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;All Students Required to Own a Computer&quot;/&gt;

In 2001, Dartmouth became the first Ivy League institution to offer entirely ubiquitous wireless internet access.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;/&gt; With over 1,400 access points, the network is available throughout all College buildings as well as in most public outdoor spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; Other technologies being pioneered include College-wide Video-on-Demand and VoIP rollouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Public Affairs&quot;/&gt;

=== Native Americans at Dartmouth ===
It is often pointed out that the charter of Dartmouth College, granted to [[Eleazar Wheelock]] in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created &quot;for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;/&gt; However, Wheelock primarily intended the College to educate white youth and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named [[Samson Occom]], and at least some of those funds were used to help found the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt;

The College graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt; In 1970, the College established Native American academic and social programs as part of a &quot;new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt; Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-nap&quot;/&gt;

=== Traditions ===
{{Main|Dartmouth College traditions}}
[[File:2004 Winter Carnival Sculpture.JPG|thumb|upright|Snow sculpture at the 2004 Dartmouth Winter Carnival]]

Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;15th President Installed at Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; The College functions on a [[Academic term|quarter system]], and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as &quot;big weekends&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steph&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dartmouth Green: A Walking Tour of Dartmouth&quot;/&gt; or &quot;party weekends&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins Center offers many alternatives over weekend&quot;/&gt; In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class.&lt;ref name=&quot;homecoming-history&quot;/&gt; Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdr-wc&quot;/&gt; In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green Key History: Those Were the Days&quot;/&gt;

The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the [[Connecticut River]]. Begun in 1986, Tubestock met its demise in 2006 when Hanover town ordinances and a lack of coherent student protest conspired to defeat the popular tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Town, College Weigh Tubestock Changes&quot;/&gt; The class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fieldstock, chariots await town approval&quot;/&gt;

Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the [[Moosilauke Ravine Lodge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Program&quot;/&gt; In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.

== Insignia and other representations ==

=== Motto and song ===
Dartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is ''Vox clamantis in deserto''. The Latin motto is literally translated as &quot;The voice of one crying in the wilderness&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Out of the Woods&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; but is more often rendered as &quot;A voice crying in the wilderness&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Debriefing&quot;/&gt; which attempts to translate the [[synecdoche]] of the phrase. The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartlett Hall's Wheelock Memorial Window&quot;/&gt; Richard Hovey's &quot;[[Alma Mater (Dartmouth College)|Men of Dartmouth]]&quot; was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,&lt;ref name=&quot;homecoming-history&quot;/&gt; and became the school's official song in 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Follow-up on the news; Song out of tune with the times&quot;/&gt; The song was retitled to &quot;Alma Mater&quot; in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.&lt;ref name=&quot;rscl&quot;/&gt;

=== Seal ===
{{Main|Seal of Dartmouth College}}
[[File:Seal of Dartmouth College.png|thumb|upright|left|Seal of Dartmouth College]]

Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a [[seal (device)|seal]] for use on official documents and diplomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;/&gt; The College's founder [[Eleazar Wheelock]] designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by Commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:

{{quote|An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words &quot;vox clamantis in deserto&quot; the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.&lt;ref name=&quot;collections&quot;/&gt;}}

On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769,&quot; to accord with the date of the College Charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of &quot;1769&quot; to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.&lt;ref name=&quot;uspatent&quot;/&gt;

=== Shield ===
On October 28, 1926, the Trustees approved a &quot;Dartmouth College Shield&quot; for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944 the trustees approved another [[coat of arms]] based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer [[Thoreau MacDonald]]. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769&quot; around 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;good&quot;/&gt; That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;uspatent&quot;/&gt;

College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Proposal for a Heraldic Coat of Arms for Dartmouth College&quot;/&gt; The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of [[Dartmouth Medical School]], and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nanometer Pattern Generation System: Dartmouth Seal&quot;/&gt; The design has appeared on [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]'s Bicentennial Medal ([[Philadelphia Mint]], 1969) and elsewhere.

=== Nickname, symbol, and mascot ===
[[File:Keggy the Keg.JPG|thumb|upright|Keggy posing on the Dartmouth College Green.]]
Dartmouth has never had an official mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad-green&quot;/&gt; The nickname &quot;The Big Green,&quot; originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (&quot;Dartmouth Green&quot;) as the school's official color in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;greencolor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History-of-Dartmouth-Hanover&quot;/&gt; Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname &quot;the Indians,&quot; a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad-green&quot;/&gt; This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the &quot;use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The 'Big Green' Nickname&quot;/&gt; Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'', have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth Indians: The New Tradition&quot;/&gt; but no team has worn the symbol on its uniform in decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Banning of the Indian&quot;/&gt;

Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a new mascot, but none has become &quot;official.&quot; One proposal devised by the College humor magazine the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' was [[Keggy the Keg]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] beer keg who makes occasional appearances at College sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Straight from the Tap: the men behind the mascot&quot;/&gt; the mascot has only received approval from the student government.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedartmouth4&quot;/&gt; In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the &quot;Dartmoose&quot; as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former Indian mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;First SA meeting draws crowd&quot;/&gt;

== Alumni ==
{{Main|List of Dartmouth College alumni}}
Dartmouth's alumni are known for their devotion to the College.&lt;ref name=&quot;ihe-alum&quot;/&gt; Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. According to a 2008 article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10&amp;nbsp;years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivy Leaguers' Big Edge: Starting Pay&quot;/&gt;
