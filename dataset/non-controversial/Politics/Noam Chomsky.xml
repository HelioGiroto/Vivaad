'''Avram Noam Chomsky''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|m|_|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|m|s|k|i}}; born December 7, 1928) is an American [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]],&lt;ref name=&quot;szabo&quot;&gt;[http://chomsky.info/bios/2004----.htm &quot;Noam Chomsky&quot;], by Zoltán Gendler Szabó, in ''Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, 1860–1960'', ed. Ernest Lepore (2004). &quot;Chomsky's intellectual life had been divided between his work in linguistics and his political activism, philosophy coming as a distant third. Nonetheless, his influence among analytic philosophers has been enormous because of three factors. First, Chomsky contributed substantially to a major methodological shift in the human sciences, turning away from the prevailing empiricism of the middle of the twentieth century: behaviorism in psychology, structuralism in linguistics and positivism in philosophy. Second, his groundbreaking books on syntax (Chomsky (1957, 1965)) laid a conceptual foundation for a new, cognitivist approach to linguistics and provided philosophers with a new framework for thinking about human language and the mind. And finally, he has persistently defended his views against all takers, engaging in important debates with many of the major figures in analytic philosophy...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' (1999), &quot;Chomsky, Noam,&quot; [[Cambridge University Press]], pg. 138. &quot;Chomsky, Noam (born 1928), preeminent American linguist, philosopher, and political activist...

==Biography==

===Childhood: 1928&amp;ndash;45 ===
Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928 in the affluent [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20041126.htm |title=The Life and Times of Noam Chomsky, Noam Chomsky interviewed by Amy Goodman|publisher=www.chomsky.info |accessdate=December 21, 2008|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[William Chomsky|Dr. William &quot;Zev&quot; Chomsky]] (1896&amp;ndash;1977) had been born in [[Ukraine]], then a part of the [[Russian Empire]], but had fled to the United States in 1913 to avoid conscription into the army. Here, he began work in sweatshops in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], before gaining employment teaching at the city's Hebrew elementary schools, using his money to fund his studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Marrying Elsie Simonofsky &amp;ndash; a native of what is present-day [[Belarus]] who grew up in the United States &amp;ndash; they moved to Philadelphia, where they both began teaching at the Mikveh Israel religious school, with William eventually rising to the position of school principal. In 1924 he was appointed to the faculty at the country's oldest teacher training institution, [[Gratz College]], where he began faculty president in 1932. In 1955 he also began teaching courses at [[Dropsie College]]. Independently, he was involved in researching Medieval Hebrew, eventually authoring a series of books on the language: ''How to Teach Hebrew in the Elementary Grades'' (1946), ''Hebrew, the Story of a Living Language'' (1947), ''Hebrew, the Eternal Language'' (1957) and ''Teaching and Learning'' (1959), as well as an edited version of ''David Kimhi's Hebrew Grammar'' (1952).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 9&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a &quot;very warm, gentle, and engaging&quot; individual, William Chomsky placed a great emphasis on educating people so that they would be &quot;well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all&quot;, a view that would be subsequently be adopted by his son.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=&quot;What motivated his [political] interests? A powerful curiosity, exposure to divergent opinions, and an unorthodox education have all been given as answers to this question. He was clearly struck by the obvious contradictions between his own readings and mainstream press reports. The measurement of the distance between the realities presented by these two sources, and the evaluation of why such a gap exists, remained a passion for Chomsky.&quot;|source=Biographer Robert F. Barsky, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 30&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noam was the Chomsky family's first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later. The brothers remained close, although David was more easy-going while Noam could be very competitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's parents' first language was [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], but Chomsky said it was &quot;taboo&quot; in his family to speak it. Unlike her husband, Elsie spoke &quot;ordinary [[New York dialect|New York English]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;/&gt; Both the Chomsky brothers were raised into this Jewish environment, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of [[Zionism]]; the family were particularly influenced by the [[Left Zionism|Left Zionist]] writings of [[Ahad Ha'am]] (1856&amp;ndash;1927).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Being Jewish, Chomsky faced [[anti-semitism]] as a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in Philadelphia; he recalls German &quot;beer parties&quot; celebrating the [[Battle of France|fall of Paris to the Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conversations-with-History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreisler |first=Harry |title=Activism, Anarchism, and Power: Conversation with Noam Chomsky |work=Conversations with History |publisher=Institute of International Studies, [[UC Berkeley]] |date=March 22, 2002 |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con1.html |accessdate=September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noam described his parents as &quot;normal [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]&quot;, adopting a centre-left position on the political spectrum, but he was exposed to far left politics through other members of the family, a number of whom were [[socialism|socialists]] involved in the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU) trade union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced largely by his uncle who, having never passed [[Fourth grade|4th grade]], owned a newspaper stand in [[New York City]] where local Jewish leftists came to debate the issues of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barksy 1997 23&quot;&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;globetrotter.berkeley.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con1.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky, p. 1 of 5 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever visiting his family in the city, Chomsky also frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores, becoming a voracious reader of political literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barksy 1997 23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;globetrotter.berkeley.edu&quot;/&gt; He would later describe his discovery of [[anarchism]] as a &quot;lucky accident&quot;, allowing him to become critical of other radical left-wing ideologies, namely [[Marxism-Leninism]], which held to the belief that the path to an egalitarian society lay in the control of the [[vanguard party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barksy 1997 17-19&quot;&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 17&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's primary education was undertaken at [[Oak Lane Day School|Oak Lane Country Day School]], an independent institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non-competitive atmosphere. It was here that he wrote his first article, aged 10, on the spread of [[fascism]], following the fall of Barcelona in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 15&amp;ndash;17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreisler (2002), {{cite web|title=Chapter 1: Background |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con1.html |accessdate=September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 12, he moved on to secondary education at [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], where he joined various clubs and societies but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching that they employed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 21&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University: 1945&amp;ndash;55===
{{double image|right|Rudolf Rocker.jpg|155|George Orwell press photo.jpg|150|Anarcho-syndicalist [[Rudolf Rocker]] (left) and English democratic socialist [[George Orwell]] (right) were both strong influences on the young Chomsky. Their work convinced him that an anarcho-syndicalist society was both possible and desirable.}}
A graduate of [[Central High School of Philadelphia]], Chomsky began studying [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1945, taking classes with philosophers such as [[C. West Churchman]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] and linguist [[Zellig Harris]]. Harris's teaching included his discovery of transformations as a [[linear transformation|mathematical analysis]] of language structure (mappings from one subset to another in the set of sentences). Chomsky referred to the morphophonemic rules in his 1951 master's thesis&amp;nbsp;– ''The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew''&amp;nbsp;– as transformations in the sense of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap's]] 1938 notion of rules of transformation (vs. rules of formation), and subsequently reinterpreted the notion of grammatical transformations in a very different way from Harris, as operations on the productions of a [[context-free grammar]] (derived from [[Post canonical system|Post production systems]]).

On visits to New York City, Chomsky frequented the office of the Yiddish-language anarchist journal ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', becoming enamoured with the work of one of its contributors, the anarcho-syndicalist [[Rudolf Rocker]] (1873&amp;ndash;1958). Chomsky would later note that it was Rocker's work that first introduced him to the link between anarchism and [[classical liberalism]], a relationship that he would later go on to explore.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Other political thinkers whose work was read by Chomsky at this time included the anarchist [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], democratic socialists [[George Orwell]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Dwight Macdonald]] and works by non-Bolshevik Marxists like [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Karl Korsch]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt; His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes that had been set up during the [[Spanish Civil War]] that were documented in Orwell's work ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He became an avid reader of the leftist journal ''[[Politics (journal)|Politics]]'', published by Macdonald from 1944 through to 1949. Although initially adhering to a Marxist viewpoint, in 1946 Macdonald abandoned this approach &quot;to whore after the strange gods of anarchism and pacifism&quot;. Chomsky would later remark that ''Politics'' &quot;answered to and developed&quot; his interest in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 34&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; In his late twenties, Chomsky became a reader of the periodical ''[[International Council Correspondence|Living Marxism]]'', which was published in Chicago by Marxist thinker [[Paul Mattick]] (1904&amp;ndash;1981), a [[council communism|council communist]]. The magazine critically assessed the situation in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union and the developments of the Second World War. Although he rejected its Marxist theoretical basis, Chomsky would become heavily influenced by the council communist movement, voraciously reading the ''Living Marxism'' articles by the likes of [[Antonie Pannekoek]] and [[Karl Korsch]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 36&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky came to know Mattick personally, but would later describe him as &quot;too orthodox a Marxist for my taste&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; He also took a great interest in the political theories of the Marlenites, an obscure group of American anti-Stalinist Marxists led by George Spiro who had united under the [[Leninist League (US)|Leninist League]]. The Marlenites argued that the Second World War was &quot;phoney&quot; because it had been orchestrated by Western capitalists and the &quot;[[state capitalism|state capitalists]]&quot; governing the Soviet Union in order to crush the European proletariat, a viewpoint Chomsky agreed with.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 43&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered into a romantic relationship with a fellow pupil at the Mikveh Israel school, [[Carol Chomsky|Carol Doris Schatz]], whom he had known since they were toddlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, he married her.

Chomsky and his wife lived for part of 1953 in [[HaZore'a]], a [[kibbutz]] in [[Israel]]. Asked in an interview whether the stay was &quot;a disappointment&quot; Chomsky replied, &quot;No, I loved it&quot;; however, he &quot;couldn't stand the ideological atmosphere&quot; and &quot;fervent nationalism&quot; in the early 1950s at the kibbutz, with Stalin being defended by many of the left-leaning kibbutz members who chose to paint a rosy image of future possibilities and contemporary realities in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20051110.htm |title=Noam Chomsky interviewed by Shira Hadad |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky notes seeing many positive elements in the commune-like living of the kibbutz, in which parents and children lived together in separate houses, and when asked whether there were &quot;lessons that we have learned from the history of the kibbutz&quot;, responded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/zspace/commentaries/186 |title=Eight Question on Kibbutzim: Answers from Noam Chomsky Questions from Nikos Raptis |publisher=Zmag.org |date=August 24, 1999 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/kibbutzim01.htm |title=Kibbutzim as a Climate for Learning |publisher=Csudh.edu |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in &quot;some respects, the kibbutzim came closer to the anarchist ideal than any other attempt that lasted for more than a very brief moment before destruction, or that was on anything like a similar scale.

Chomsky received his [[doctorate|PhD]] in linguistics from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1955. He conducted part of his doctoral research during four years at [[Harvard University]] as a [[Harvard Junior Fellow]]. In his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral thesis]], he began to develop some of his linguistic ideas, elaborating on them in his 1957 book ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', one of his best-known works in linguistics.

===Career===

Chomsky joined the staff of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1955 and in 1961 was appointed full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics (now the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy). From 1966 to 1976 he held the Ferrari P. Ward Professorship of Modern Languages and Linguistics, and in 1976 he was appointed Institute Professor. As of 2010, Chomsky has taught at MIT continuously for 55 years.

In February 1967, Chomsky became one of the leading opponents of the Vietnam War with the publication of his essay, &quot;[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Thought==

===Linguistics===
Chomskyan linguistics, beginning with his ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', a distillation of his ''Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (1955, 75), challenges [[structural linguistics]] and introduces [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Transformacijsko-generativni pristup jeziku u ''Sintaktičkim strukturama'' i ''Aspektima teorije sintakse'' Noama Chomskog |trans_title=Transformational-generative approach to language in ''Syntactic structures'' and ''Aspects of the theory of syntax'' of Noam Chomsky |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=SOL: lingvistički časopis |volume=6 |issue=12-13 |pages=103–112 |year=1991 |issn=0352-8715 |archivedate=September 2, 2012| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ANNlKB4s |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach takes utterances (sequences of words) to have a syntax characterized by a formal grammar; in particular, a [[context-free grammar]] extended with transformational rules.

Perhaps his most influential and time-tested contribution to the field is the claim that modeling knowledge of language using a [[formal grammar]] accounts for the &quot;productivity&quot; or &quot;creativity&quot; of language. In other words, a formal grammar of a language can explain the ability of a hearer-speaker to produce and interpret an infinite number of utterances, including novel ones, with a limited set of grammatical rules and a finite set of terms. He has always acknowledged his debt to [[Pāṇini]] for his modern notion of an explicit generative grammar, although it is also related to [[rationalist]] ideas of [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] knowledge.

It is a popular misconception that Chomsky proved that language is entirely innate, and that he discovered a &quot;universal grammar&quot; (UG). In fact, Chomsky simply observed that while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human child will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever the relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the &quot;language acquisition device&quot; (LAD) and suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to figure out what the LAD is and what constraints it puts on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints are often termed &quot;[[universal grammar]]&quot; or UG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noam Chomsky |url=http://www.chomsky.info/books/architecture01.htm |title=The 'Chomskyan Era' (Excerpted from The Architecture of Language) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principles and Parameters approach (P&amp;P)&amp;nbsp;– developed in his Pisa 1979 Lectures, later published as ''[[Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures|Lectures on Government and Binding]]'' (LGB)&amp;nbsp;– makes strong claims regarding universal grammar: that the grammatical principles underlying languages are innate and fixed, and the differences among the world's languages can be characterized in terms of parameter settings in the brain (such as the pro-drop parameter, which indicates whether an explicit subject is always required, as in English, or can be optionally dropped, as in Spanish), which are often likened to switches. (Hence the term principles and parameters, often given to this approach.) In this view, a child learning a language need only acquire the necessary [[lexical]] items (words, grammatical [[morpheme]]s, and idioms), and determine the appropriate parameter settings, which can be done based on a few key examples.

Proponents of this view argue that the pace at which children learn languages is inexplicably rapid, unless children have an innate ability to learn languages. The similar steps followed by children all across the world when learning languages, and the fact that children make certain characteristic errors as they learn their first language, whereas other seemingly logical kinds of errors never occur (and, according to Chomsky, should be attested if a purely general, rather than language-specific, learning mechanism were being employed), are also pointed to as indications of innateness.

More recently, in his [[Minimalist Program]] (1995), while retaining the core concept of &quot;principles and parameters,&quot; Chomsky attempts a major overhaul of the linguistic machinery involved in the LGB model, stripping from it all but the barest necessary elements, while advocating a general approach to the architecture of the human language faculty that emphasizes principles of economy and optimal design, reverting to a derivational approach to generation, in contrast with the largely representational approach of classic P&amp;P.

Chomsky's ideas have had a strong influence on researchers of [[language acquisition]] in children, though many researchers in this area such as [[Elizabeth Bates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elman, J., Bates, E., Johnson, M., Karmiloff-Smith, A., Parisi, D., &amp; Plunkett, K. |year=1996|title=Rethinking innateness: A connectionist perspective on development|publisher= Cambridge, MA: MIT Press/Bradford Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Tomasello]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tomasello, M|year=2003|title= Constructing a Language: A Usage-Based Theory of Language Acquisition|publisher= Harvard University Press| isbn=0-674-01764-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue very strongly against Chomsky's theories, and instead advocate [[Emergence|emergentist]] or [[connectionist]] theories, explaining language with a number of general processing mechanisms in the brain that interact with the extensive and complex social environment in which language is used and learned.

His best-known work in [[phonology]] is ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'' (1968), written with [[Morris Halle]] (and often known as simply ''SPE''). This work has had a great significance for the development in the field. While phonological theory has since moved beyond &quot;SPE phonology&quot; in many important respects, the SPE system is considered the precursor of some of the most influential phonological theories today, including [[autosegmental phonology]], lexical phonology and [[optimality theory]]. Chomsky no longer publishes on phonology.

====Generative grammar====
{{Main|Generative grammar}}
The Chomskyan approach towards [[syntax]], often termed [[generative grammar]], studies grammar as a body of knowledge possessed by language users. Since the 1960s, Chomsky has maintained that much of this knowledge is innate, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;aspects&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Aspects of the Theory of Syntax|publisher=MIT Press|author=Chomsky, Noam|year=1965|isbn=0-262-53007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The innate body of linguistic knowledge is often termed [[universal grammar]]. From Chomsky's perspective, the strongest evidence for the existence of Universal Grammar is simply the fact that children successfully acquire their native languages in so little time. Furthermore, he argues that there is an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (the &quot;[[poverty of the stimulus]]&quot; argument). The knowledge of Universal Grammar would serve to bridge that gap.

Chomsky's theories have been immensely influential within linguistics, but they have also received criticism. One recurring criticism of the Chomskyan variety of generative grammar is that it is Anglocentric and Eurocentric, and that often linguists working in this tradition have a tendency to base claims about Universal Grammar on a very small sample of languages, sometimes just one. Initially, the Eurocentrism was exhibited in an overemphasis on the study of English. However, hundreds of different languages have now received at least some attention within Chomskyan linguistic analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Logical relations in Chinese and the theory of grammar|author=Huang, Cheng-Teh James|year=1982|url= |publisher=MIT PhD dissertation}} Available online [http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/15215].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidatsa Syntax|author=Matthews, G.H.|year=1965|publisher=Mouton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Platero, Paul Randolph|year=1978|title=Missing noun phrases in Navajo|publisher=MIT PhD dissertation}} Available online [http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/16328].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Towards a Minimalist Account of Quirky Case and Licensing in Icelandic|author=Schütze, Carson T.|year=1993|publisher=MIT Working Papers in Linguistics 19}} Available online [http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/cschutze/Icelandic.MITWPL.fixed.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Matching Effects and the Syntax-Morphology Interface: Evidence from Hindi Correlatives|author=Bhatt, Rajesh|publisher=MIT Working Papers in Linguistics 31|year=1997}} Available online [http://people.umass.edu/bhatt/papers/mscil.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the diversity of languages that have been characterized by UG derivations, critics continue to argue that the formalisms within Chomskyan linguistics are Anglocentric and misrepresent the properties of languages that are different from English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science|author=Evans, N., &amp; Levinson, S.

This practice has been criticized on general methodological grounds. Some [[psychology|psychologists]] and [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguists]],{{Who|date=March 2009}} though sympathetic to Chomsky's overall program, have argued that Chomskyan linguists pay insufficient attention to experimental data from language processing, with the consequence that their theories are not psychologically plausible. Other critics (see [[language learning]]) have questioned whether it is necessary to posit Universal Grammar to explain child language acquisition, arguing that domain-general learning mechanisms are sufficient.

Today there are many different branches of generative grammar; one can view grammatical frameworks such as [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], [[lexical functional grammar]], and [[combinatory categorial grammar]] as broadly Chomskyan and generative in orientation, but with significant differences in execution.

====Chomsky hierarchy====
{{Main|Chomsky hierarchy}}
Chomsky is famous for investigating various kinds of [[formal language]]s and whether or not they might be capable of capturing key properties of human language. His [[Chomsky hierarchy]] partitions [[formal grammar]]s into classes, or groups, with increasing expressive power, i.e., each successive class can generate a broader set of formal languages than the one before. Interestingly, Chomsky argues that modeling some aspects of human language requires a more complex formal grammar (as measured by the Chomsky hierarchy) than modeling others. For example, while a [[regular language]] is powerful enough to model English [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], it is not powerful enough to model English [[syntax]]. In addition to being relevant in linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy has also become important in [[computer science]] (especially in [[compiler]] construction and [[automata theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Davis. ''Computability, complexity, and languages: Fundamentals of theoretical computer science''. Boston: Academic, Harcourt, Brace, 1994: 327. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is an equivalence between the Chomsky language hierarchy and the different kinds of automata. Thus theorems about languages are often dealt with as either languages (grammars) or automata.

An alternate method of dealing with languages is based upon [[Formal power series|Formal Power series]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Computer Programming and Formal Systems&quot;, Eds. P. Braffort and D. Hirschberg, pp. 124–135&lt;/ref&gt; Formal Power series as well as the relationship between languages and [[Semigroup|semi-groups]] continued to occupy M. P. Schützenberger at the Sorbonne. Formal Power Series are similar to the Taylor Series one encounters in a course on Calculus, and it is especially useful for languages where words (terminal symbols) are commutative.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Finite Semigroups and Recognizable Languages: An Introduction&quot;, by Jean-Eric Pin, Bull Research and Development, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky has engaged in political activism all of his adult life and expressed opinions on politics and world events, which are widely cited, publicized, and discussed. Chomsky has in turn argued that his views are those the powerful do not want to hear, and for this reason he is considered an American political [[dissident]].

Chomsky asserts that [[Political power|authority]], unless justified, is inherently illegitimate, and that the burden of proof is on those in authority. If this burden can't be met, the authority in question should be dismantled. Authority for its own sake is inherently unjustified. An example given by Chomsky of a legitimate authority is that exerted by an adult to prevent a young child from wandering into traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=2G6kf7XM9Nk |title=''Anarchism 101 with Noam Chomsky'' |publisher=Youtube.com |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one's self to an owner or &quot;[[wage slavery]]&quot;. He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace, a view held (as he notes) by the [[Lowell Mill Girls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky, p. 2 of 5 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky has strongly criticized the [[foreign policy of the United States]]. He claims double standards in a foreign policy preaching democracy and freedom for all while allying itself with non-democratic and repressive organizations and states such as [[Chile]] under [[Augusto Pinochet]] and argues that this results in massive [[human rights]] violations. He often argues that America's intervention in foreign nations, including the secret aid given to the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua, an event of which he has been very critical, fits any standard description of [[terrorism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/GlobalWatch/chomskymit.htm An Evening With Noam Chomsky]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} including &quot;official definitions in the US Code and Army Manuals in the early 1980s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200501--.pdf |title=Simple Truths, Hard Problems: Some thoughts on terror, justice, and self-defence* |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noam Chomsky |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199112--02.htm |title=International Terrorism: Image and Reality |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before its collapse, Chomsky also condemned [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] imperialism; for example in 1986 during a question/answer following a lecture he gave at Universidad Centroamericana in Nicaragua, when challenged about how he could &quot;talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath,&quot; Chomsky responded: &quot;One of the truths about the world is that there are two superpowers, one a huge power which happens to have its boot on your neck; another, a smaller power which happens to have its boot on other people's necks.

Regarding the [[death of Osama bin Laden]], Chomsky stated: &quot;We might ask ourselves how we would be reacting if Iraqi commandos landed at George W. Bush's compound, assassinated him, and dumped his body in the Atlantic. Uncontroversially, his crimes vastly exceed bin Laden's, and he is not a 'suspect' but uncontroversially the 'decider' who gave the orders to commit the 'supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole' (quoting the Nuremberg Tribunal) for which Nazi criminals were hanged: the hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of refugees, destruction of much of the country, [and] the bitter sectarian conflict that has now spread to the rest of the region.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guernicamag.com/blog/2652/noam_chomsky_my_reaction_to_os/ |title=Noam Chomsky: My Reaction to Osama bin Laden's Death |publisher=Guernicamag.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has argued that the mass [[media in the United States]] largely serve as a &quot;[[Bought Priesthood|bought priesthood]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChomskyOtero2003_2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|last2=Otero|first2=Carlos Peregrín|title=Chomsky on democracy &amp; education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=84NQ3IXpbOYC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=August 16, 2011|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-92632-4|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[U.S. government]] and U.S.-based corporations, with the three intertwined through common interests. In a famous reference to [[Walter Lippmann]], Chomsky along with his coauthor [[Edward S. Herman]] has written that the American media [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactures consent]] among the public. Chomsky has condemned the 2010 [[US Supreme Court]] ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Citizens United]]'' ruling revoking the limits on campaign finance, calling it a &quot;corporate takeover of democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noam Chomsky |url=http://chomsky.info/articles/20100124.htm |title=The Corporate Takeover of U.S. Democracy |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky opposes the U.S. global &quot;[[war on drugs]]&quot;, claiming its language is misleading, and refers to it as &quot;the war on certain drugs.&quot; He favors [[drug policy reform]], in education and prevention rather than military or police action as a means of reducing drug use.&lt;ref name=&quot;certain&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky is critical of the American &quot;[[state capitalism|state capitalist]]&quot; system and big business; he describes himself as a [[Socialism|socialist]], specifically an [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], and is critical of &quot;authoritarian&quot; [[communist]] branches of socialism.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} He also believes that socialist values exemplify the rational and morally consistent extension of original unreconstructed classical liberal and radical humanist ideas to an industrial context. He believes that society should be highly organized and based on democratic control of communities and work places. He believes that the radical humanist ideas of his two major influences, [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[John Dewey]], were &quot;rooted in the Enlightenment and classical liberalism, and retain their revolutionary character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1996), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky has stated that he believes the United States remains the &quot;greatest country in the world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/30/ltm.01.html &quot;Interview with Noam Chomsky, Bill Bennett&quot;], May 30, 2002 ''American Morning with Paula Zahn CNN''&lt;/ref&gt; a comment that he later clarified by saying, &quot;Evaluating countries is senseless and I would never put things in those terms, but that some of America's advances, particularly in the area of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]], that have been achieved by centuries of popular struggle, are to be admired.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Routledge. p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky objects to the criticism that [[anarchism]] is inconsistent with support for government welfare, stating in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One can, of course, take the position that we don't care about the problems people face today, and want to think about a possible tomorrow. OK, but then don't pretend to have any interest in human beings and their fate, and stay in the seminar room and intellectual coffee house with other privileged people. Or one can take a much more humane position: I want to work, today, to build a better society for tomorrow&amp;nbsp;– the classical anarchist position, quite different from the slogans in the question. That's exactly right, and it leads directly to support for the people facing problems today: for enforcement of health and safety regulation, provision of national health insurance, support systems for people who need them, etc. That is not a sufficient condition for organizing for a different and better future, but it is a necessary condition. Anything else will receive the well-merited contempt of people who do not have the luxury to disregard the circumstances in which they live, and try to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/chomsky_repliesana.htm 'Answers by Noam Chomsky' to questions about anarchism]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky holds views that can be summarized as [[anti-war]] but not strictly pacifist. He prominently opposed the Vietnam War and most other wars in his lifetime. He expressed these views with [[tax resistance]] and peace walks. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt; He published a number of articles about the war in Vietnam, including &quot;The Responsibility of Intellectuals&quot;. He maintains that U.S. involvement in World War II to defeat the [[Axis powers]] was probably justified, with the caveat that a preferable outcome would have been to end or prevent the war through earlier diplomacy. He believes that the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of nuclear bombs]] on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were &quot;among the most unspeakable crimes in history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/debates/19670420.htm |title=An Exchange on &quot;The Responsibility of Intellectuals&quot;, Noam Chomsky debates with Fryar Calhoun, E.

Chomsky has made many criticisms of the [[Israel]]i government, its supporters, the United States' support of the government, and its treatment of the [[Palestinian people]], arguing that &quot; 'supporters of Israel' are in reality supporters of its moral degeneration and probable ultimate destruction&quot; and that &quot;Israel's very clear choice of expansion over security may well lead to that consequence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20080606.htm |title=On the Future of Israel and Palestine |publisher=Chomsky.info |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky disagreed with the founding of Israel as a Jewish state, saying, &quot;I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept.

Chomsky has a broad view of free-speech rights, especially in the [[mass media]], and opposes [[censorship]].

Chomsky has frequently stated that there is no connection between his work in linguistics and his political views and is generally critical of the idea that competent discussion of political topics requires expert knowledge in academic fields. In a 1969 interview, he said regarding the connection between his politics and his work in linguistics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I still feel myself that there is a kind of tenuous connection. I would not want to overstate it but I think it means something to me at least. I think that anyone's political ideas or their ideas of social organization must be rooted ultimately in some concept of human nature and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;''New Left Review'', 57, September–October 1969, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics have accused Chomsky of hypocrisy when, in spite of his political criticism of American and European military imperialism,
early research at the institution (MIT) where he did his linguistic research had been substantially funded by the American military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Chomsky Discusses Economy, Military Hegemony|author=Ghoshroy, S.|year=2008|publisher=The Tech, 128, 51}} Available online [http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N51/chomsky.html].&lt;/ref&gt; More sympathetic critics, pointing to the same institutional sponsorship, have described him instead as 'the conscience of America'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_chomsky_interview_reply.pdf Knight, C. (2010). The Chomsky Enigma.] ''Radical Anthropology'' 4, 22-30. ISSN 1756-090X&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky himself makes the argument that because he has received funding from the U.S. military, he has an even greater responsibility to criticize and resist its immoral actions.

He is also an outspoken opponent of the [[death penalty]] and has spoken against the execution of [[Steven Michael Woods, Jr.|Steven Woods]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think the death penalty is a crime no matter what the circumstances, and it is particularly awful in the Steven Woods case. I strongly oppose the execution of [[Steven Michael Woods, Jr.|Steven Woods]] on September 13, 2011.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chomsky endorses Stein in 2012|url=http://www.jillstein.org/chomsky|publisher=Jill Stein for President|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky endorsed [[Jill Stein]] for Green party Presidential nominee in 2012, saying,
{{quote|I hope you'll take the opportunity of the March 6th Green-Rainbow primary to cast a vote for resurgent democracy. A democracy that thrives outside of the Democratic and Republican Parties that are sponsored by and subservient to corporate America. ... As you know, popular anger at the political and economic institutions, and the subordination of the former to the latter, has reached historic heights. And for sound reasons. There could hardly be a better time to open up political debate to the just anger and frustrations of citizens who are watching the country move towards what might be irreversible decline while a tiny sector of concentrated wealth and power implements policies of benefit to them and opposed by the general population, whom they are casting adrift.}}

[[Nick Cohen]] has criticised Chomsky for frequently making overly critical statements about Western governments, especially the US, and for allegedly refusing to retract his speculations when facts become available which disprove them.&lt;ref&gt;

Chomsky also supports and focuses on [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] separatism both in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies, p.286, 287&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media====
Another focus of Chomsky's political work has been an analysis of mainstream mass media (especially in the United States), its structures and constraints, and its perceived role in supporting big business and government interests. [[Edward S. Herman]] and Chomsky's book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' (1988) explores this topic in depth, presenting their &quot;propaganda model&quot; of the news media with numerous detailed case studies demonstrating it. According to this propaganda model, more democratic societies like the U.S. use subtle, non-violent means of control, unlike totalitarian systems, where physical force can readily be used to coerce the general population. In an often-quoted remark, Chomsky states that &quot;propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.&quot; (Media Control)

The model attempts to explain this perceived [[systemic bias]] of the mass media in terms of structural economic causes rather than a conspiracy of people. It argues the bias derives from five &quot;filters&quot; that all published news must &quot;pass through,&quot; which combine to systematically distort news coverage.

In explaining the first filter, ownership, he notes that most major media outlets are owned by large corporations. The second, funding, notes that the outlets derive the majority of their funding from advertising, not readers. Thus, since they are profit-oriented businesses selling a product&amp;nbsp;– readers and audiences&amp;nbsp;– to other businesses (advertisers), the model expects them to publish news that reflects the desires and values of those businesses. In addition, the news media are dependent on government institutions and major businesses with strong biases as sources (the third filter) for much of their information. Flak, the fourth filter, refers to the various pressure groups that attack the media for supposed bias. Norms, the fifth filter, refer to the common conceptions shared by those in the profession of journalism. (Note: in the original text, published in 1988, the fifth filter was &quot;anticommunism&quot;. However, with the fall of the Soviet Union, it has been broadened to allow for shifts in public opinion.) The model describes how the media form a decentralized and non-conspiratorial but nonetheless very powerful propaganda system, that is able to mobilize an elite consensus, frame public debate within elite perspectives and at the same time give the appearance of democratic consent.

Chomsky and Herman test their model empirically by picking &quot;paired examples&quot;&amp;nbsp;– pairs of events that were objectively similar except for the alignment of domestic elite interests. They use a number of such examples to attempt to show that in cases where an &quot;official enemy&quot; does something (like murder of a religious official), the press investigates thoroughly and devotes a great amount of coverage to the matter, thus victims of &quot;enemy&quot; states are considered &quot;worthy&quot;. But when the domestic government or an ally does the same thing (or worse), the press downplays the story, thus victims of US or US client states are considered &quot;unworthy.&quot;

They also test their model against the case that is often held up as the best example of a free and aggressively independent press, the media coverage of the [[Tet Offensive]] during the Vietnam War. Even in this case, they argue that the press was behaving subserviently to elite interests.

===Science===
Chomsky sees science as a straightforward search for [[explanation]], and rejects the views of it as a catalog of [[fact]]s or mechanical explanations. In this light, the majority of his contributions to science have been frameworks and [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], rather than &quot;discoveries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mysteries of nature&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

As such, he considers certain so-called [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] or [[post-modernism|postmodern]] critiques of logic and reason to be nonsensical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have spent a lot of my life working on questions such as these, using the only methods I know of; those condemned here as &quot;science&quot;, &quot;rationality,&quot; &quot;logic,&quot; and so on. I therefore read the papers with some hope that they would help me &quot;transcend&quot; these limitations, or perhaps suggest an entirely different course. I'm afraid I was disappointed. Admittedly, that may be my own limitation. Quite regularly, &quot;my eyes glaze over&quot; when I read polysyllabic discourse on the themes of [[poststructuralism]] and [[postmodernism]]; what I understand is largely [[truism]] or error, but that is only a fraction of the total word count. True, there are lots of other things I don't understand: the articles in the current issues of math and physics journals, for example. But there is a difference. In the latter case, I know how to get to understand them, and have done so, in cases of particular interest to me; and I also know that people in these fields can explain the contents to me at my level, so that I can gain what (partial) understanding I may want. In contrast, no one seems to be able to explain to me why the latest post-this-and-that is (for the most part) other than truism, error, or gibberish, and I do not know how to proceed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChomskyOtero2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|last2=Otero|first2=Carlos Peregrín|title=Chomsky on democracy &amp; education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5Ouy4XoXPsC|accessdate=August 16, 2011|year=2003|publisher=RoutledgeFalmer|isbn=978-0-415-92632-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Chomsky believes that a scientific background is important to teach proper reasoning, he holds that science in general is &quot;inadequate&quot; to understand complicated problems like human affairs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Science talks about very simple things, and asks hard questions about them. As soon as things become too complex, science can't deal with them... But it's a complicated matter: Science studies what's at the edge of understanding, and what's at the edge of understanding is usually fairly simple. And it rarely reaches human affairs. Human affairs are way too complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/debates/20060301.htm |title=Science in the Dock, Discussion with Noam Chomsky, Lawrence Krauss &amp; Sean M.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Psychology===
Chomsky's work in linguistics has had profound implications for modern [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMN Cognitive Science&quot; /&gt; For Chomsky, linguistics is a branch of [[cognitive psychology]]; genuine insights in linguistics imply concomitant understandings of aspects of mental processing and human nature. His theory of a [[universal grammar]] was seen by many as a direct challenge to the established [[behaviorist]] theories of the time and had major consequences for understanding how children learn [[language]] and what, exactly, the ability to use language is.

In 1959, Chomsky published an influential critique of [[B.F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner's]] ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'', a book in which Skinner offered a theoretical account of language in functional, behavioral terms. He defined &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; as learned behavior that has characteristic consequences delivered through the learned behavior of others. This makes for a view of communicative behaviors much larger than that usually addressed by linguists. Skinner's approach focused on the circumstances in which language was used; for example, asking for water was functionally a different response than labeling something as water, responding to someone asking for water, etc. These functionally different kinds of responses, which required in turn separate explanations, sharply contrasted both with traditional notions of language and Chomsky's psycholinguistic approach. Chomsky thought that a functionalist explanation restricting itself to questions of communicative performance ignored important questions. (Chomsky&amp;nbsp;– Language and Mind, 1968). He focused on questions concerning the operation and development of innate structures for syntax capable of creatively organizing, cohering, adapting and combining words and phrases into intelligible utterances.

In the review Chomsky emphasized that the scientific application of behavioral principles from animal research is severely lacking in explanatory adequacy and is furthermore particularly superficial as an account of human verbal behavior because a theory restricting itself to external conditions, to &quot;what is learned,&quot; cannot adequately account for generative grammar. Chomsky raised the examples of rapid language acquisition of children, including their quickly developing ability to form grammatical sentences, and the universally creative language use of competent native speakers to highlight the ways in which Skinner's view exemplified under-determination of theory by evidence. He argued that to understand human verbal behavior such as the creative aspects of language use and language development, one must first postulate a genetic linguistic endowment. The assumption that important aspects of language are the product of universal innate ability runs counter to Skinner's radical behaviorism.

Chomsky's 1959 review has drawn fire from a number of critics, the most famous criticism being that of Kenneth MacCorquodale's 1970 paper ''On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior'' (''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior,'' volume 13, pages 83–99). MacCorquodale's argument was updated and expanded in important respects by Nathan Stemmer in a 1990 paper, ''Skinner's Verbal Behavior, Chomsky's review, and mentalism'' (''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior,'' volume 54, pages 307–319). These and similar critiques have raised certain points not generally acknowledged outside of behavioral psychology, such as the claim that Chomsky did not possess an adequate understanding of either behavioral psychology in general, or the differences between Skinner's behaviorism and other varieties. Consequently, it is argued that he made several serious errors. On account of these perceived problems, the critics maintain that the review failed to demonstrate what it has often been cited as doing. As such, it is averred that those most influenced by Chomsky's paper probably either already substantially agreed with Chomsky or never actually read it. The review has been further critiqued for misrepresenting the work of Skinner and others, including by quoting out of context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774611/?tool=pmcentrez Journal citation PMC2774611&amp;nbsp;– An Underdiscussed Aspect of Chomsky (1959)]&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky has maintained that the review was directed at the way Skinner's variant of behavioral psychology &quot;was being used in Quinean empiricism and naturalization of philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barsky (1997), {{cite web|url=http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/3/2.html |title=Chapter 3|accessdate=September 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that Chomsky's critique of Skinner's methodology and basic assumptions paved the way for the &quot;[[cognitive revolution]]&quot;, the shift in American psychology between the 1950s through the 1970s from being primarily behavioral to being primarily cognitive. In his 1966 ''Cartesian Linguistics'' and subsequent works, Chomsky laid out an explanation of human language faculties that has become the model for investigation in some areas of psychology. Much of the present conception of how the mind works draws directly from ideas that found their first persuasive author of modern times in Chomsky.

There are three key ideas. First is that the mind is &quot;cognitive&quot;, or that the mind actually contains mental states, beliefs, doubts, and so on. Second, he argued that most of the important properties of language and mind are innate. The acquisition and development of a language is a result of the unfolding of innate propensities triggered by the experiential input of the external environment. The link between human innate aptitude to language and heredity has been at the core of the debate opposing Noam Chomsky to [[Jean Piaget]] at the [[Abbaye de Royaumont]] in 1975 (''Language and Learning. The Debate between Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky,'' Harvard University Press, 1980). Although links between the genetic setup of humans and aptitude to language have been suggested at that time and in later discussions, we are still far from understanding the genetic bases of human language. Work derived from the model of selective stabilization of [[synapses]] set up by [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]], Philippe Courrège and [[Antoine Danchin]],&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently developed experimentally and theoretically by [[Jacques Mehler]] and [[Stanislas Dehaene]] in particular in the domain of [[numerical cognition]] lend support to the Chomskyan &quot;nativism&quot;. It does not, however, provide clues about the type of rules that would organize neuronal connections to permit language competence. Subsequent psychologists have extended this general &quot;nativist&quot; thesis beyond language. Lastly, Chomsky made the concept of &quot;[[Modularity of Mind|modularity]]&quot; a critical feature of the mind's cognitive architecture. The mind is composed of an array of interacting, specialized subsystems with limited flows of inter-communication. This model contrasts sharply with the old idea that any piece of information in the mind could be accessed by any other cognitive process (optical illusions, for example, cannot be &quot;turned off&quot; even when they are known to be illusions).

==Influence==
''Chomskyan'' models have been used as a theoretical basis in various fields of study. The [[Chomsky hierarchy]] is often taught in fundamental [[computer science]] courses as it confers insight into the various types of [[formal language]]s. This hierarchy can also be discussed in mathematical terms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sakharov|first=Alex|title=Grammar|publisher=MathWorld|date=May 12, 2003|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Grammar.html|accessdate=September 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has generated interest among mathematicians, particularly [[combinatorics|combinatorialists]]. Some arguments in [[evolutionary psychology]] are derived from his research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 6: Evolutionary Psychology, Problem Solving, and 'Machiavellian' Intelligence|publisher=Massey University|work=School of Psychology|year=1996|url=http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm|accessdate=September 4, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070117055247/http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Nobel Prize laureate in Medicine and Physiology, [[Niels Kaj Jerne|Niels K. Jerne]], used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system, equating &quot;components of a generative grammar ... with various features of
protein structures&quot;. The title of Jerne's Stockholm Nobel lecture was &quot;The Generative Grammar of the Immune System&quot;.

[[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in [[animal language acquisition]] at [[Columbia University]], was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.

Famous computer scientist [[Donald Knuth]] admits to reading ''Syntactic Structures'' during his honeymoon and being greatly influenced by it. &quot;...I must admit to taking a copy of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures along with me on my honeymoon in 1961 ...
