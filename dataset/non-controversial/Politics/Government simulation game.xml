      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17340">{{Simulation VG}}
A '''government simulation''' or '''political simulation''' is a game that attempts to simulate the government and politics of all or part of a nation. These games may include geopolitical situations (involving the formation and execution of foreign policy), the creation of domestic political policies, or the simulation of political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/08/12/news_6104371.html | title = Spot On: Games get political | accessdate = 2007-01-07 | author = Tom Leupold | date = 2004-08-12 | publisher = [[Gamespot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from the genre of classical [[wargaming|wargames]] due to their discouragement or abstraction of military or action elements.

==Background==
[[File:Diplomacy pcgame screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A screenshot from the 2005 computer adaptation of ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'', first created as a board game in 1954.]]

Games based on geopolitics and elections existed long before the emergence of personal computers and their ability to quickly process large amounts of statistical data. One of the earliest such games was ''The Game of Politics'', created by Oswald Lord in 1935&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, February 3, 1936, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755767-1,00.html &quot;Monopoly &amp; Politics&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; which remained in print until 1960. In 1954, the board game ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' was created, which differs from other wargames in that it features a &quot;negotiation&quot; phase during which players reach agreements with other players, and then execute military moves simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Allan B. Calhamer, Europa Express #10, [http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S1998R/Calhamer/invention.html &quot;The Roots of Diplomacy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; National politics has remained a vital area of board gaming, with products such as the 1986 board game ''[[Die Macher]]'' featuring elections in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Erik Arneson, [http://boardgames.about.com/library/weekly/aa061399.htm &quot;Playing Politics&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Wreck the Nation'' which satirizes the politics of the United States under the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzflash.com/store/reviews/274 |title=BuzzFlash Reviews |publisher=Buzzflash.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After enjoying years as a [[play-by-mail game]], ''Diplomacy'' was one of the first games to move to take advantage of [[e-mail]], and continues to be a popular email game as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Burgess, [http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/postal/pbm-vs-pbem.htm &quot;Play-by-Mail Diplomacy vs Play-by-Email Diplomacy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer gaming==
&lt;!-- When adding games to the history section, please try and arrange it into rough chronological order, and indicate why a particular title was notable for its time or representative of a trend within the genre. --&gt;

[[File:BalanceOfPower.png|thumb|left|240px|A screenshot from the [[Atari ST]] version of ''[[Balance of Power (computer game)|Balance of Power]]''.]]

As computers became more sophisticated, games in this genre moved beyond e-mail to more complex simulations. One of the earliest titles in this genre was ''[[Balance of Power (computer game)|Balance of Power]]'', designed by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] and published in 1985. This game features conflict at the height of the [[Cold War]], using political and policy decisions to shape outcomes rather than warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Crawford (2003), Chris Crawford on Game Design, ISBN 0-13-146099-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mandel, The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Jun., 1987), [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-0027(198706)31%3A2%3C333%3AAEOT%22O%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5 &quot;An Evaluation of the 'Balance of Power' Simulation&quot;], pp. 333-345,&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Balance of Power'', any armed conflict between the player and the opponent superpower results in a nuclear war, which is considered a loss condition.

Other Cold War era games included ''[[Conflict: Middle East Political Simulator]]'' created by [[Virgin Interactive]], [[Spectrum Holobyte|Spectrum Holobyte's]] ''[[Crisis in the Kremlin]]'' and virtually unknown ''[[Hidden Agenda (computer game)|Hidden Agenda]]''.

''Conflict'' simulated a hypothetical situation in 1997 in which the player assumed the role of the Israeli Prime Minister and was obligated to employ various diplomatic and covert directives to defeat its rival nations. Surrounded by hostile nations, the player was restrained by a very limited military force and was thereby encouraged to employ peaceful means to remain in power until he acquired more advanced weapons systems and power.&lt;ref&gt;Zzap! Issue 70, February 1991, p.48, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071017063735/http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/conflict.htm &quot;Conflict: the Middle East Political Simulator&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Crisis in the Kremlin]]'', the user could play as the protege of any of the following Soviet politicians: [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] of the [[reform]]ist faction; [[Yegor Ligachev]], leader of the hardline faction; and [[Boris Yeltsin]], who was the prevalent figure of the [[nationalist]] faction. The player could use the simulation to test certain strategies to lead the failing [[Soviet Union]] into a new era of prosperity or force its dissolution and integration into the new world order. This game introduced the concept of budget management, citizen and faction satisfaction as well as multiple economic values and political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Social Science Computer Review, Vol. 12, No. 3, 447-448 (1994), &quot;Software Reviews: Crisis in the Kremlin&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hidden Agenda (computer game)|Hidden Agenda]]'' the user takes the role of the president of Chimerica, a fictional post-revolutionary [[Central America]]n country, trying to juggle international relations and the needs of the country's citizens.

Early political simulation games were intended more for education than entertainment. In 1987, ''On the Campaign Trail'' was developed as a tool at [[Kent State University]]'s political campaign management program, and engaged students in decision-making regarding the campaigns for [[United States Senate]] elections between 1970 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Nadine S. Koch, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1049-0965%28199112%2924%3A4%3C694%3AWINTOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4&amp;size=LARGE &quot;Winning Is Not the Only Thing 'On the Campaign Trail': An Evaluation of a Micro-Computer Campaign Simulation&quot;] PS: Political Science and Politics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Dec., 1991), pp. 694-698,&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a commercial market developed for packaged games involving elections and campaigns.

[[File:PoliticalMachine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A screenshot from [[Stardock]]'s ''Political Machine'' game.]]

The 1992 game ''Power Politics'' (and, before it, 1981's [[President Elect (computer game)|President Elect]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/president-elect &quot;President Elect.&quot;] Moby Games (retrieved on January 25th, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; focused on domestic United States political campaigns (but not the running of the country upon election). In 1996, this was adapted to the ''Doonesbury Election Game'', designed by Randy Chase (who also did Power Politics) and published by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]], in which players conducted a campaign with the assistance of a pool of advisors selected from characters in the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/659/659635.html |title=IGN: The Doonesbury Election Game |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=1995-12-30 |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A successor entitled ''Power Politics III'' was released in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/power-politics-iii/|title=Power Politics III (PC)|accessdate=2007-12-22|publisher=[[GameSpy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Stardock]] published ''Political Machine'', in which the player steers a candidate through a 41-week election cycle for United States President, developing policies and tailoring talk show appearances and speech content. The game is heavily tied to modern polling methods, using real-time feedback for how campaign strategy impacts polling numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2004/08/64625|title=Campaign Game Mimics Real Life|accessdate=2007-12-22|author=Jason Silverman|date=2004-08-19|publisher=[[Wired News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], [[TheorySpark]] released ''[[President Forever 2008 + Primaries]]'', an election simulation game that allows the player to realistically control an entire election campaign through both the Primaries and General Election. ''President Forever 2008 + Primaries'' itself a follow-up to the highly successful general election sim ''President Forever'', released in 2004

Some games in the genre involve enacting policies and budget decisions to sway voters. One such game is ''[[Democracy (game)|Democracy]]'', published in 2005 by [[Positech Games]]. In ''Democracy'', players make decisions during each turn regarding which policies to support. As turns progress, the player views how their favorability rating changes amongst certain types of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Democracy (PC)|accessdate=2007-12-06|author=Jess Nickelsen|publisher=NZGamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates make promises before each election, and failure to follow through can result in lower support during the player's reelection campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positech.co.uk/democracy/democracy1.html|title=Positech Democracy|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is [[Commander in Chief (video game)|Commander in Chief]], produced by Eversim, boasting an array of choices for domestic policy and decisions. Another such game is [[Tropico]].

There can also be found games that puts the player in the seat of a state leader, such as [[SuperPower]], and its sequel, [[SuperPower 2]], whose goals are to produce economic stability and prosperity, but the game mainly revolves around foreign policies, with the abilities to interact with other countries in many ways. The game includes a great number of real-life treaties that influence countries.

==Online games==
Web-based games such as [[NationStates]] and [[CyberNations]] allow players to manage the day-to-day decisions of individual governments, and compete against rival nations. Less formally structured games are also played out in [[internet forum]]s, where players manage governments and nations according to a set of agreed rules, such as the MOCpages-based 21st Century World group.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In forum-based simulation games players register, apply for an open nation an avatar (administrator), and then send news article actions which help shape their policies, and aspects such as realism and cooperation are highly promoted.

Other web based games simulate the politics of one specific nation. Players on such games play as fictional politicians and participate in debates, media activity, and simulated elections.

==Related games==
[[File:Maturecity.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A mature city from ''[[SimCity 4]]''.]]

Other [[construction and management simulation]]s require government management. For example, [[city-building game]]s such as the ''[[SimCity]]'' series of games developed and published by [[Maxis]] simulates the experience of being a mayor. ''SimCity'' features a real-time environment in which the player can create zones for city development, build roads, power and water utilities, and watch as their city develops based on their decisions. The game was originally published in 1989 and as of 2003 was in its fourth major release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/382/382583p1.html|title=Sim City 4 Review|accessdate=2007-12-22|author=Tal Blevins|date=2003-01-14|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strategy video game|Strategy games]] frequently make use of government management challenges. [[4X]] games require the management of a government, be it [[tribe|tribal]] or [[Galactic empire|interstellar]]. This includes tasks such as building infrastructure and conducting trade. ''[[Galactic Civilizations II]]'' requires players to manage their approval rating to keep their political party in power. Domestic policy is sometimes abstracted with more emphasis on international conflict. For example, the ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' series gives players total control over resources, and radically restructuring an empire is a matter of clicking a &quot;revolution!&quot; button.

Other strategy games focus on government management to varying degrees. For instance, in the ''[[Hearts of Iron]]'' games (set in [[World War II]]) the civilian population is only a factor with [[partisan (military)|partisans]] and [[Human resources|manpower]], whereas in ''[[Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun|Victoria]]'' a player must not only 'hobnob' and conquer, but implement the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] while warding off (ushering in) real political revolutions such as the [[Revolutions of 1848|upheavals of 1848]] and [[communist revolution|communist revolt]]. Another politically connected game is ''[[Tropico]]''.

Government and politics have also been incorporated into [[adventure game]]s. ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]'', published by [[Infocom]] in 1985, was an [[interactive fiction]] game in which the player controlled a sentient computer capable of experimenting with potential future scenarios based on varying public policy decisions. [[Newsweek]] said of the game, &quot;It isn't '[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]],' but in some ways it is even scarier.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/a-mind-forever-voyaging/adblurbs|title=Ad-Blurbs for A Mind Forever Voyaging|accessdate=2007-12-22|publisher=[[MobyGames]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
Beyond entertainment, these games have practical applications in training and education of government personnel. Training simulations have been created for subjects such as managing law enforcement policies (such as racial profiling), the simulation of a military officer's career, and hospital responses to emergency situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/simulation-games-help-prepare-government-unite-local-businesses|title=Simulation games help prepare government, unite local businesses|accessdate=2011-03-18|author=Dave Carey|date=2007-01-06|publisher=[[The Washington Examiner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
