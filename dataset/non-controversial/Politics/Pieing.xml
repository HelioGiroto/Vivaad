      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24243">[[File:San Francisco pie fight.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A pie fight in [[San Francisco]]]]
'''Pieing''' is the act of throwing a [[pie]] at a person or persons. This can be a political action when the target is an authority figure, politician, or celebrity and can be used as a means of protesting against the target's political beliefs, or against perceived arrogance or vanity. Perpetrators generally regard the act as a form of ridicule to embarrass and humiliate the victim. In some U.S. states pieing may conform to definitions of the crime of battery, but not assault.

Pieing and pie fights are a staple of [[slapstick comedy]], and pie &quot;tosses&quot; are also common charity fundraising events, especially in schools.

==Slapstick==
Pieing has its origins in the &quot;pie in the face&quot; gag from [[slapstick]] comedy, first seen in the 1909 [[Essanay Studios]] [[silent film]] ''[[Mr. Flip]]'' starring [[Ben Turpin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Very Brief History of Slapstick | work = Splat TV | year = 2003 | url = http://splat-tv.artshtick.com/history.html | accessdate = 2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, Turpin has a pie pushed into his face for taking liberties with a woman.

Beginning in 1913 with ''[[That Ragtime Band]]'' and ''[[A Noise from the Deep]]'', filmmaker [[Mack Sennett]] became known for using one or two thrown pies in many of his [[Short film|comedy shorts]]. Sennett had a personal rule about who received the pies: &quot;A mother never gets hit with a custard pie&amp;nbsp;... Mothers-in-law, yes. But mothers? Never.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.com/ns/news-story.aspx?t=mack-sennett--the-father-of-slapstick-cinema&amp;id=152 |title=Mack Sennett – The Father of Slapstick Comedy |work=The Obit Report |publisher=Legacy.com |accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least a half dozen films have been made incorporating extended pie-throwing battles. The first was [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Behind the Screen]]'' released in 1916. The definitive pie fight film is ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'' (1927) starring [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], using 3,000 pies. [[Our Gang]]'s ''[[Shivering Shakespeare]]'' (1930) winds up with an auditorium full of people throwing pies.  The 1935 short subject called ''[[Keystone Hotel (film)|Keystone Hotel]]'' featured a large pie fight ending with the camera taking a pie. In 1941, another major pie fight film appeared: [[The Three Stooges]]' ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]''.&lt;ref name=nowtoronto /&gt;&lt;ref name=rachelgordon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PK9ZsmT9B5IC&amp;pg=PA55 |page=55 |title=The complete films of Laurel &amp; Hardy |chapter=The Battle of the Century |last=Everson |first=William K. |publisher=Citadel Press |year=1967 |isbn=0-8065-0146-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Technicolor]] film involving pies was the 1965 comedy, ''[[The Great Race]]''; known for having the largest pie fight in cinematic history.&lt;ref name=Zeitlin1965&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R1MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84 |pages=84–88 |title=Greatest pie fight ever creates a horrendous SPLAAT! |last=Zeitlin |first=David |work=Life |date=July 9, 1965 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its $200,000 pie fight scene used one large cake and 4,000 pies, and took five days to shoot.&lt;ref name=Wasson2009&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.il/books?id=KWr3jPbVVDkC&amp;lpg=PT99&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PT113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=98 |last=Wasson |first=Sam |title=A splurch in the kisser: the movies of Blake Edwards |chapter=The Great Race (1965) |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2009 |isbn=0-8195-6915-1 |series=Wesleyan Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many instances in the [[Looney Tunes]] series of cartoons where characters &quot;pie&quot; each other in the face. [[Bugs Bunny]] repeatedly hits [[Elmer Fudd]] with cream pies during a scene in ''Slick Hare''. In ''Shishkabugs'', Bugs Bunny releases a spring-loaded pie into the face of the king, causing the royal cook [[Yosemite Sam]] to be led away to a dungeon. The episode ''Daffy Dilly'' has [[Daffy Duck]] trying to cure a dying millionaire by getting him to laugh. After he achieves this inadvertently, by landing in a cake, Daffy is hired as a sort of household jester and ends the cartoon by getting repeatedly pelted with cakes and pies.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvtropes.org&quot;&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PieInTheFace&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the [[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] comic books, [[The Joker]] once concocted an elaborate scheme whose sole purpose was to hit Batman in the face with a pie.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvtropes.org&quot;/&gt;

Many comedy routines have used a pie as a gag, including ones performed by [[Soupy Sales]] and [[Monty Python]].

=== Celebrities who have been pied ===

[[Alison Sweeney]] was pied on the show ''[[Days of our Lives|Days of Our Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://messyworks.sfpincchicago.com/celebrity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brett Favre]] was pied at the 1999 Fox Kids Bowl along with [[Jerome Bettis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|MsIUfAH-Nck|Fox Kids Bowl 99 Pt2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Clarkson]] was pied in 2005 shortly before he was due to receive an honorary degree from [[Oxford Brookes University]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Brookes University &lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Chip Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Dan Wheldon]] threw a pie at teammate [[Scott Dixon]] in celebrating the 2008 Izod IndyCar Series Championship.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Political acts==
{{see also|List of people who have been pied}}

The probable originator of pieing as a political act was [[Thomas King Forcade]], the founder of ''[[High Times]]'' magazine. In 1970, Forcade pied [[Otto N. Larsen]], the Chairman of the [[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]]; his action was called the first [[Yippie]] pieing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DB1F3CF933A25751C1A9669C8B63|title=Take Sugar, Eggs, Beliefs . . . And Aim|last=Vinciguerra|first=Thomas|date=December 10, 2000|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww4report.com/node/3495 ''Tom Forcade: Unsung Hero of the Counter-culture''] By Bill Weinberg. World War 4 Report.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aron Kay, also a Yippie, went on to take up Forcade's pieing tactics. Kay pied, among many others, [[William F. Buckley]], [[Phyllis Schlafly]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[E. Howard Hunt]], and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=AronKay&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |date=October 3, 1977 |title=Aron Kay: Un-American as Apple Pie |author=Lewis Grossberger |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9gBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=94sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6008,560527&amp;dq=aron-kay-un-american-as-apple-pie&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disciple of Aron Kay, Thom Higgins, pied singer and [[gay rights|anti-gay rights]] activist [[Anita Bryant]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], in 1977 (audio footage of the incident is included in the [[Chumbawamba]] song ''Just Desserts'', a homage to the concept of pieing).&lt;ref&gt; Rutledge, Leigh (1992). ''The Gay Decades''. New York: Penguin Books Ltd. ISBN 0-452-26810-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lichtenstein&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-lichtenstein/murdoch-pie-man-history_b_905279.html Murdoch, the Pie Man, and Baked Goods as Political Theatre]. By Bill Lichtenstein. July 21, 2011. ''[[Huffington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;[http://gershkuntzman.homestead.com/files/pie_master.doc &quot;Pie-Faced: Why throwing a pie at someone who deserves it is one of the most celebrated traditions in our so-called culture&quot;]. By Gersh Kuntzman. ''[[Newsweek]]'', April 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Kay retired in 1992 after pieing [[right-wing]] activist [[Randall Terry]]. Kay appears in cartoon form in a 2003 animated music video, &quot;Death penalty for pot&quot; by Benedict Arnold and The Traitors, where he and [[Dana Beal]] pie [[George W. Bush]] and former U.S. Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] (at 2 minutes and 33 seconds into the video).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Death penalty for pot&quot;. Kay pieing George Bush and John Ashcroft in an &quot;animated music video (2003) by northern California artist/animator Brad Frost, of the song &quot;Death Penalty For Pot&quot;, by the band Benedict Arnold &amp; The Traitors.&quot; [http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=706379698 on MySpace] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTPTWbm6uK0 on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Kay, an article in the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' says: &quot;He considers the Three Stooges, whom he began watching on TV as a kid, as the true fathers of pie-throwing.&quot;&lt;ref name=rachelgordon&gt;[http://aspin.asu.edu/hpn/archives/nov98/0190.html &quot;A Long Career of Pitching Pastries&quot;]. By Rachel Gordon. ''[[San Francisco Examiner]].'' November 12, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the [[Belgian]] [[anarchist]] and [[surrealist]] [[Noël Godin]] has gained a following for pieing figures whom he believes take themselves too seriously, such as filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] during the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. His favorite target was [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]]. Godin stated that the men he most desired to pie were [[Bill Clinton]], [[Tony Blair]], [[John Travolta]], [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Pope John Paul&amp;nbsp;II]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Godin's popularity has inspired many copycats.

A noted victim of pieing was [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] who was pied in [[Belgium]] in 1998. A computer game was later released in which Gates' head pops up around the screen and the object is to &quot;pie&quot; as many of his heads as possible in the allocated time.

The anonymous [[Biotic Baking Brigade]] has pied or attempted to pie, among others, conservative pundits [[Ann Coulter]] and [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and [[Fred Phelps]], the controversial leader of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]]. Coulter has also been attacked by the &quot;terrorist&quot; group Al Pieda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Time Waster |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1022042coulter1.html |title=&quot;Al Pieda&quot; Targets Ann Coulter |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=2004-10-22 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian]] group the [[Entartistes]], founded by [[Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–1993)|Rhinoceros Party of Canada]] founder [[François Gourd]], has also pied many, including then-[[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. In 2003 in the city of [[Calgary]] they pied [[Ralph Klein]], the premier of the Canadian province of [[Alberta]], saying in their press release: &quot;Is it surprising to see Ralph Klein opposing the [[Kyoto Accord]] for the right of big corporations to pollute, the same corporations that finance his campaigns?&quot;&lt;ref name=nowtoronto&gt;[http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2003-07-17/news_story3.php &quot;The Art of Pieing. Nothing cuts through the veneer of the powerful like a banana cream&quot;]. By Tooker Gomberg. ''[[NOW (magazine)|Now]]'' (Toronto). July 17–23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The pie gives power back to the people because so many feel powerless in the face of big politicians and industrialists&quot;, explained Pope-Tart (a pseudonym), a member of the Entartistes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entartistes.ca/Gazette310199.html &quot;Pied Snipers&quot;]. By Andrew Duffy. ''Southam News.'' January 31, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' columnist [[Gersh Kuntzman]] wrote that pieing &quot;deserves to be one of the most celebrated traditions in our so-called culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt;

Sometimes pieing targets suffer the prank with good humor. Godard was very pleased at being pied and said &quot;this is what happens when silent movies meet talking pictures&quot;; he intervened with the Cannes authorities on behalf of [[Noël Godin]] to prevent him from being arrested. Anti-gay campaigner Anita Bryant, upon being pied by a gay activist on television, joked that &quot;at least it's a ''fruit'' pie&quot;, apparently making a pun on the derogatory term for a gay man (&quot;fruit&quot;). However, moments later she was in tears. By contrast, Bernard-Henri Lévy has on multiple occasions attacked Godin and his followers, and Ann Coulter pressed charges in 2005 when she narrowly evaded a pie at the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Time Waster |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1022042coulter2.html |title=&quot;Al Pieda&quot; Targets Ann Coulter |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist David Horowitz said of his pieing, &quot;These attacks are sinister. The person who throws a pie is saying, ‘I hate you. I don't want you to speak.' I never saw it coming. And it took away my dignity. When you're lecturing, you're supposed to have an authority. But a pie turns it into a food fight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt;

On January 25, 2010, Canada's [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Fisheries and Oceans Minister]] [[Gail Shea]] was hit with a pie in her face while touring the [[Canada Centre for Inland Waters]] in [[Burlington, Ontario]], in an act of protest against the [[Seal hunting#Canada|seal hunt in Canada]] by animal rights group [[PETA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/755483--anti-sealing-peta-protester-smacks-minister-with-tofu-pie &quot;Anti-sealing PETA protester smacks Minister with tofu pie&quot;]. By John Burman and Mike McNeil. ''[[Toronto Star]].'' January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; PETA said in a release that it was part of its campaign “to stop the government’s ill-advised sanction of the slaughter of seals.”&lt;ref name=&quot;can-pie&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/755958--pie-tossing-is-terrorism-mp-says|title=Pie tossing is terrorism, MP says|date=2010-01-26|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=26 December 2010|location=Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convicted ===
==== Canada ====
Former Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]] was hit in the face with a pie by a protester in [[Prince Edward Island]] in 2000. His attacker initially was given jail time but eventually received a conditional sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;can-pie&quot;/&gt;

A woman who missed Alberta Premier [[Ed Stelmach]] with a pie at the annual Calgary Stampede breakfast in 2007, and hit a security official instead, was sentenced to 30 days in jail. So was a woman who threw a pie at [[Calgary]] Mayor [[Dave Bronconnier]] in the summer of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;can-pie&quot;/&gt;

In 2003, a protester who hit then-Alberta premier [[Ralph Klein]] in the face with a pie at the [[Calgary Stampede|Stampede breakfast]] was convicted of assault and ordered to serve a 30-day intermittent jail sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;can-pie&quot;/&gt;

==== U.K ====

Jonathan May-Bowles pied Rupert Murdoch in July 2011 during a highly publicized testimony before a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliamentary]] committee in connection with the [[News International phone hacking scandal]]. May-Bowles was sentenced to serve a six-week prison sentence at [[Wandsworth Prison]] in [[London]]; this sentence has subsequently been reduced to four weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnaug&quot;&gt;[http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/16/murdoch-pie-thrower-reportedly-blogging-from-prison/?hpt=hp_t1 CC Murdoch pie thrower reportedly blogging from prison, CNN, August 16th, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
In August 2010, a [[Michigan State University]] student named Ahlam Mohsen, 23, threw a [[Dutch apple pie]] into [[Michigan]] Senator [[Carl Levin]]'s face and was arrested on assault and battery charges. The police also charged a man who allegedly distracted the senator before the pie was thrown. Mohsem said she threw the pie to protest the Senator's support for war crimes by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemondrop.com/2010/08/18/ahlam-mohsem-pie-senator/|title=Woman, 23, Arrested for Pie-ing U.S. Senator|last=Tan|first=Emily|date=Aug 18th 2010|publisher=Lemondrop.com|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sweden ====

In September 2001, the Swedish king [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] was visiting [[Varberg]] when he suddenly got pied by a 16-year-old boy. Such an attack could possibly have counted as [[high treason]] under Swedish law, which would have warranted a long prison sentence. However, the perpetrator was merely convicted for [[assault]], as it could not be proven that his motive was of political character. He was therefore sentenced to no more than hefty [[day-fine|day-fines]]. Two other boys, who had helped to prepare the attack by making the cake, were also fined. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10246204.ab&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity==
[[File:Newfee-pie-Toss.jpg|left|thumb|237px|There is an annual pie toss at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] on [[Pi Day]] in support of the [[Janeway Children's Health and Rehabilitation Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jackey Locke|title=Pi-Day in support of the Janeway Foundation a huge success|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|date=April 9, 2009|accessdate=2009-05-09|url=http://today.mun.ca/news.php?news_id=4545}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At charity [[fund raiser]]s, a pie-toss event usually involves some well-known figure, generally a person either in a position of authority or fame, who is intended as the &quot;victim&quot;. People attending the event pay for or bid on the opportunity to smoosh the volunteer victim in the face with a custard pie; throwing is generally not allowed anymore as the impact can cause injury, and the smoosh is usually in slow-motion and applied without great pressure. Although this takes the element of chance out of the event, it allows the opportunity to smear pie more thoroughly in the victim's face and potentially through their hair.
This is a popular fund-raising event with schools and social or charitable organizations. Students can pie teachers, professors, or other administrators to ease the tension while still raising money and/or awareness about a cause.

The '''pie''' in question can include a variety of messy substances, usually [[whipped cream]], [[custard]], non-dairy dessert topping or simply shaving foam, placed in a pie tin or sometimes simply piled onto a paper plate.

One additional option is allowing the person who has purchased or won the opportunity to use the pie to also fill it, usually with a variety of extremely messy dessert toppings: chocolate, cherries, caramel sauce, strawberry sauce, etc. Plastic bags for the victim to protect their clothing and hair are optional. Witnesses standing too close to the victim(s) may be splattered.

==Sports==
In [[Major League Baseball]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] pitcher [[A. J. Burnett]] (formerly of the [[New York Yankees]]) pies teammates who drive in or score the winning run in a walk-off win (a game won on a hit by the last batter).&lt;ref name=&quot;victorino&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/nyregion/28pie.html|title=A Pie in the Face Is a New Yankee Tradition|last=Barron|first=James|date=28 October 2009|work=The New York Times|page=25|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;victorino2&quot;&gt;[http://www.philliesnation.com/archives/2008/02/video-victorino-pies-myers-on-today-show/ - Video:  Victorino Pies Myers On 'Today Show' - Phillies Nation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnett's &quot;pies&quot; are filled with either [[shaving cream]] or [[whipped cream]]. Burnett has pied [[Alex Rodriguez]], [[Johnny Damon]], [[Melky Cabrera]], [[Jorge Posada]], [[Hideki Matsui]], [[Nick Swisher]], (twice) [[Robinson Canó]] (twice), [[Francisco Cervelli]],&lt;ref name=&quot;burnett&quot;&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/sports/2009/09/as-of-this-moment---.html Pie Is Again Served at Yankee Stadium - New York Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Miranda]], [[Mark Teixeira]], [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], [[Marcus Thames]], and most recently [[Brett Gardner]].  Burnett usually pies the player while he is being interviewed on the field by a TV reporter.

The pieing tradition in baseball has extended beyond game-winning hits to any outstanding performance.
