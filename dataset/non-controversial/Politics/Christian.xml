A '''Christian''' ({{Audio|En-us-Christian.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a person who adheres to [[Christianity]], an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]], [[Monotheism#Christianity|monotheistic]] [[religion]] based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] as recorded in the [[Canonical gospels]] and the letters of the [[New Testament]]. &quot;Christian&quot; derives from the [[Koine Greek]] word [[Christ]], a translation of the [[Biblical Hebrew]] term [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bickerman-1949|Bickerman (1949)]] p. 145, ''The Christians got their appellation from &quot;Christus,&quot; that is, &quot;the Anointed,&quot; the Messiah.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the Christian faith is the ''[[Good News (Christianity)|gospel]]'', the teaching that humans have hope for [[salvation]] through the message and work of Jesus, and particularly, his [[atonement in Christianity|atoning]] [[crucifixion of Jesus|death on the cross]] {{bibleref2|1Co|15:3}} and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] {{bibleref2|1Co|15:4}}. Christians also believe Jesus is the [[Messiah]] prophesied in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ataglance/glance.shtml Christianity at a glance], [[BBC]]. Retrieved 19 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Christians believe in the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] (&quot;tri-unity&quot;), a description of [[God]] as [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]. This includes the vast majority of churches in Christianity, although a minority are [[Nontrinitarianism|Non-trinitarians]].

The term &quot;Christian&quot; is also used adjectivally to describe anything associated with Christianity, or in a proverbial sense &quot;all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CCEL&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the Christian Church |last=Schaff |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Schaff |chapter=V. St. Paul and the Conversion of the Gentiles (Note 496) |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc1.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a label to identify people who associate with the [[cultural Christian|cultural aspects of Christianity]], irrespective of personal religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | publisher = BBC News| date = 10 December 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7136682.stm | title = Dawkins: I'm a cultural Christian | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

==Etymology==
The Greek word {{lang|grc|Χριστιανός}} (''Christianos'')—meaning &quot;follower of Christ&quot;—comes from {{lang|grc|Χριστός}} (''Christos'')—meaning &quot;[[anointing|anointed]] one&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ Christ] at Etymology Online&lt;/ref&gt;—with an adjectival ending borrowed from Latin to denote adhering to, or even belonging to, as in slave ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bickerman-1949|Bickerman, 1949]] p. 147, ''All these Greek terms, formed with the Latin suffix ''-ianus'', exactly as the Latin words of the same derivation, express the idea that the men or things referred to, belong to the person to whose name the suffix is added.''&lt;br&gt;p. 145, ''In Latin this suffix produced proper names of the type ''Marcianus'' and, on the other hand, derivatives from the name of a person, which referred to his belongings, like ''fundus Narcissianus'', or, by extension, to his adherents, ''Ciceroniani.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]], ''christos'' was used to translate the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מָשִׁיחַ (''{{unicode|Mašíaḥ}},'' [[messiah]]), meaning &quot;[one who is] anointed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=messiah Messiah] at Etymology Online&lt;/ref&gt; In other European languages, equivalent words to 'Christian' are likewise derived from the Greek, such as 'Chrétien' in French and 'Cristiano' in Spanish.

==Early usage==
The first recorded use of the term (or its [[cognate]]s in other languages) is in the [[New Testament]], in {{bibleref2|Acts|11:26}}, which states &quot;...in [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] were first called Christians.&quot; The second mention of the term follows in {{bibleref2|Acts|26:28}}, where [[Herod Agrippa II]] replies to [[Paul the Apostle]], &quot;Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?&quot; The third and final New Testament reference to the term is in {{bibleref2|1pe|4:16|NIV|1 Peter 4:16}}, which exhorts believers, &quot;...if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.&quot;

Another term for Christians which appears in the New Testament is &quot;[[Nazarene (title)|Nazarenes]]&quot; which is used by the Jewish lawyer [[Tertullus]] in Acts 24. [[Tertullian]] (''Against Marcion'' 4:8) records that &quot;the Jews call us Nazarenes,&quot; while around 331 AD [[Eusebius]] records that Christ was called a Nazoraean from the name [[Nazareth]], and that in earlier centuries &quot;Christians,&quot; were once called &quot;Nazarenes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies: Volume 65, Issue 1  University of London. School of Oriental and African Studies - 2002 &quot;... around 331, Eusebius says of the place name [[Nazareth]] that 'from this name the Christ was called a Nazoraean, and in ancient times we, who are now called Christians, were once called [[Nazarene (title)|Nazarenes]]';6 thus he attributes this designation ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew equivalent of &quot;Nazarenes&quot;, ''Notzrim'', occurs in the Babylonian Talmud, and is still the modern Israeli Hebrew term for Christian.

All three original New Testament verses' usages reflect a derisive element in the term ''Christian'' to refer to followers of Christ who did not acknowledge the emperor of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wuest-1973]] p. 19.  ''The word is used three times in the New Testament, and each time as a term of reproach or derision.  Here in Antioch, the name ''Christianos'' was coined to distinguish the worshippers of the Christ from the ''Kaisarianos'', the worshippers of Caesar.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The town Antioch, which is said to have given them the name ''Christian'', had a reputation for coming up with such nicknames.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wuest-1973]] p. 19.  ''The city of Antioch in Syria had a reputation for coining nicknames.''&lt;/ref&gt; However Peter's apparent endorsement of the term led to its being preferred over &quot;Nazarenes&quot; and the term ''Christianoi'' from [[1 Peter]] becomes the standard term in the [[Early Church Fathers]] from [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] and [[Polycarp]] onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Trevett '' Christian women and the time of the Apostolic Fathers'' 2006 &quot;'Christians' (christianoi) was a term first coined in Syrian Antioch (Acts 11: 26) and which appeared next in Christian sources in Ignatius, Eph 11.2; Rom 3.2; Pol 7.3. Cf. too Did 12.4; MPol 3.1; 10.1; 12.1-2; EpDiog 1.1; 4.6; 5.1;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest occurrences of the term in non-Christian literature include [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus]], referring to &quot;the tribe of Christians, so named from him;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Josephus]] |url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-18.htm |title=Antiquities of the Jews&amp;nbsp;— XVIII, 3:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Younger]] in [[Epistulae (Pliny)|correspondence with Trajan]]; and [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], writing near the end of the 1st century. In the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' he relates that &quot;by vulgar appellation [they were] commonly called Christians&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tacitus|first1=Cornelius|last2=Murphy|first2=Arthur|title=The works of Cornelius Tacitus: with an essay on his life and genius, notes, supplements, &amp;c|page=287|year=1836|publisher=Thomas Wardle|url=http://books.google.com/?id=E0vy1dAhgj0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies Christians as [[Nero]]'s scapegoats for the [[Great Fire of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of the Acts |author=Bruce, Frederick Fyvie |authorlink=F. F. Bruce |year=1988 |publisher=Eerdmans |page=228 |isbn=0-8028-2505-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
[[File:ChristianityPUA.png|left|thumb|The [[Christian cross|cross]] and [[Ichthys]] symbols, two symbols often used by Christians to represent their religion.]]
A wide range of beliefs and practices is found across the world among those who call themselves Christian. There is usually a consensus among many denominations about what defines a Christian, but disagreement does exist among some sects and denominations on a common definition of &quot;Christianity.&quot; Philosopher [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], in his book ''The Case Against Christianity'', evaluated three historical Christian creeds (the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Athanasian Creed]]) to establish a set of basic assumptions which include belief in [[theism]], the [[historicity of Jesus]], the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], [[Christian soteriology|salvation]] through faith in Jesus, and [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus]] as an ethical role model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Case Against Christianity |author=Martin, Michael |authorlink=Michael Martin (philosopher) |year=1993 |publisher=Temple University Press |page=12 |isbn=1-56639-081-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew terms===
As the identification of the Messiah with Jesus is not accepted within Judaism, the [[Talmud]]ic term for Christians in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is ''Notzrim'' (&quot;Nazarenes&quot;), originally derived from the fact that Jesus came from the village of [[Nazareth]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nazarene Nazarene] at Etymology Online&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]] are referred to in modern Hebrew as יהודים משיחיים (''Yehudim Meshihi'im'').

===Arabic terms===
[[File:Famous Christians.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Set of pictures for a number of famous Christians from various fields.]]
&lt;!-- [[Nasrani (disambiguation)]] links here --&gt;
In Arabic-speaking cultures, two words are commonly used for Christians: ''Nasrani'' (نصراني), plural &quot;Nasara&quot; (نصارى) is generally understood to be derived from ''Nazareth''&lt;ref name=&quot;KhaledAhmed&quot; /&gt; through the [[Syriac]] (Aramaic); ''Masihi'' (مسيحي) means followers of the Messiah.&lt;ref name=&quot;KhaledAhmed&quot;&gt;[[Khaled Ahmed]], [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C02%5C19%5Cstory_19-2-2006_pg3_4 Pakistan Daily Times].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SOFIR&quot;&gt;Society for Internet Research, [http://www.sofir.org/sarchives/005539.php The Hamas Charter], note 62 (erroneously, &quot;salidi&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a distinction, ''Nasrani'' refers to people from a Christian culture and ''Masihi'' means those with a religious faith in Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tayler&quot;&gt;[[Jeffrey Tayler]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=98dQ39WOoUUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA41&amp;lpg=RA1-PA41&amp;dq=masihi+nasrani&amp;source=web&amp;ots=LESqWUSy43&amp;sig=ABHlcsuLXyO4iZBR2gMP4dnoux8 Trekking through the Moroccan Sahara].''&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries ''Nasrani'' tends to be used generically for non-Muslim white people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tayler&quot;/&gt; Another Arabic word sometimes used for Christians, particularly in a political context, is ''Salibi'' (صليبي &quot;Crusader&quot;) from ''salib'' (صليب &quot;crucifix&quot;) which refers to [[Crusades|Crusaders]] and has negative connotations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOFIR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Akbar S. Ahmed]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=kXY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=salibi+crusader&amp;source=web&amp;ots=R_6x5wvD-L&amp;sig=iSIt3GH4P7yJg-OrI39idUrO0AA Islam, Globalization, and Postmodernity],'' p 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian terms===
The Syriac term ''Nasrani'' (Nazarene) has also been attached to the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of [[Kerala]], India. In the [[Indian subcontinent]], Christians call themselves &quot;Isaai&quot; ({{lang-hi|ईसाई}}, {{lang-ur|عیسائی}}), and are also known by this term to adherents of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Catholic priest in saffron robe called 'Isai Baba' | url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Catholic-priest-in-saffron-robe-called---Isai-Baba--/402458/ | work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the name they call Jesus, &quot;Isa Masih&quot;.

In the past, the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]s used to call the Portuguese ''Serani'' from the Arabic ''Nasrani''. Today the term ''Serani'' is used for the [[Kristang people|creole Christian community]] of Malaysia today.

The Chinese word is {{linktext|基督|徒}} ([[pinyin]]: jīdū tú), literally &quot;Christ follower.&quot; The two characters now pronounced ''Jīdū'' in Mandarin Chinese, were originally pronounced ''Ki-To'' in [[Cantonese]] as representation of Latin &quot;Cristo.&quot; Likewise in Vietnam the same two characters read ''[[:wikt:Cơ đốc|Cơ đốc]]'', and a &quot;follower of Christianity&quot; is a ''tín đồ Cơ đốc giáo''.  In Japan, the term ''[[kirishitan]]'' (written in Edo period documents 吉利支丹, 切支丹, and in modern Japanese histories as キリシタン), from Portuguese cristão, referred to Roman Catholic Christians in the 16th and 17th centuries before the religion was banned by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Today Christians are referred to in standard Japanese as  ''Kuristo-kyo-to'' キリスト教徒, or the English-derived term ''kurisuchan'' クリスチャン. Korean still uses ''Kidok-kyo-do'' (written in hangul as 기독교도) for &quot;Christian,&quot; though the Greek form ''Kurisudo'' 그리스도 has now replaced the old Sino-Korean ''Kidok'' for Christ himself.

==Demographics==
{{main|Christianity by country}}
As of the early 21st century, [[Christianity]] has around 2.1 billion adherents.&lt;ref name=&quot;World&quot;&gt;33.2% of 6.7 billion world population (under &quot;People&quot;) {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=World|publisher=CIA world facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ForeignPolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3835|title=The List: The World's Fastest-Growing Religions|publisher=foreignpolicy.com|date= 2007-03 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Major Religions Ranked by Size&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faith represents about a quarter to a third of the world's population and is the largest religion in the world, with approximately [[List of Christian denominations|38,000 Christian denominations]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells, ''The Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion'', p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians have composed about 33 percent of the world's population for around 100 years. The largest Christian denomination is the [[Roman Catholic Church]], with 1.17 billion adherents, representing half of all Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/universal_church_sees_increase_in_seminarians_reports_pontifical_yearbook/ Pontifical Yearbook 2010], Catholic News Agency.
