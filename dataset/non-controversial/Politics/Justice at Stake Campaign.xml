      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">The '''Justice at Stake Campaign''' ('''JAS''') is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[non-partisan]] group whose stated objective is ensuring that [[Courts of the United States|courts in the United States]] are fair, impartial, and [[Judicial independence|independent]], and that [[judge]]s rely only on the facts and the law.

Founded in 2000, the group is a noted opponent of judicial elections, and its reports have called attention to rising [[Campaign finance|expenditures]] and [[advocate group|interest group]] contributions to candidates for [[state supreme court]]s, in [[U.S. state|state]]s in which justices are chosen in elections. The group has commissioned polls showing that many Americans believe these expenditures could affect the ability of judges to rule neutrally in cases involving campaign contributors.

Justice at Stake has developed a national network of 50 partners and has received grants from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], the Herbert Block Foundation, the [[JEHT Foundation]], the [[Joyce Foundation]], the Moriah Fund, the [[Open Society Institute]], and the Public Welfare Foundation. 

Justice at Stake is a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] organization governed by a [[board of directors]]. The chair of the board is Roger Warren, former president of the [[National Center for State Courts]]. JAS does not support or oppose individual judges seeking election or [[nomination]] to the bench.

Justice at Stake’s work falls into several categories:

''Educating Americans About Their Courts and Judges'': &lt;br /&gt;
•	Giving informational presentations on judicial independence and discussing actions groups can take to protect it&lt;br /&gt;
•	Publicizing state voter guides&lt;br /&gt;
•	Publishing reports on a variety of topics relating to fair and impartial courts

''Reducing Special Interest Pressure and Improving Judicial Campaigns'': &lt;br /&gt;
•	Monitoring special interest pressure on the courts&lt;br /&gt;
•	Encouraging states to consider [[public financing]] of judicial elections and merit-based selection of judges&lt;br /&gt; 
•	Compiling national databases of state disclosures of campaign and interest group contributions

''Protecting Courts and Judges from [[political parties|Partisan]] Attacks'':&lt;br /&gt;
•	Rapid response to [[intimidation]] and [[impeachment]] threats&lt;br /&gt;
•	Educating political leaders and the public on the unique role of the courts&lt;br /&gt;
•	Protecting court [[budgets]] from political attacks

''Defending the Courts That Defend Our Rights'':&lt;br /&gt;
•	Calling attention to attacks on the power of the courts to uphold the Constitution&lt;br /&gt;
•	Building a network of judges who can speak up on behalf of the courts&lt;br /&gt;
•	Developing new messages and [[coalitions]] to defend the courts
