[[Image:Indymedia Edinburgh DSC04943.JPG|300px|thumb|Temporary IMC in [[Edinburgh]] covering protests at the [[31st G8 summit|2005 G8 summit]]]]
The '''Independent Media Center''' (also known as '''Indymedia''' or '''IMC''') is a global [[Open publishing|participatory]] network of journalists that report on political and social issues. It originated during the Seattle [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|anti-WTO protests worldwide in 1999]] and remains closely associated with the [[global justice movement]], which criticizes [[neo-liberalism]] and its associated institutions. Indymedia uses an [[open publishing]] and [[democratic media]] process that allows anybody to contribute.

According to its homepage, &quot;Indymedia is a collective of independent media organizations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage. Indymedia is a democratic media outlet for the creation of radical, accurate, and passionate tellings of truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml Indymedia global home page]&lt;/ref&gt; Indymedia was founded as an alternative to government and [[corporate media]], and seeks to facilitate people being able to publish their media as directly as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanni&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Tanni|date=July 1, 2007|title=Do citizen-based media of communication advance public journalism's ideals?

==Overview==
The first Indymedia project was started in late November 1999 to report on protests against the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO meeting]] that took place in [[Seattle]], Washington, and to act as an alternative media source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattle.indymedia.org/en/1999/11/2.shtml First ever Indymedia post, made November 24, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} This followed a successful experiment in June that year, reporting the events of the [[Carnival Against Capitalism]] in London, UK. The Media team there used software and unmediated reports from protest participants.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, &quot;June 18th 1999 Carnival Against Capital&quot;, in Days of Dissent!, 2004, accessed online at http://web.archive.org/web/20050508150407/daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The open publishing script was first developed by video activists in Sydney, Australia. 
&quot;Even more importantly, a group of hackers in Sydney, Australia, had written a special piece of software for live updating of the webpage devoted to their local J18 event. Six months later, this “Active Software” would be used in the American city of Seattle, as the foundation of the Indymedia project – a multiperspectival instrument of political information and dialogue for the twenty-first century&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brianholmes.wordpress.com/2007/04/27/do-it-yourself-geopolitics Brian Holmes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2006/05/25/18253281.php Rabble]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mako.cc/writing/mute-indymedia_software.htm Benjamin Mako Hill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realtimearts.net/article.php?id=9752 Zanny Begg]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Seattle the idea and network spread rapidly. By 2002, there were 89 Indymedia websites covering 31 countries (and the [[Palestinian territories]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indymedia.org/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020901125639/http://indymedia.org/ |archivedate=September 1, 2002 |title= Wayback Machine – indymedia.org circa September 1, 2002 |accessdate=April 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; growing to over 150 by January 2006, not all of them currently active. Indymedia websites publish in a number of languages, including English, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, French, Russian, Arabic and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.indymedia.org/Global/FrequentlyAskedQuestionEn#languages |date=July 25, 2007|title=Indymedia's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  |publisher=Indymedia Documentation Project |accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMC collectives distribute [[Printing|print]], [[sound reproduction|audio]], [[photo]], and video media, but are most well known for their [[open publishing]] newswires, sites where anyone with internet access can publish news from their own perspective. The content of an IMC is determined by its participants, both the users who post content, and members of the local Indymedia collective who administer the site. While Indymedias worldwide are run autonomously and differ according to the concerns of their users, they share a commitment to provide [[copyleft]] content. The general rule is that content on Indymedia sites can be freely reproduced for non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/PrinciplesOfUnity IMC &quot;Principles of Unity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and focus==
[[Image:Belgian Indymedia media centre.jpg|300px|thumb| Belgian Indymedia's headquarters in Brussels]]
The origins of IMCs themselves came out of protests against the concentrated ownership and perceived biases in [[corporate media]] reporting. The first IMC node, attached as it was to the Seattle anti-corporate globalization protests, was seen by [[activists]] as an alternative news source to that of the corporate media, which they accused of only showing violence and confrontation, and portraying all protesters negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991223&amp;slug=A19991224010135&quot;Independent+Media+Center&quot; | work=The Seattle Times | title=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991218&amp;slug=3002212&quot;Independent+Media+Center&quot; | work=The Seattle Times | title=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/22220_gag09.shtml?searchpagefrom=1&amp;searchdiff=1732 | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Paul | last1=Shukovsky | title=Media center fighting FBI over Web data | date=August 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/19980_security24.shtml | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Paul | last1=Shukovsky | title=FBI raids media center | date=April 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/wto091.shtml | title=An overflow crowd vents its anger at city, police | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratical.org///////////////co-globalize/NLG-REPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, between 1999 and 2001, IMC newswires tended to be focused on up-to-the-minute coverage of protests, from local [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s to [[Summit (meeting)|summit]]s where [[anti-globalization movement]] protests were occurring, with protest coverage continuing into 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

IMC also run a global radio project which aggregates audio RSS feeds from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.indymedia.org/|title= Radio Indymedia|publisher=radio.indymedia.org|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
[[Image:Indymedia Cuiabá.jpg|300px|thumb|Indymedia collective at [[Mato Grosso Federal University]] in [[Cuiabá]], Brazil hosting a free radio broadcast in 2004.]]
IMC is formed of local collectives which are expected to be open and inclusive of individuals from a variety of different local [[anti-capitalist]] [[point of view (literature)|points of view]], whether or not these have any definite political philosophy, so that even those without internet access can participate in both content creation and in content consumption. Editorial policies, locally chosen by any Indymedia collective, generally involve removing articles which the Indymedia editors believe promote racism, [[sexism]], [[hate speech]], and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name=principles&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; All Indymedia collectives are expected to have a locally chosen, thoroughly discussed and clearly stated editorial policy for posts to their website.&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

==Criticism==
===Allegations of anti-Semitism===
Indymedia has often faced criticism for [[anti-Semitism]]. In a 2002 op-ed, [[alter-globalisation]] activist and critic of Israel [[Naomi Klein]] criticised Indymedia for perpetuating [[Jewish conspiracy|conspiracy theories]] about the Jews, including [[9/11 conspiracy theories|supposed involvement with the September 11 attacks]] and re-posting from the infamous hoax ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;klein&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naomiklein.org/articles/2002/04/sharon-le-pen-and-anti-semitism|title='Sharon, Le Pen, and Anti-Semitism'|author=Naomi Klein|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Swiss edition of Indymedia was sued for anti-Semitism by [[Aktion Kinder des Holocaust]] for publishing a [[Carlos Latuff]] cartoon of a Jewish boy in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] saying &quot;I am Palestinian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Schärer: [http://www.akdh.ch/ps/woz040402.htm Linke und Antisemitismus: Der Indymedia-Streit – Aufpassen, was im Kübel landet], ''Die Wochenzeitung'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Junge Welt]]: [http://www.akdh.ch/indymedia4.htm Ärger im Internet: Wegen antisemitischer Beiträge hat Indymedia Schweiz den Betrieb gestoppt], February 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aktion Kinder des Holocaust: [http://www.akdh.ch/latuff2.htm Is this cartoon by Latuff, published at indymedia-switzerland, anti-Semitic? An analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early May 2003, after receiving numerous complaints about newswire stories that referred to the [[Israel Defence Forces]] as &quot;Zionazi forces&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/11403/index.php example of Newswire posting using the term &quot;Zionazi forces&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or to Israelis as &quot;[[Zionazis]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2003/02/52318.html example of Newsire posting using the term &quot;Zionazi&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Google temporarily stopped including some IMCs in [[Google News]] searches, justifying the removal by describing the term as a &quot;degrading, hateful slur&quot; and refused to index the [[San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center|Bay Area IMC]] because it had appeared there; SF Bay Area Indymedia agreed that it &quot;could be considered [[hate speech]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2003/09/03/16398621.php Google News Bans SF Bay Area Indymedia Over Israel/Palestine Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Servers seizures==
Indymedia has had interactions with authorities in USA and UK.

===Seizure of servers by the FBI===
On October 7, 2004, the [[FBI]] took possession of several [[Server (computing)|server]] hard drives used by a number of IMCs and hosted by US-based [[Rackspace]] Managed Hosting. The servers in question were located in the United Kingdom and managed by the British arm of Rackspace, but some 20 mainly European IMC websites were affected, and several unrelated websites were affected, including the website of a [[Linux]] distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/08/1097089554894.html?oneclick=true FBI seizes Indymedia servers], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]], 2004-10-08&lt;/ref&gt; No reasons were given at first by the FBI and Rackspace for the seizure, in particular IMC was not informed. Rackspace claimed that it was banned from giving further information about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml Indymedia report]&lt;/ref&gt; Some, but not all, of the legal documents relating to the confiscation of the servers were unsealed by a Texas district court in August 2005, following legal action by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The documents revealed that the only action requested by the government was to surrender server log files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eff.org/press/releases/2005/08 EFF Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lettice, [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/03/indymedia_texas_docs_unsealed/ ''US court files reveal Italian link to Indymedia server grab''], The Register, August 3, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement by Rackspace&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml ''FBI Seizes IMC Servers in the UK''], Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the company had been forced to comply with a court order under the procedures laid out by the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]], which governs international police co-operation on &quot;international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering&quot;. The investigation that led to the court order was said to have arisen outside of the U.S. Rackspace stated that they were prohibited on giving further detail. [[Agence France-Presse]] reported FBI spokesman Joe Parris,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200410/ai_n6865024 News website Indymedia says FBI seized server]&lt;/ref&gt; who said the incident was not an FBI operation, but that the subpoena had been issued at the request of the Italian and the Swiss governments. Again, no further details on specific allegations were given. UK involvement was denied in an answer given to a parliamentary question posed by Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardallan.org.uk/?m=200410 MP Richard Allan's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indymedia pointed out that they were not contacted by the FBI and that no specific information was released on the reasons of seizing the servers. Indymedia also sees the incident in the context of &quot;numerous attacks on independent media by the US Federal Government&quot;, including a subpoena to obtain IP logs from Indymedia at the occasion of the Republican National Conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11476prs20040830.html American Civil Liberties Union : Statement of Brian Szymanski Regarding Secret Service Investigation of Indymedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the shut-down of several community radio stations in the US by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and a request by the FBI to remove a post on Nantes IMC containing a photograph of alleged undercover Swiss police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indymedia.org/en/static/fbi Indymedia's page on the FBI seizure]&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was condemned by the [[International Federation of Journalists]], who stated that &quot;The way this has been done smacks more of intimidation of legitimate journalistic inquiry than crime-busting&quot; and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/more-intimidation-than-crime-busting-says-ifj-as-police-target-independent-media-network ''&quot;More Intimidation Than Crime-Busting&quot; Says IFJ As Police Target Independent Media Network''], IFJ press release, October 8, 2004, Retrieved August 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism was also voiced by European civil liberties organisation [[Statewatch]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2004/oct/04uk-usa-indymedia.htm ''Was the seizure of Indymedia's servers in London unlawful or did the UK government collude? ''], Statewatch Press release, October 2004, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters]] (AMARC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/united_kingdom/2004/10/08/fbi_seizes_indymedia_servers_in/ ''FBI seizes Indymedia servers in the United Kingdom''], bulletin, October 8, 2004, Retrieved August 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Mathew Honan commented in ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' that &quot;This kind of thing doesn’t happen to [[Wolf Blitzer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhoNabbed&quot;/&gt; EFF attorney Kurt Opsahl compared the case with ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhoNabbed&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2004/11/09/indymedia/ Who nabbed Indymedia’s computers? The freewheeling network of Web sites has a history of clashing with authority. But usually it knows who is trying to shut it up.] By Mathew Honan, Nov 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the federal prosecutor of Bologna Marina Plazzi confirmed that an investigation against Indymedia had been opened because of suspected &quot;support of terrorism&quot;, in the context of Italian troops in the Iraqi city of [[Nasiriyah]]. The investigation was triggered after 17 members of the coalition government belonging to the right-wing [[Alleanza Nazionale]], including [[Alessandra Mussolini]], demanded that Indymedia be shut down. A senior party member and government official had announced the co-operation with US authorities, and party spokesman Mario Landolfi welcomed the FBI's seizure of the Indymedia servers. Left-wing Italian politicians denounced the move and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Damiano Valgolio, ''The Censorers Trace leads to Rome and Zurich'', Junge Welt, October 11, 2004, cited at [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/112083.shtml ''Indymedia to U.S., U.K., Swiss and Italian Authorities: &quot;Hands Off Our Websites&quot;''], Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bristol server seizure===
[[Image:Bristol indymedia.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Graffito (drawing technique)|Graffito]] in Bristol, United Kingdom advertising the local chapter of Indymedia with the slogan &quot;Read it, write it, your site, your news&quot;]]
Not long after the Rackspace affair another server in the UK was seized by police in June 2005. An [[anonymous post]] on the [[Bristol Indymedia]] server, came to police attention for suggesting an &quot;action&quot; against a freight train carrying new cars as part of a protest against cars and climate change in the run up to that year's Gleneagles G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;John Leyden, ''[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/indymedia_server_seizure_bristol/ Legal row after police seize Bristol Indymedia server]'', The Register, June 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The police claimed that the poster broke the law by &quot;incitement to criminal damage&quot;, and sought access logs from the server operators. Despite being warned by lawyers that the servers were &quot;journalistic equipment&quot; and subject to special laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/06/314798.html ''PRESS RELEASE : Bristol Indymedia Server Threatened''], Bristol IMC press release, June 24, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the police proceeded with the seizure and a member of the Bristol Indymedia group was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/4629399.stm ''Indymedia server seized in raid''], BBC News, June 28, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Indymedia was supported in this matter by the [[National Union of Journalists]], [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the original server being returned, Bristol Indymedia was donated a replacement server by local IT co-operative, Bristol Wireless.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bristolwireless.net/2005/07/indymedia-returns/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other legal actions in the United States===
On January 30, 2009, one of the system administrators of the server that hosts indymedia.us received a grand jury subpoena from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana|Southern District of Indiana]] federal court. The subpoena asked the administrator to provide all &quot;[[IP address]]es, times, and any other identifying information&quot; for every visitor to the site on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation [http://www.eff.org/wp/anatomy-bogus-subpoena-indymedia &quot;Anatomy of a Bogus Subpoena&quot;], Retrieved on 2009-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena also included a gag order that stated that the recipient is &quot;not to disclose the existence of this request unless authorized by the Assistant U.S. Attorney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot; /&gt; The administrator of indymedia.us could not have provided the information because Indymedia sites generally do not keep IP address logs. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] determined that there was no legal basis for the gag order, and that the subpoena request &quot;violated the [[Stored Communications Act|SCA's]] restrictions on what types of data the government could obtain using a subpoena.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot; /&gt; Under [[Reporters' privilege#Department of Justice guidelines|Justice Department guidelines]], subpoenas to news media must have the authorization of the attorney general. According to a CBS News blog, the subpoena of indymedia.us was never submitted for review by the Attorney General.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;Declan McCullagh [http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/09/taking_liberties/entry5595506.shtml &quot;Justice Dept.
