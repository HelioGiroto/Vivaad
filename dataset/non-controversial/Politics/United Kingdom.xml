==Etymology and terminology==
{{anchor|Etymology}}&lt;!--linked--&gt;{{See also|Britain (placename)|Terminology of Great Britain|Terminology of the British Isles}}

The name &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; was introduced in 1927 by the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]]. It reflected the reality that the ''de facto'' independence of the [[Irish Free State]], created by the partitioning of Ireland in 1922, left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland still within the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Irish Civil War 1922–23 | author=Cottrell, P. | year=2008 | page=85 | isbn=1-84603-270-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the [[Acts of Union 1800]], that united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1801, had given the new state the name of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Great Britain before 1801 is occasionally referred to as the &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/ |title=Acts of Union 1707 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf |title=Making the Act of Union 1707 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/7327029.stm |title=England&amp;nbsp;– Profile |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 July 2011 |date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org.uk/resources/he_resource_730_9.html |title=The Creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 |publisher= [[Historical Association]] |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Section 1 of both of the 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] declare that England and Scotland are &quot;United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/union.html |title= Treaty of Union, 1706 |publisher=Scots History Online |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/?id=LYc1tSYonrQC&amp;pg=PA165 |title= Constitutional &amp; Administrative Law |page=165 |author= Barnett, Hilaire |author2=Jago, Robert |edition=8th |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-415-56301-7 |publisher=Routledge |location =Abingdon |accessdate =5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Compare to section 1 of both of the 1800 [[Acts of Union (1800)|Acts of Union]] which reads: the ''Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall...be united into one Kingdom, by the Name of &quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''united kingdom'' is found in informal use during the 18th century to describe the new state but only became official with the union with Ireland in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab07 |title=History of Great Britain (from 1707) |authorlink=Bamber Gascoigne |author=Gascoigne, Bamber |publisher=History World |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the United Kingdom, as a sovereign state, is a country, England, Scotland, [[Wales]] and (more controversially) [[Northern Ireland]] are also referred to as countries, although they are not sovereign states and only Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved self-government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/?id=gPkDAQAAIAAJ Population Trends, Issues 75–82, p.38], 1994, UK Office of Population Censuses and Surveys&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= citizenship&gt;[http://books.google.com/?id=2u8rD6F-yg0C&amp;pg=PA7 Life in the United Kingdom: a journey to citizenship, p7], United Kingdom Home Office, 2007, ISBN 978-0-11-341313-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Prime Minister's website has used the phrase &quot;countries within a country&quot; to describe the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;page823&quot;/&gt; With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used &quot;can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 =Whyte |first1 =John |authorlink1=John Henry Whyte|last2= FitzGerald |first2 =Garret| authorlink2=Garret FitzGerald|year=1991 |title= Interpreting Northern Ireland |location= Oxford |publisher= Clarendon Press |isbn= 978-0-19-827380-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms used for Northern Ireland include &quot;region&quot; and &quot;province&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alphabeticalNI&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Dunn, Seamus; Dawson, Helen. |title= An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict |year= 2000 |publisher= Edwin Mellen Press |place= Lampeter |isbn=978-0-7734-7711-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;placeApart&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Murphy, Dervla |title= A Place Apart |year= 1979 |publisher= Penguin |place= London |isbn=978-0-14-005030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom is often referred to as ''Britain''. British government sources frequently use the term as a short form for the United Kingdom, whilst media style guides generally allow its use but point out that the longer term ''[[Great Britain]]'' refers only to the main island which includes England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,,184840,00.html | title=Guardian Unlimited Style Guide |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | year=2007 | accessdate=23 August 2011 | location=London | date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/radio_newsroom/1099593.stm#g| title=BBC style guide (Great Britain)| accessdate=23 August 2011 |work=BBC News| date=19 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_10012517 |title=Key facts about the United Kingdom |accessdate=24 August 2011 |work=Government, citizens and rights |publisher=HM Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some foreign usage, particularly in the United States, uses ''Great Britain'' as a loose synonym for the ''United Kingdom''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/great%20britain Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online Definition of ''Great Britain'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]: &quot;Great Britain: England, Wales, and Scotland considered as a unit.

The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, and the [[South Wales Valleys]] to their north.

[[Geography of Ireland|Northern Ireland]] accounts for just {{convert|14160|km2|sqmi|-1}} and is mostly hilly.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round.&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt; The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below {{convert|-11|C|lk=on}} or rising above {{convert|35|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ |title=UK climate summaries |publisher=Met Office |accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt; although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind—as the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]], bring mild winters; especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south-east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snow News|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2070541/UK-weather-Snow-gales-blizzards-arctic-conditions-leave-Britain-shivering.html|work=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2070541/UK-weather-Snow-gales-blizzards-arctic-conditions-leave-Britain-shivering.html|accessdate=8 December 2011|location=London|first=Luke|last=Salkeld|date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative geography of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Map of the administrative geography of the United Kingdom.png|thumb|Administrative units of the United Kingdom]]
Each country of the United Kingdom has its own system of administrative and geographic demarcation, which often has origins that pre-date the formation of the United Kingdom itself. Consequently there is &quot;no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/9th-uncsgn-docs/report%20of%209th%20uncsgn%20n0750902%20en.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lhCIacyi |archivedate=1 December 2009 |title=Ninth UN Conference on the standardization of Geographical Names |month=August |year=2007 |author=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] |publisher=UN Statistics Division |accessdate =21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.&lt;ref name=barlow&gt;{{cite book |last= Barlow |first =I.M. |title= Metropolitan Government |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location =London |isbn =978-0-415-02099-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change did not occur in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform either.

The organisation of [[local government in England]] is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements. Legislation concerning local government in England is decided by the UK parliament and the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], as England does not have a devolved parliament. The upper-tier [[subdivisions of England]] are the nine [[Regions of England|Government office regions]] or European Union government office regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gos.gov.uk/national/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hYQkeu1p |archivedate=15 June 2009 |publisher=Government Offices |accessdate=3 July 2008 |title= Welcome to the national site of the Government Office Network}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One region, [[Greater London Authority|Greater London]], has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a [[Greater London Authority referendum, 1998|referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/history.jsp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080421023053/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/history.jsp |archivedate=21 April 2008 |title=A short history of London government |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected [[Regional assembly (England)|regional assemblies]], but a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region was rejected by a [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|referendum in 2004]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece |title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly |accessdate =15 February 2008 |work=The Times |location=London |first1=Jill |last1=Sherman |first2=Andrew |last2=Norfolk |date=5 November 2004 |quote= The Government is now expected to tear up its twelve-year-old plan to create eight or nine regional assemblies in England to mirror devolution in Scotland and Wales.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below the region level England has either [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county councils]] and district councils or [[unitary authorities]] and London which consists of 32 [[London borough]]s. Councillors are elected by the [[Plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] system in single-member wards or by the [[Plurality-at-large voting|multi-member plurality system]] in multi-member wards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/aio/39780|title=Local Authority Elections|publisher=Local Government Association|accessdate=3 October 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local government in Scotland]] is divided on a basis of [[subdivisions of Scotland|32 council areas]], with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of [[Glasgow]], Edinburgh, [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] are separate council areas as is the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Highland Council]] which includes a third of Scotland's area but just over 200,000&amp;nbsp;people. The power invested in local authorities is administered by elected councillors, of which there are currently 1,222&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/2007/pps/Bennie.pdf |title=STV in Scotland: Local Government Elections 2007 |publisher=Political Studies Association |accessdate =2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are each paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by [[single transferable vote]] in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a [[Provost (civil)|Provost]], or [[Chairman|Convenor]], to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area. [[Councillor]]s are subject to a [[Ethical code|code of conduct]] enforced by the [[Standards Commission for Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Standards in Public Life framework: {{cite web|title=Ethical Standards in Public Life |url= http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representative association of Scotland's local authorities is the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] (COSLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cosla.gov.uk/about/decision-making-cosla |title=Who we are |publisher=Convention of Scottish Local Authorities |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local government in Wales]] consists of 22 unitary authorities. These include the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Swansea]] and [[Newport]] which are unitary authorities in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/localgovernment/localauthorities/?lang=en|title=Local Authorities |publisher=The Welsh Assembly Government|accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/how_do_i_vote/voting_systems/local_government_elections_i3.aspx |title=Local government elections in Wales |publisher=[[The Electoral Commission]] |year=2008 |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent elections were held in May 2008.

As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and &quot;constitutional law&quot; the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] can perform &quot;constitutional reform&quot; simply by passing [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution.

===Government===
{{main|Government of the United Kingdom}}
The UK has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] based on the [[Westminster system]] that has been emulated around the world—a legacy of the British Empire. The parliament of the United Kingdom that meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]] has two houses; an elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an appointed [[House of Lords]]. Any bill passed requires [[Royal Assent]] to become law.

The position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the UK's [[head of government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Government, Prime Minister and Cabinet|work=Public services all in one place|publisher=[[Directgov]]|url = http://direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073444|accessdate =12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to the member of parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons, usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber. The prime minister and cabinet are formally appointed by the monarch to form [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]], though the prime minister chooses the cabinet and, by convention, the Queen respects the prime minister's choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;npm&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm |title=Brown is UK's new prime minister |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=23 January 2008 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which [[responsible government|they are responsible]]. Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]], and become [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. The [[Rt.

The UK's three [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom#Major parties in the House of Commons|major political parties]] are the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]]. During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] these three parties won 622 out of 650 seats available in the House of Commons: 621 seats at the general election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/european_election_database/country/uk/|title=United Kingdom|work=European Election Database|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1 more at the delayed by-election in Thirsk and Malton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/28/general-election-2010-conservatives|title=Thirsk and Malton: Conservatives take final seat in parliament|work=The Guardian |location=London|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remaining seats were won by minor parties that only contest elections in one part of the UK: the [[Scottish National Party]] (Scotland only); [[Plaid Cymru]] (Wales only); and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], [[Ulster Unionist Party]], and [[Sinn Féin]] (Northern Ireland only, though Sinn Féin also contests elections in the Republic of Ireland).

===Devolved administrations===

Behind are residential buildings in a mixture of styles.|The [[Scottish Parliament Building]] in [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] is the seat of the [[Scottish Parliament]]]]

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own devolved  [[Executive (government)|government or executive]], led by a [[First Minister]] (or, in the case of Northern Ireland, a [[Diarchy|diarchal]] [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]]), and a [[Devolution|devolved]] [[unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called [[West Lothian question]] which concerns the fact that MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3432767.stm |title=Scots MPs attacked over fees vote |work=BBC News |date=27 January 2004 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on matters affecting England that are handled by devolved legislatures for their own constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/82358.stm |title=Talking Politics: The West Lothian Question |work=BBC News |first=Brian |last=Taylor |date=1 June 1998 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] and [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically [[reserved matters|'reserved']] to the UK parliament, including [[education in Scotland|education]], [[NHS Scotland|healthcare]], [[Scots law]] and [[local government in Scotland|local government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/the_scottish_parliament/310036.stm |title=Scotland's Parliament&amp;nbsp;– powers and structures |work=BBC News |date=8 April 1999 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|2011 elections]] the SNP won re-election and achieved an overall majority in the Scottish parliament, with its leader, [[Alex Salmond]], as [[First Minister of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6659531.stm |title=Salmond elected as first minister |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2007 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13305522 |title= Scottish election: SNP wins election |work=BBC News |date= 6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welsh Government]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]] have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/wales_99/the_welsh_assembly/309033.stm |title=Structure and powers of the Assembly |work=BBC News |date=9 April 1999 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales|Acts of the Assembly]], which require no prior consent from Westminster.

The Executive is led by a [[diarchy]] representing [[Designated Unionist|unionist]] and [[Designated Nationalist|nationalist]] members of the Assembly. Currently, [[Peter Robinson (politician)|Peter Robinson]] ([[Democratic Unionist Party]]) and [[Martin McGuinness]] ([[Sinn Féin]]) are [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;northernireland1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/your-government/devolved-government.htm|title=Devolved Government&amp;nbsp;– Ministers and their departments|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=17 October 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070822230925/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/your-government/devolved-government.htm| archivedate = 22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom does not have a [[codified constitution]] and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|Parliamentary sovereignty]], the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;N. Burrows, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2230.00203/abstract &quot;Unfinished Business: The Scotland Act 1998&quot;], ''The Modern Law Review'', vol. 62, issue 2, (March 1999), p. 249: &quot;The UK Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate. The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Elliot, [http://icon.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/3/545.abstract &quot;United Kingdom: Parliamentary sovereignty under pressure&quot;], ''International Journal of Constitutional Law'', vol. 2, issue 3, (2004), pp. 553–554: &quot;Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the U.K. Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied ... but this power to legislate on what may be termed &quot;devolved matters&quot; is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters ... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 1972, the UK Parliament [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972|unilaterally prorogued]] the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Walker,[http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/644536 &quot;Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Devolution, 1945–1979&quot;], ''Journal of British Studies'', vol. 39, no. 1 (January 2010), pp. 124 &amp; 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the circumstances in which the UK Parliament would abolish devolution given the political constraints created by referendum decisions are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gamble, [http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/1/19.short &quot;The Constitutional Revolution in the United Kingdom&quot;], ''Publius'', volume 36, issue 1, p. 29: &quot;The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater than in relation to Scotland and Wales, given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the [[Government of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Meehan, [http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/1/19.short &quot;The Belfast Agreement—Its Distinctiveness and Points of Cross-Fertilization in the UK's Devolution Programme&quot;], ''Parliamentary Affairs'', vol. 52, issue 1 (1 January 1999), p. 23: &quot;[T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland's new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminister and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states... Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminister's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|British Armed Forces}}
''[[British Armed Forces|Her Majesty's Armed Forces]]'' also known as the ''British Armed Forces'' and sometimes as the ''Armed Forces of the Crown''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/legalservices/p3chp29.htm Armed Forces Act 1976, Arrangement of Sections], raf.mod.uk&lt;/ref&gt; are the [[armed forces]] of the United Kingdom. They encompass three professional service branches, the [[Naval Service (United Kingdom)|Naval Service]] (including the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]]), the [[British Army]], and the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=21 February 2012|publisher=Ministry of Defence|title=Ministry of Defence|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Home/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forces are all managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and controlled by the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]], chaired by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. The [[Commander-in-Chief]] of Her Majesty's Armed Forces is the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]],&lt;ref name=Speaker&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2012/march/speaker-addresses-hm-the-queen/ Parliament] Speaker addresses Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, 20 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Elizabeth II]], to whom members of the forces swear allegiance.

Historically, the British Armed Forces had played a key role in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|dominant world power]]. Having seen action in a number of major wars involving other world powers, such as the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Crimean War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] - repeatedly emerging victorious allowed Britain to [[Congress of Vienna|influence world events]] with its policies and emerge as the world's leading military and economic power. Since the end of the British Empire, the United Kingdom has nonetheless remained a [[great power]] and the British Armed Forces are among the largest and most technologically sophisticated armed forces in the world. Recent defence policy has a stated assumption that &quot;the most demanding operations&quot; will be undertaken as part of a coalition.&lt;ref&gt;''UK 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''. Office for National Statistics. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Setting aside the [[Operation Palliser|intervention in Sierra Leone]], UK military operations in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[Role of the United Kingdom in the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], [[Operation Telic|Iraq]] and, most recently, [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya]], have followed this approach. The last war in which the British military fought alone was the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, in which they were victorious.

The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in [[NATO]], including the [[Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps|Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]], as well as the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]], [[RIMPAC]] and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in [[Ascension Island]], [[Military of Belize|Belize]], [[Military Forces based in Brunei|Brunei]], [[British Army Training Unit Suffield|Canada]], [[Sovereign Base Areas|Cyprus]], [[Diego Garcia]], the [[Military of the Falkland Islands|Falkland Islands]], [[British Forces Germany|Germany]], [[British Forces Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], [[Kenya]] and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Facilities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&amp;STEMMER=en&amp;WORDS=raf%20diego%20garcia&amp;ALL=RAF&amp;ANY=&amp;PHRASE=%22Diego%20Garcia%20%22&amp;CATEGORIES=&amp;SIMPLE=&amp;SPEAKER=&amp;COLOUR=red&amp;STYLE=s&amp;ANCHOR=50221w33.html_spnew0&amp;URL=/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050221/text/50221w33.htm#50221w33.html_spnew0|title=House of Commons Hansard|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various sources, including the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] and the Ministry of Defence, the United Kingdom has the fourth-highest [[List of countries by military expenditures|military expenditure]] in the world. Total defence spending currently accounts for around 2.3%&amp;nbsp;– 2.6% of total national GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/Organisation/KeyFactsAboutDefence/DefenceSpending.htm |title=Defence Spending |publisher=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the near future two new [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] and [[HMS Prince of Wales (R09)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] will enter service in the Royal Navy. The [[United Kingdom Special Forces]], such as the [[Special Air Service]] and [[Special Boat Service]], provide troops trained for quick, mobile, military responses in [[counter-terrorism]], land, maritime and [[amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]], often where secrecy or covert tactics are required.

The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century. As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century.

Education in the United Kingdom is a [[devolution|devolved]] matter, with each country having a separate education system.

[[Education in England]] is the responsibility of the [[Secretary of State for Education]], though the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of [[Local education authority|local authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081230030407/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/localauthorities/index.cfm |title=Local Authorities |publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families |accessdate=21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universally free of charge state education was introduced piecemeal between 1870 and 1944, with education becoming compulsory for all 5 to 14 year-olds in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gordon, J.C.B. |title= Verbal Deficit: A Critique |publisher=Croom Helm |location =London |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-85664-990-5 |page=44 note 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 8 ('Duty of local education authorities to secure provision of primary and secondary schools'), Sections 35–40 ('Compulsory attendance at Primary and Secondary Schools') and Section 61 ('Prohibition of fees in schools maintained by local education authorities ...'), Education Act 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August). The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. State schools which are allowed to select pupils according to intelligence and academic ability can achieve comparable results to the most selective private schools: out of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 two were state-run [[grammar school]]s. Despite a fall in actual numbers the proportion of children in England attending private schools has risen to over 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/nov/09/schools.uk |title=Private school pupil numbers in decline |newspaper= The Guardian |date=9 November 2007 |location=London |first=Donald |last=MacLeod |accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of students at the leading universities of Cambridge and Oxford had attended state schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6905288.stm |title=More state pupils in universities |work=BBC News |date=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[universities of England]] include some of the top universities in the world; the [[University of Cambridge]], [[University College London]], the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Imperial College London]] are all ranked in the global top 10 in the 2010 [[QS World University Rankings]], with Cambridge ranked first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2010/results |title=QS World University Rankings Results 2010 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS) rated pupils in England 7th in the world for maths and 6th for science.

[[Education in Scotland]] is the responsibility of the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]], with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two [[Scottish public bodies|non-departmental public bodies]] have key roles in Scottish education: the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] colleges of [[further education]] and other centres;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/5656.html About SQA] Scottish Qualifications Authority.

[[Education in Northern Ireland]] is the responsibility of the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Education]] and the [[Department for Employment and Learning|Minister for Employment and Learning]], although responsibility at a local level is administered by five education and library boards covering different geographical areas.

===Healthcare===
{{Main|Healthcare in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital]], an [[NHS Scotland]] specialist [[children's hospital]]]]
Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a [[devolution|devolved matter]] and each country has its own system of private and [[publicly funded health care]], together with [[alternative medicine|alternative]], holistic and complementary treatments. Public healthcare is provided to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] and is free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The [[World Health Organization]], in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last =Haden |editor-first= Angela |editor2-last =Campanini |editor2-first =Barbara |title =The world health report 2000&amp;nbsp;– Health systems: improving performance |year= 2000 |location =Geneva |publisher=World Health Organisation |url= http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |isbn = 92-4-156198-X |accessdate =5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Statistics/WHO-COMP-Study-30.pdf |title=Measuring overall health system performance for 191 countries |author=[[World Health Organization]] |publisher=New York University |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [[General Medical Council]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and non-governmental-based, such as the [[Royal College]]s. However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national [[executive (government)|executives]]; [[healthcare in England]] is the responsibility of the UK Government; [[healthcare in Northern Ireland]] is the responsibility of the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]; [[healthcare in Scotland]] is the responsibility of the [[Scottish Government]]; and [[healthcare in Wales]] is the responsibility of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]].

Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.healthp.org/node/71|title=The NHS from Thatcher to Blair |first=Peter |last=Fisher |work=NHS Consultants Association |publisher=International Association of Health Policy |quote=The Budget ... was even more generous to the NHS than had been expected amounting to an annual rise of 7.4% above the rate of inflation for the next 5 years.

The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its [[History of the United Kingdom|history]] as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a [[political union]] of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the [[British Empire]], British influence can be observed in the [[English language|language]], [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]] and [[Common law|legal systems]] of many of its former colonies; including Australia, Canada, [[India]], Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.

'British literature' refers to literature associated with the United Kingdom, the [[Isle of Man]] and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in the English language. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the [[books published per country per year|largest publisher of books]] in the world.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news |author=Goldfarb, Jeffrey |title= Bookish Britain overtakes America as top publisher |url= http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080106093222/http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/499053/bookish_britain_overtakes_america_as_top_publisher/ |agency=Reuters |date =10 May 2006 |work=RedOrbit |location= Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the playwrights [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.

Notable pre-modern and early-modern English writers include [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (14th century), [[Thomas Malory]] (15th century), [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] (16th century), and [[John Milton]] (17th century). In the 18th century [[Daniel Defoe]] (author of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'') and [[Samuel Richardson]] were pioneers of the [[modern novel]]. In the 19th century there followed further innovation by [[Jane Austen]], the gothic novelist [[Mary Shelley]], children's writer [[Lewis Carroll]], the [[Brontë family|Brontë sisters]], the social campaigner [[Charles Dickens]], the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] [[Thomas Hardy]], the [[realism (arts)|realist]] [[George Eliot]], the visionary poet [[William Blake]] and romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]]. 20th century English writers include: science-fiction novelist [[H. G. Wells]]; the writers of children's classics [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[A. A. Milne]] (the creator of [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]), [[Roald Dahl]] and [[Enid Blyton]]; the controversial [[D. H.

[[Dylan Thomas]] became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century.

During the late 1980s and 1990s the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the &quot;[[Young British Artists]]&quot;: [[Damien Hirst]], [[Chris Ofili]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], [[Tracey Emin]], [[Mark Wallinger]], [[Steve McQueen (artist)|Steve McQueen]], [[Sam Taylor-Wood]] and the [[Jake and Dinos Chapman|Chapman Brothers]] are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement.

The [[Royal Academy]] in London is a key organisation for the promotion of the visual arts in the United Kingdom.

Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of American and European influence. Many British films are co-productions with American producers, often using both British and American actors, and British actors feature regularly in Hollywood films. Many successful Hollywood films have been based on British people, [[British literature|stories]] or events, including [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']], ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', and the 'English Cycle' of Disney animated films which include, ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article600292.ece/Barry-Ronges-Classic-DVD---Alice-in-Wonderland |title =Barry Ronge's Classic DVD: Alice in Wonderland |work=Sunday Times |location =Johannesburg |accessdate =20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Britons are also notable for a theory of moral philosophy [[utilitarianism]], first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and later by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his short work ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=s7y5MJOuN30C&amp;pg=PA66 |title=Moral Problems in Medicine: A Practical Coursebook |author=Palmer, Michael |publisher=Lutterworth Press | location = Cambridge |year=1999 | isbn = 978-0-7188-2978-0 |page=66 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=8A4xLnzfqYwC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=Utilitarianism |author=Scarre, Geoffrey |publisher=Routledge | location = London |year=1995 |page=82 |accessdate=30 December 2010 | isbn = 978-0-415-12197-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other eminent philosophers from the UK and the unions and countries that preceded it include [[Duns Scotus]], [[John Lilburne]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A.J. &quot;Freddie&quot; Ayer]]. Foreign-born philosophers who settled in the UK include [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Karl Popper]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

Major sports, including association football, [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[boxing]], badminton, [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[darts]] and golf, originated or were substantially developed in the United Kingdom and the states that preceded it. A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular [[sport in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/928/Rugby-Union-Britains-Second-Most-Popular-Sport.aspx Britain's Most Popular Sports&amp;nbsp;– MORI Sports Tracker] ''Ipsos MORI''. Retrieved 2 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In most international competitions, separate teams represent England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland usually field a single team representing all of Ireland, with notable exceptions including at the [[Commonwealth Games]] and association football. In sporting contexts, these teams can be referred to collectively as the [[Home Nations]]. However there are occasions where a single sports team represents the United Kingdom, including at the Olympics where the UK is represented by the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain team]]. London was the site of the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] Olympic Games, and in [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] became the first city to play host for a third time.

Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and [[league system]], though a few clubs play outside their country's respective systems for a variety of historical and logistical reasons. [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] compete as separate countries in international competition and, as a consequence, Great Britain previously did not compete as a team in football events at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/football/7529807.stm |title=Why is there no GB Olympics football team? |work=BBC Sport |date=5 August 2008 |accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Britain Olympic football team]] was assembled to compete in the [[London 2012 Olympic Games]] by [[The Football Association]]. The [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish]], [[Football Association of Wales|Welsh]] and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Irish]] football associations declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status&amp;nbsp;– a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/football/7286011.stm |title=Blatter against British 2012 team |work=BBC News |date=9 March 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inside the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Millennium Stadium]], [[Cardiff]], opened for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]]]]
[[Cricket]] was invented in England. The [[England cricket team]], controlled by the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/about-ecb/ About ECB] England and Wales Cricket Board.

Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from football and rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams, although Wales had fielded its own team in the past. [[Sport in Ireland|Irish]] and [[Cricket in Scotland|Scottish]] players have played for England because neither [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]] nor [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] have Test status and have only recently started to play in [[One Day International]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Howzat-happen-England-fields-.5519537.jp |title=Howzat happen?

There is a professional [[County Championship|league championship]] in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/counties_glamorgan.shtml |title=Glamorgan |publisher=BBC South East Wales| month=August |year=2009 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Rugby league]] is a popular sport in some areas of the UK. It originates in Huddersfield and is generally played in [[Northern England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7rY2tVBypH0C&amp;pg=PA27 |title=Professional identities: policy and practice in business and bureaucracy |isbn= 978-1-84545-054-0 |author=Ardener, Shirley |publisher=Berghahn |location =New York |year=2007 |page=27 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single 'Great Britain Lions' team had competed in the [[Rugby League World Cup]] and Test match games, but this changed in 2008 when [[England national rugby league team|England]], [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] and [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]] competed as separate nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rlwc08.com/|title=Official Website of Rugby League World Cup 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain is still being retained as the full national team for Ashes tours against Australia, New Zealand and France. [[Super League]] is the highest level of professional rugby league in the UK and Europe. It consists of 11 teams from Northern England, 1 from London, 1 from Wales and 1 from France.

The [[Six Nations Championship]], played between the Home Nations, as well as Italy and France, is the premier international [[rugby union]] tournament in the northern hemisphere. [[Sport governing body|Sport governing bodies]] in [[Rugby union in England|England]], [[Rugby union in Scotland|Scotland]], [[Rugby union in Wales|Wales]] and [[Rugby union in Ireland|Ireland]] organise and regulate the game separately.

The UK is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] (F1) are based in the UK, and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The UK hosted the very first F1 Grand Prix in 1950 at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], the current location of the [[British Grand Prix]] held each year in July. The country also hosts legs of the [[World Rally Championship]] and has its own [[touring car racing]] championship, the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesrallygb.com/documents/Rally_Guide_1.pdf |title=Wales Rally GB, Rally Guide 1 |publisher=walesrallygb.com |accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]] (also referred to as the Union Jack). It was first created in 1606 by the superimposition of the [[Flag of England]] on the [[Flag of Scotland]] and updated in 1801 with the addition of [[Saint Patrick's Flag]]. Wales is not represented in the Union Flag as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom; the possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7114248.stm |title=Welsh dragon call for Union flag |work=BBC News |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is &quot;[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]&quot;, with &quot;King&quot; replaced with &quot;Queen&quot; in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.

[[Britannia]] is a [[national personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from [[Roman Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html|title=Britannia on British Coins|publisher=Chard|accessdate=25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding on the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often been associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song &quot;[[Rule, Britannia!]]&quot;. Up until 2008, the [[lion]] symbol is depicted behind Britannia on the [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|British fifty pence coin]] and on the back of the [[Ten pence (British decimal coin)|British ten pence coin]]. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom and has been associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baker|first=Steve|title=Picturing the Beast|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2001|page=52|isbn=0-252-07030-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
