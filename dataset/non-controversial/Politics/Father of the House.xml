      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34255">'''Father of the House''' is a term that has by tradition been unofficially bestowed on certain members of some national [[legislature]]s, most notably the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In some legislatures the term refers to the oldest member, but in others it refers the longest-serving member. The term '''Mother of the House''' or [[Mother of Parliament]] is also found, although the usage varies between countries. It is used simply as the female alternative to Father of the House, being applied when the relevant member is a woman.

==United Kingdom==
===House of Commons===
{{See also|Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom#List of oldest sitting MPs since 1945}}
The ''Father of the House'' is a title that is by tradition bestowed on the senior Member of the House of Commons who has the longest unbroken service.&lt;ref name=&quot;hciom3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m03.pdf|title=The Father of the House|date=March 2009|work=Factsheet M3|publisher=House of Commons Information Office|accessdate=2009-10-05|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two or more MPs have the same length of current uninterrupted service, then whoever was sworn in earliest at its commencement, as listed in [[Hansard]], is named Father.

In the House of Commons, the sole mandatory duty of the Father of the House is to preside over the election of a new Speaker whenever that office becomes vacant. The relevant Standing Order does not refer to this member by the title &quot;Father of the House&quot;, referring instead to the longest-serving member of the House present who is not a [[Minister of the Crown]] (meaning that if the Father is absent or a government minister, the next person in line presides).

The current Father of the House of Commons is Sir [[Peter Tapsell (UK politician)|Peter Tapsell]], Conservative MP for [[Louth and Horncastle (UK Parliament constituency)|Louth and Horncastle]], who began his continuous service from the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 general election]].  

Should Tapsell cease to be a Member of the House of Commons, MPs with continuous service from the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]] will become eligible to be Father of the House. The members with this length of service are: Sir [[Gerald Kaufman]], [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Michael Meacher]] and [[Dennis Skinner]] (listed according to the order in which they took the oath after the 1970 election).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jun/30/members-sworn|title=Members Sworn|date=30 June 1970|work=Hansard|publisher=Hansard Digitisation Project|accessdate=2009-10-05}} (Cormack was the 191st member to take the oath in 1970, Strang 205th, Prescott 225th, Kaufman 351st, Clarke 365th.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jul/01/members-sworn|title=Members Sworn|date=1 July 1970|work=Hansard|publisher=Hansard Digitisation Project|accessdate=2009-12-01}} (Meacher was the 540th member to take the oath in 1970, Skinner 579th.)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Father of the House is not necessarily the sitting MP with the earliest date of first election: Sir [[Peter Tapsell (UK politician)|Peter Tapsell]] was first elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]], and is the only remaining 1950s MP, but lost his seat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964]] and was out of Parliament until [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966]]; this meant that [[Alan Williams]] was Father of the House until his retirement at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] by virtue of his continuous service since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]]. [[Michael Foot]], as the only remaining MP from the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 election]] between [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]], was never Father of the House because he was out of Parliament between [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955]] and a [[Ebbw Vale by-election, 1960|by-election in 1960]].  Similarly, though Sir [[Winston Churchill]] was first elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900]], he did not become Father of the House until 1959 because he lost his seat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]], not returning to the Commons until [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924]].

Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was simultaneously Father of the House and Prime Minister from May 1907 until shortly before his death in April 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;hciom3&quot; /&gt;

===House of Lords===

The current Father of the House of Lords is  [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]), who became eligible to take his seat on his 21st birthday in 1940 (having succeeded to the title in 1938 while still a minor) and actually first took his seat in October 1945. After the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of [[hereditary peer]]s to sit in the House of Lords, Carrington (along with all former [[Leader of the House of Lords|Leaders of the House]]) was given a [[life peerage]] to enable him to continue to sit.  

Should Carrington cease to be a Member of the House of Lords, the remaining peers who first sat in the 1940s will become eligible to be Father of the House. There are currently two: [[Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu|Lord Montagu of Beaulieu]] (sat first on 26 November 1947) and [[Bertram Bowyer, 2nd Baron Denham|Lord Denham]] (sat first on 13 December 1949). Both are hereditary peers who were [[List of excepted hereditary peers under the House of Lords Act 1999|elected]] to remain in the House under the provisions of the 1999 Act. 

The senior life peer by date of creation is [[Alun Gwynne Jones, Baron Chalfont|Lord Chalfont]], who entered the House in 1964.

The [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], including the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], was [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]]d in 1972 and abolished completely in 1973 leaving the title of Father of the House defunct.

==Australia==
{{Main|Father of the Australian Senate|Father of the Australian House of Representatives|Father of the Australian Parliament|Members of the Parliament of Australia who have served for at least 30 years}}

In Australia, the current member of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with the longest period of continuous service, whether a Minister or not, is known as &quot;Father of the House&quot;.  Similarly, the current member of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] with the longest period of continuous service is known as &quot;Father of the Senate&quot;.  The longer serving of the two Fathers is called &quot;[[Father of the Australian Parliament|Father of the Parliament]]&quot;.

As in Britain, these terms have no official status. However, unlike Britain: 

*the term Father of the House/Senate applies where there is one member whose continuous service is unequivocally longer than any other, as determined by the date of election (House) or the date of the start of the term (Senate).  Where two or more members have equal length of continuous service, more than any other members, they are considered joint Fathers of the House/Senate.  Some state parliaments, however, follow the British convention.

*the Father of the House and the Father of the Senate in Australia have no parliamentary role at all.  The election of the presiding officers is conducted by the [[Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives|Clerk of the House]] and the [[Clerk of the Australian Senate|Clerk of the Senate]] respectively.

Since 1 July 2008, Senator [[Ron Boswell]], who was first elected in 1983, has been the [[Father of the Australian Senate|Father of the Senate]].  

Since 1 September 1998, [[Philip Ruddock]], who was first elected in 1973, has been the [[Father of the Australian House of Representatives|Father of the House of Representatives]] and [[Father of the Australian Parliament|Father of the Parliament]].

==Canada==
{{Main|Dean of the House (Canada)}}
The longest-serving member of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] who is not a cabinet minister is known as the Dean of the House, and presides over the election of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker]] at the beginning of each Parliament. The same term is used for the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives|equivalent position]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

==Germany==
Starting with the Frankfurter Nationalversammlung ([[Frankfurt Parliament]]) of 1848, all democratic German parliaments had a Father (or Mother) of the House, usually called ''Alterspräsident'' (President by right of age).

Under the current constitution ([[Grundgesetz]]) of 1949, the Alterspräsident will preside over the Parliament ([[Bundestag]]) at the start of each legislative period. 

Following tradition, the Alterspräsident will first ascertain himself that he is the oldest member of the Bundestag by stating his birth date and asking if anyone is present who was born before his date. If no older member of the Bundestag is present (which is usually the case) he will formally declare that he indeed is the Alterspräsident and will start proceedings. 

As acting President of the Bundestag ([[Bundestagspräsident]]) he delivers the first programmatic speech and oversees the elections of the President of the Bundestag and the Vicepresidents of the Bundestag ([[Bundestagsvizepräsident]]en). He then stands down and yields his power to the newly elected Bundestagspräsident.
As the position of Father of the House usually draws a certain public attention, the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] twice nominated old independents (Stefan Heym in 1994, Fred Gebhardt in 1998) to obtain this office. None of them served a complete term (Heym resigned in 1996, Gebhardt died in 2000). This was considered a manipulation.

== Israel ==
In the beginning of each [[Knesset]], before the election of a permanent [[speaker (politics)|speaker]], there is a temporary speaker. In the past it was the oldest member of Knesset, now it is the longest-serving member. [[Michael Eitan]] is the most recent Knesset member to serve in this capacity, doing so from February 24 - March 30, 2010.

==Ireland==
{{Main|Father of the Dáil}}
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the term '''Father of the [[Dáil]]''' is an unofficial title applied to the [[Records of members of the Oireachtas|longest-serving Teachta Dála]] (TD) in the house, regardless of their position. The current Father is the Taoiseach and [[Fine Gael]] party leader, [[Enda Kenny]], [[Teachta Dála|TD]], since the retirement of [[Séamus Pattison]] at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]]. On a number of occasions two or more people have shared the position of Father of the Dáil.

==New Zealand==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
In [[New Zealand]], the term '''Father-''' or '''Mother of the House''' is an unofficial title applied to the longest-serving MP in the house, regardless of their position. The Father of the House has no official role in Parliament. The current Father of the House in the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] is [[Peter Dunne]], the leader of the [[United Future New Zealand]], having served continuously since the [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]]. The current [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], [[Lockwood Smith]], has also served continuously since 1984, but as members are sworn into office in alphabetical order, Dunne by virtue of this has served the longest.

In [[New Zealand]]'s first election of {{NZ election link year|1853}}, the {{NZ electorate link|Bay of Islands}} electorate was the first to declare the election of a successful candidate, [[Hugh Carleton]], was returned unopposed. In the subsequent [[1st New Zealand Parliament|General Assembly of 1854]], Carleton liked to be known as the Father of the House.
