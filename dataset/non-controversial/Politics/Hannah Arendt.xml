'''Johanna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelsey Wood (Pulaski Technical College) |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=143 |title=Literary Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Hannah Arendt |publisher=Litencyc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Hannah&quot; Arendt''' (October 14, 1906 – December 4, 1975) was a [[Germany|German]] [[People of the United States|American]] [[political theorist]]. She has often been described as a [[philosopher]], although she refused that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with &quot;man in the singular.&quot; She described herself instead as a [[political theory|political theorist]] because her work centers on the fact that &quot;men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. The Human Condition. Second ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt's work deals with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of [[politics]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]].

==Life and career==
Arendt was born into a family of secular [[German Jewish|German Jews]] in the city of Linden (now part of [[Hanover]]). She was the daughter of Martha (née Cohn) and Paul Arendt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=VsbCymMbcvoC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Paul+and+Martha+Arendt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kz3uvnPo1u&amp;sig=ZiLgRZTfqH60lPImgJj6IVwfPoQ&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Hannah Arendt: An Introduction - John Mcgowan - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=1997-12-15 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in [[Königsberg]] (the birthplace of Prussian philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], renamed Kaliningrad and annexed to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1946) and [[Berlin]].

At the [[University of Marburg]], she studied philosophy with [[Martin Heidegger]].  According to [[Hans Jonas]], her only German-Jewish classmate, Arendt embarked on a long and stormy romantic relationship with Heidegger, for which she was later criticized because of Heidegger's support for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party when he was rector of [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg University]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Ron Rosenbaum]], the author of ''[[Explaining Hitler]]'', even extended the argument [of Heidegger's critic [[Emmanuel Faye]] that Heidegger's thought is thoroughly tainted by Nazism] to the German Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt, a former student and lover of Heidegger's. Citing a recent essay by the historian [[Bernard Wasserstein]], Mr. Rosenbaum wrote on ''Slate.com'' that Arendt's thinking about the Holocaust and her famous formulation, &quot;the banality of evil,&quot; were contaminated by Heidegger and other anti-Semitic writings.&quot; Cohen, Patricia. [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/books/09philosophy.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Does%20a%20Nazi%20Deserve%20a%20Place%20Among%20Philosophers?%20&amp;st=cse &quot;An Ethical Question: Does a Nazi Deserve a Place Among Philosophers?&quot;], ''The New York Times'', November 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of one of their breakups, Arendt moved to [[Heidelberg]], where she wrote her [[dissertation]], under the existentialist philosopher-psychologist [[Karl Jaspers]], on the concept of love in the thought of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]. In 1929, in Berlin, she married Günther Stern, later known as [[Günther Anders]]; they divorced in 1937.

The dissertation was published in 1929. Because she was Jewish, Arendt was prevented from ''[[habilitating]]'', a prerequisite for teaching in German universities.  She researched [[anti-Semitism]] for some time before being interrogated by the [[Gestapo]]. Thereupon Arendt fled Germany for [[Paris]]. There she befriended the [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]], her first husband's cousin. While in France, Arendt worked to support and aid Jewish refugees. She was imprisoned in [[Camp Gurs]] but was able to escape after a few weeks.

With the German [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|military occupation of northern France]] during World War II and the deportation of Jews to [[Nazi concentration camp]]s even by the [[Vichy France|Vichy collaborator regime]] in the unoccupied south, Arendt was compelled to leave France. In 1940, she married the German poet and [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Heinrich Blücher]], by then a former member of the Communist Party.

In 1941, Arendt escaped with her husband and her mother to the [[United States]].  They relied on the life-saving visas, illegally issued by the American diplomat [[Hiram Bingham IV]], who aided in this way approximately 2,500 other Jewish refugees.  Another American, [[Varian Fry]], paid for their travels and helped in securing the visas. Upon arrival in New York, Arendt became active in the German-Jewish community. From 1941 to 1945, she wrote a column for the German-language Jewish newspaper, ''[[Aufbau]]''. From 1944, she directed research for the Commission of European Jewish Cultural Reconstruction and traveled frequently to Germany in this capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Human, citizen, Jew | url= http://www.haaretz.com/human-citizen-jew-1.202946 | newspaper= [[Haaretz]] | first= Natan | last= Sznaider | date= 20 October 2006 | accessdate= 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II she returned to Germany and worked for [[Youth Aliyah]], a [[Zionist]] organization that had saved thousands of children from the Holocaust and settled them in Palestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cullen-DuPont2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first= Kathryn | last=Cullen-DuPont|title=Encyclopedia of women's history in America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA374|accessdate=28 November 2011|date=1 August 2000|publisher=Infobase Publishing| isbn=978-0-8160-4100-8| pages= 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a close friend of Karl Jaspers and his Jewish wife, developing a deep intellectual friendship with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first1= Hannah |last1= Arendt | first2= Karl | last2= Jaspers | year=1992 | work=Correspondence 1926-1969 | publisher= Harcourt Brace Jovanovich | ISBN = 0-15-107887-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began corresponding with [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first1= Hannah |last1= Arendt | first2= Mary | last2= McCarthy | year=1995 | work=Between Friends: The Correspondence of Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy 1949-1975 | publisher= Secker &amp; Warburg | ISBN = 0-436-20251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, she became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.haaretz.com/dear-hannah-1.245518 | title=Dear Hannah | newspaper= Haaretz | first= Anshel | last= Pfeffer | date= 9 May 2008 | accessdate= 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt served as a visiting scholar at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Northwestern University]]. In the spring of 1959, she became the first woman lecturer at Princeton. Arendt also taught at the [[University of Chicago]], where she was a member of the [[Committee on Social Thought]]; [[The New School]] in New York City; [[Yale University]], where she was a fellow; and, the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]] (1961–1962, 1962–1963).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958–1969] at [[Wesleyan University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1962 and a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAL&gt;{{cite web|title=Deceased Members|url=http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php#a|work=American Academy of Arts and Letters|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in 1975, at age 69, of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and was buried at [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]], where her husband taught for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David|last= Bird|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hannah Arendt, Political Scientist, Dead |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00915F73D5C1A7493C4A91789D95F418785F9 |quote=Hannah Arendt, the political philosopher who escaped Hitler's Germany and later scrutinized its morality in &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; and other books, died Thursday night in her apartment at 370 Riverside Drive. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 6, 1975 |accessdate=2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hannah Arendts Grave.JPG|thumb|Hannah Arendt's gravestone at the [[Bard College]] cemetery in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]]]]

Arendt was instrumental in the creation of [[Structured Liberal Education]] (SLE) at [[Stanford University]]. She wrote a letter to the then president of Stanford University to convince the university to enact [[Mark Mancall]]'s vision of a residentially based humanities program.

==Works==
Arendt theorizes [[Free will|freedom]] as public, performative and associative, drawing for illustration on the Greek &quot;[[Polis]],&quot; American [[Township (United States)|townships]], the [[Paris Commune]], the [[civil rights movement]]s of the 1960s, and the 1956 Hungarian uprising. She posits that freedom does not pre-exist the organised community but is rather constructed there, as the common space whereto its equal members bring their own uniqueness and &quot;natality,&quot; and create something of lasting value such as a state. This natality signs the contingent, indeterminate and so political future that we don't know anything about.

;The Origins of Totalitarianism
Arendt's first major book was ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), which traced the roots of [[Stalinist]] [[Communism]] and [[Nazism]] in both [[anti-Semitism]] and [[imperialism]]. The book was opposed by the Left on the grounds that it presented the two movements as equally tyrannical. She further contends that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust but merely a convenient proxy. Totalitarianism in Germany was in the end about megalomania and consistency, not eradicating Jews.

;The Human Condition
Arguably, her most influential work, ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' (1958), distinguishes between the concepts of political and social, labour and work, various forms of action, and explores implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social-being part of human nature, political life, was intentionally constructed by only a few of these societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom through the construction of a common world. These categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between ontological and sociological structures, are sharply delineated.  While Arendt relegates labour and work to the realm of the &quot;social,&quot; she favors the human condition of action as the &quot;political&quot; that is both existential and aesthetic.

;Men in Dark Times
Her collection of essays ''Men in Dark Times'' presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the 20th century, such as [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Hermann Broch]], [[Pope John XXIII]], and [[Isak Dinesen]].

;Adolf Eichmann Trial
In her reporting of the [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]] trial for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which evolved into ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]]'' (1963), she coined the phrase &quot;the [[banality of evil]]&quot; to describe Eichmann. She raised the question of whether [[evil]] is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions and inaction.

Arendt was sharply critical of the way the trial was conducted in [[Israel]]. She was also critical of the way that some Jewish leaders, notably [[Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski|M. C. Rumkowski]], acted during the [[Holocaust]]. This caused a considerable controversy and even animosity toward Arendt in the Jewish community. Her friend [[Gershom Scholem]], a major scholar of [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the [[Shoah]]/Holocaust. Due to this lingering criticism, her book has only recently been translated into [[Hebrew]]. Arendt ended the book with:{{quote|Just as you [Eichmann] supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations—as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world—we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang.}}

;On Revolution
Arendt published another book in the same year, ''[[On Revolution]].'' In this analysis of the two major [[revolution]]s of the 18th century, Arendt went against the grain of [[Marxist]] and [[left-wing politics|leftist]] thought by contending that the [[American Revolution]] was a successful revolution, whereas the [[French Revolution]] was not. When the masses of France gained the sympathy of revolutionaries, the French Revolution turned away from the legal stability of a constitutional government toward the lawless satisfaction of the constantly regenerating economic needs of these masses. Some saw in this argument a post-Holocaust anti-French sentiment. Nevertheless, it was inveterate in the history of political philosophy, echoing that of [[Edmund Burke]].

Arendt also argued that the revolutionary spirit endemic to the founding fathers had not been preserved in America because the majority of people had no role to play in politics other than voting. She admired [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s idea of dividing counties into townships. Arendt's interest in such a &quot;[[council system]],&quot; which she saw as the only alternative to the state, continued all her life.&lt;ref&gt;Bortolini, Matteo. [http://www.scform.unipd.it:8080/~m.bortolini/arendt.pdf &quot;Hannah Arendt, Council Democracy And (Far) Beyond. A Radical View&quot;], 19 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

;On Violence Essay
Arendt's essay &quot;On Violence&quot; distinguishes violence and power. She maintains that, although theorists of both the Left and Right regard violence as an extreme manifestation of power, the two concepts are in fact antithetical. Power comes from the collective will and does not need violence to achieve any of its goals since voluntary compliance takes its place. As governments start losing their legitimacy, violence becomes an artificial means towards the same ends and is therefore found only in the absence of Power. Bureaucracies then become the ideal birthplaces of violence since they are defined as the &quot;rule by no one,&quot; with whom to argue against and therefore re-create the missing link with the people it rules over.

;The Life of the Mind
Her posthumous book, ''The Life of the Mind'' (1978, edited by [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]), remained incomplete. Stemming from her [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland, it focuses on the mental faculties of thinking and willing, in a sense moving beyond her previous work concerning the ''vita activa''. In her discussion of thinking, she focuses mainly on [[Socrates]] and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between Me and Myself. This appropriation of Socrates leads her to introduce novel concepts of conscience (which gives no positive prescriptions but instead tells me what I cannot do if I would remain friends with myself when I re-enter the two-in-one of thought where I must render an account of my actions to myself) and morality (an entirely negative enterprise concerned with non-participation in certain actions for the sake of remaining friends with one's self). In her volume on Willing, Arendt, relying heavily on Augustine's notion of the will, discusses the will as an absolutely free mental faculty that makes new beginnings possible.

==Legacy==
In the third volume, Arendt was planning to engage the faculty of judgment by appropriating Kant's ''Critique of Judgment'', however, she did not live to write it. Nevertheless, although her notion of judging remains unknown, Arendt did leave manuscripts (&quot;Thinking and Moral Considerations,&quot; &quot;Some Questions on Moral Philosophy,&quot;) and lectures (''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'') concerning her thoughts on this mental faculty. The first two articles were edited and published by [[Jerome Kohn]], an assistant of Arendt and a director of Hannah Arendt Center at [[The New School]], and the last was edited and published by Ronald Beiner, professor of political science at the University of Toronto.

Her personal library was deposited at [[Bard College]] at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, [[ephemera]], and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment. The college has begun digitally archiving some of the collection, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bard.edu/arendtcollection/ |title=Hannah Arendt Collection - Stevenson Library, Bard College |publisher=Bard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
