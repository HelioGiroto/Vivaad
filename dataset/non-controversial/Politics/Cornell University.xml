'''Cornell University''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ɔr|ˈ|n|ɛ|l}} {{respell|kor|NEL|'}}) is an American [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education#Doctorate-granting Universities|research university]] located in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], New York, United States. Founded in 1865 by [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge — from the [[classics]] to the [[science]]s, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: &quot;I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;motto&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov07/2015investWalsh.lgk.html | title = Cornell University Facts: Motto | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is broadly organized into seven [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] colleges and seven [[graduate school|graduate]] divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in [[Education City]], [[Qatar]]. Cornell is one of two private [[land-grant university|land grant universities]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The other is the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are [[statutory college|state-supported statutory or contract colleges]]. As a land grant college, it operates a [[cooperative extension]] outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzer 2005&quot;/&gt;

Since its founding, Cornell has been a [[co-education]]al, non-[[sectarianism|sectarian]] institution where admission is offered irrespective of religion or race. Cornell counts more than 245,000 living [[alumnus|alumni]], 31&amp;nbsp;[[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall Scholars]], 28&amp;nbsp;[[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]] and [[List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Cornell University|41 Nobel laureates]] as affiliated with the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/about/facts/cornell_facts.pdf | title = 2009–10 Factbook | publisher = Cornell University | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/Nobel_Laureates_at_CUk1.shtml | title = Cornell Nobel laureates | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhodes Scholars&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1165899600 | title = Uncle Ezra | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student body consists of nearly 14,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 states and 122 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;student body&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/about/facts/stats.cfm | title = Facts about Cornell | format = URL| publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Cornell University}}
Cornell University was founded on April&amp;nbsp;27, 1865 as the result of a [[New York State Senate|New York State (NYS) Senate]] bill that named the university as the state's [[land-grant university|land grant]] institution. Senator [[Ezra Cornell]] offered his farm in [[Ithaca, New York]] as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial [[financial endowment|endowment]]. Fellow senator and experienced educator [[Andrew Dickson White]] agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the initial two buildings and traveled around the globe to attract students and [[faculty (university)|faculty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;founding&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Becker | first = Carl L. | authorlink = Carl L.

Cornell continued to be a technological innovator applying its research to its own campus as well as to outreach efforts. For example, it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered [[dynamo]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=chp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|title=The Early History of District Energy at Cornell University|accessdate=2009-11-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070704140529/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|archivedate=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1894, Cornell has included state-funded statutory colleges&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, Sidney (2001).

Cornell expanded significantly, particularly since [[World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]], with its student population in Ithaca growing to its current count of about 20,000 students. The faculty also expanded, and by the century's end, the university had more than 3,400&amp;nbsp;faculty members.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Weill Cornell Medical College-NYC medical division units have additional external affiliations with 1,326&amp;nbsp;full-time and part-time faculty members elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also increased its breadth of course offerings.

Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in [[Ithaca, New York]], overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]]. When the university was founded in 1865, the campus consisted of 209.5&amp;nbsp;acres (0.85&amp;nbsp;km²) of Ezra Cornell's roughly 300&amp;nbsp;acre (1.2&amp;nbsp;km²) farm.{{Failed verification|date=December 2010}} Since then, it has swelled to about 745&amp;nbsp;acres (3.0&amp;nbsp;km²), encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ithaca&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/visiting/ithaca | title = Cornell University - The Ithaca Campus | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 260 university buildings are divided primarily between [[Cornell Central Campus|Central]] and [[Cornell North Campus|North Campuses]] on the [[plateau]] of the Hill, [[Cornell West Campus|West Campus]] on its slope, and Collegetown immediately south of Central Campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ithaca&quot; /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2010}} Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums. The only remaining residential facility on Central Campus is the [[Cornell Law School|Law School's]] dormitory, Hughes Hall. North Campus contains [[freshman]] and [[graduate student]] housing, themed program houses, and 29&amp;nbsp;[[fraternity and sorority houses]]. West Campus has upperclass residential colleges and an additional 25&amp;nbsp;fraternity and sorority houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/maps/large.cfm | title = Cornell University Map | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2010}} Collegetown contains two upperclass [[residence halls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dining.cornell.edu/campuslife/housing/undergraduate/cascadilla-hall.cfm|title=Housing – Cascadilla Hall|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campuslife.cornell.edu/campuslife/housing/undergraduate/sheldon-court.cfm|title=Sheldon Court|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Schwartz [[performing arts|Performing Arts]] Center amid a neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.ithaca.ny.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B4519B3DC-DFAD-47EE-9E0A-6A55E243E4B4%7D&amp;DE=%7BFEA36033-DB19-4201-9F95-A5F4DAA6DE06%7D|title=Collegetown|publisher=City of Ithaca|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic [[architectural style]]s, including ornate [[Collegiate Gothic]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] buildings, and less decorative [[international style (architecture)|international]] and [[modern architecture|modernist]] structures. The more ornate buildings generally predate [[World War II]]. Because the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, grandiosity was neglected in favor of less expensive and more rapidly constructed styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Daniel | last=Margulis | coauthors=Schroeder, John | title=A Century at Cornell | publisher=[[Cornell Daily Sun]] | location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] | year=1980 | isbn=0-938304-00-3 | pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some buildings are neatly arranged into [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangles]], others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus. For example, in one of the earliest plans, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the designer of [[Central Park]], outlined a &quot;grand terrace&quot; overlooking [[Cayuga Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Kermit C. | last=Parsons | title=The Cornell Campus: A History of its Planning and Development | publisher=Cornell University Press | location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] | year=1968 | chapter=Chp. 3: A Quadrangle of Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the terrace plan was dropped, McGraw Hall appears to face the wrong direction, facing Libe Slope rather than the Arts Quad.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The university is home to several buildings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including the [[Andrew Dickson White House]], [[Bailey Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Bailey Hall]], [[Caldwell Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Caldwell Hall]], [[Comstock Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Comstock Hall]], [[Morrill Hall]], and [[Deke House (Ithaca, New York)|Deke House]]. At least three other historic buildings—[[Roberts Hall (Ithaca, New York)|the original Roberts Hall]], [[East Robert Hall (Ithaca, New York)|East Robert Hall]] and [[Stone Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Stone Hall]]—have also been listed on the NRHP, despite their demolitions in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{NRISref|2008a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ithaca Campus is among the rolling valleys of the [[Finger Lakes]] region and, atop East Hill, provides a view of the surrounding area, including 38&amp;nbsp;miles (61.4&amp;nbsp;km) long [[Lake Cayuga]].

On December 19, 2011, a bid by a consortium of Cornell University and [[Technion-Israel Institute of Technology]] won a competition for rights to claim free city land as well as $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in the city.  The competition was established by New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] in order to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector.  The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square feet state-of-the-art tech campus to be built on [[Roosevelt Island]].  Instruction is to begin in the fall of 2012 in a temporary location in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec11/NYCcover.html|title='Game-changing' tech campus goes to Cornell, Technion|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thom Mayne]] of the architecture firm Morphosis has been selected to design the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island.

Cornell is [[decentralized]], with its colleges and schools exercising wide autonomy. Each defines its own academic programs, operates its own [[college admissions|admissions]] and advising programs, and confers its own [[academic degree|degrees]]. The only university-wide requirements for a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degree are to pass a [[human swimming|swimming]] test, take two [[physical education]] courses, and satisfy a writing requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateuniversity.com/universities/NY/Cornell_University.html|title=Cornell University|publisher=stateuniversity.com|accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.cornell.edu/studying.html|title=Studying Computing and Information Science|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.cornell.edu/academics/|title=Cornell Biology: Intro to the Major|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All academic departments are affiliated with at least one college; the last department without such an affiliation, the [[Cornell Africana Studies and Research Center]], merged with the Arts College in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2010/12/02/day-hall-merges-africana-center-arts-college-director-resigns-protes|title=Day Hall Merges Africana Center Into Arts College; Director Resigns in Protest|authors=Lawrence Lan and Ben Gitlin|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=December 2, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven schools provide undergraduate programs and an additional seven provide graduate and professional programs. Students pursuing graduate degrees in departments of these schools are enrolled in the [[Cornell University Graduate School|Graduate School]]. The School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions offers programs for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sce.cornell.edu | title = School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 13,515 undergraduate students, 4,251 (31.5%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, [[Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences|Arts and Sciences]], followed by 3,153 (23.3%) in [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|Agriculture and Life Sciences]] and 2,680 (19.8%) in [[Cornell University College of Engineering|Engineering]]. By student enrollment, the smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is [[Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning|Architecture, Art, and Planning]], with 515 (3.8%) students.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot; /&gt;

Several other universities have used Cornell as their model, including [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Sydney]] in Australia and the [[University of Birmingham]] in the United Kingdom; the latter on the recommendation of one of its financiers, [[Andrew Carnegie]], who was a Cornell Trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.

The university awarded the world’s first degree in [[journalism]], the nation’s first university degree in [[veterinary medicine]], and the first doctorates in [[electrical engineering]] and [[industrial engineering]]. It also established the first four-year schools of hotel administration and industrial and labor relations. Cornell was the first U.S. university to offer a major in American studies, and it was the first university to teach modern Far Eastern languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot; /&gt;

Cornell and Oregon State University are the only two institutions which are members of the [[Land-grant university|Land Grant]], [[National Sea Grant College Program|Sea Grant]], [[National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program|Space Grant]], and [[Sun grant colleges|Sun Grant]] programs.

At the time of its founding, Cornell University was considered revolutionary because its founder, Ezra Cornell, was committed to access for all students, regardless of economic circumstance. Section 9 of the original charter of Cornell University ensured that the university &quot;shall be open to applicants for admission&amp;nbsp;... at the lowest rates of expense consistent with its welfare and efficiency, and without distinction as to rank, class, previous occupation or locality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=United States.

The university awarded need-based grants as early as 1879, and its first endowed scholarship fund was created in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000037.pdf|page=13|title=Gifts and Giving|first=Michael|last=Whalen|date=May 2003|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1950s Cornell coordinated with other Ivy League schools to provide a consistent set of financial aid. However, in 1989, a consent decree to end a Justice Department antitrust investigation ended such coordination.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005-06 Financial Plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000030.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cornell University|title=2005-06 Financial Plan|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the decree, all Ivy League schools continue to award aid on financial need without offering any athletic scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/WhatIsIvy/compliance.asp |publisher=[[Ivy League]] |title=NCAA Rules: A guide for Ivy Alumni and Friends of Athletics |accessdate=2010-04-11 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308165649/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/WhatIsIvy/compliance.asp |archivedate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, Cornell announced a policy of matching any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke University or Stanford, if an accepted applicant is trying to decide between Cornell and those other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/AidMatch.html|title=Cornell to match financial aid offers of peer universities|date=December 7, 2010|publisher=Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2008, Cornell announced a new financial aid initiative to be phased in over the following two years. In the first year, 2008–09, Cornell replaced need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from families with incomes under $60,000 and capped such loans annually at $3,000 for students from families with incomes between $60,000 and $120,000. The following year, 2009–10, the program improved by replacing loan with scholarships for students from families with incomes up to $75,000, and capped annual loans at $3,000 for students from families with income between $75,000 and $120,000.  For families above $120,000, need-based loans were capped at $7,500 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2008/12/05/cu’s-new-aid-plan-will-help-during-econ-crisis|title=C.U.'s New Aid Plan Will Help During Econ.

In the early 1980s, Cornell deployed the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate course-grained parallel computing. In 1984, the [[National Science Foundation]] began work on establishing five new [[supercomputer]] centers, including the [[Cornell Theory Center|Cornell Center for Advanced Computing]], to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. As an NSF center, Cornell deployed the first IBM Scalable Parallel supercomputer. In the 1990s, Cornell developed scheduling software and deployed the first supercomputer built by Dell. Most recently, Cornell deployed Red Cloud, one of the first cloud computing services designed specifically for research. Today, the center is a partner on the National Science Foundation XSEDE supercomputing program, providing coordination for XSEDE architecture and design, systems reliability testing, and online training using the Cornell Virtual Workshop learning platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cac.cornell.edu/about/history.aspx|title=Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing History and Awards|date=April 2012|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as [[Hans Bethe]], contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] (see also: [[List of Cornell Manhattan Project people]]). In the 1930s, Cornell built the second [[cyclotron]] in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study [[synchrotron radiation]]. During the 1990s, the [[Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source|Cornell Electron Storage Ring]], located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/42/1/11 | title = Cornell's laboratory is at the crossroads | publisher = CERN Courier | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lns.cornell.edu/accelphys/cesr.shtml | title = Accelerator Physics: Cornell Electron Storage Ring | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After building the synchrotron at Cornell, [[Robert R.

The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and shed light on questions such as the identity of [[dark matter]] and the existence of extra dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/research/accelerator-physics/|title=Accelerator Physics|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of humanities and social sciences, Cornell is best known for being one of the world's greatest centers for the study of [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[Cornell South East Asia Program|Southeast Asia Program]] (SEAP) at Cornell is designated as a [[National Resource Center]] (NRC) by the United States Department of Education 2010–2014. Therefore, the SEAP is nationally prominent in promoting advanced foreign language training, area and international knowledge in the liberal arts and applied discipline focused on Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/southeastasia/ |title=Home &amp;#124; SEAP - Southeast Asia Program |publisher=Einaudi.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/southeastasia/resources/research.asp George McTurnan Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia] is located in the historic &quot;Treman House.&quot; The house was built by [[Robert Henry Treman]], the son of an enterprising local family and the first member of that family to attend Cornell University and be elected to its board of trustees.

During the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system committed 21,668 [[community service]] and [[advocacy]] hours and raised $176,547 in philanthropic efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek&quot; /&gt; However, the administration has expressed concerns over student misconduct in the system. In 2004–05, of the 251 social events registered with the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs, 37 (15%) resulted in a complaint. In that same year, there were five reported instances of property destruction, five reports of [[bias]], three [[hazing]] incidents, and various other allegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek&quot; /&gt; Misconduct by students, faculty or staff is reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's [[justice system]]. However, students accused of academic and conduct code violations at Cornell are entitled to representation in the Cornell justice system by the Office of the Judicial Codes Counselor. Judicial Codes Counselors are usually Cornell Law students appointed by the University president to advocate for students accused of academic and conduct code violations. In addition to the right to representation, Cornell students have the right to not self-incriminate during Judicial Administrator investigations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Admin/judicial_system.html#ja5|title=CUInfo: The Campus Judicial System|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an unusual (though very important) right in college justice systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brucealanblock.com/pages/College_student_legal_resource_center.html|title=College Students Legal Resource Center|publisher=Bruce Allan Block, PLC|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Visions of Liberty: The Bill of Rights for All Americans|first=Ira|last=Glasser|publisher=Arcade Publishing|year=1993|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press and radio===&lt;!-- Any publications discussed here should pertain chiefly to Student life -- Scholarly publications belong in the Press and scholarly publications section above --&gt;
The Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio. Student-run press outlets include ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', the oldest continuously independent college daily newspaper in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornellsun125.com/index.php?q=node/27 | title = The Sun Also Rises: A history of America's Oldest Continuously Publishing, Independent College Daily | publisher = The Cornell Daily Sun | accessdate = 2006-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060515205920/http://www.cornellsun125.com/index.php?q=node/27 |archivedate = May 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Cornell Lunatic]]'', a campus humor magazine; the ''[[Cornell Chronicle]]'', the university's newspaper of record; ''[[The Cornell Review]]'', a [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[newspaper]]; and ''[[Kitsch (magazine)|Kitsch Magazine]]'', a [[feature story|feature magazine]] published in cooperation with [[Ithaca College]].

===Housing===
[[File:Cornell footbridge.jpg|thumb|right|One of several [[footbridge]]s that span Cornell's [[gorge]]s and ease commuting from housing to academic buildings on campus]]
University housing is broadly divided into three sections: [[Cornell North Campus|North Campus]], [[Cornell West Campus|West Campus]], and [[Collegetown]]. Since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ri.campuslife.cornell.edu/Ri_article_page_view.asp?action=article&amp;ID=2318 | title = The Residential Initiative: North Campus | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the program houses: [[Risley Residential College]], Just About Music, the [[Cornell North Campus#Ecology House|Ecology House]], [[Cornell North Campus#Holland International Living Center|Holland International Living Center]], the [[Cornell North Campus#Multicultural Living Learning Unit|Multicultural Living Learning Unit]], the [[Cornell North Campus#Latino Living Center|Latino Living Center]], [[Cornell North Campus#Akwe:kon|Akwe:kon]], and [[Cornell North Campus#Ujamaa|Ujamaa]]. In an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250&amp;nbsp;million reconstruction of West Campus created [[Cornell West Campus#House system|residential colleges]] there for undergraduates.&lt;ref name=&quot;houses&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cornellsun.com/node/22275 | title = Housing Initiative to Finish Two Years Early | publisher = The Cornell Daily Sun | accessdate = 2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=13&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19700205.2.1.4&amp;e=--------20--1----Seznec+Report-all|title=Risley may become house for create arts study|first=Barbara|last=Kantrowitz|date=February 5, 1970|accessdate=December 12, 2010|work=Cornell Daily Sun|volume=86|number=75|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Cornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional students. Of these, Schuyler House (which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/fs/facinfo/fs_facilInfo.cfm?facil_cd=2702|title=Schuyler House|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hughes Hall (which is the domitory wing of the law school complex)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/fs/facinfo/fs_facilInfo.cfm?facil_cd=3028|title=Hughes Hall|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a dorm layout, while Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living. Off campus, many single family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dos.cornell.edu/greek/info_for_students/index.cfm|title=DOS: For Students|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell’s Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students.

Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include [[Slope Day]], a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and [[Dragon Day]], which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day.

According to legend, if a virgin crosses the [[Arts Quad]] at midnight, the statues of [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/tours/default.cfm?tour_id=41|title=Fall Creek Gorge: Suspension Bridge Virtual Tour|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7&amp;nbsp;m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27&amp;nbsp;kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/pumpkin_tale.html | title = Pumpkin Tale | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1067490000|title=Ask Uncle Ezra|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock tower also plays music.

The school colors are [[carnelian (color)|carnelian]] (a shade of red) and white, a play on &quot;Cornellian&quot; and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot &quot;Touchdown&quot; in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascot&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/17613|title=Wild Cornell Mascot Wreaks Havoc|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 30, 2006|accessdate=2010-09-21|first=Casey|last= Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's [[alma mater]] is &quot;[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]&quot;, and its [[fight song]] is &quot;[[Give My Regards to Davy]]&quot;.

The university received worldwide attention for a series of six student suicides that occurred during the 2009–10 school year, and they have since added temporary fences to its bridges while more permanent measures are in process. Before this abnormal cluster of suicides, the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide rates of other American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008 in which no suicides occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/03/20/new.york.cornell.suicides/index.html |title=Two suspected suicides confirmed at Cornell; total now at six |first=Ross |last=Levitt |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Susan |last2=Candiotti |work=[[CNN]] |date=March 22, 2010 |publisher=CNN |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/education/17cornell.html |title=After 3 Suspected Suicides, Cornell Reaches Out |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 16, 2010 |first=Trip |last=Gabriel |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
