'''''Election''''' is a 1999 American [[comedy film]] adapted from a 1998 novel [[Election (1998 novel)|of the same title]] by [[Tom Perrotta]]. The plot revolves around a three-way [[election]] race in [[high school]], and satirizes both suburban [[Youth subculture|high school life]] and [[Student activism|politics]]. The film received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Witherspoon in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]] category, and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film]] in 1999.

The film stars [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], and [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] and tells the story of Jim McAllister (Broderick), a popular high school history and civics teacher in [[Omaha – Council Bluffs metropolitan area|suburban Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], and one of his students, [[Tracy Flick]] (Witherspoon), around the time of the school's [[Student governments in the United States|student body]] [[election]]s.  McAllister's involvement with various school-related functions masks his frustration with other aspects of his life; Tracy is an overachiever whose obsession with getting into a good college masks a vindictive and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] personality. When Tracy obtains a nomination for class president in the school election, McAllister believes she does not deserve the title, and tries his best to stop her from winning.

While it failed to become a major box office success, home video and DVD releases were more lucrative. Following its release, the movie has received various rankings; ''Election'' is ranked #61 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] ''100 Funniest Movies'' and #9 on [[Entertainment Weekly|Entertainment Weekly's]] list of the [http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1532588_1_0_,00.html 50 Best High School Movies], while Witherspoon's performance as Flick was ranked at #45 on the list of the ''100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time'' by [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere Magazine]]. The film was rated [[PG-Rating|R]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for strong [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]], sex-related dialogue and [[profanity|language]], and a scene of [[Cannabis (drug)|drug use]] and was rated '15' by the [[BBFC]] for &quot;some moderate sex and references&quot;.

==Plot==
Jim McAllister ([[Matthew Broderick]]) is a high school teacher in the suburbs of Omaha, Nebraska whose enthusiastic involvement at school masks his frustration with other aspects of his life. Tracy Flick ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) is an overachieving senior with a secret vindictive and sexual side. Earlier in the year, Tracy had an affair with another teacher, McAllister's best friend Dave ([[Mark Harelik]]). As a result, Dave was fired and divorced by his wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll); Tracy walked away without reprisal or punishment.

One day, Tracy announces that she is running for student body president, which horrifies McAllister, who is in charge of organizing the school's student government and truly despises Tracy. Set to run unopposed, McAllister decides to teach Tracy a lesson in humility by introducing another candidate. Paul Metzler ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]) is a polite and popular football player at the school. Paul is unable to play football his final year due to a broken leg, leaving him depressed. McAllister convinces him to register for the election in order to stop Tracy's chances of winning, since McAllister thinks that Tracy wins the election, she will have to spend more time with him which might lead to the same misfortune that his best friend had. At first, Paul does not like the idea because he does not feel smart enough to run in the election, and he does not want to go against Tracy, who has been nice to him, even letting him copy her homework. Eventually, Paul agrees with McAllister because the election gives him a new purpose. This brings out Tracy's vindictiveness, as she is jealous of Paul’s ease at being successful and popular. 

Meanwhile, Paul's younger sister Tammy ([[Jessica Campbell]]) is dumped by her girlfriend, Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia), who says that she is heterosexual and was just &quot;experimenting&quot;. Lisa does not waste time in &quot;getting over&quot; Tammy, performing oral sex on Paul after asking him to drive her home from school one day. The two become an item (Paul claiming that they would &quot;go to her house [after school] to fuck&quot; and swim in the hot tub) and election partners, in part to anger Tammy. 

In retaliation, Tammy decides to run for president as well, with a platform that student government is a sham. During a school assembly to hear their speeches, after Tracy and Paul only draw polite applause, Tammy delivers a defiant speech in which she denounces the election by saying that the school president does not really help the student body, and only uses the position to get credentials for college applications, much to Tracy's chagrin. Tammy also declares that she will dissolve the student government if elected. This rallies the student body to a standing ovation. Fearing the student body will vote for Tammy and thus the dissolution of the student government, Tammy is suspended.

While at school one night over the weekend, Tracy tries to fix one of her posters, but accidentally tears it. In a fit of uncharacteristic rage, she destroys all of Paul's campaign posters. She tries to dispose of them at the power plant, but is observed doing so by Tammy. The next day, when confronted by McAllister, Tracy claims innocence and threatens legal action against the school. Tracy then sees Tammy talking to McAllister and showing him the torn posters, which makes Tracy panic. However, Tammy is actually &quot;confessing&quot; to Tracy's crime and is then transferred to a private parochial school for girls, which was the original objective of her false confession, and kicked out of the election.

Later, McAllister, who is secretly attracted to Linda, kisses her spontaneously the day before the election. Linda asks Jim to rent a motel room for a later rendezvous and he leaves school during a class to prepare the room.  However, when he arrives later to pick her up, she is not there. He returns home to find Linda and his wife ([[Molly Hagan]]) talking together. Knowing he has been caught, Jim spends the night in his car outside Linda's house.

The next morning, McAllister oversees the counting of the election ballots at school. During this, he calls Linda several times, professing his love for her, after a bee sting. Jim's wife kicks him out of the house when he tries to apologize. After all the ballots are counted, Tracy has won by one vote (Paul voted for Tracy, feeling she was more qualified and that it is too arrogant to vote for oneself).  

After seeing Tracy dancing around excitedly in the hall, McAllister deduces that she found out that she won before it was announced. McAllister secretly disposes of two of Tracy’s ballots and then demands a recount, naming Paul as the winner.  While McAllister and his student argue about the validity of vote, it is suggested that the tally of protest votes for Tammy (disqualified on the ballot) exceeded that of either other candidate.  When a janitor discovers the two discarded ballots and presents them to the principal, McAllister resigns from his job. 

Divorced and humiliated, McAllister leaves Nebraska, ultimately choosing to fulfill a longtime dream of moving to [[New York City]], becoming a tour guide at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where he meets a new woman. Tracy gets accepted into [[Georgetown University]] (but she still does not fit in with other students, much to her disappointment), while Paul gets into the [[University of Nebraska]]. Tammy loves her new school, where she has met her new girlfriend. 

As the film closes, Jim recounts his final encounter with Tracy. After seeing her climb into a limousine with a politician, McAllister is reminded of his friend Dave and what Tracy has done to get where she is. Jim hurls a soda cup at the limousine, then makes a quick getaway. The final scene of the film shows Jim asking questions to some children he is giving a tour to at the Museum, all the while deliberately ignoring an overeager girl, the only one of the group who could answer, as she reminds him of Tracy.

==Pre-production and direction==
Much of the film was shot in and around the Omaha area including [[Dundee, Nebraska|Dundee]], [[Elkhorn, Nebraska|Elkhorn]], [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]], [[Carter Lake (Iowa–Nebraska)|Carter Lake]], and [[Papillion, Nebraska|Papillion]]. Other scenes were filmed in [[New York City|New York]] (including the college scene, which was actually filmed at [[Adelphi University]] on Long Island) and [[Washington D.C.]] Production shut down for about a month when [[1997 Western Plains winter storms|a freak fall snowstorm]] hit Omaha in October 1997, knocking down trees and power lines.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

Omaha locations used during production include:
* [[Papillion La Vista Senior High School]] serves as the setting for George Washington Carver High School. Payne had initially aimed to use [[Millard North High School]] in Omaha, but the School Board of [[Millard, Nebraska|Millard]] found the script too obscene and inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/election.html |title=Election - by Alexander Payne andJim Taylor |publisher=Dailyscript.com |date=1997-07-22 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb_trivia&quot;/&gt; The setting was then moved to Papillion-La Vista High School which explains why the background noise from the school can be heard during much of the film, by actual teachers and students, because filming took place during the 1997-98 school year.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb_trivia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126886/trivia | title=Trivia for Election | publisher=at the [[Internet Movie Database]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Godfather's Pizza]] where Dave visits with Tracy is located at 7920 S. 84th St. in LaVista.
* The parking lot where Jim throws away Tracy's nomination signatures in a dumpster was filmed on the  corner of N. 50th St. and Underwood Ave. The Carl S. Baum Druggists building in the scene is currently a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant.
* Linda's house is located at 683 Parkwood Ln.
* The Metzler house is located on S. 187 Cir. along the Shadow Ridge Country Club south of [[Elkhorn, Omaha, Nebraska|Elkhorn]].
* [[Younkers]] is located in the [[Westroads Mall]].
* The soccer field at [[Brownell-Talbot School]] was used for the Immaculate Heart soccer game.
* The American Family Inn (also credited as Rodeway Inn) is located at 1110 Fort Crook Road in Bellevue.

===Direction===
The novel's rights were sold to director Alexander Payne in January 1997. Payne had become a fan of the novel by Tom Perrotta on which the film is based. The novel was inspired by two key events. The first was the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 Bush vs. Clinton election campaign]], in which [[Ross Perot]] entered as a third party candidate (a move echoed by Tammy Metzler). The second was an incident at [[Memorial High School (Eau Claire, Wisconsin)|Memorial High School]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in which a pregnant student was elected homecoming queen, but staff announced a different winner and burned the ballots to cover it up.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D71538F937A25753C1A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= | title=Officials Deny Pregnant Girl School Crown | work=The New York Times | date=October 14, 1992 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/feb/21/tom-perrotta-interview | title=A life in writing: Tom Perrotta | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Crace | date=February 21, 2009 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the text of a newspaper article in the film, the following can be read: &quot;If you've paused the film in order to read this entire article, your time would be better spent renting ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'' from your local video store, which was another Payne film. Do you know how hard it is to write these fake few stories for newspaper movie props? I've got better things to do.&quot; 

For the school assembly scenes, Payne had to use special effects to make the gym look full. As Payne said on the commentary, some students learned that being an extra wasn't all it was cracked up to be, and that left the assembly scene lacking in students. Payne filmed a select group of students sitting in different spots for multiple takes, and then (using digital editing) filled in the blanks to make it look like a packed gym.

The film uses a number of stylized techniques in its storytelling, particularly through the use of freeze frames, flashbacks and voiceovers, which allow sections of the narrative to be delivered from the points of view of the four main characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117492039.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title=Todd McCarthy Review from 'Variety' | date=April 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to commentary by Alexander Payne, in the scene where Jim watches pornography in the basement, the basement was left unaltered.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb_trivia&quot;/&gt; 

The film was originally shot with an ending close to the one found in the novel, with Jim McCallister working in a car dealership, where Tracy visits him before leaving for college.  After testing poorly with audiences, the ending was eventually reshot.  The original ending was unseen until the accidental discovery of an early VHS [[workprint]] of the film at a [[flea market]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slashfilm.com/watch-original-alexander-paynes-election/ Watch The Never Before Seen Original Ending of Alexander Payne’s ‘Election’]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ending surfaced on [[YouTube]] but [[Paramount Pictures]] has since had it removed claiming copyright infringement. It can still be found on other various websites.

===Casting===
Several actors were cast in place of Broderick, Witherspoon, Klein, and Campbell and turned it down because of the high-risk content and creative differences. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} [[Thora Birch]] was cast as Tammy Metzler, but left due to creative differences with Alexander Payne.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb_trivia&quot;/&gt; Many of the remaining cast members were scouted on location, including the janitor that appears at the beginning and end of the movie. He is an actual janitor that works for the director's offices in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. He was formerly a janitor at [[Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart (Omaha, Nebraska)|Duchesne Academy]]. He has since retired.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb_trivia&quot;/&gt;

Also, the casting director of the movie is the football player that appears in the adult movie that McAllister watches. Many local Omaha students and teachers were used in the film for the roles of students and teachers. One in particular was [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]], who would end up becoming a mainstay in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] and star in other movies. Payne found him when he was scouting schools for locations to shoot and a teacher at one of the schools introduced him to Klein. Witherspoon had been acting in moderately well-received films in the early 1990s. [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], who appeared towards the end of the film as committee chairman Larry Fouch, was just a student at [[Creighton Preparatory School]] in Omaha, the same high school Payne attended, when he did this movie. He would go on to college at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee]] before moving out to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue an acting career.
