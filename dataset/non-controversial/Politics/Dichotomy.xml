[[File:Dichotomy.svg|thumb|right|250px|An example of a dichotomy is the partition of a scene into [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure and ground]] – the letters are foreground or figure; the rest is the background.]]

{{Wiktionary}}
A '''dichotomy''' is any splitting of a whole into exactly two non-overlapping parts, meaning it is a procedure in which a whole is divided into two parts. It is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets) that are:
* [[jointly exhaustive]]: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
* [[mutually exclusive]]: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

Such a partition is also frequently called a [[bipartition]].

&lt;!-- this is a confused sentence - clearly ME and JE are NOT mutually exclusive, please re-phrase if you know how it works: 
These two ways to [[partition of a set|partition]] elements are themselves a dichotomy. --&gt;
The two parts thus formed are [[Complement (set theory)|complements]]. In [[logic]], the partitions are [[dual (category theory)|opposites]] if there exists a [[proposition]] such that it holds over one and not the other.

== Etymology ==

The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''dichotomia'' (Greek: &quot;διχοτομία&quot;) (divided): ''dich-'' (form of ''dícha'', in two, asunder); ''tomia-'' a combining form meaning cutting, incision, excision of an object.

== Usage ==

* The above applies directly when the term is used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], or [[linguistics]]. For example, if there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice-versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.
* In [[set theory]], a dichotomous relation ''R'' is such that either ''aRb'', ''bRa'' or both.
* In [[statistics]], dichotomous data may only exist at first two [[levels of measurement]], namely at [[nominal scale|nominal]] level of measurement (such as in case of &quot;British&quot;, &quot;American&quot;, &quot;Australian&quot; etc when measuring nationality) and at [[ordinal scale|ordinal]] level of measurement (such as in case of &quot;tall&quot; vs &quot;short&quot;, when measuring height).
* In the [[classification of mental disorders]] in [[psychiatry]] or [[clinical psychology]], dichotomous classification or [[categorization]] refers to the use of cut-offs intended to separate disorder from non-disorder at some level of abnormality, severity or disability.
* A [[false dichotomy]] is a [[logical fallacy]] consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also [[undistributed middle]]).
* In economics, the [[classical dichotomy]] is the division between the real side of the economy and the monetary side. According to the classical dichotomy, changes in monetary variables do not affect real values as output, employment, and the real interest rate. Money is therefore neutral in the sense that it cannot affect these real variables.
* In [[biology]], a dichotomy is a division of organisms into two groups, typically based on a characteristic present in one group and absent in the other. Such dichotomies are used as part of the process of identifying species, as part of a [[dichotomous key]], which asks a series of questions, each of which narrows down the set of organisms. A well known dichotomy is the question &quot;does it have a backbone?&quot; used to divide species into [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
* In [[botany]], a dichotomy is a mode of branching by repeated [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]]. Thus a focus on branching rather than division.
* In [[computer science]], more specifically programming language engineering, the term dichotomy is used to denote fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, C++ has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In the anthropological field of [[theology]] and in [[philosophy]], dichotomy is the belief that humans consist of a soul and a body. (See [[Mind-body dichotomy]]) This stands in contrast to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]].
* Perceived Dichotomies are common in Western thought. [[C. P. Snow]] believes that Western society has become an argument culture ([[The Two Cultures]]). In ''The Argument Culture'' (1998), [[Deborah Tannen]] suggests that the dialogue of Western culture is characterized by a warlike atmosphere in which the winning side has truth (like a trophy). In such a dialogue, the middle alternatives are virtually ignored.
* In [[sociology]] and [[semiotics]], dichotomies (also sometimes called 'binaries' and/or 'binarisms') are the subject of attention because they may form the basis to divisions and inequality. For example, the [[Domestic-public dichotomy]] divides men's and women's roles in a society; the [[East-West dichotomy]] contrasts the [[Orient]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. Some social scientists attempt to [[deconstruct]] dichotomies in order to address the divisions and inequalities they create: for instance [[Judith Butler]]'s deconstruction of the [[gender]]-dichotomy and [[Val Plumwood]]'s deconstruction of the human-[[social environment|environment]] dichotomy.
* The [[I Ching]] and [[taijitu]] represent the yin yang theories of traditional [[Chinese culture]]. However, these do not represent a true dichotomy as the symbol incorporates a portion of each in the other, representing a dialectic.
* In [[Dialectical Behavioral Therapy]], a treatment shown to have some success in treating some clients with [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], an essential tool used is based on the idea of dichotomy. Dichotomy, in this case, is a self-defeating behavior using &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; or &quot;black-and-white&quot; thinking. The therapy teaches the patient how to change the dichotomy to a more &quot;[[dialectical]]&quot; (or &quot;seeing the middle ground&quot;) way of thinking.
* Divine Dichotomy as mentioned in the [[Conversations With God]] series of books by religious author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification. This is classifying objects by splitting objects into two groups until all are separated and in their own unique category.
* In [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/16540/dichotomy Astronomy] it is the phase of the moon or an inferior planet in which half its disk appears illuminated
