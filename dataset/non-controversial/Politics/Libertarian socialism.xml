Adherents of libertarian socialism assert that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing [[authoritarian]] institutions that control certain [[means of production]] and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic [[elite]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, Silva. ''Socialismo Libertário ou Anarchismo'' Vol. 1 (1896): &quot;Society should be free through mankind's spontaneous federative affiliation to life, based on the community of land and tools of the trade; meaning: Anarchy will be equality by abolition of [[private property]] (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]) and [[liberty]] by abolition of [[authority]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialism also constitutes a tendency of thought that promotes the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Authority is defined in terms of the right to exercise social control (as explored in the &quot;sociology of power&quot;) and the correlative duty to obey (as explred in the &quot;philosophy of practical reason&quot;). Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those &quot;authoritative&quot; powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.&quot;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.&quot; [[Emma Goldman]]. &quot;What it Really Stands for Anarchy&quot; in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows &quot;They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]].

After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at [[New Harmony, Indiana]] during 1825. One member of this commune was [[Josiah Warren]] (1798–1874), considered to be the first [[individualist anarchist]]&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini. &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Libertarian socialism is a western philosophy with diverse interpretations, though some general commonalities can be found in its many incarnations. Its proponents generally advocate a worker-oriented system of production and organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from [[neoclassical economics]] in favor of democratic [[cooperatives]] or [[common ownership]] of the means of production ([[socialism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty'' Transaction Publishers (1994) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; They propose that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the [[liberty]] of individuals and minimize [[Elite|concentration of power]] or authority ([[libertarianism]]).

[[File:Noam chomsky cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noam Chomsky]], a noted libertarian socialist]]

Libertarian socialists are strongly critical of coercive institutions, which often leads them to reject the legitimacy of the state in favor of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, Henry. ''The Growth of Economic Thought'' Duke University Press (1991) p.446&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale [[private property]] and enterprise (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relations as forms of domination that are antagonistic to individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ellen Frankel et al. ''Problems of Market Liberalism'' Cambridge University Press (1998) p.305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, libertarian socialism retains respect for personal property.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first anarchist journal to use the term &quot;libertarian&quot; was ''La Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' and it was published in New York City between 1858 and 1861 by French anarcho-communist [[Joseph Déjacque]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__150_years_of_Libertarian.html The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective]. &quot;150 years of Libertarian&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The next recorded use of the term was in Europe, when &quot;libertarian communism&quot; was used at a French regional anarchist Congress at Le Havre (16–22 November 1880). January the following year saw a French manifesto issued on &quot;Libertarian or Anarchist Communism.&quot; Finally, 1895 saw leading anarchists [[Sébastien Faure]] and [[Louise Michel]] publish ''La Libertaire'' in France.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary&quot; /&gt; The word stems from the [[French language|French]] word ''libertaire'', and was used to evade the French ban on anarchist publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:Libertarian|Wikiquote]]. Retrieved June 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In this tradition, the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; in &quot;libertarian socialism&quot; is generally used as a synonym for [[anarchism]], which some say is the original meaning of the term; hence &quot;libertarian socialism&quot; is equivalent to &quot;socialist anarchism&quot; to these scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noam Chomsky 2004, p. 739&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perlin |first=Terry M. |title=Contemporary Anarchism |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1979 |page=40|isbn=978-0-87855-097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the European socialist movement, ''libertarian'' has conventionally been used to describe those who opposed state socialism, such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. 

The association of socialism with libertarianism predates that of capitalism, and many anti-authoritarians still decry what they see as a mistaken association of capitalism with libertarianism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. ''The Modern Crisis'' Black Rose Books (1987) pp. 154–55 ISBN 0-920057-61-6&lt;/ref&gt; As Noam Chomsky put it, a consistent libertarian &quot;must oppose [[Private property|private ownership]] of the means of production and [[wage slavery]], which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2003) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In a chapter recounting the history of libertarian socialism, economist [[Robin Hahnel]] relates that thus far the period where libertarian socialism has had its greatest impact was at the end of the 19th century through the first four decades of the twentieth century.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in the twentieth century, libertarian socialism was as powerful a force as [[social democracy]] and communism. The [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Libertarian International– founded at the Congress of Saint Imier]] a few days after the split between Marxist and libertarians at the congress of the [[First International|Socialist International]] held in [[Hague Congress (1872)|The Hague in 1872]]– competed successfully against social democrats and communists alike for the loyalty of anticapitalist activists, revolutionaries, workers, unions and political parties for over fifty years. Libertarian socialists played a major role in the Russian revolutions of [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]]. Libertarian socialists played a dominant role in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1911. Twenty years after World War I was over, libertarian socialists were still strong enough to spearhead the [[Spanish Revolution|social revolution that swept across Republican Spain]] in 1936 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnel, Robin. [http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=CI5d2CpL60oC ''Economic Justice and Democracy''], Routledge Press, 2005, p. 138 ISBN 0-415-93344-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand a libertarian trend also developed within marxism which gained visibility around the late 1910s mainly in reaction against [[Bolshevism]] and [[Leninism]] rising to power and establishing the [[Soviet Union]]. Contemporary [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]] [[Harry Cleaver]] describes the situation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Outside and against this process of turning of Marxism into an ideology of domination, however, were various revolutionary tendencies which still drew on Marx's work to inform their struggles and which rejected both social- democratic and [[Marxist-Leninist]] versions of his theory. The most interesting of these, those that are relevant to my current purpose, have been those which insisted on the primacy of the self-activity and creativity of people in struggle against capitalism. Within the space of these tendencies there has developed a coherent critique of &quot;orthodox Marxism&quot; that includes not only a rejection of the concept of &quot;the transition&quot; but a reconceptualization of the process of transcending capitalism that has remarkable similarities to [[Peter Kropotkin|(Peter) Kropotkin]]'s thinking on this subject...Thus one of the earliest political tendencies within which this approach appeared after the Russian revolution of 1917 was that of &quot;[[Council Communism]]&quot; which saw the &quot;workers councils&quot; in Germany (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), or the [[soviets]] in Russia, as new organizational forms constructed by the people. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and beginning the restoration of domination and exploitation...Over the years this emphasis on working class autonomy has resulted in a reinterpretation of Marxist theory that has brought out the two-sided character of the class struggle and shifted the focus from capital (the preoccupation of orthodox Marxism) to the workers...As a result, not only has there been a recognition that capitalism seeks to subordinate everyone's life (from the traditional factory proletariat to peasants, housewives and students) but that all those peoples' struggles involve both the resistance to this subordination and the effort to construct alternative ways of being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Cleaver]]. [http://libcom.org/library/kropotkin-self-valorization-crisis-marxism &quot;Kropotkin, Self-valorization And The Crisis Of Marxism.&quot;] written for and presented to the Conference on Pyotr Alexeevich Kropotkin organized by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Dimitrov on December 8 – 14, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Anti-capitalism ===

{{main|Anti-capitalism}}
{{Socialism sidebar}}

Libertarian socialists are anti-capitalist, and can thus be distinguished from [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarians]]. Whereas [[Capitalism|capitalist]] (and [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]]) principles concentrate economic power in the hands of those who own the most capital, libertarian socialism aims to distribute power, and thus freedom, more equally amongst members of society. A key difference between libertarian socialism and capitalist libertarianism is that advocates of the latter generally believe that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status, whereas advocates of the former focus on freedom of choice. This is sometimes characterized as a desire to maximize &quot;free creativity&quot; in a society in preference to &quot;free enterprise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2003) pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialists believe if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with [[direct democracy]], voluntary federation, and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Austin, et al. 'Encyclopedia of Social Theory' Routledge (2006) p.50&lt;/ref&gt; including physical communities and economic enterprises.

Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture, while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S. 'A History of European Socialism' Yale University Press (1983) p.160&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of &quot;private property&quot; and &quot;[[Personal property|personal possession]]&quot;. Whereas &quot;private property&quot; grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not, and regardless of its productive capacity, &quot;possession&quot; grants no rights to things that are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Richard et al. 'Property and Contract in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth' The Macmillan Company (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-authoritarianism and opposition to the state===
{{main|Anti-statism|anti-authoritarianism}}
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
Libertarian socialists generally regard concentrations of power as sources of oppression that must be continually challenged and justified. Most libertarian socialists believe that when power is exercised, as exemplified by the economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2004) p. 775&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified structures of authority, be they [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or social.&lt;ref&gt;Ed, Andrew. 'Closing the Iron Cage: The Scientific Management of Work and Leisure' Black Rose Books (1999) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into voluntary associations (usually [[collective]]s, [[intentional community|communes]], municipalities, [[cooperative]]s, [[commons]], or [[Syndicalism|syndicates]]) that use [[direct democracy]] or [[consensus]] for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate combining these institutions using rotating, recallable [[Wiktionary:Delegate|delegates]] to higher-level federations.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray [http://books.google.com/books?id=F06arcQyYEgC&amp;printsec=frontcover Social Anarchism Or Lifestyle Anarchism] AK Press (1995) pp. 71–72 ISBN 1-873176-83-X&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish anarchism]] is a major example of such federations in practice.

Contemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and global justice movements&lt;ref&gt;Purkis, Jon. Bowen, James. 'Changing Anarchism' Manchester University Press (2004) p.165,179&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Councils of Good Government]] and the Global [[Indymedia]] network (which covers 45 countries on six continents). There are also many examples of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies around the world whose political and economic systems can be accurately described as [[anarchism|anarchist]] or libertarian socialist, each of which is unique and uniquely suited to the culture that birthed it.&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David. &quot;Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology&quot; Prickly Paradigm Press (2004) p. 22–23, 26–29&lt;/ref&gt; For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and of their flexibility and strength.

Contrary to popular opinion, libertarian socialism has not traditionally been a [[utopia]]n movement, tending to avoid dense theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made now, and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best solution can be arrived at democratically and organically, and to base the direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that the success of the [[scientific method]] comes from its adherence to open rational exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to [[dogma]] and predetermined predictions.

Because libertarian socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists but disagree with some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, [[Peter Hain]] interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete abolition of the state&lt;ref&gt;Hain, Peter &quot;Rediscovering our Libertarian Roots&quot; Chartist (August 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power, while also emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary protection while oppressive structures remain in existence.

=== Civil liberties and individual freedom ===
{{Main|Free love|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Anarchism and religion|Anarcha-feminism|Anarchism and education|Queer anarchism|Individualist anarchism}}
Libertarian socialists have been strong advocates and activists of [[civil liberties]] that provide an individual specific rights such as the freedom in issues of love and sex ([[free love]]) (see [[Anarchism and issues related to love and sex]]) and of thought and conscience ([[freethought]]). In this activism they have clashed with state and religious institutions which have limited such rights (see [[Anarchism and religion]]). [[Anarchism]] has been an important advocate of [[free love]] since its birth. Later a strong tendency of free love appeared alongside [[anarcha-feminism]] and advocacy of [[LGBT rights]] (see [[Queer anarchism|Anarchism and issues related to LGBTI persons]]). In recent times anarchism has also voiced opinions and taken action around certain sex related subjects such as [[pornography]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Boston_Anarchist_Drinking_Brigade__An_Anarchist_Defense_of_Pornography.html &quot;An Anarchist Defense of Pornography&quot; by Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade]&lt;/ref&gt; [[BDSM]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bdsm&quot;&gt;[http://info.interactivist.net/node/1530 &quot;Interview with an anarchist dominatrix&quot; by ''Organise'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bdsm&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Emma Goldman seated.jpg|180px|left|thumb|American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], prominent [[anarcha-feminist]], [[free love]] and [[freethought]] activist]]
[[Anarcha-feminism]] developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Virginia Bolten]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticise and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Also the council communist [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was a feminist activist as well as a [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian marxist]]. Anarchists also took a pioneering [[Queer anarchism|interest in issues related to LGBTI persons]]. An important current within anarchism is [[free love]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html |title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy |publisher=Ncc-1776.org |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2010-09-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101231195631/http://ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html| archivedate= 31 December 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to the early anarchist [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's [[self-ownership]].

A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the...free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf [[Wendy McElroy]]. &quot;The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895–1897 as ''The Firebrand''; 1897–1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major [[Anarchism|anarchist]] newspaper in the [[United States]] at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-MSF-551&quot;&gt;&quot;''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.&quot; ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909'', p.551.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication staunchly advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued &quot;[[Comstockery]]&quot; – censorship of sexual information.

===Violent and non-violent means===
{{See also|Anarchism and violence}}
Some libertarian socialists see violent revolution as necessary in the abolition of capitalist society. Along with many others, [[Errico Malatesta]] argued that the use of violence was necessary; as he put it in ''[[Umanità Nova]]'' (no. 125, September 6, 1921):

{{Block quote|It is our aspiration and our aim that everyone should become socially conscious and effective; but to achieve this end, it is necessary to provide all with the means of life and for development, and it is therefore necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence that denies these means to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Umanità Nova]], n. 125, September 6, 1921. (A translation can be found at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1921/09/haste.htm The revolutionary haste by Errico Malatesta]. Retrieved June 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued in favor of a [[non-violent revolution]] through a process of [[dual power]] in which libertarian socialist institutions would be established and form associations enabling the formation of an expanding network within the existing state-capitalist framework with the intention of eventually rendering both the state and the capitalist economy obsolete. 

The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed, in part, from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. 'Anarchism and Other Essays' Mother Earth (1910) p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency within the anarchist movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;&gt;Woodcock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence &quot;Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition&quot; by Geoffrey Ostergaard]. Ppu.org.uk (1945-08-06). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;/&gt; It developed &quot;mostly in [[Netherlands|Holland]] ''(sic)'', Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 21: &quot;Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from [[anarchist individualism]] to [[anarcho-syndicalism]], we come to [[Tolstoyanism]] and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in [[Netherlands|Holland]] ''(sic)'', Britain, and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even revolutionary action (see: [[non-violent revolution]]) provided it does not result in violence; it was in fact their approval of such forms of opposition to power that lead many anarcho-pacifists to endorse the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon. Later anarcho-pacifists have also come to endorse to non-violent strategy of dual power.

Other anarchists have believed that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified as a way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

==== Peasant revolts in the post-reformation era ====
[[Image:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|right|300px|Woodcut from a [[Diggers]] document by [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]].]]
Various libertarian socialist authors have identified the written work of English Protestant social reformer [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and the social activism of his group, the [[Diggers]], as anticipating this line of thought.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the Levellers and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''. In fact, it seems likely Tolstoy took much of his own inspiration from Winstanley &quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Marlow__Anarchism_and_Christianity.html Marlow. &quot;Anarchism and Christianity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;While the ideal commonwealth conceived by [[James Harrington]] tried to combine the existence of a powerful state with respect for the political rights of the citizens, [[Thomas Hobbes]] and Gerrard Winstanley, for opposite reasons, denied the possibility of power being shared between the state and the people...Before defining the government of a true Commonwealth Winstanley denounces the kingly government based on property and like Proudhon he believes that “[[property is theft]]”. [[Marie Louise Berneri]] &quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Marie_Louise_Berneri__Utopias_of_the_English_Revolution.html#toc10 &quot;Utopias of the English Revolution&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] &quot;Although [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|(Pierre Joseph) Proudhon]] was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was [[Gerrard Winstanley]] (1609-c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving.

In 1649–1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods. The communities failed, but a series of pamphlets by Winstanley survived, of which ''The New Law of Righteousness'' (1649) was the most important. Advocating a rational Christianity, Winstanley equated Christ with “the universal liberty” and declared the universally corrupting nature of authority. He saw “an equal privilege to share in the blessing of liberty” and detected an intimate link between the institution of property and the lack of freedom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary1&quot;&gt;[[George Woodcock]] [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/George_Woodcock__Anarchism.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;]. ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was [[Thomas Muenzer]]; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in the Digger movement. The concepts held by Muenzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time — a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Muenzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Lewis_Herber__Murray_Bookchin___Ecology_and_Revolutionary_Thought.html Lewis Herber.

Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; For Woodcock a more elaborate sketch of anarchism, although still without the name, was provided by [[William Godwin]] in his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' (1793). Godwin was a gradualist anarchist rather than a revolutionary anarchist; he differed from most later anarchists in preferring above revolutionary action the gradual and, as it seemed to him, more natural process of discussion among men of good will, by which he hoped truth would eventually triumph through its own power. Godwin, who was influenced by the English tradition of Dissent and the French philosophy of the Enlightenment, put forward in a developed form the basic anarchist criticisms of the state, of accumulated property, and of the delegation of authority through democratic procedure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary1&quot;/&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], [[Sylvain Maréchal]], in his ''Manifesto of the Equals'' (1796), demanded &quot;the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earth&quot; and looked forward to the disappearance of &quot;the revolting distinction of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham-2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;graham2005-v1&quot;/&gt; The term &quot;anarchist&quot; first entered the English language in 1642, during the [[English Civil War]], as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=BBC-Anarchism/&gt; By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''[[Enragés]]'', began to use the term positively,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean.

[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Charles Fourier]]]]
Kent Bromley, in his preface to [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', considered early French socialist [[Charles Fourier]] to be the founder of the libertarian branch of [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as opposed to the authoritarian socialist ideas of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]] and [[Philippe Buonarroti|Buonarroti]].&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. ''The Conquest of Bread'', preface by Kent Bromley, New York and London, G. P.

America, Mexico, S. America, Algeria, Yugoslavia, etc. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Peter Kropotkin]] all read him with fascination, as did [[André Breton]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hakim Bey]] (1991) [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html &quot;The Lemonade Ocean &amp; Modern Times&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist Peter Sabatini reports that in the United States &quot;of early to mid-19th century, there appeared an array of communal
and &quot;utopian&quot; counterculture groups (including the
so-called [[free love]] movement). [[William Godwin]]'s anarchism exerted an ideological influence on some of this, but
more so the socialism of [[Robert Owen]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. After success of his British venture, Owen himself
established a cooperative community within the United
States at [[New Harmony, Indiana]] during 1825. One member of
this commune was [[Josiah Warren]] (1798–1874), considered to be
the first [[individualist anarchist]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini. &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot;]. Theanarchistlibrary.org (2009-12-03). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
As [[Albert Meltzer]] and [[Stuart Christie]] stated in their book ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'', anarchism has:

{{Block quote|...its particular inheritance, part of which it shares with socialism, giving it a [[family resemblance]] to certain of its enemies. Another part of its inheritance it shares with [[liberalism]], making it, at birth, kissing-cousins with American-type radical [[individualism]], a large part of which has married out of the family into the [[Right Wing]] and is no longer on speaking terms. (''The Floodgates of Anarchy'', 1970, page 39.)}}
[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], who is often considered the father of modern anarchism, coined the phrase &quot;[[Property is theft]]&quot; to describe part of his view on the complex nature of ownership in relation to freedom. When he said property is theft, he was referring to the capitalist who he believed stole profit from laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was &quot;subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://fair-use.org/p-j-proudhon/general-idea-of-the-revolution/organization-of-economic-forces#s3p5 General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'' (1851), Sixth Study, § 3 ¶ 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Peter Kropotkin]], main theorist of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
Seventeen years (1857) after Proudhon first called himself an anarchist (1840), [[anarchist communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] was the first person to describe himself as a libertarian.&lt;ref name=&quot;dejacque&quot;&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J.

Back in the United States, [[Henry George]] spearheaded the [[Single Tax]] Movement, which sought socialism via progressive taxation, with tax only on natural resources. This might be seen as a predecessor to libertarian socialism trends there.

Libertarian socialism has its roots in both classical liberalism and socialism, though it is often in conflict with liberalism (especially [[neoliberalism]] and [[right-libertarianism]]) and authoritarian [[State socialism]] simultaneously. While libertarian socialism has roots in both socialism and liberalism, different forms have different levels of influence from the two traditions. For instance [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] anarchism is more influenced by liberalism while [[Communist anarchism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]] anarchism are more influenced by socialism. It is interesting to note, however, that mutualist anarchism has its origins in 18th and 19th century European socialism (such as [[Charles Fourier|Fourierian socialism]])&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ricardian Socialism&quot;. The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought. 1987. p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; while communist and syndicalist anarchism has its earliest origins in early 18th century liberalism (such as the [[French Revolution]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;graham2005-v1&quot;&gt;[[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]].

Anarchism posed an early challenge to the vanguardism and statism it detected in important sectors of the socialist movement. As such &quot;The consequences of the growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the anarchists, would be de-radicalism and em[[bourgeoisie]]ment. Further, state politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response, many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or by championing organisation by a single, similtaneously economic and political administrative unit (Ruhle, Syndicalism). The power of the intellectual and of science were also rejected by many anarchists: “In conquering the state, in exalting the role of parties, they [intellectuals] reinforce the hierarchical principle embodied in political and administrative institutions”.[47] Revolutions could only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious instincts of the masses (the “instinct for freedom” (Bakunin, Chomsky)). Thus, in Bakunin’s words: “All that individuals can do is to clarify, propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct”.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;'Advance Without Authority'&quot;&gt;&quot;The [http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm 'Advance Without Authority']: Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism and Intellectuals&quot; by Chamsy Ojeili, ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' vol.7, no.3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxism===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[William Morris]], early english [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian marxist]]]]Marxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. &quot;One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|(William) Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;'Advance Without Authority'&quot;/&gt; Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners, in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, [[anarchism|anarchists]] began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer, pg. 256&quot;&gt;Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, pg. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887 marked the change, with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring that &quot;This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; pg. 538, fn. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris played peacemaker but sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].

However, &quot;the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers’ councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses.&quot; For these socialists, “The intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius”. Luxemburg’s workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period – [[Anton Pannekoek|Pannekoek]], Roland Holst, and [[Herman Gorter|Gorter]] in Holland, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]] in Italy, [[György Lukács|Lukacs]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the dictatorship of the proletariat was to be the dictatorship of a class, “not of a party or of a clique”.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Advance Without Authority'&quot;/&gt; However within this line of thought &quot;The tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity...The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and [[György Lukács|Lukacs]]...The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Advance Without Authority'&quot;/&gt;

In the emerging Soviet state there appeared [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolshevik]]s led or supported by left wing groups including [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],&lt;ref name=&quot;carr1985&quot;&gt;Carr, E.H. – The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–1923. W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], [[Mensheviks]], and [[anarchists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;avrich1968&quot;&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. &quot;Russian Anarchists and the Civil War&quot;, ''Russian Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 296–306. [[Blackwell Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force.

For &quot;many Marxian libertarian socialists, the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return “behind Marx” to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy... [[Karl Korsch]]... remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory’s truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx’s Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes. &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Advance Without Authority'&quot;/&gt;

In rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian socialists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of [[Marxism]]. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and [[council communism]] have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement.

Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time, as in the [[Spanish Civil War]], though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and [[Leninism|Leninist]] Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. In recent history, however, libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with Marxist-Leninist groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both reject.

Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the ''[[First International]]'', a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where [[Mikhail Bakunin]], who was fairly representative of anarchist views, and [[Karl Marx]], whom anarchists accused of being an &quot;authoritarian&quot;, came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call &quot;authoritarian communists&quot;, or alternatively just &quot;authoritarians&quot;.

Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]], and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the [[council communism]] of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm Notes on Anarchism]&lt;/ref&gt; he suggests the possibility &quot;that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy.&quot;

In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) since 1967, the terms [[Ultra leftism|Ultra-Left]] and left communist refers to political theory and practice self-defined as further &quot;[[Left-wing politics|left]]&quot; than that of the central [[Maoist]] leaders at the height of the GPCR (&quot;[[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]]&quot;). The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term &quot;ultra-left&quot; more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further &quot;left&quot; than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as &quot;ultra-left&quot; the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. &quot;Ultra-Left&quot; refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central [[Maoist]] line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and &quot;peasants&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Peasant (农民)&quot; was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s. According to the Ultra-Left, both peasants and (urban) workers together composed a [[proletarian]] [[Social class|class]] divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution.&lt;/ref&gt; conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the Party's mediation, the Ultra-Left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however &quot;red&quot; a given bureaucrat's &quot;thought&quot; might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary &quot;ideas&quot; and &quot;habits&quot; among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to &quot;turn over a new leaf&quot; after they had undergone &quot;[[thought reform]],&quot; the Ultra-Left argued that &quot;cultural revolution&quot; had to give way to &quot;political revolution&quot; – &quot;in which one class overthrows another class&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm &quot;Whither China?&quot;] by Yang Xiguang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 70s Collective, ed. 1996. ''China: The Revolution is Dead, Long Live the Revolution''. Montreal: Black Rose Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 french [[platformist]] anarcho-communist [[Daniel Guerin]] published an essay called &quot;Libertarian Marxism?&quot; in which he dealt with the debate between Karl Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] at the [[First International]] and afterwards he suggested that &quot;Libertarian marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greator place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the ‘elites’; libertarian marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy ‘scientific’ apparatus, doesn’t equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Libertarian_Marxism_.html Libertarian Marxism? by [[Daniel Guerin]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autonomist Marxism]], [[Neo-Marxism]] and [[Situationist International|Situationist theory]] are also regarded as being [[anti-authoritarian]] variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition.

==Notable libertarian socialist tendencies==

=== Classical anarchist tendencies ===
In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post-classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid-20th century and after.

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|right|thumb|Proudhon and his children, by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1865).]]

Mutualism is a political and economic theory largely associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Proudhon argued that &quot;all capital, whether material or mental, being the result of collective labour, is, in consequence, collective property.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'What is Property?'&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that artisans would manage the tools required for their own work while, in large scale enterprises, this meant replacing wage labour by workers' co-operatives. He argued &quot;it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers... because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two... castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The General Idea of the revolution'' Freedom Press (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it in 1848:

&quot;Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality.... We are socialists... under universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is ''social'' ownership... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers' associations... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'Oeuvres Complètes' (Lacroix edition), volume 17, pp. 188–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualists believe that a free labor market would allow for conditions of equal income in proportion to exerted labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tandy-96&quot;&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10, 15, 19 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer) ISBN 1-4196-5869-7.&lt;/ref&gt; As Jonathan Beecher puts it, Proudhon's aim was to, &quot;emancipate labor from the constraints imposed by capital&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beecher |first=Jonathan F. |title=Victor Considerant and the Rise and Fall of French Romantic Socialism |year=2001 |page=155 |publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-22297-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon supported individual possession of land and argued that the &quot;land is indispensable to our existence, consequently a common thing, consequently insusceptible of appropriation.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He believed that an individual only had a right to land while he was using or occupying it. If the individual ceases doing so, it reverts to unowned land.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists hold a [[labor theory of value]], arguing that in exchange labor should always be worth &quot;the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tandy-96&quot;&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and considering anything less to be exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]].

Mutualists oppose the institutions by which individuals gain income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe the income received through these activities is not in direct accord with labor spent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tandy-96&quot;&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer) ISBN 1-4196-5869-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In place of these capitalist institutions they advocate [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations.&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, pp. 110, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists advocate mutual banks, owned by the workers, that do not charge interest on secured loans. Most mutualists believe that anarchy should be achieved gradually rather than through revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutualist.org/ Free Market Anti-Capitalism]. Mutualist.Org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Worker cooperative]]s such as the [[Mondragón Cooperative Corporation]] follow an economic model similar to that of mutualism. The model followed by the corporation [[WL Gore and Associates]], inventor of [[Gore-Tex]] fabrics, is also similar to mutualism as there is no chain of command and salaries are determined collectively by the workers.

[[G.D.H. Cole]]'s [[guild socialism]] was similar to mutualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wyatt | first1 = C | title = A recipe for a cookshop of the future: G. D. H. Cole and the conundrum of sovereignty |page=93| url = http://www.cseweb.org.uk/pdfs/CC90/5.%20Wyatt.pdf | journal = Capital and Class | volume = 30|doi=10.1177/030981680609000106 |issue=3| year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, mutualism's stress on worker association is similar to the more developed modern theory of [[participatory economics]], although participatory economists do not believe in markets. 

Mutualist anarchist ideas continue to have influence today, even if indirectly. Many modern day [[workers' cooperative|cooperatives]] are influenced directly or indirectly by economic mutualism that became popular in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aia.mahost.org/pro_coop.html Anarchism In Action: Cooperatives]. Aia.mahost.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary mutualist theorist who is the author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html [[Kevin Carson]]. ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[individualist anarchists]], such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], were influenced by Proudhon's Mutualism, but unlike Proudhon, they did not call for &quot;association&quot; in large enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collectivist anarchism ====
{{Main| Collectivist anarchism}}
[[File:Bakunin.png|upright|thumb|left|[[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]
Collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary&lt;ref name=&quot;Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54&quot;&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; doctrine that advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.

For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production&lt;ref name=&quot;Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54&quot;/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin Mikail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished, and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods &quot;to each according to his need.&quot; Thus, Bakunin's &quot;Collectivist Anarchism&quot;, notwithstanding the title, is seen as a blend of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]], the [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the [[First International]], and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of [[anarchism]] which advocates the abolition of the state, markets, money, capitalism and private property (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;/&gt; in favor of [[common ownership]] of the means of production,&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Communist+anarchism+belives+in+collective+ownership |title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms Alan James Mayne Published 1999 Greenwood Publishing Group 316 pages ISBN 0-275-96151-6 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&amp;pg=PA14 |title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing|year=2008|accessdate=20 September 2010|isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: &quot;[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fabbri, Luigi. &quot;Anarchism and Communism.&quot; Northeastern Anarchist #4. 1922. 13 October 2002. http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/worldwidemovements/fabbrianarandcom.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Makhno, Mett, Arshinov, Valevski, Linski (Dielo Trouda). &quot;The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists&quot;. 1926.

Some forms of anarchist communism, such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]], are strongly influenced by [[egoist anarchism|egoism]] and radical [[individualism]], believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;creativenothing&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html &quot;Towards the creative Nothing&quot; by [[Renzo Novatore]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bobblack&quot;&gt;[[Post-left anarchy|Post-left]] anarcho-communist [[Bob Black]] after analysing [[Insurrectionary anarchism|insurrectionary]] anarcho-communist [[Luigi Galleani]]'s view on anarcho-communism went as far as saying that &quot;communism is the final fulfillment of individualism.... The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both.... Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of “emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,”... You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a “method of individualization.” It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Nightmares_of_Reason.html#toc22 Bob Black. ''Nightmares of Reason''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Modern Communists are more individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name the individual is enslaved – and how enslaved!...Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand – that leads to the dissolution of property, to expropriation.

{{Anarcho-communism}}
To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (ie, established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This process of education and class organization, more than any single factor in Spain, produced the collectives. And to the degree that the CNT-FAI (for the two organizations became fatally coupled after July 1936) exercised the major influence in an area, the collectives proved to be generally more durable, communist and resistant to Stalinist counterrevolution than other republican-held areas of Spain.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Murray_Bookchin__To_Remember_Spain__The_Anarchist_and_Syndicalist_Revolution_of_1936.html [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Free Territory]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Spanish Anarchists]] during the [[Spanish Revolution]] within the [[Spanish Civil War]], starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, and in the stronghold of [[Anarchist Catalonia]] before being crushed by the combined forces of [[Francoism]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Murray_Bookchin__To_Remember_Spain__The_Anarchist_and_Syndicalist_Revolution_of_1936.html [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936'']&lt;/ref&gt; During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked to create and defend—through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]—anarchist communism in the [[Free Territory]] of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.

Anarcho-communist currents include [[platformism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]. The anarchist-communist tradition continues today, for instance in the work of [[L. Susan Brown]]. Brown's conception of libertarian socialists is that all social bonds should be developed by individuals who have an equal amount of bargaining power, that an accumulation of economic power in the hands of a few and the centralization of political power both reduce the bargaining power—and thus the liberty of the other individuals in society.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. Susan. 'The Politics of Individualism' Black Rose Books (2003) p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within individualist anarchism ====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and his or her [[will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first American [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', was the first anarchist periodical published.&lt;ref name=&quot;bailie20&quot;&gt;William Bailie, [http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf] ''Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist &amp;mdash; A Sociological Study'', Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1906, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster &quot;It is apparent...that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]...[[William B.

While not against the market and property he was firmly against capitalism as it was, in his eyes, a state-supported monopoly of social capital (tools, machinery, etc.) which allows owners to exploit their employees, i.e., to avoid paying workers the full value of their labour. He thought that the &quot;labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit.&quot;... Therefore &quot;''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product.&quot;...This stance puts him squarely in the libertarian socialist tradition and, unsurprisingly, Tucker referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be &quot;Anarchistic socialism.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG5 &quot;Benjamin Tucker: Capitalist or Anarchist&quot;] in ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''by Various Authors&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]] shows clearly opposition to capitalism and centralized economies when he said that the individualist anarchist &quot;inwardly he remains refractory – fatally refractory – morally, intellectually, economically (The capitalist economy and the directed economy, the speculators and the fabricators of single are equally repugnant to him.)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html &quot;Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity&quot; by Emile Armand]&lt;/ref&gt; The spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] thought that &quot;&quot;capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it [[State capitalism]] or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;el capitalismo es sólo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el
capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente.... Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo único que se cultiva es
la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea inútil, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado
o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existirá el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias,
es contra el Estado.&quot;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; His view on class division and [[technocracy]] are as follows &quot;Since when no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists.... The priority which without rest an anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to individual needs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;¿La propiedad? ¡Bah! No es problema. Porque cuando nadie trabaje para nadie, el acaparador de la riqueza desaparece, como ha de desaparecer el gobierno cuando nadie haga caso a los que aprendieron cuatro cosas en las universidades y por ese sólo hecho pretenden gobernar a los hombres. Porque si en la tierra de los ciegos el tuerto es rey, en donde todos ven y juzgan y disciernen, el rey estorba. Y de lo que se trata es de que no haya reyes porque todos sean hombres. Las grandes empresas industriales las transformarán los hombres en grandes asociaciones donde todos trabajen y disfruten del producto de su trabajo. Y de esos tan sencillos como hermosos problemas trata el anarquismo y al que lo cumple y vive es al que se le llama anarquista...El hincapié que sin cansancio debe hacer el anarquista es el de que nadie debe explotar a nadie, ningún hombre a ningún hombre, porque esa no-explotación llevaría consigo la limitación de la propiedad a las necesidades individuales.&quot;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]], famous anarchist [[Irish people|Irish]] writer who published the libertarian socialist work titled ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'']]The [[anarchist]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one &quot;of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience&quot; and talked of him as &quot;a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.&quot; But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.&quot; [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (pg. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; writer and [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that &quot;Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html The soul of man under Socialism by [[Oscar Wilde]]]&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] &quot;Wilde's aim in ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist... for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated.... Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (pg. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents; &quot;each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society.&quot; Wilde added that &quot;upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to [[individualism]]&quot; since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments &quot;armed with economic power as they are now with political power&quot; over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism: &quot;of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type&quot; a critique which is &quot;quite true.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Soul of Man&quot;&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde The Soul of Man]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way socialism, in Wilde's imagination, would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring &quot;The new individualism is the new hellenism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Soul of Man&quot;/&gt;

====Anarcho-syndicalism====
{{Main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[labor union|labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labor unions]] as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are:
:# Workers' [[Wiktionary:Solidarity|solidarity]]
:# [[Direct action]]
:# [[Workers' self-management]]
[[Image:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|[[May day]] demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in 2010. The red and black flag is often used by anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists]]
Workers' solidarity means that anarcho-syndicalists believe all workers—no matter their race, gender, or ethnic group—are in a similar situation in regard to their [[Wiktionary:Boss|boss]] ([[class consciousness]]). Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]].

Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.

[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''.

The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

=== Libertarian Marxist tendencies ===
{{Main|Libertarian Marxism}}
Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of [[Marxism]]. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]],&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Wayne.[http://www.utopianmag.com/files/in/1000000034/12___WayneLibMarx.pdf &quot;Libertarian Marxism's Relation to Anarchism&quot;] &quot;The Utopian&quot; 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives, such as [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and [[Trotskyism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marot, Eric. [http://libcom.org/library/trotsky-left-opposition-rise-stalinism-theory-practice-john-eric-marot &quot;Trotsky, the Left Opposition and the Rise of Stalinism: Theory and Practice&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism is also critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/social-democracy-1-aufheben-8 &quot;The Retreat of Social Democracy ... Re-imposition of Work in Britain and the 'Social Europe'&quot;] &quot;Aufheben&quot; Issue #8 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal. [https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333&quot;The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels&quot;] &quot;The Socialist Register.&quot; Vol 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[anarchism]], Libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. [http://chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3 &quot;Government In The Future&quot;] Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as [[Luxemburgism]], [[council communism]], [[left communism]], ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'', the [[Johnson–Forest tendency]], [[world socialism]], [[Lettrism]]/[[Situationist International|Situationism]] and [[operaismo]]/[[autonomism]], and [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map A libertarian Marxist tendency map]. libcom.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Guérin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].

====De Leonism====
{{Main|De Leonism}}
De Leonism, occasionally known as Marxism-Deleonism, is a form of [[syndicalist]] Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]]. De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] (specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. Industrial Unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in [[anarcho-syndicalism]] is that, according to De Leonist thinking, a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field.

De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the [[Socialist Labor Party]]; Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's &quot;[[What Is to Be Done?]]&quot;.

The highly [[decentralized]] and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other &quot;communist&quot; states. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.

====Council communism====
{{Main|Council Communism}}
Council communism was a radical [[left-wing politics|Left]] movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism, and also within libertarian socialism. The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of [[Social democracy]] and [[Leninism|Leninist]] communism, is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and [[Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]], parliaments, or the state.
[[File:Antonie Pannekoek.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Antonie Pannekoek]], theorist of [[council communism]]]]
The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run &quot;bureaucratic socialism&quot;. They also oppose the idea of a &quot;revolutionary party&quot;, since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.

The [[Russian language|Russian]] word for council is &quot;[[Soviet (council)|soviet]]&quot;, and during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] for various political organs. Indeed, the name &quot;[[Supreme Soviet]]&quot;, by which the parliament was called; and that of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any [[decentralization]].

Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution in Russia became a &quot;[[bourgeois]] revolution&quot; when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that, since capitalist relations still existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Thus, council communists support workers' revolutions, but oppose one-party dictatorships.

Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in elections or parliament, and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union.

====Left communism====
{{Main|Left communism}}
[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]Left communism' is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the [[Bolsheviks]] at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically [[Marxism|Marxist]] and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress.
{{Left communism sidebar}}
Left Communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as 'left of capital', not socialists), [[Anarchist Communism|Anarchists]] (some of whom they consider internationalist socialists) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances).

Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Amadeo Bordiga]], [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto Rühle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].

Prominent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the [[International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party]]. Also, different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are considered left communist organizations.

====Johnson–Forest tendency====
{{Main|Johnson–Forest Tendency}}
[[File:RD lecture2.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Raya Dunayevskaya]]]]The Johnson–Forest tendency, sometimes called the Johnsonites, refers to a radical left tendency in the United States associated with Marxist theorists [[C.L.R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], who used the pseudonyms J.R. Johnson and Freddie Forest respectively. They were joined by [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese-American woman who was considered the third founder.

====''Socialisme ou Barbarie''====
{{Main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}
[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], libertarian socialist theorist]]''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' (Socialism or Barbarism) was a French-based radical [[libertarian socialist]] group of the post-[[World War II]] period (the name comes from a phrase [[Friedrich Engels]] used, and was cited by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in a 1916 essay, 'The Junius Pamphlet'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;). It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dick Howard | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised spontaneism...(for) Cornelius Castoriadis the emancipation of the mass of people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not simply fold his or her arms. Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he rejected ''attentisme'', maintaining that, in the struggle for a new society, intellectuals needed to “place themselves at a distance from the everyday and from the real”.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Advance Without Authority'&quot;/&gt;

====Situationist International====
{{Main|Situationist International}}
The Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957, and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]].

With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the [[capitalism|capitalist order]], for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the ''construction of situations'', namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. In this vein a major theorectical work which emerged from this group was [[Raoul Vaneigem]]´s ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/raoul-vaneigem-the-revolution-of-everyday-life [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Situationists}}
They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May '68 revolts, and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with [[direct democracy]], through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.

After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts, and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,&lt;ref name=&quot;SI12BeginningOfAnEra&quot;&gt;''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; the SI was dissolved in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=2001-06-01 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autonomism====
{{Main|Autonomism}}
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of Italian autonomism]]Autonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]], [[Franco Berardi]] &quot;Bifo&quot; etc.

Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a &quot;bottom up&quot; theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.

Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].

It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.

The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].

=== Other tendencies ===
This section is dedicated to post-classical anarchist tendencies as well as tendencies which cannot be easily classified within the anarchist/marxist division presented before.

==== Guild socialism ====
{{Main|Guild socialism}}
Guild socialism is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guilds]] &quot;in an implied contractual relationship with the public&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism &quot;Guild Socialism&quot;.  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the [[United Kingdom]] and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; It was strongly associated with [[G. D. H. Cole]] and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].
[[File:George-douglas-howard-cole.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[G. D. H. Cole]]]]
Guild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. 

The Guild Socialists &quot;stood for state ownership of industry, combined with “workers’ control” through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers’ guilds, consumers’ organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

In 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson|S. G. Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Guilds, unlike the existing trade unions, would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920).

==== Revolutionary syndicalism ====
{{Main|Syndicalism}}
Revolutionary syndicalism is a type of [[economic system]] proposed as a replacement for [[capitalism]] and an alternative to [[state socialism]], which uses [[Federation (disambiguation)|federations]] of collectivised [[trade unions]] or [[industrial unions]].   It is a form of [[Socialism|socialist]] economic [[corporatism]] that advocates interest aggregation of multiple non-competitive categorised units to negotiate and manage an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. ''Corporatism and comparative politics''. M.E. Sharpe, 1996. pp. 65–66, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; For adherents, labour unions are the potential means of both overcoming economic [[aristocracy]] and running [[society]] fairly in the interest of the majority, through [[union democracy]]. Industry in a syndicalist system would be run through [[co-operative economics|co-operative]] confederations and [[Mutual aid (politics)|mutual aid]]. Local syndicates would communicate with other syndicates through the [[Bourse du Travail]] (labor exchange) which would manage and transfer [[Commodity|commodities]]. 
{{Syndicalism sidebar}}
Syndicalism is also used to refer to the tactic of bringing about this social arrangement, typically expounded by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[De Leonism]], in which a general strike begins and workers seize their means of production and organise in a federation of trade unionism, such as the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]].&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Syndcicalism'', Brown, Tom. Retrieved July 06, 2010: http://libcom.org/library/principles-of-syndicalism-tom-brown&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, the reformist section of syndicalism has been overshadowed by its revolutionary section, typified by the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (CGT) in [[France]], [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]], the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] section of the CNT.,&lt;ref&gt;info on the FAI http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/f/10748453.php&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]] and the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] (SAC).

==== Gandhism ====
{{Main|Gandhism|Gandhian economics}}
[[File:MKGandhi.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]]]Gandhism is the collection of inspirations, principles, beliefs and philosophy of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] (known as Mahatma Gandhi), who was a major political and spiritual leader of [[India]] and the [[Indian Independence Movement]]. It is a body of ideas and principles that describes the inspiration, vision and the life work of Gandhi. It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. Gandhi's ideas are also influential in [[anarcho-pacifism]]. Gandhian economics are the [[socio-economic]] principles expounded by Mohandas Gandhi. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term &quot;Gandhian economics&quot; was coined by [[J. C. Kumarappa]], a close supporter of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumarappa|first=Joseph Cornelius|title=Gandhian economic thought|publisher=Vora|location=Bombay, India|year=1951|edition=1st|series=Library of Indian economics|oclc=3529600|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3529600?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all economic spheres. In order to achieve this means he advocated [[Trusteeship (Gandhism)|trusteeship]], [[decentralization]] of economic activities, labour intensive technology and priority to weaker sections.

Gandhian activists such as [[Vinoba Bhave]] and [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] were involved in the ''[[Sarvodaya]]'' movement, which sought to promote self-sufficiency amidst India's rural population by encouraging [[land redistribution]], socio-economic reforms and promoting [[cottage industries]]. The movement sought to combat the problems of class conflict, unemployment and poverty while attempting to preserve the lifestyle and values of rural Indians, which were eroding with [[industrialisation]] and modernisation. ''Sarvodaya'' also included ''[[Bhoodan]]'', or the gifting of land and agricultural resources by the landlords (called ''[[zamindar]]s'') to their tenant farmers in a bid to end the medieval system of ''zamindari''.

==== Platformism ====
{{Main|Platformism}}
Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of [[Dielo Truda]]'s ''Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''.&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda group |authorlink=Dielo Trouda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The document was based on the experiences of [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]], which led eventually to the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Today there are platformist groups in many countries including:
* the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland,
* [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] (NEFAC, or ''Fédération des Communistes Libertaires du Nord-Est'') in the northeastern USA,
* the ''[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Communiste_Libertaire|Union Communiste Libertaire]'' in [[Quebec]],
* Common Cause in [[Ontario]],
*the ''[[Organización Comunista Libertaria]]'' (OCL) in [[Chile]],
*the [[Federation of Anarchists of Greece]] (OAE) in [[Greece]],
*''[[Anarchist Communist Initiative]]'' (AKI) in [[Turkey]],
*''[[Organizacion Socialista Libertaria]]'' (OSL) in [[Argentina]],
*the ''[[Federazione dei Comunisti Anarchici]]'' (FdCA) in Italy,
*the ''[[Coletivo pró Organização Anarquista em Goiás]]'' in [[Brazil]],
*''[[Grupo Qhispikay Llaqta]]'' in [[Peru]],
*the [[Libertarian Communist Organization (France)]] in France,
*the ''[[Alianza de los Comunistas Libertarios]]'' (ACL) in [[Mexico]],
* Melbourne Anarchist Communist Group (MACG) and [[Sydney Anarchist Communist Trajectory]] (SACT) in [[Australia]],
*the [[Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front]] (ZACF) in [[South Africa]], and
* Revolutionary Confederation of Anarcho-syndicalists (RKAS) by the name of N.I. Makhno (Революционная конфедерация анархо-синдикалистов им. Н. И. Махно) – an international anarcho-syndicalist, platformist confederation (sections and individual members of RKAS exist in Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Germany, Latvia, Bulgaria and Israel){{citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

Platfomist organizations also founded the now defunct [[International Libertarian Solidarity]]. The website [[Anarkismo.net]] is run collaboratively by Platformist organisations from all over the world.

====Within the New Left====
{{Main|New Left}}
[[File:Herbert Marcuse in Newton, Massachusetts 1955.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|[[Herbert Marcuse]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], was an influential libertarian socialist&lt;ref&gt;&quot;During the 1960s, Marcuse achieved world renown as &quot;the guru of the New Left,&quot; publishing many articles and giving lectures and advice to student radicals all over the world. He travelled widely and his work was often discussed in the mass media, becoming one of the few American intellectuals to gain such attention. Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism.&quot; Douglas Kellner [http://www.uta.edu/english/dab/illuminations/kell12.html &quot;Marcuse, Herbert&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher of the New Left&lt;ref name=kellner12&gt;Douglas Kellner [http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm Herbert arcuse]&lt;/ref&gt;]]The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hahnel]], ''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' Part II ISBN 0-415-93344-7&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left's critique of the [[Old Left]]'s authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in personal liberty, [[autonomy]] (see the thinking of [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) and led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as [[left communism]], [[council communism]], and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like ''Radical America'' and ''[[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'' in America, ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'', ''[[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]]'' and ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'', succeeded by ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy].

[[Social ecology]], [[autonomism]] and, more recently, [[participatory economics]] (parecon), and [[Inclusive Democracy]] emerged from this. The New Left in the United States also included anarchist, [[countercultural]] and [[hippie]]-related radical groups such as the [[Yippies]] who were led by [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[The Diggers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1966, [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lytle_2006_213215&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Digger Archives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;American Experience doc&quot;&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the Yippies employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a pig (&quot;[[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]] the Immortal&quot;) as a candidate for President in 1968, to mock the social status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101355/pg_2 | work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture | title=Yippies | first=David | last=Holloway | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as a highly theatrical, [[anti-authoritarian]] and anarchist&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbie Hoffman page 128&quot;&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 128.

====Social ecology and Communalism====
{{Main|Social ecology}}
{{Main|Communalism (Political Philosophy)}}
[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Murray Bookchin]]]]Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]] and influenced by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Social ecologists assert that the present [[ecological crisis]] has its roots in human social problems, and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |title=The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism |year=1994 |pages=119–120 |publisher=Black Rose Books|isbn=978-1-55164-018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called &quot;Communalism&quot; (spelled with a capital &quot;C&quot; to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of [[Social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism, and radical ecology.

Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called [[Libertarian Municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics -especially municipal elections- as long as candidates are [[libertarian socialist]] and anti-statist in outlook.

Economically, Communalism favours the abolition of markets and money and the transition to an economy similar to [[libertarian communism]] and according to the principle &quot;from each according to ability, to each according to need.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====Participism====
{{Main|Participism}}
[[File:NLN Michael Albert.jpg|left|thumb|[[Michael Albert]]]]
[[Participism]] is a twenty-first century form of libertarian socialism. It comprises two related economic and political systems called [[Participatory economics]] or &quot;Parecon&quot; and [[Participatory politics]] or &quot;Parpolity&quot;.

Parecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]], among others. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as &quot;an anarchistic economic vision&quot;, and it could be considered a form of socialism as under Parecon, the means of production are owned by the workers.

The underlying values that Parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, workers' self-management and efficiency. (Efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets.) It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions:
Workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice, and Participatory Planning.

Under Parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable &quot;credit&quot; which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.

Parpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany Parecon.

The values on which Parpolity is based are: Freedom, self-management, justice, solidarity and tolerance.

The goal, according to Shalom, is to create a political system that will allow people to participate, as much as possible in a face to face manner. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and [[capitalism]] arguing that the level of political control by the people isn’t sufficient. To address this problem Parpolity suggests a system of &quot;Nested Councils&quot;, which would include every adult member of a given society. With five levels of nested councils it is thought, could represent the population of the United States.

Under [[Participism]], the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.

====Inclusive Democracy====
{{Main|Inclusive Democracy}}
Inclusive Democracy is a political theory and political project that aim for [[direct democracy]], [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm) and ecological democracy. The theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy (ID)), as distinguished from the political project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.

According to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' &quot;offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 &quot;Beyond Social Democracy? Takis Fotopoulos' Vision of an Inclusive Democracy as a New Liberatory Project&quot;] ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003), pp. 345–358(14)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as David Freeman points out, although Fotopoulos' approach &quot;is not openly anarchism, yet anarchism seems the formal category within which he works, given his commitment to direct democracy, municipalism and abolition of state, money and market economy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Freeman, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol1/vol1_no3_freeman.htm &quot;Inclusive democracy and its prospects&quot;] review of book ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy: The Crisis of the Growth Economy and the Need For a New Liberatory Project'', published in ''Thesis Eleven'', Sage Publications, no. 69 (May 2002), pp. 103–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insurrectionary anarchism ====
{{Main|Insurrectionary anarchism}}
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes the theme of [[insurrection]] within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small [[affinity group]] based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]], and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.

Contemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php &quot;Say you want an insurrection&quot; by [[Crimethinc]]. Crimethinc.com (2001-04-21). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[illegalism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Some insurrectionists see precedents in the propaganda of the deed carried out by Nineteenth-century assassins and the illegalism associated with Jules Bonnot and his fellow bank robbers. We can trace the lineage of current insurrectionist theory from Errico Malatesta and Luigi Galleani&quot;[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php &quot;Say you want an insurrection&quot; by [[Crimethinc]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Within the labour movement and parliamentary politics====
There was a strong left-libertarian current in the British [[labour movement]] and the term ''libertarian socialist'' has been applied to a number of [[democratic socialist]]s, including some prominent members of the [[British Labour Party]]. The [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] was formed in 1885 by [[William Morris]] and others critical of the authoritarian socialism of the [[Social Democratic Federation]]. It was involved in the [[New Unionism]], the rank and file union militancy of the 1880s–90s, which anticipated [[syndicalism]] in some key ways ([[Tom Mann]], a New Unionist leader, was one of the first British syndicalists). The Socialist League was dominated by anarchists by the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;John Quail, ''The Slow-Burning Fuse'' Paladin, 1978 ISBN 0-586-08225-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Labour Party]], formed at that time, drew more on the [[Non-Conformist]] religious traditions in the British working class than on Marxist theory, and had a libertarian socialist strain. Others in the tradition of the ILP, and described as libertarian socialists, have been [[Nye Bevan]], [[Michael Foot]] and most importantly, [[G. D. H. Cole]]. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] minister [[Peter Hain]] has written in support of libertarian socialism, identifying an axis involving a &quot;bottom-up vision of socialism, with anarchists at the [[revolutionary]] end and democratic socialists [such as himself] at its [[reformism|reformist]] end&quot;, as opposed to the axis of [[state socialism]] with Marxist-Leninists at the revolutionary end and social democrats at the reformist end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hain |first=Peter |title=Ayes to the Left: A Future for Socialism |year=1995 |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart|isbn=978-0-85315-832-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent mainstream Labour politician who has been described as a libertarian socialist is [[Robin Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] said in 2005 that in recent years Cook had been setting out a vision of &quot;libertarian, democratic socialism that was beginning to break the sometimes sterile boundaries of 'old' and 'New' Labour labels.&quot;.{{cite news|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article304442.ece |title=Chris Smith: The House of Commons was Robin Cook's true home – Commentators, Opinion – Independent.co.uk |publisher=Comment.independent.co.uk |date=2005-08-08 |accessdate=2009-06-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in this way, libertarian socialism in the contemporary political mainstream is distinguished from modern social democracy and democratic socialism principally by its political [[Decentralization|decentralism]] rather than by its economics. The multi-tendency [[Socialist Party USA]] also has a strong libertarian socialist current.

[[Katja Kipping]] and [[Julia Bonk]] in Germany, [[Femke Halsema]]&lt;ref name=&quot;vrijzinnig&quot;&gt;&quot;Following Isaiah Berlin, Halsema distinguishes between positive and negative freedom. Negative freedom is according to Halsema the freedom citizens from government influence; she applies this concept especially to the multicultural society and the rechtsstaat, where the government should protect the rights of citizens and not limit them. Positive freedom is the emancipation of citizens from poverty and discrimination. Halsema wants to apply this concept to welfare state and the environment where government should take more action. According to Halsema, GreenLeft is undogmatic party, that has anarchist tendencies.&quot;{{citation

==== Communization ====
{{Main|Communization}}
Communization mainly refers to a contemporary communist theory in which we find is a &quot;mixing-up of [[insurrectionist anarchism]], the [[Left communism|communist ultra-left]], post[[Autonomism|autonomists]], anti-political currents, groups like [[The Coming Insurrection|the Invisible Committee]], as well as more explicitly ‘communizing’ currents, such as ''Théorie Communiste'' and ''Endnotes''. Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of the term communization with a self-identified &quot;[[ultra-left]]&quot; was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism but a vision of communist revolution itself. Thus the 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' states: “insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/world-without-money-les-amis-de-4-millions-de-jeunes-travailleurs &quot;A World Without Money&quot;] by Les amis de 4 millions de jeunes travailleurs. (quoted passage not included in this English extract)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauvé]] and ''Théorie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency. But in the late 1990s a close but not identical sense of &quot;communization&quot; was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with &quot;the revolution&quot; considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities – from squatting and setting up communes to simply &quot;sharing&quot; – that would typically be understood as &quot;pre-revolutionary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process.&quot; Anonymous, [http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf ''Call'']&lt;/ref&gt; From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of &quot;dropping-out&quot; or, as Tiqqun put it, &quot;desertion&quot; — setting up spaces and practices that are held to partially autonomous from capitalism — is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of &quot;communization&quot; see &quot;[http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call Reflexions Around Call]&quot; Letters Journal #3. See also Dauvé and Nesic, [http://troploin0.free.fr/ii/index.php/textes/19-communisation-un-appel-et-une-invite &quot;Un Appel et une Invite&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works ''Call'' and ''[[The Coming Insurrection]]'' in US anarchist circles it tended to be this latter sense of &quot;communization&quot; that was employed in US anarchist and &quot;[[insurrectionist]]&quot; communiques, notably within the [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|Californian student movement of 2009–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ &quot;After the Fall: Communiqués from Occupied California&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary libertarian socialism==
[[File:Wallst14occupy.jpg|right|thumb|The global [[Occupy movement]] is noted to have distinct libertarian socialist principles.]]
{{Main|Contemporary anarchism}}
A surge of popular interest in libertarian socialism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|1985|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism was influential in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/dnckhs &quot;These groups had their roots in the anarchist resurgence of the nineteen sixties. Young militants finding their way to anarchism, often from the anti-bomb and anti-Vietnam war movements, linked up with an earlier generation of activists, largely outside the ossified structures of ‘official’ anarchism. Anarchist tactics embraced demonstrations, direct action such as industrial militancy and squatting, protest bombings like those of the First of May Group and Angry Brigade – and a spree of publishing activity.&quot; &quot;Islands of Anarchy: Simian, Cienfuegos, Refract and their support network&quot; by John Patten]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Farrell provides a detailed history of the Catholic Workers and their founders Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin. He explains that their pacifism, anarchism, and commitment to the downtrodden were one of the important models and inspirations for the 60s. As Farrell puts it, &quot;Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade.&quot;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 &quot;The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism&quot; by James J. Farrell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;While not always formally recognized, much of the protest of the sixties was anarchist. Within the nascent women's movement, anarchist principles became so widespread that a political science professor denounced what she saw as &quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness.&quot; Several groups have called themselves &quot;Amazon Anarchists.&quot; After the [[Stonewall Rebellion]], the New York [[Gay Liberation Front]] based their organization in part on a reading of [[Murray Bookchin]]'s anarchist writings.&quot; [http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Anarchism.pdf &quot;Anarchism&quot; by Charley Shively in ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'']. pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and anarchists actively participated in the [[Protests of 1968|late sixties students and workers revolts]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Within the movements of the sixties there was much more receptivity to anarchism-in-fact than had existed in the movements of the thirties...But the movements of the sixties were driven by concerns that were more compatible with an expressive style of politics, with hostility to authority in general and state power in particular...By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement.&quot; [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 in [[Carrara]], Italy the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of [[Anarchist Federation (France)|France]], the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana|Italian]] and the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/ifa-hist-short.html Short history of the IAF-IFA] A-infos news project, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The uprisings of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] also led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading capitalist countries. A series of conferences of the communist left began in 1976, with the aim of promoting international and cross-tendency discussion, but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the movement or its unity of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.internationalism.org/ir/122_conferences]&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Party]], International Communist Current and the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]]. 

The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and [[Squatting|squatter]] movements like that of [[Barcelona]], Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the [[Freetown Christiania]], an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. 

Around the turn of the 21st century, libertarian socialism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{Cite book| page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7425-2943-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; For english anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]] &quot;contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]...One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon_Critchley#Infinitely_Demanding_.282007.29|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]]. [[Verso Books|Verso]]. 2007. pg. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT). CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]]; the CNT-AIT in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html%20Website%20of%20the%20Confédération%20Nationale%20du%20Travail%20-%20Association%20Internationale%20des%20Travailleurs http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html Website of the Confédération Nationale du Travail – Association Internationale des Travailleurs]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|Union Sindicale Italiana]] in Italy; in the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

Libertarian socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the [[alter-globalization]] movement, squatter movement; [[social centers]]; [[infoshop]]s; anti-poverty groups such as [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]] and [[Food Not Bombs]]; [[Leasehold estate|tenants']] unions; [[housing cooperative]]s; [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] generally and [[egalitarian communities]]; anti-[[sexist]] organizing; grassroots media initiatives; digital media and computer activism; experiments in [[participatory economics]]; [[anti-racist]] and [[anti-fascist]] groups like [[Anti-Racist Action]] and [[Anti-Fascist Action]]; activist groups protecting the rights of [[immigrant]]s and promoting the free movement of people, such as the [[No Border network]]; [[worker co-operative]]s, [[countercultural]] and artist groups; and the [[peace movement]] etc.

Libertarian socialism has also more recently played a large part in the global [[Occupy movement]], in particular its focus on direct [[participatory democracy]].
