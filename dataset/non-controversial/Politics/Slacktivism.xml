      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20784">'''Slacktivism''' (sometimes '''slactivism''' or '''slackervism''') is a portmanteau of the words ''[[slacker]]'' and ''[[activism]]''.  The word is usually considered a pejorative term that describes &quot;feel-good&quot; measures, in support of an issue or social cause, that have little or no practical effect other than to make the person doing it feel some amount of satisfaction. The acts tend to require minimal personal effort from the slacktivist. The underlying assumption being promoted by the term is that these low cost efforts substitute for more substantive actions rather than supplementing them, although this assumption has not been borne out by research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Jesse|title=Cause Marketing: Moving Beyond Corporate Slacktivism|url=http://evidencebasedmarketing.net/cause-marketing-moving-beyond-corporate-slacktivism|accessdate=22 November 2011|date=27|month=October|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Slacktivist activities include signing [[Internet petitions]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/internet.htm Snopes.com: Inboxer Rebellion (Internet Petitions)] - discusses '''slacktivism''' in some detail&lt;/ref&gt; joining a community organization without contributing to the organization's efforts, copying and pasting of [[Social Network]] statuses or messages or altering one's personal data or [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] on [[social network service]]s. Research is beginning to explore the connection between the concept and modern activism/advocacy, as groups are increasingly using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Advocacy 2.0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Obar|first=Jonathan, et al|title=Advocacy 2.0: An Analysis of How Advocacy Groups in the United States Perceive and Use Social Media as Tools for Facilitating Civic Engagement and Collective Action|journal=Journal of Information Policy|year=2012|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1956352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] describes the term &quot;slacktivist&quot;, saying it &quot;posits that people who support a cause by performing simple measures are not truly engaged or devoted to making a change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS, UNAIDS OUTLOOK REPORT, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of the Term ==
The term appears to have been coined by Dwight Ozard and Fred Clark in 1995 at the Cornerstone Festival. The term was meant to shorten the phrase slacker activism, which refers to bottom up activities by young people to affect society on a small, personal scale (such as planting a tree, as opposed to participating in a protest). The term originally had a positive connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Henrik|title=Political activities on the internet: slacktivism or political participation by other means?|journal=First Monday|year=2011|volume=16|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3336/2767|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio host and political commentator Dan Carlin was using the term on his show in the 1990s and may have coined the present day meaning.{{citation needed | date = April 2011}}

Monty Phan, staff writer for Newsday, was an early user of the term in his 2001 article titled, &quot;On the Net, &quot;Slacktivism' / Do-Gooders Flood In-Boxes&quot; (Phan 2001).

An early example of using the term &quot;slacktivism&quot; appeared in Barnaby Feder's article in ''The New York Times'' called &quot;They Weren't Careful What They Hoped For.&quot;  Feder quoted anti-scam crusader Barbara Mikkelson of [[Snopes.com]], who described activities such as those listed above.  &quot;It's all fed by slacktivism ... the desire people have to do something good without getting out of their chair&quot; (Feder 2002).

Another example of the term &quot;Slacktivism&quot; appeared in [[Evgeny Morozov]]’s book, &quot;Net Delusion: How Not To Liberate the World&quot;. In his book, Morozov relates slacktivism to the Colding-Jorgensen experiment: In 2009, a Danish psychologist named Colding Jorgensen created a fictitious Facebook group, as part of his research. On the page, he announced that the Copenhagen city authorities would be demolishing the historical Storck fountain site. 125 Facebook members joined the Jorgensen’s page within the first day, and the number of fans began to grow at a staggering rate, eventually reaching 27,500. Morozov argues the Colding-Jorgensen experiment reveals a key component of slacktivism: “When communication costs are low, groups can easily spring into action.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Morozov 2011 180&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=The net delusion : the dark side of Internet freedom|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clay Shirky]] also similarly characterized slacktivism as “ridiculously easy group forming.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Morozov 2011 180&quot;/&gt;

==Defense and criticism==

Despite the pejorative connotation of the term, a recent correlational study conducted by [[Georgetown University]] entitled “The Dynamics of Cause Engagement” determined that so-called slacktivists are indeed “more likely to take meaningful actions.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Andresen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Andresen|first=Katya|title=Why Slacktivism is Underrated|url=http://mashable.com/2011/10/24/slactivism-cause-engagement/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Notably, “slacktivists participate in more than twice as many activities as people who don’t engage in slacktivism, and their actions “have a higher potential to influence others.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Andresen&quot;/&gt;  Cited benefits of slacktivism in achieving clear objectives include creating a secure, low cost, effective means of organizing that are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leonard|first=Cindy|title=In Defense of &quot;Slacktivism&quot;|url=http://bayercenter.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/in-defense-of-slacktivism/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These &quot;social champions&quot; have the ability to directly link social media engagement with responsiveness, leveraging their transparent dialogue into economic, social or political action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis 2011&quot;/&gt;  

Yet skepticism of slacktivism’s value certainly exists.  Particularly, some argue that it entails an underlying assumption that all problems can be seamlessly fixed using social media, and while this may be true for local issues, slacktivism could prove ineffective for solving global predicaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=From Slacktivism to Activism|url=http://neteffect.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/09/05/from_slacktivism_to_activism|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In turn, organizationally speaking, slacktivism may result in a “waste of resources, lack of productivity and a risk of liability for the employer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Corporate Response to Slacktivism|url=http://www.ceridian.com/human_resources_article/1,6266,15760-70045,00.html|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 [[NPR]] piece asked whether &quot;the publicity gains gained through this greater reliance on new media [are] worth the organizational losses that traditional activists entities are likely to suffer, as ordinary people would begin to turn away from conventional (and proven) forms of activism.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=Foreign Policy: Brave New World Of Slacktivism|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104302141|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of slacktivism often involves the idea that internet activities are ineffective, and/or that they prevent or lessen political participation in real life. However, as many studies on slacktivism relate only to a specific case or campaign, it is difficult to find an exact percentage of slacktivist actions that reach a stated goal. Furthermore, many studies also focus on such activism in democratic or open contexts, whereas the act of publicly liking, RSVPing or adopting an avatar or slogan as one's profile picture can be a defiant act in authoritarian or repressive countries. The Western-centric nature of the critique of slacktivism discounts the impact it can have in authoritarian or repressive contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/ITP-pub-CyberactivismAndWomen-051712.pdf |title=Unveiling the Revolutionaries: Cyberactivism and Women's Role in the Arab Uprisings|author=Radsch, Courtney|publisher=Rice University| date= May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2E2T9GFaE&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Courtney C. Radsch]] argues that even such low level of engagement was an important form of activism for [[Arab]] youth before and during the [[Arab Spring]] because it was a form of free speech, and could successfully spark mainstream media coverage, such as when a hashtag becomes &quot;a trending topic [it] helps generate media attention, even as it helps organize information. The power of social media to help shape the international news agenda is one of the ways in which they subvert state authority and power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courtney-c-radsch/doubleedged-sword-social-_b_826354.html |title=Double-Edged Sword: Social Media's Subversive Potential|author=Courtney Radsch|publisher=Huffington Post| date= Feb. 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, studies suggest that &quot;fears of Internet activities supplanting real life activity are unsubstantiated,&quot; in that they do not cause a negative or positive effect on political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christensen|first=Henrik|title=Political activities on the internet: slacktivism or political participation by other means?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3336/2767|publisher=First Monday|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malcolm Gladwell]], in his October 2010 [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all  New Yorker Article], lambasted those who compare social media &quot;revolutions&quot; with actual activism that challenges the status quo ante. He argued that today's social media campaigns can't compare with activism that takes place on the ground, using the [[Greensboro sit-ins]] as an example of what real, high-risk activism looks like. &quot;As the historian [[Robert Darnton]] has written, “The marvels of communication technology in the present have produced a false consciousness about the past—even a sense that communication has no history, or had nothing of importance to consider before the days of television and the Internet.” But there is something else at work here, in the outsized enthusiasm for social media. Fifty years after one of the most extraordinary episodes of social upheaval in American history, we seem to have forgotten what activism is.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his criticism, Mirani argues that he might be right if activism is defined only as sit-ins, taking direct actions, and confrontations on the streets. However, if activism is about arousing awareness of people, changing people's minds, and influencing opinions across the world,then 'the revolution will be indeed be tweeted',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mirani|first=Leo|title=Sorry, Malcolm Gladwell, the revolution may well be tweeted|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/02/malcolm-gladwell-social-networking-kashmir|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|date=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 'hashtagged'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courtney-c-radsch/the-revolutions-will-be-h_b_839362.html |title=The Revolutions Will Be Hashtagged: Twitter Turns 5 as the Middle East Demands Democracy|author=[[Courtney C. Radsch]]|publisher=Huffington Post| date= March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and 'YouTubed'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/03/30/the_youtube_revolutions|

In a March 2012 [[Financial Times]] article, referring to efforts to address the on-going violence related to the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], Matthew Green wrote that the slactivists behind the [[Kony 2012]] video had &quot;achieved more with their 30-minute video than battalions of diplomats, NGO workers and journalists have since the conflict began 26 years ago.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Clicktivism==

The term &quot;clicktivism&quot; is sometimes used to describe activists using social media to organise protests. It allows organizations to quantify their success by keeping track of how many &quot;clicked&quot; on their petition or other call to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Micah|title=Clicktivism is ruining leftist activism|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/12/clicktivism-ruining-leftist-activism|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=16 November 2011|location=London|date=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the British group [[UK Uncut]] uses Twitter and other websites to organise protests and direct action against companies accused of tax avoidance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clicktivists - a new breed of protestors&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23914725-the-clicktivists---a-new-breed-of-protesters.do |title= Clicktivists - a new breed of protestors' |publisher=''London Evening Standard'' Online |date=19 January 2011 | accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This varies from slacktivism in that it merely replaces older ways of communicating a protest's existence (telephone, word of mouth, leaflets etc.) and does actually involve a real life, physical protest. On the other hand, clicktivism is also used to describe forms of internet based slacktivism such as signing online petitions or signing and sending form letter emails to politicians or corporate [[CEO]]s. 

Critics of clicktivism state that this new phenomenon turns social movements to resemble advertising campaigns in which messages are tested, [[clickthrough rate]] is recorded, and [[A/B testing]] is often done.  In order to improve these metrics, messages are reduced to make their &quot;asks easier and actions simpler.&quot; This in turn reduced social action to have members that are a list of email addresses rather than engaged people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Micah|authorlink=Micah M. White|title=Rejecting Clicktivism|url=http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/blackspot-blog/rejecting-clicktivism.html|publisher=AdBusters|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micah White, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/12/clicktivism-ruining-leftist-activism Clicktivism is ruining leftist activism], [[The Guardian]], 12 August 2010. Consulted on November 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity slacktivism==
Charity slacktivism can be described as actions in support of a cause that take little effort on the part of the individual. Examples of online charity slacktivism include changing one's Facebook status to support a cause, joining a charity organization's Facebook page or &quot;liking&quot; a cause on Facebook, tweeting or retweeting a charity organization's request for support, signing Internet petitions, and posting and sharing YouTube videos about a cause.  Recent examples include the [[Kony 2012]] campaign that exploded in social media in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cross|first=Allison|title=Hunt for Ugandan war criminal Joseph Kony video goes viral|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/07/hunt-for-ugandan-war-criminal-joseph-kony-video-goes-viral/|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=National Post|date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of offline charity slacktivism include awareness wristbands and paraphernalia in support of causes, such as the [[Livestrong wristband]] and the [[Product Red]] campaign products, as well as bumper stickers and [[mobile donating]].

The term slacktivism is often used to describe the world's reaction to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. The Red Cross managed to raise $5 million in 2 days via text message donations [http://articles.cnn.com/2010-01-14/tech/cashmore.haiti.earthquake.relief.technology_1_social-media-twitter-and-facebook-text-haiti/2?_s=PM:TECH]. Social media outlets were used to spread the word about the earthquake. The day after the earthquake, CNN reported that four of Twitter's top topics were related to the Haitian earthquake [http://articles.cnn.com/2010-01-14/tech/cashmore.haiti.earthquake.relief.technology_1_social-media-twitter-and-facebook-text-haiti/2?_s=PM:TECH]. These impressive responses by the world community were both praised as helpful reactions and condemned as throwing money at a problem that needed a different type of response.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Luxury good slacktivism==
The act of purchasing luxury brand goods that highlight support for a particular cause and advertises that a percentage of the cost of the good will go to the cause.  In some instances the donated funds are spread across various entities within one foundation which in theory helps out several deserving areas of the cause but criticisms of this type of donation highlight the thin spread of the donation.   

Slacktivists may also purchase a product from a company because it has a history of donating funds to charity, as a way to second-handedly support a cause. For example, a slactivist may buy [[Ben and Jerry's]] ice cream because its founders invested in the nation’s children, or promoted social and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangold|first=W.|coauthors=David Faulds|title=Social media: The new hybrid element of the|journal=Business Horizons|year=2009|pages=357–365|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politically motivated slacktivism==
Certain forms of slacktivism have political goals in mind, such as gaining support for a presidential campaign, or signing an internet petition that aims to influence governmental action. 
* The online petition website [[Change.org]] claimed it was attacked by Chinese hackers and brought down in April 2011. Change.org claimed that the fact that hackers 'felt the need to bring down the website must be seen as a testament to Change.org’s fast-growing success and a vindication of one particular petition: A Call for the Release of [[Ai Weiwei]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|title=Chinese Hackers Vindicate &quot;Slacktivism&quot;|url=http://projectquinn.com/chinese-hackers-vindicate-slacktivism/|publisher=ProjectQuinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ai Weiwei was released on 22nd, June, 2011 from Beijing, which was deemed as a victory by Change.org of its online campaign and petition demanding Ai's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joffe-Walt|first=Benjamin|title=Victory!
