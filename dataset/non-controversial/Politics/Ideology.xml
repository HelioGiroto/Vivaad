{{Original research|article|date=February 2012}}
An '''ideology''' is a set of [[idea]]s that constitute one's goals, [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s, and [[action theory (philosophy)|actions]]. An ideology is a comprehensive vision, a way of looking at things (compare [[worldview]]) as in several [[philosophical]] tendencies (see [[#Political ideologies|political ideologies]]), or a set of ideas proposed by the dominant class of a society to all members of this society (a &quot;received consciousness&quot; or product of [[socialization]]). 

Ideologies are systems of abstract thought applied to public matters and thus make this concept central to politics. Implicitly every political or economic tendency [[logical consequence|entails]] an ideology whether or not it is propounded as an explicit system of thought. 

==History==
{{Importance-section|date=November 2010}}
The term &quot;ideology&quot; was born in the highly controversial philosophical and political debates and fights of the [[French Revolution]] and acquired several other meanings from the early days of the [[First French Empire]] to the present. The word was coined by [[Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Emmet (1979) ''&quot;Ideology&quot; from Destutt De Tracy to Marx'', Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 40, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep., 1979), pp. 353-368 (article consists of 16 pages) http://www.jstor.org/pss/2709242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, David M. (2002) ''Destutt De Tracy: Annotated Bibliography'' http://www.econlib.org/library/Tracy/DestuttdeTracyBio.html&lt;/ref&gt; assembling the parts [[idea#John_Locke|''idea'']] (near to the [[John Locke|Lockean]] sense) and ''[[-logy]]''. He used it to refer to one aspect of his &quot;science of ideas&quot; (to the study itself, not the subject of the study). He separated three aspects, namely: ideology, general grammar, and logic, considering respectively the subject, the means, and the reason of this science.&lt;ref&gt;De Tracy, Destutt (1801) ''Les Éléments d'idéologie'', 3rd ed. (1817), p. 4, cited by: Mannheim, Karl (1929) Ideologie und Utopie, 2nd footnote in the chapter ''The problem of &quot;false consciousness&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that among these aspects ideology is the most [[generic]] term, because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.

According to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (as a politician) used it in an abusive way against &quot;the ideologues&quot; (a group which included{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]], [[Marquis De Condorcet|Condorcet]], [[Benjamin Constant|Constant]], [[Pierre Claude François Daunou|Daunou]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]], [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]], and [[Destutt de Tracy|Tracy]]), to express the pettiness of his (liberal republican) political opponents.

Perhaps the most accessible source for the near-original meaning of ''ideology'' is [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s work on the [[Ancien Regime]] (the first volume of &quot;Origins of Contemporary France&quot;). He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the [[Socratic method]], but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] as one of its precursors. (Tracy read the works of Locke and Condillac while he was imprisoned during the [[Reign of Terror]].)

The word &quot;ideology&quot; was coined long before the Russians coined &quot;intelligentsia&quot;, or before the adjective &quot;intellectual&quot; referred to a sort of person (see [[substantive]]), i.e. an [[intellectual]]. Thus these words were not around when the hard-headed, driven Napoleon Bonaparte took the word &quot;ideologues&quot; to ridicule his intellectual opponents. Gradually, however, the term &quot;ideology&quot; has [[Euphemism#Euphemism treadmill|dropped some of its pejorative sting]], and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology. An introduction,'' Verso, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Karl Marx]] situated the term within [[class struggle]] and domination,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Robert C (1978). ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''MER,'' pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt; others believed it was a necessary part of [[structural functionalism|institutional functioning]] and [[social cohesion|social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Silbey, [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/cupsoc/ideology &quot;Ideology&quot;] at Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
''Meta-ideology'' is the study of the structure, form, and manifestation of ideologies. Meta-ideology posits that ideology is a ''coherent system of ideas'', relying upon a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis, but are subjective choices that serve as the seed around which further thought grows. According to this perspective, ideologies are neither right nor wrong, but only a relativistic intellectual strategy for categorizing the world. The pluses and minuses of ideology range from the vigor and fervor of true believers to ideological infallibility. Excessive need for certitude lurks at fundamentalist levels in politics and religions.

The works of [[George Walford]] and [[Harold Walsby]], done under the heading of [[systematic ideology]], are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. [[Charles Blattberg]] has offered an account which distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, &quot;Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies,&quot; in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;

David W. Minar describes six different ways in which the word &quot;ideology&quot; has been used:
# As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of ''content'', usually normative;
# As the ''form or internal logical structure'' that ideas have within a set;
# By the role in which ideas play in ''human-social interaction'';
# By the role that ideas play in the ''structure of an organization'';
# As meaning, whose purpose is ''persuasion''; and
# As the ''locus'' of social interaction, possibly.

For Willard A. Mullins, an ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:
# it must have power over cognition
# it must be capable of guiding one's evaluations;
# it must provide guidance towards action;
# and, as stated above, it must be logically coherent.

Mullins emphasizes that an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of ''utopia'' and ''historical myth''.

The German philosopher [http://www.ideologieforschung.de/web/Christian_Duncker.html Christian Duncker] called for a &quot;critical reflection of the ideology concept&quot; (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of [[epistemology]] and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.

Though the word &quot;ideology&quot; is most often found in political discourse, there are many different kinds of ideology: [[political]], [[Social issues|social]], [[epistemological]], [[ethical]], etc.

===Marxist view===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Karl Marx]] posits that a society’s dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure.]]
In the [[Marxist]] [[base and superstructure (Marxism)|economic base and superstructure]] model of society, ''base'' denotes the [[relations of production]], and ''superstructure'' denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a [[feudal]] [[mode of production]], religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as [[liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via [[false consciousness]], such as in the case of [[commodity fetishism]]—the belief that [[theory of value (economics)|value]] is inherent to a commodity, rather than external, added to it via labor.

The ruling class affect their social reproduction by the [[dominant ideology]]'s representing—to every social-economic class—that the economic interests of the ruling class are the economic interests of the entire society. Some explanations have been presented. [[György Lukács]] proposes ideology as a [[psychological projection|projection]] of the [[class consciousness]] of the ruling class. [[Antonio Gramsci]] uses [[cultural hegemony]] to explain why the [[working-class]] have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests.

Chronologically, the dominant ideologies in Capitalism are:
# [[classical liberalism]]
# [[modern liberalism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Preager.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[social democracy]]
# [[neo-liberalism]]

corresponding to these three [[capitalism|capitalist]] stages of development:
# [[extensive stage]]
# [[intensive stage]]
# [[contemporary capitalism]] ([[late capitalism]])

The Marxist formulation of &quot;ideology as an instrument of social reproduction&quot; is conceptually important to the [[sociology of knowledge]], viz. Karl Mannheim, [[Daniel Bell]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the &quot;total&quot; but &quot;special&quot; Marxist conception of ideology to a &quot;general&quot; and &quot;total&quot; ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including [[Marxism]]) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]].

===Louis Althusser's ''Ideological State Apparatuses''===
[[Louis Althusser]] proposed a materialistic conception of ideology, which made use of a special type of discourse: the [[lacunar discourse]]. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is ''not'' told (but is suggested).

For example, the statement &quot;All are equal before the law,&quot; which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal &quot;opportunities&quot;. This is not true, for the concept of [[private property]] and power over the [[means of production]] results in some people being able to own more (''much'' more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.

Althusser also proffered the concept of the [[Louis Althusser#Ideological state apparatuses|Ideological State Apparatus]] to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was &quot;''ideology has no history''&quot;: while individual ideolog''ies'' have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.   His second thesis, &quot;''Ideas are material''&quot;, explains his materialistic attitude, which he illustrates with the &quot;scandalous advice&quot; of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] toward unbelievers: &quot;kneel and pray, and then you will believe&quot;. For Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. What is ultimately important for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the &quot;minds&quot; of human individuals, but rather the material institutions, rituals, and discourses that produce these beliefs.

===Feminism as critique of ideology===
Naturalizing socially constructed patterns of behavior has always been an important mechanism in the production and reproduction of ideologies. [[Feminist]] theorists have paid close attention to these mechanisms. [[Adrienne Rich]], for example, has shown how to understand [[motherhood]] as a social institution. However, feminism is not a homogeneous whole, and some corners of feminist thought criticize the critique of [[social constructionism]], by advocating that it disregards too much of human nature and natural tendencies. The debate, they say, is about the normative/naturalistic fallacy—the idea that just something &quot;being&quot; natural does not necessarily mean it &quot;ought&quot; to be the case.

==Political ideologies==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Charles De Gaulle]]--&gt;
{{main|Ideologies of parties}}
Many [[political party|political parties]] base their political action and program on an ideology. In [[social studies]], a Political ''Ideology'' is a certain ethical set of [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myth]]s, or [[symbol]]s of a [[social movement]], [[institution]], [[social class|class]], or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends it should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them.

Political ideologies have two dimensions:
# ''Goals'': how society should work
# ''Methods'': the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement.

An ideology is a collection of ideas. Typically, each ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers to be the best [[form of government]] (e.g. [[democracy]], [[theocracy]], [[caliphate]] etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, &quot;socialism&quot; may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology which supports that economic system.

Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though this is very often controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g. [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana political parties|legalization of marijuana]]). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as &quot;the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition.&quot;

Studies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of systematic ideology.

Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, some of which are: the economy, [[education]], [[health care]], [[labor law]], [[criminal law]], the [[justice system]], the provision of [[social security]] and [[social welfare]], [[trade]], the [[environmentalism|environment]], [[minor (law)|minors]], [[immigration]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], use of the [[military]], [[patriotism]], and [[established religion]].

There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies. See the '''[[political spectrum]]''' article for a more in-depth discussion of these different methods (each of whom generates a specific political spectrum).

Today, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, D. ''[[The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties]] (2000) (2nd ed.). Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, pg. 393''&lt;/ref&gt; in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this is often associated with [[Francis Fukuyama|Francis Fukuyama's]] writings on &quot;the end of history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1992)''[[The End of History and the Last Man]].'' USA: The Free Press, xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological ideologies==
Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant [[paradigm]] or [[mindset]] can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.

A special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. [[Perceptual psychology|Perceptual psychologist]] [[James J. Gibson]] believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]] itself. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.

[[Deep ecology]] and the modern [[ecology movement]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[Green parties]]) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.

Some accuse [[ecological economics]] of likewise turning scientific theory into [[political economy]], although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of [[green economics]] fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.

This is far from the only theory of economics to be raised to ideology status—some notable economically based ideologies include [[mercantilism]], [[mixed economy]], [[social Darwinism]], [[communism]], [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], and [[free trade]]. There are also current theories of [[safe trade]] and [[fair trade]] which can be seen as ideologies.

==Psychological research==
Psychological research&lt;ref name=&quot;jost2008&quot;/&gt; increasingly suggests that ideologies reflect motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Research in 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;jost2008&quot;&gt;Jost, John T., Ledgerwood, Alison, &amp; Hardin, Curtis D. (2008). Shared reality, system justification, and the relational basis of ideological beliefs. ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2'',171-186&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships. The authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of [[system justification|system-justifying]] worldviews. [[Psychologists]] have generally found that [[personality traits]], individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have a common thread.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Ideology and semiotic theory==
According to the semiotician [[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], ideology &quot;identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s '[[episteme]]' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], [http://www.semioticon.com/seo/I/ideology.html# &quot;Ideology&quot;], at ''Semiotics Encyclopedia Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Michael Freeden]] have also recently incorporated a [[semantics|semantic]] analysis to the study of ideologies.
