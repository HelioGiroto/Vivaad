The '''Western Journalism Center''' (also called the Western Center for Journalism) was founded in 1991 by [[Joseph Farah]] and James H. Smith. It is based in [[Sacramento, California]]. 
==Projects==
The Center helped fund [[Christopher W. Ruddy]] (who later founded [[NewsMax]]) to investigate conspiracies surrounding the death of [[Vincent Foster]], which was part of the [[Arkansas Project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foster&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/clinton/Clintonculwar8-06.html | title = Western Journalism Center - Joseph Farah | work = Public Eye | accessdate =  November 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, &quot;the Center placed some 50 ads reprinting Ruddy's ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' stories in the ''[[Washington Times]]'', then repackaged the articles as a packet titled &quot;The Ruddy Investigation,&quot; which sold for $12.&quot; In addition, &quot;Farah also bought full page ads publicizing Ruddy's allegations that appeared in papers including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&quot; and &quot;the ad campaign brought in over $500,000, half from individual donors-many of whom bought Foster conspiracy materials-and half from foundations, including $100,000 from Carthage.&quot; The [[Carthage Foundation]] is controlled by [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], whose foundations gave $330,000 to the Center in 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;scaife&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifegraf050299.htm | title = Decades of Contributions to Conservatism | work = The Washington Post (May 2, 1999) | accessdate = June 29, 2006 | date=1999-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, &quot;WJC circulated a video featuring Ruddy's claims, ''Unanswered-The Death of Vincent Foster'', that was produced by author [[James Dale Davidson|James Davidson]], chairman of the [[National Taxpayers Union]] (NTU) and co-editor of the Strategic Investment newsletter.&quot;

During the 2012 [[Todd_Akin_%27legitimate_rape%27_and_pregnancy_comment_controversy|Todd Akin &quot;legitimate rape&quot; controversy]], [[Karl Rove]] remarked that Republicans &quot;should sink [[Todd Akin]]&quot; and joked that &quot;If he's found mysteriously murdered, don't look for my whereabouts&quot;. In response, WJC created RoveMustGo.com to circulate a petition asserting that &quot;Karl Rove has made himself toxic to Republicans by his incredibly offensive and dangerous statement suggesting the murder of Congressman Todd Akin of Missouri.&quot; Though Rove later issued an apology for the joke, as of September 4, 2012, WJC was still running Facebook ads for the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoveMustGo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rovemustgo.com | title = Rove Must Go | accessdate = September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In 1998, the Center sued the [[IRS]] claiming it was audited in 1996 for political reasons. The lawsuit was thrown out, with appeals denied. A lower court ruled that the IRS could not be sued on allegations of politically motivated auditing practices, while a federal appeals court ruled that the Center's lawsuit was barred by the statute of limitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;lawsuit2&quot;&gt;&quot;Journalism group can't sue over 'politically motivated' audit,&quot; Associated Press, December 20, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
==Ownership==
In 1997, Farah created the news website [[WorldNetDaily]] as a division of the Western Journalism Center. In 1999, WorldNetDaily was spun off&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=17207 World's 'No. 1 website' goes for-profit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a for-profit division of the Center. The Center and Farah own a majority of WorldNetDaily's stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://conwebwatch.tripod.com/stories/2002/wndown.html |title = The 'O' Word |accessdate = 2008-02-02 |last = Krepel |first = Terry |date = 2002-02-19 |work = ConWebWatch |quote = So, who owns WorldNetDaily? Joseph Farah is a little reluctant to answer. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center doesn't include either an address or telephone number on its letterhead, but is believed to be headed by conservative author, speaker, and political consultant [[Floyd Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.westernjournalism.com/?page_id=2 |title = About |accessdate = 2009-04-02 |work = Western Center for Journalism |quote = Today the Center is led by columnist and veteran broadcaster Floyd Brown. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
