{{Economics sidebar}}

An '''economy''' consists of the [[economic systems]] of a country or other area; the [[Wage labor|labor]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]], and [[Land (economics)|land]] [[resources]]; and the [[manufacturing]], production, [[trade]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]], and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[goods (economics)|goods]] and services of that area.

A given economy is the result of a process that involves its [[technological evolution]], [[history]] and [[social organization]], as well as its [[geography]], [[natural resource]] endowment, and [[ecology]], as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions.

A market based economy may be described as a spatially limited [[social network]] where [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]] are freely produced and exchanged according to [[demand]] and [[supply (economics)|supply]] between participants (economic agents) by [[barter]] or a [[medium of exchange]] with a [[credit]] or [[debit]] [[value (economics)|value]] accepted within the network. Capital and labor can move freely across places, industries and firms in search of higher profits, dividends, interest, compensations and benefits. Rent on land allocates this generally fixed resource among competing users.

Contemporary [[Capitalism]] is a [[market economy]] in which most of the production capacity is owned and directed by the private sector. Government role is limited to provide for defense and internal security; administer justice and prisons; make laws and regulations; enforce contracts, laws and regulations; correct market imperfections and failures; ensure full employment without inflation; promote balance economic growth and development; provide for the poor, children, and elderly; protect and assist in emergencies and natural disasters; provide basic opportunities to all members of society; prevent future calamities and disasters; and, pursue national goals established by society at large such as protection of the environment and natural resources. 

On the other hand, traditional [[socialism]] is a command-based economy in which markets and the free exchange of goods and services, as well as manufacturing, production, trade and distribution are replaced or done by government central planning and state owned enterprises. In this economy all private owners of capital (called capitalist) and of land (called landowners) are not allowed or banned; and the only permitted private ownership is of consumption goods. Capital and land are assigned by the state and movement of labor is severely restricted. There are no profits, dividends, interest or rent. Labor compensation and benefits are decided by central planners. 

Finally, a mixed economy contains elements of both capitalism and socialism which means a market based economy with a varied degree of government central planning and state owned enterprises.

==Range==
Today the range of fields of study examining the economy revolve around the [[social science]] of [[economics]], but may include [[sociology]] ([[economic sociology]]), [[history]] ([[economic history]]), [[anthropology]] ([[economic anthropology]]), and [[geography]] ([[economic geography]]). Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving [[Production (economics)|production]], [[distribution (economics)|distribution]], [[Trade|exchange]], and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[goods and services]] as a whole, are [[engineering]], [[management]], [[business administration]], [[applied science]], and [[finance]].

All [[profession]]s, occupations, [[economic agent]]s or economic activities, contribute to the economy. [[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]], [[saving (money)|saving]], and [[investment]] are variable components in the economy that determine macroeconomic equilibrium. There are three main sectors of economic activity: [[Primary sector of the economy|primary]], [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary]], and [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary]].

Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times,&lt;ref&gt;The volume of financial transactions in the 2008 global economy was 73.5 times higher than nominal world GDP, while, in 1990, this ratio amounted to &quot;only&quot; 15.3 ([http://www.wifo.ac.at/wwa/servlet/wwa.upload.DownloadServlet/bdoc/WP_2009_344$.PDF &quot;A General Financial Transaction Tax: A Short Cut of the Pros, the Cons and a Proposal&quot;], Austrian Institute for Economic Research, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; the term '''real economy''' is used by analysts&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/07/23/meanwhile-in-the-real-economy/ &quot;Meanwhile, in the Real Economy&quot;], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', July 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/10/24/boes-haldane-bank-regulation-should-serve-real-economy/ &quot;Bank Regulation Should Serve Real Economy&quot;], ''Wall Street Journal'', October 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as well as politicians&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/08/15/perry-and-romney-trade-swipes-over-real-economy/ &quot;Perry and Romney Trade Swipes Over ‘Real Economy'&quot;], ''Wall Street Journal'', August 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with actually producing goods and services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=real-economy &quot;Real Economy&quot;] definition in the ''Financial Times'' Lexicon&lt;/ref&gt; as ostensibly  contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://glossary.econguru.com/economic-term/real+economy &quot;Real economy&quot;] definition in the Economic Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] values (adjusted for [[inflation]]), such as [[real GDP]], or in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] values (unadjusted for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;• Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics, search for ''[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/r.html#real real]''.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • R. O'Donnell (1987).  &quot;real and nominal quantities,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] words &quot;economy&quot; and &quot;[[economics]]&quot; can be traced back to the [[Greek language|Greek]] words οἰκονόμος (i.e. &quot;one who manages a household&quot;, a composite word derived from οἴκος (&quot;house&quot;) and νέμω (&quot;manage; distribute&quot;)) and οἰκονομία (&quot;household management&quot;). 

The first recorded sense of the word &quot;œconomy&quot; is in the phrase &quot;the management of œconomic affairs&quot;, found in a work possibly composed in a monastery in 1440. &quot;Economy&quot; is later recorded in more general senses, including &quot;thrift&quot; and &quot;administration&quot;. 

The most frequently used current sense, denoting &quot;the economic system of a country or an area&quot;, seems not to have developed until the 19th or 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/economy Dictionary.com], &quot;economy.&quot; The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company, 2004. 24 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient times ===
{{See also|Palace economy}}
As long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. [[Sumer]] developed a large scale economy based on [[commodity money]], while the [[Babylonians]] and their neighboring [[city states]] later developed the earliest system of [[economics]] as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on [[debt]], legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.&lt;ref name=Sheila&gt;Sheila C. Dow (2005), &quot;Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply&quot;, ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'' '''27''' (3), p. 385-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;yale2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm|title=The Code of Hammurabi : Introduction|accessdate=September 14, 2007|publisher=Yale University|year=1915|author=Charles F. Horne, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.

Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records and other pursuits. Ways to divide private property, when it is contended... amounts of interest on debt... rules as to property and monetary compensation concerning property damage or physical damage to a person... fines for 'wrongdoing'... and compensation in money for various infractions of formalized law were standardized for the first time in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheila&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:BMC 193.jpg|thumb|RIGHT|200px|Greek [[drachm]] of Aegina. Obverse: Land [[turtle]] / Reverse: ΑΙΓ(INA) and dolphin. The oldest turtle coin dates 700 BC]]

The ancient economy was mainly based on [[subsistence farming]]. The [[Shekel]] referred to an ancient unit of weight and currency. The first usage of the term came from [[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific mass of [[barley]] which related other values in a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] such as silver, bronze, copper etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of [[currency]] and a unit of weight... just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one pound mass of silver.

For most people the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships. There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In [[Ancient Greece]], where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were [[bond slaves]] of the [[Freeholder (government)|freeholders]]. Economic discussion was driven by [[scarcity]].

=== Middle ages ===
In [[Medieval]] times, what we now call economy was not far from the subsistence level. Most exchange occurred within [[social groups]]. On top of this, the great conquerors raised [[venture capital]] (from ''ventura'', ital.; ''risk'') to finance their captures. The [[Capital (economics)|capital]] should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the [[New World]]. Merchants such as [[Jakob Fugger]] (1459–1525) and [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]] (1360–1428) founded the first [[bank]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The discoveries of [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324),{{Dubious|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Asia-Europe trade existed long before Polo. --&gt; [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506) and [[Vasco da Gama]] (1469–1524) led to a first [[globalization|global]] economy. The first [[Company|enterprises]] were trading establishments. In 1513 the first [[stock exchange]] was founded in [[Antwerpen]]. Economy at the time meant primarily [[trade]].

=== Early modern times ===
The European captures became branches of the [[Europe]]an states, the so-called [[colonies]]. The rising [[nation-state]]s [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]] tried to control the trade through [[custom duties]] and [[taxes]] in order to protect their national economy. The so-called [[mercantilism]] (from ''mercator'', lat.: [[merchant]]) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and [[public interest]].
The [[secularization]] in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the [[nobles]] decreased. The first [[Secretaries of State]] for economy started their work. [[Bankers]] like [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] (1773–1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and [[infrastructure]]. Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the [[citizens]] of a state.

=== The industrial revolution ===
The first [[economist]] in the true meaning of the word was the Scotsman [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790). He defined the elements of a [[national economy]]: [[Product (business)|products]] are offered at a [[natural price]] generated by the use of [[competition]] - [[supply and demand]] - and the [[division of labour]]. He maintained that the basic motive for [[free trade]] is human self-interest. The so-called [[self-interest hypothesis]] became the [[anthropological]] basis for economics. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of [[overpopulation]]. The [[United States of America]] became the place where millions of [[expatriates]] from all European countries were searching for free [[economic evolvement]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in [[agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], and [[transport]] had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the [[United Kingdom]], then subsequently spreading throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]], and eventually the [[world]]. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way.
In Europe wild [[capitalism]] started to replace the system of [[mercantilism]] (today: [[protectionism]]) and led to [[economic growth]]. The period today is called [[industrial revolution]] because the system of [[Production (economics)|Production]], [[costs, and pricing|production]] and [[division of labour]] enabled the [[mass production]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]].

=== After World War II ===
After the chaos of two [[World War]]s and the devastating [[Great Depression]], policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy. This was explored and discussed by [[Friedrich August von Hayek]] (1899–1992) and [[Milton Friedman]] (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global [[free trade]] and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called [[neoliberalism]]. However, the prevailing view was that held by [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who argued for a stronger control of the [[markets]] by the state. The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called [[Keynesianism]] in his honor. In the late 1950s the economic growth in America and Europe—often called [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (ger: ''economic miracle'') —brought up a new form of economy: [[mass consumption economy]]. In 1958 [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an [[affluent society]]. In most of the countries the economic system is called a [[social market economy]].

=== Late 20th - beginning of 21th century ===
With the fall of the [[Iron curtain]] and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Block towards democratic government and market economies the idea of the post-industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the [[service sector]] receives at the place of the industrialization, as well as the growing need and valuation of knowledge and creativity for the businesses. In fact the idea of the post-industrial society has its beginning in the 70s &lt;ref&gt;There is an ongoing debate about the first usage of this term, some relate it to Daniel Bell's 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', while other - to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book ''Tools for Conviviality''. The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of [[postmodernism]] in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21 century.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term came to common usage to describe the growth of economies like the Chinese at the period (the term is specifically used by [[Bill Clinton]] in a speech about Republic of China in 1998).

With the spread of [[Internet]] as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000-2001 the idea for the Internet and information economy is given place because of the growing importance of ecommerce and electronic businesses, also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of &quot;all-connected&quot; society is created. In the late 00s the new type of economies and economic expansions of countries like China, Brazil and India bring attention and interest to different from the usually dominating Western type economies and economic models.

== Economic phases of precedence ==
The economy may be considered as having developed through the following Phases or Degrees of Precedence. 

* The [[Ancient history|ancient economy]] was mainly based on [[subsistence]] farming.
* The [[industrial revolution]] phase lessened the role of [[subsistence]] farming, converting it to more [[extensive farming|extensive]] and [[monoculture|mono-cultural]] forms of agriculture in the last three centuries. The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries. [[Commerce]] became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the community.
* In the economies of modern [[consumer society|consumer societies]] phase there is a growing part played by [[Service (economics)|services]], [[finance]], and [[technology]]—the ([[knowledge economy]]).

In modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by degrees of activity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* '''Primary stage/degree of the economy:''' Involves the extraction and production of [[raw materials]], such as [[corn]], [[coal]], [[wood]] and [[iron]]. (A coal miner and a fisherman would be workers in the primary degree.)
* '''Secondary stage/degree of the economy:''' Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into [[cars]], or [[textiles]] into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary degree.) At this stage the associated industrial economy is also sub-divided into several [[economic sectors]] (also called [[industries]]). Their separate evolution during the [[Industrial Revolution]] phase is dealt with elsewhere.
* '''Tertiary stage/degree of the economy:''' Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, such as [[baby-sitting]], [[film|cinema]] and [[banking]]. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary degree.)
* '''Quaternary stage/degree of the economy:''' Involves the research and development needed to produce products from natural resources and their subsequent by-products. (A logging company might [[research]] ways to use partially burnt wood to be processed so that the undamaged portions of it can be made into pulp for paper.) Note that '''education''' is sometimes included in this sector.

Other sectors of the developed community include :

* the [[Public Sector]] or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for empoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature-reserves, some universities, national sports grounds/stadiums, national arts/concert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions).
* the [[Private Sector]] or privately-run businesses.
* the [[Social sector]] or [[Voluntary sector]].

== Economic measures ==
There are a number of ways to measure economic activity of a nation. These methods of measuring economic activity include:

* [[Consumer spending]]
* [[Exchange Rate]]
* [[Gross domestic product]]
* [[GDP per capita]]
* [[GNP]]
* [[Stock Market]]
* [[Interest Rate]]
* [[National Debt]]
* [[Inflation|Rate of Inflation]]
* [[Unemployment]]
* [[Balance of Trade]]

=== GDP ===
The [[GDP]] - Gross domestic product of a country is a measure of the size of its economy. The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and [[GDP per capita]]. While often useful, it should be noted that GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged.

== Informal economy ==
{{Main|Informal economy}}

An informal economy is economic activity that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government, contrasted with a formal economy. The informal economy is thus not included in that government's [[Gross National Product]] (GNP). Although the informal economy is often associated with [[developing countries]], all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion.

Informal economic activity is a dynamic process which includes many aspects of economic and social theory including exchange, regulation, and enforcement. By its nature, it is necessarily difficult to observe, study, define, and measure. No single source readily or authoritatively defines informal economy as a unit of study.

The terms &quot;under the table&quot; and &quot;off the books&quot; typically refer to this type of economy. The term [[black market]] refers to a specific subset of the informal economy. The term &quot;informal sector&quot; was used in many earlier studies, and has been mostly replaced in more recent studies which use the newer term.

Micro economics are focused on an individual person in a given economic society and Macro economics is looking at an economy as a whole. (town, city, region)
