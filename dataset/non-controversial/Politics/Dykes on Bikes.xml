Along with [[drag queen]]s, the DOB have been criticized for not portraying a more acceptable image of LGBT culture but supporters counter that they are seen as highly visible icons of gay pride who refuse to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] and conform to mainstream society [[gender roles]] and indeed remind of the [[Butch and femme|butches]] and queens who helped lead the [[Stonewall Inn|Stonewall]] [[Stonewall riots|riots]] launching the modern [[LGBT social movements|gay-rights movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Homo Economics: Capitalism, Community&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The Dykes on Bikes have been criticized for using the term ''dyke'' in their name rather than lesbian but the group has registered the mark in the United States, after a battle to demonstrate that the terms ''diesel-dyke,'' ''bull-dyke,'' ''bull-dagger'' and dyke all have historically negative connotations but have been re-appropriated as self-referential terms of endearment and empowerment distinct from ''lesbian'' and indeed awards and events utilizing those names are now used by the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dykes on Bikes and the Regulation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In many countries motorcycles are simply an economical and effective mode of transportation. Cheaper to purchase, maintain and use than a four-wheeled vehicle and more capable of handling narrow or poorly maintained roads, motorcycles are a simply a better option. The United States with its car friendly culture and its wide well-marked and extensive road system is an exception rather than the rule but even in America the motorcycle is used not only as transportation but as means of escapism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[File:Dykes on bykes.JPG|thumbnail|left|Dykes On Bikes leading the 2005 [[San Francisco Pride|San Francisco Pride parade]], the contingent has over 400 motorized bikes, many of which are decorated for the event.]]
The first formal appearance of the Dykes on Bikes was in 1976 at San Francisco's Pride parade where the riders were placed first as motorcycles don't always run reliably at the walking pace of the rest of the parade and as first contingent they can move faster.  Although the original group self-identified as ''Dykes on Bikes'' and they were known as such, over the years they used ''the Women’s Motorcycle Contingent/ Dykes on Bikes'' to encompass those who identified as [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] or any of the newer [[gender-bending]] terms like [[femme]], [[androgyne]] and [[boi (gender)|boi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wmc&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, after a prolonged court battle involving testimony on the word's changing role in the lesbian community, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] permitted the group to register its name. In 2007, the club won a legal challenge from a male lawyer, Michael McDermott, who sued after the USPTO granted approval &lt;ref&gt;McDermott vs. San Francisco Women's Motorcycle Contingent, 07-7126.&lt;/ref&gt; calling the name “disparaging to men” and “scandalous and immoral.” &lt;ref&gt;Court rules Dykes on Bikes are not offensive, Pink News, 16 July 2007 [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/07/16/court-rules-dykes-on-bikes-are-not-offensive/]&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that men had no grounds to be offended by the term. McDermott stated his opposition against any group associated with the annual [[Dyke March]], which he dubbed &quot;the Annual Illegal San Francisco Dyke Hate Riot&quot; in which he and all men are subject to criminal attacks and civil right violations. He claimed the word dyke is associated with a &quot;deep obsessive hatred of men and the male gender.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Man has no legal grounds for objecting to 'Dykes on Bikes,' court says. Marisa Lagos, San Francisco Chronicle, Thursday, July 12, 2007 [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/12/BAG5PQVE0J12.DTL#ixzz1ukaxs3JG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO), under Section 2(a) of the [[Lanham Act]], will not consider registration of a proposed trademark which contains a term that is [[Disparagement|disparaging]] to a group of people. This presents a problem for the PTO when an attempt is made by a group to register a mark containing a self-disparaging term, as was done with DOB.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anten&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anten|first=Todd|author-link= |title=Self-Disparaging Trademarks and Social Change: Factoring the Reappropriation of Slurs into Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=106|issue= |page=338|date= |year=2006|url=http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Anten-Web.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-07-12| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061124014213/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Anten-Web.pdf| archivedate = November 24, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;On February 20, 2004, the PTO refused the registration of the [[Trademark|mark]] 'Dykes on Bikes' under Trademark Act Section 2(a), explaining that a [[reasonable person]] of ordinary sensibilities would recognize that the term “dyke” is disparaging and objectionable to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dykes on Bikes and the Regulation&quot;/&gt; 

However, the defence noted that during the time period from 2000-2005 the PTO had approved marks for “Crippled Old Biker Bastards,” “Biker Bitch,” “[[Whore]],” and “Evil [[Pussy]]” as well as “TechnoDyke,” &quot;Homo Depot,&quot; &quot;Queer Shop,&quot; ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' and ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dykes on Bikes and the Regulation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;“Exhibit A.” Applicant’s Request&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In this particular case, it is women – or more specifically lesbians, bisexuals and transgender women – who ride motorcycles in the Pride Parades and who would be using the term.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Dykes on Bikes and the Regulation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;“Response to Office Action.” Response&quot;&gt;{{cite web
