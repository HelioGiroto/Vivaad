'''Progg''', a contraction of the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word for &quot;progressive music&quot; (''progressiv musik'') was a [[left-wing]] and anti-commercial [[music]]al movement in [[Sweden]] that had its roots in the late 1960s, and its golden age in the 1970s. It should not be confused with the English expression ''progressive music'' or [[progressive rock]]. Progg is not a genre.  There were progg bands playing progressive rock, but the progg movement encompassed many other genres.

The progg movement was closely connected to similar movements in arts, theatre and design, and to alternative life styles and left wing views. The people playing and listening to this music came to be called ''proggare'' (Lit. ''proggers'') in Swedish.

== The movement ==

Many musicians and people working with music in the end of the 1960s were against the commercialism of pop music. Notably, the record companies [[Silence Records|Silence]] and [[MNW]] were formed, and started to record and release this new music. They created a new distribution company, ''SAM-distribution'', which distributed the records of the alternative record companies, and so called ''music forums'', places where concerts could be held without a commercial middleman such as ordinary concert arrangers were created in many Swedish cities. In the middle of the 1970s around 75 music forums existed. The word that was generally used about the movement was ''musikrörelsen'', which means the music movement.

== The music==
Progg did not have a uniform sound and featured a broad spectrum of musical styles. There were a wide range of artists as well, including [[Bo Hansson]], [[Kebnekajse]], [[Södra bergens balalaikor]], [[Blå Tåget]], [[Hoola Bandoola Band]], [[Nationalteatern]], [[Dag Vag]], and [[Jan Hammarlund]].
Most lyrics were in Swedish, while English was the common language for other pop and rock in Sweden at the time.

The two big progg record companies had a somewhat different musical profile.

== History ==
Alternative bands began to form in the late 1960s, but the movement emerged in full in the summer of 1970. A big alternative music festival was held at the field [[Gärdet]] in [[Stockholm]] between June 12 and June 14. The festival was illegal, as a permission for it had not been obtained {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. The new independent record company ''Silence'' released a compilation record with music from the festival as their first record, and signed some of the bands that played, including [[Träd, Gräs och Stenar]] and [[Gudibrallan]]. In 1971 MNW was formed. During this decade the progg movement had a strong position in the musical landscape of Sweden.

At the end of the 1970s, however, the movement started to decline, as many of the bands disintegrated and the ''music forums'' were closed. The left wing ideals became less dominating among young people, and the rock and folk music also became less popular than new genres such as [[hard rock]] and [[electronic music]].

== Opinions ==

The progg movement took a clear stance against [[capitalism]] and commercialism, but it was by no means a homogeneous movement. 
The political opinions ranged from everything from [[anarchism]] and [[communism]] to less clearly pronounced general left-wing opinions. The relations with the governing [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] were not that good, which can be exemplified by the song ''Fy på dig sosse'' (Shame on you, [[Social Democrat]]) by ''Gudibrallan''. Few people in the movement were members of any [[Political Party|political party]], though the communist parties [[Communist Party (Sweden)|the Swedish communist party]] and [[Communist Party of Sweden (1967)]] started their own record companies which joined the movement.

The [[United FNL groups]] were a strong movement in support of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam]], and progg bands often played at their demonstrations. Progg bands also played at other big demonstrations at the time, such as the protest that managed to stop the cutting down of the [[elm]]s in the park [[Kungsträdgården]] in Stockholm, and the protests to stop the [[tennis]] matches against tennis players from the [[Pinochet]]-ruled [[Chile]] in [[Båstad]] 1975.

In 1977 the record company Silence moved their studio to the small village [[Koppom]] in the forests of the province of [[Värmland]].

== Legacy ==

Some of the artists from the progg movement have continued to play music and managed to remain popular over the years, for example [[Björn Afzelius]], [[Mikael Wiehe]], [[Totta Näslund]] and [[Peps Persson]]. 

There has been a stereotypical image of progg as something out of date and spaced out from the 1970s. On the other hand, since the end of the 1990s, many progg bands have experienced some renaissance, with many old progg bands reuniting for concerts and new records, for example Träd, Gräs och Stenar and [[Samla Mammas Manna]]. Some bands, like [[Nationalteatern]], still go on long tours in the 21st century performing their old songs for a new generation. Silence has re-released much of their catalogue from the 1970s on [[CD]], and old [[Gramophone record|LP]]s with progg music are sold at high prices.

There are new musicians who have references to the progg music, and are sometimes called ''nyprogg'' (new progg), for example [[Lars Winnerbäck]], [[Dungen]], [[Hovet (band)|Hovet]], [[Cirkus Miramar]] and [[Doktor Kosmos]].

The film ''[[Together (2000 film)|Together]]'' from 2000 is set in Sweden during the progg era and features much progg music.
