An '''Affinity group''' is usually a small group of [[activists]] (usually from 3-20) who work together on [[direct action]]. 

Affinity groups are organized in a non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] manner, usually using [[consensus decision making]], and are often made up of trusted [[friendship|friends]]. They provide a method of organization that is flexible and decentralized. 

Affinity groups can be based on a common [[ideology]] (e.g., [[anarchism]], [[pacifism]]), a shared concern for a given issue (e.g., [[anti-nuclear]], [[anti-war]]) or a common activity, role or skill (e.g., [[Legal Support|legal support]], medical aid, [[black bloc]]s). Affinity groups may have either open or closed membership, although the latter is far more common.

== History ==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
{{weasel|date=September 2012}}
Although Affinity groups are a natural way for humans to organize{{cn|date=September 2012}} and are, in that sense, as old as humanity, the origin of Affinity groups, in the current context, dates back to 19th century [[Spain]]. It was the favourite way of organization by [[Spanish anarchists]] (''grupos de afinidad''), and had their base in the [[tertulias]] or in the local groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rantcollective.net/article.php?id=33 Rant Collective :  History of Affinity groups]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Affinity groups appeared again in the U.S. anti-war movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The term was used by [[Ben Morea]] and the group [[Black Mask (NYC)|Black Mask]]. Later, [[Peace movement|anti-war]] activists on college campuses organized around their interests or backgrounds -- [[religion|religious]], [[gender]], [[ethnic group]], etc. They became popular in the 1970s in the [[anti-nuclear]] movement in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. The 30,000 person occupation and blockade of the Ruhr nuclear power station in Germany in 1969 was organized on the Affinity group model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starhawk.org/activism/trainer-resources/affinitygroups.html Starhawk.org : Affinity groups]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uproot.info/affinity.html Uproot : Affinity groups]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the structure is used by many different activists: [[animal rights]], [[environmentalism|environmental]], [[anti-war]], and [[anti-globalization]], to name some examples.

The 1999 [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|protests in Seattle]] which shut down the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]] included coordinated organization by many clusters of Affinity groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidc.org.za/?q=book/view/136 Seattle prepares for battle - Trade before freedom]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===External===
By definition, Affinity groups are [[Autonomy|autonomous]]. Co-ordinated effort and co-operation amongst several Affinity groups, however, is often achieved by using a loose form of [[confederation]]. 

*''Cluster'': The cluster is the basic unit of organization amongst Affinity groups. A cluster consists of several Affinity groups and is organized in a non-hierarchical manner. A cluster can be permanent, but is more often an [[ad hoc]] grouping organized for one specific task or action. One can be organized around a shared goal (e.g. [[Blockade|blockading]] a particular road), a common ideology (e.g. [[Religious Society of Friends|the Quakers]]) or a place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rantcollective.net/article.php?id=31  Rant Collective :  Clusters and Spokes Councils]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinspokes.org/glossary.shtml Austinspokes.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Spokescouncil]]'': The spokescouncil is an aggregate of clusters and Affinity groups. Each Affinity group or cluster nominates one representative (often called a &quot;spoke&quot;) to participate in the council. Spokescouncils are most often temporary bodies, committed to accomplishing one task or event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinspokes.org/spokescouncil.shtml Austinspokes.org What is a spokescouncil?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal===
Affinity groups tend to be loosely organized, however there are some  formal roles or positions that commonly occur. A given Affinity group may have all, some or none of these positions. They may be permanent or temporary and the group may opt to take turns in these roles, or assign one role to one person.

*''Spoke'': The individual charged with representing the Affinity group at a spokescouncil or cluster meeting; roughly the same as a [[spokesman]] but without [[gender]] assumptions. Occasionally, the spoke will be granted a more general [[ambassador]]ial role by the Affinity group.

*''Facilitator'': A person or people who perform [[Facilitation (business)|facilitation]] duties in [[consensus decision-making|consensus process]] of the group and also, to varying degrees, act as arbiter of internal conflicts.

*''Media contact'': An individual who represents the group to the [[mass media]]. Often this individual is the same person as the Spoke.

*''Vibe watch'': A person or people charged with monitoring the [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and [[feeling]] of the group. The reference is to ''vibrations'' in the colloquial emotional sense. In some Affinity groups, the vibe watch is also charged with keeping the facilitator from using his or her role to favor any position or proposal.

*''Snap-decision facilitator'': Also called &quot;quick decision facilitator&quot;, this is a person charged with making decisions for the group in time-constrained or high-pressure situations. The position is rare and is almost always temporary (contrast with the pre-Imperial Roman concept of a temporary [[dictator]]).
