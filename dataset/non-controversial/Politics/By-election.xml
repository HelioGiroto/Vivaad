A '''by-election''' (occasionally also spelled '''bye-election''', and known in the [[United States]] and the [[Philippines]] as a '''special election''') is an [[election]] held to fill a political office that has become vacant between regularly scheduled elections.

Usually, a by-election occurs when the incumbent has died or [[resign]]ed. It may also occur when the incumbent becomes ineligible to continue in office, for example because of a [[recall election|recall]], [[Nobility|ennoblement]], a serious criminal conviction, failure to maintain a minimum attendance, [[bankruptcy]] or [[Mental breakdown|mental incapacity]]. By-elections have also been called as a result of a constituency election being invalidated by voting irregularities; see [[Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election, 2011|Oldham East and Saddleworth election petition]].

Historically, members of some parliaments were required to seek re-election upon being appointed to a [[political minister|ministerial]] post. The subsequent by-elections were termed '''ministerial by-elections'''. These by-elections were usually a formality as they were normally, but not always, uncontested by opposition parties. The requirement for [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) to resign their seats and re-offer upon being appointed to [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] was done away with as an anachronism in most [[Westminster system]]s by the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Re-election was required under the Succession to the Crown Act 1707. The Re-Election of Ministers Act 1919 severely restricted the necessity to seek re-election on appointment to government office. The Re-Election of Ministers Act (1919) Amendment Act 1926 ended the practice. http://www.election.demon.co.uk/causes.html (19/10/2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In single-member constituencies==
By-elections are held in most nations that elect their parliaments through single-member [[constituencies]], whether [[Two-round system|with]] or [[first-past-the-post election system|without]] a [[runoff election|runoff]] round. This includes most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Pakistan]], as well as non-Commonwealth countries such as [[France]]. In the United States they are called special elections, and are held when a seat in [[United States Congress|Congress]], a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] or at the local level becomes vacant.

==In multi-member constituencies==
When one seat in a [[proportional representation]] constituency becomes vacant, the consequences vary. For example, a by-election may be held to fill just the vacancy or all the seats in the constituency become up for grabs in the by-election held.

[[Scotland]] and [[New Zealand]] still hold by-elections, despite having adopted the [[mixed-member proportional representation]] system, in which members are also chosen by [[party list]]s. In both countries, actual by-elections where voters go to the polls to vote for their preferred candidate only take place to fill a vacancy in a constituency seat, such as on the death of [[Donald Dewar]], which resulted in a by-election for the constituency of [[Glasgow Anniesland]]. In the event of the vacancy arising from the death or resignation of a list member, the next unelected candidate on the party list is offered the seat, and upon accepting, is elected. If the next unelected candidate has died or declines the offer, it is offered to each subsequent candidate on the list until one accepts the seat, such as was the case upon the resignation of [[Darren Hughes]] in March 2011, where [[Louisa Wall]] was elected after the five list candidates above her on the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]'s list declined the seat. The [[Republic of Ireland]] holds by-elections despite electing members in multi-member constituencies by the [[single transferable vote]].

Alternatives to holding a by-election include:
# having a recount of the votes of the vacating member{{clarify|date=December 2011}}{{examples|date=November 2012}}
# choosing from those losing candidates from the previous election, who choose to contest the recount to fill the vacancy, as in [[Tasmania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral.tas.gov.au/pages/ElectoralInformation/HareClark.html|title=Tasmania's Hare-Clark Electoral System}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Australian Capital Territory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections_and_voting/casual_vacancies_in_the_legislative_assembly|title=Casual Vacancies in the Legislative Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# keeping the seat vacant until the next [[general election]]. This usually occurs if a vacancy arises shortly before a planned general election (within six months in New Zealand).
# nominating another candidate with the same affiliation as the one whose seat has become vacant – typically, in list systems, the next candidate on the party list.

For the Australian Senate (where each State forms a multi-seat constituency voting by [[single transferable vote]]), the State Parliament appoints a replacement; in 1977 a referendum amended the Constitution to require that the person appointed must belong to the same political party (if any) as the Senator originally elected to that seat. Those Australian States with an Upper House elected by PR-STV (NSW, Victoria and South Australia) copy the federal Senate model, except for Western Australia, which holds a recount of ballots with sitting members being immune from defeat).

==Consequences==
By-elections can become crucial when the ruling party has only a small margin. In [[parliament]]ary systems, party discipline is strong enough so that the one common scenario for a [[vote of no confidence]] to occur is after the governing party loses enough by-elections to become a [[minority government]]. Examples include the [[Callaghan Ministry|Labour government of James Callaghan 1976–1979]] and the [[Major Ministry|Conservative government of John Major 1992–1997]]. In the United States, [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|Scott Brown's election]] in 2010 ended the [[filibuster]]-proof majority formerly enjoyed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].

By-elections can also be important if a minority party needs to gain one or more seats in order to gain [[official party status]] or the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in a minority or coalition situation. For example, [[Andrea Horwath]]'s win in an [[Ontario]] provincial by-election in 2004 allowed the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|Ontario NDP]] to regain official party status with important results in terms of parliamentary privileges and funding.

===As harbingers and breakthroughs===
By-election upsets can have a psychological impact by creating a sense of momentum for one party or a sense of impending defeat for a government. [[Deborah Grey]]'s 1989 by-election victory in [[Beaver River (electoral district)|Beaver River]] was seen as evidence that the newly formed [[Reform Party of Canada]] would be a serious political contender and that it posed a serious political threat for the ruling [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]]. It also provided important momentum for the new party. Similarly, the upset 1960 by-election victory of [[Walter Pitman]] in [[Peterborough (electoral district)|Peterborough]] as a &quot;[[New Party (Canada)|New Party]]&quot; candidate was seen as a significant boost for the movement to replace the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] with an unnamed &quot;New Party&quot; which would be integrated with the labour movement. Pitman's candidacy in a riding in which the CCF was traditionally weak was seen as a test of this concept and his upset victory was used to convince the CCF and the labour movement to proceed with the founding of the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP).

By-elections may occur singly, or in small bunches, especially if the authority responsible for calling them has discretion over the timing and can procrastinate. They are sometimes bunched to save money as holding multiple by-elections is likely to cost more than holding a by-election to fill the vacancies all at once. In Canada, in 1978, 15 by-elections were held on a single date, restoring the House of Commons to 264 members. The media called it a &quot;mini-election&quot;, a test of the Liberal government's popularity with a general election due in less than a year. The 15 districts stretched from Newfoundland to British Columbia, and produced some unexpected results, for example, an NDP candidate winning in Newfoundland for the first time.

===Upsets===
In Canada, the most recent example of a cabinet minister appointed from outside of parliament having to resign after losing a by-election was in 1975 when Minister of Communications [[Pierre Juneau]] was appointed to [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s Liberal cabinet directly from the private sector and tried to enter parliament through a by-election in [[Hochelaga (electoral district)|Hochelaga]]. Juneau was upset by the Progressive Conservative candidate and resigned from cabinet ten days after his by-election defeat.

General [[Andrew McNaughton]] was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Defence on November 1, 1944 without having a seat in parliament after his predecessor resigned during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]. A by-election was arranged in [[Grey North]] which the opposition Progressive Conservative party contested. The major campaign issue became the government's policy of &quot;limited conscription&quot; during World War II which McNaughton supported and which the Conservatives counterposed with a call for &quot;full conscription&quot;. McNaughton was upset in the February 5, 1945 by-election. As a result, with confidence in his government undermined, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] called the [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945 federal election]] several weeks later when he had originally intended to wait until after the end of the war. McNaughton sought a seat in the federal election and resigned after he was again defeated.

In 1942, new Conservative Party leader [[Arthur Meighen]] sought to enter the Canadian House of Commons through a by-election in [[York South]]. His surprise defeat at the hand of [[Joseph Noseworthy]] of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] ended his political career, and may also have been a factor in the Conservative Party's decision to move to the left and rebrand itself the Progressive Conservative Party under Meighen's replacement. Noseworthy's victory was also a significant breakthrough for the CCF giving it credibility as a national party where it has previously been seen as a Western Canadian regional protest party.

In the Canadian province of Ontario, [[John Tory]], leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] ran in a 2009 by-election in [[Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock (provincial electoral district)|Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock]], after he convinced one of his caucus members to step down, in hopes of re-entering the [[Ontario legislature]]. His by-election defeat resulted in his resignation as party leader.

A [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|Massachusetts special Senate election]] held in January 2010 produced a significant upset when [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Scott Brown]] won the [[United States Senate]] seat formerly held  for 48 years by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] stalwart [[Ted Kennedy]]. Republicans term the result the &quot;Massachusetts Miracle&quot; and argue that it is a harbinger of a revival in the party's fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2010/01/025437.php |title=Power Line - More historical perspective on the Massachusetts miracle |publisher=Powerlineblog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=10:12 EST |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/A-Massachusetts-Miracle_-8746772-81097297.html |title=Hugh Hewitt: A Massachusetts miracle? |work=[[The Washington Examiner]] |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malkin |first=Michelle |url=http://michellemalkin.com/2010/01/19/massachusetts-miracle-election-night-liveblog/ |title=Massachusetts Miracle: Election night liveblog; Update: BROWN WINS, COAKLEY CONCEDES; Brown victory speech cheers: &quot;41!41!41!&quot; |publisher=Michelle Malkin |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1986 Northern Ireland by-elections===
{{main|Northern Ireland by-elections, 1986}}
In [[Northern Ireland]] there were fifteen by-elections held on 23 January 1986, to fill vacancies in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] caused by the resignation in December 1985 of all sitting [[Unionist (Ireland)|Unionist]] [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs). The MPs, from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]], did this to highlight their opposition to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]].  Each of their parties agreed not to contest seats previously held by the others, and each outgoing MP stood for re-election. All but one of the Unionists were re-elected, many with extremely large majorities, against pro-Agreement or in some cases [[Irish Republican]] opponents. In some seats, a fictitious candidate named after [[Peter Barry]], the Irish [[foreign minister]] appeared on the ballot paper. The largest of all majorities went to [[Ian Paisley]] in [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|North Antrim]]. He won 97.4% of the vote, the highest percentage polled by any candidate in a UK by-election since the [[Middleton and Prestwich by-election, 1940|1940 Middleton and Prestwich by-election]].

The sole exception to this pattern was the Newry and Armagh by-election, where [[Seamus Mallon]] of the [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] and pro Anglo-Irish Agreement [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) was able to take the seat. The results of the fifteen by-elections were cited by Unionists as a rejection of the Agreement by the Northern Irish electorate, but the action did not succeed in persuading the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] to repeal the accord.

===2010 Hong Kong by-elections===
{{main|Hong Kong by-election, 2010 }}
Territory-wide by-elections were held on 16 May 2010 in [[Hong Kong]]. The by-elections were triggered by the resignation of five members of the [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]], one each from the territory's five constituencies, three of them from the [[League of Social Democrats]], and the other two from the [[Civic Party]]. It was meant to be a ''de facto'' referendum on the territory's electoral reform.

Thirty seats in the 60-seat legislature are elected from &quot;[[geographical constituencies]]&quot;. As in 2010 there were five multi-member constituencies. Elections are held using the [[largest remainder method]] of the [[proportional representation]] system. A by-election is necessary whenever a seat is vacant.
