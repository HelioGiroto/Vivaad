'''Socialist Resistance (SR)''' is a [[Trotskyist]] and [[ecosocialist]] organisation in Britain which publishes a [[Marxist]] periodical of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?auteur68 &quot;Socialist Resistance&quot;] ''[[International Viewpoint]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 the [[International Socialist Group]] (ISG) merged into it, making SR the British Section of the [[Fourth International (Post-Reunification)|Fourth International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?rubrique8 &quot;We are now part of Socialist Resistance&quot;] ''[[International Socialist Group]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
It was launched on 8 September 2002 by two organisations, the [[Socialist Solidarity Network]] (SSN) and [[International Socialist Group]] (ISG), and 33 individuals. 

The founders of Socialist Resistance included [[Frances Curran]] and [[Catriona Grant]], leading members of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], Murray Smith, former SSP international officer and Andrew Burgin from  of the [[Stop the War Coalition]], leading members of the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] included James White, secretary of Barnsley Alliance, Mathew Caygill secretary of Leeds Socialist Alliance plus [[Lesley Mahmood]] (Liverpool) and Margaret Manning (Manchester) from the Socialist Alliance Executive.

==Organisation==
Founded as a network it developed the norms of an organisation, included elected bodies, local groups and formal membership. By 2007 135 activists had subscribed to its internal listserver [http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/resistancesupportersgroup/], of whom around at least 65 could be assumed to have been members of the ISG [http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/Socialist_Outlook/]; and at least 20 of whom were supporters of the SSN [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Socialist-solidarity/]. Its members also include former supporters in Britain of the [[Democratic Socialist Perspective]]. 

In July 2009 Socialist Resistance adopted a constitution and a more extensive political basis. The organisation is controlled by an annual conference to which one delegate is elected for every three members. It elects a National Committee and an Appeals Committee (a [[control commission]]). The National Committee appoints sub-committees, including an executive and an editorial board.

==Activities==
It organises monthly public meetings in London, Oxford and Birmingham, as well as national open forums each year. For example, it organised a June 2006 dayschool on the [[Bolivarian revolution]] addressed by [[Michael Lowy]] and [[Celia Hart]], a September 2006 annual general meeting,  December 2006 and May 2007 forums on &quot;[[ecosocialism]]&quot; and a March 2007 forum on the [[Middle East]]. These events often provide themes for books published by Resistance: it produced the first book of Celia Hart's writings in English, [[Ron Ridenour]]'s 2006 book on Cuba, the first book on ecosocialism and a large collection on the Middle East, edited by [[Roland Rance]] and [[Terry Conway]].

In September 2009, Socialist Resistance, together with [[Green Left (UK)|Green Left]], organised a seminar on Climate and Capitalism, with [[Ian Angus]] as the main speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistresistance.org/?p=662|title=Videos show speeches and discussions at ecosocialist seminar|date=2009-09-19|publisher=Socialist Resistance|accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance also publishes irregular broadsheets and pamphlets. Three leading activists in Resistance are on the editorial board of ''[[International Viewpoint]]''. Socialist Resistance also co-operates with [[Green Left (Green Party of England and Wales)|Green Left]] and the Red-Green Study Group in the Ecosocialist International Network.

==Periodical==
[[Image:socialistresistance.jpg|90px|right|Socialist Resistance was launched in 2002]]
The rationale for the new publication was &quot;(...) to express and build support for a distinct political position which, despite differences among us on secondary issues, we share. We want to deepen the fight for a broad socialist party in England on the model of, for example, the [[Scottish Socialist Party|SSP]] in Scotland and the [[Party of Communist Refoundation]] in Italy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article39 &quot;A new paper on the left,&quot;] ''Socialist Resistance'', SR00 (October 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between September 2002 and November 2007 it produced 49 issues of a 28-page tabloid which was produced monthly, with summer and winter issues spanning two months each. In November 2007, the resources used for the newspaper were dedicated to the Respect Renewal movement, allowing it to plan the launch of a newspaper in December 2007. According to a statement by the group's Steering Committee, the change was unanimously agreed at a meeting of the group's members. In January 2008, the group's aggregate agreed to relaunch ''Socialist Resistance'' as a colour quarterly magazine in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Mac Uaid, ''Socialist Resistance: what next?'', November 27, 2007  http://liammacuaid.wordpress.com/2007/11/27/socialist-resistance-what-next/&lt;/ref&gt;
