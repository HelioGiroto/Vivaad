{{Politics}}
The '''Inter-Parliamentary Union''' ('''IPU'''; {{lang-fr|L'Union Interparlementaire (UIP)}}) is an international organization established in 1889 by [[William Randal Cremer]] ([[United Kingdom]]) and [[Frédéric Passy]] ([[France]]). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]], but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 162 countries are members of the IPU, and 10 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/english/membshp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The IPU has permanent [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Other entities|observer status at the United Nations]].

==History==
Eight leading personalities of the IPU have received [[Nobel Peace Prize]]s:

*1901: [[Frédéric Passy]] (France)
*1902: [[Charles Albert Gobat]] (Switzerland)
*1903: [[Randal Cremer]] (United Kingdom)
*1908: [[Fredrik Bajer]] (Denmark)
*1909: [[Auguste Marie François Beernaert]] (Belgium)
*1913: [[Henri La Fontaine]] (Belgium)
*1921: [[Christian Lous Lange|Christian Lange]] (Norway)
*1927: [[Ferdinand Buisson]] (France)

The organisation's initial objective was the arbitration of conflicts. The IPU played an important part in setting up the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]]. Over time, its mission has evolved towards the promotion of [[democracy]] and inter-parliamentary dialogue. The IPU has worked for establishment of institutions at the inter-governmental level, including the [[United Nations]], an organization with which it cooperates and with which it has permanent observer status.

[[File:Inter-Parliamentary Union Members.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of IPU member states]]
Numerous bodies have expressed interest in the possibility of transforming the IPU into a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], among them the [[Committee for a Democratic UN]], the [[German Bundestag]] and the [[Socialist International]]. The [[Liberal International]] also considers this as an option.

The headquarters of the union have been moved several times since its inception.
Locations:
*1892–1911: [[Bern]] (Switzerland)
*1911–1914: [[Brussels]] (Belgium)
*1914–1920: [[Oslo]] (Norway)
*1921 – permanent in [[Geneva]] (Switzerland)

==The IPU and the United Nations==

The IPU marked the 50th anniversary of the United Nations by holding a special session in the [[United Nations Headquarters|General Assembly Hall]] before the start of the session,&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_A50561_page2&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-50-561 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=50 |document_number=561 |highlight=rect_158,350_882,609 |page=2 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they planned for closer cooperation with the United Nations.  The [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution|General Assembly Resolution]] passed during that session requested the Secretary-General to put this into action.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES5015&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-50-15 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=50 |resolution_number=15 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=22 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An agreement was signed between the IPU and the Secretary-General on 24 July 1996 and subsequently ratified by a General Assembly Resolution, where the United Nations recognizes IPU as the world organization of parliaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_A51402&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-51-402 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=51 |document_number=402 |accessdate=2007-09-10| date=25 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES517&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-51-7 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=51 |resolution_number=7 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=7 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[wikt:Pursuant|Pursuant]] to this resolution, the Secretary-General submitted a report &lt;ref name=&quot;UN_A52456&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-52-456 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=52 |document_number=456 |accessdate=2007-09-10| date=13 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was noted with appreciation by the General Assembly, who requested further strengthening of cooperation and another report.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES527&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-52-7 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=52 |resolution_number=7 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=6 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This report detailed the measures that had been taken, including opening a liaison office in New York, and cooperation on issues such land-mines and the promotion of representative democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_A53458&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-53-458 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=53 |document_number=458 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=5 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following an entire morning of debate&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_A53PV46_1998&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-53-PV.46 |date=28 October 1998 |type=Verbatim Report |body=General Assembly |session=53 |meeting=46 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the General Assembly passed a resolution which simply stated that it &quot;looks forward to continued close cooperation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES5313&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-53-13 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=53 |resolution_number=13 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year (1999) the Secretary-General reported on an increased number of areas of cooperation,&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_A54379&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-54-379 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=54 |document_number=379 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=21 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue was debated for an entire afternoon&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_A54PV41_1999&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-54-PV.41 |date=27 October 1999 |type=Verbatim Report |body=General Assembly |session=54 |meeting=41 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (interrupted by a minute of silence held for tribute to [[Vazgen Sargsyan]], the Prime Minister of [[Armenia]] who had just at that time been [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting|killed by gunmen]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=A-54-PV.41 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbotim Report |session=54 |meeting=41 |page=20 |anchor=pg020-bk02 |date=27 October 1999 |meetingtime=15:00 |speakername=The President |accessdate=2007-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed a resolution requesting the IPU be allowed to address the Millennium General Assembly directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES5412&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-54-12 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=54 |resolution_number=12 |accessdate=2007-09-10| date=18 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

   |anchor=top
|accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the General Assembly welcomed the IPU declaration entitled &quot;The Parliamentary vision for international cooperation at the dawn of the third millennium&quot; and called for the Secretary-General to explore new and further ways in which the relationship could be strengthened.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES5519&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-55-19 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=55 |resolution_number=19 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2002 the IPU was granted [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer status]] to the General Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES5732&quot;&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-57-32 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=57 |resolution_number=32 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Resolution ''59/19, Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union'', the UN General Assembly takes note of the recommendations in regard to engaging parliamentarians more systematically in the work of
the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.ipu.org/Un-e/a-res-59-19.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The final declaration of the Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, hosted at United Nations headquarters, took place in September 2005, was entitled ''Bridging the democracy gap in international relations: A stronger role for parliament''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/splz-e/sp-conf05/declaration.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly, ''61/6, Cooperation between the United Nations and the
Inter-Parliamentary Union'', in 27 November 2006, it calls for ''the further development of the annual parliamentary hearing at the United Nations and other specialized parliamentary meetings in the context of '''major United Nations meetings as joint United Nations-Inter-Parliamentary Union events'''''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;http://www.ipu.org/Un-e/a-61-L6-e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year during the fall session of the General Assembly the IPU organises a Parliamentary Hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/un-e/un-hearings.htm Cooperation with the UN: hearings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU allowed for circulation of official IPU documents in the General Assembly.

UN and the IPU cooperate closely in various fields, in particular peace and security, economic and social development, international law, human rights, and democracy and gender issues, but IPU has not obtained the status of UN General Assembly subsidiary organ.
