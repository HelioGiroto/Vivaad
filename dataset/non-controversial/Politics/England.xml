Most of England comprises the central and southern part of the island of [[Great Britain]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. The country also includes [[List of islands of England|over 100&amp;nbsp;smaller islands]] such as the [[Isles of Scilly]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. 

The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period, but it takes its name from the [[Angles]], one of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in AD&amp;nbsp;927, and since the [[Age of Discovery]], which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= England&amp;nbsp;– Culture|url=http://www.britainusa.com/sections/index_nt1.asp?i=41105&amp;L1=41105&amp;L2=41105&amp;D=0|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516162153/http://www.britainusa.com/sections/index_nt1.asp?i=41105&amp;L1=41105&amp;L2=41105&amp;D=0|archivedate=16 May 2008|publisher=britainusa.com|accessdate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]], the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]], and [[English law]]—the basis for the [[common law]] legal systems of many other countries around the world—developed in England, and the country's [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary system]] of government has been widely adopted by other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1038758.stm |title=Country profile: United Kingdom |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2009 | date=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Global_Warming/Older/Industrial_Revolution.html |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |title=Industrial Revolution|accessdate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; England's [[Royal Society]] laid the foundations of modern experimental science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1058 |title=History of the Royal Society |publisher=royalsociety.org|author=The Royal Society|authorlink=Royal Society|accessdate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there are uplands in the north (for example, the mountainous [[Lake District]], [[Pennines]], and [[Yorkshire Dales]]) and in the south west (for example, [[Dartmoor]] and the [[Cotswolds]]). The former capital of England was [[Winchester]] until replaced by [[London]] in 1066. Today London is the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the largest urban zone in the [[European Union]] by most measures.&lt;ref group= &quot;nb&quot;&gt;According to the [[Eurostat|European Statistical Agency]], London is the largest [[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union|Larger Urban Zone]] which uses conurbations and areas of high population as its definition. A [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|ranking of population]] within municipal boundaries places London first. However, the [[University of Avignon]] in France claims that Paris is first and London second when including the whole urban area and hinterland, that is the [[Largest urban areas of the European Union|outlying cities as well]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demography of England|England's population]] is about 53&amp;nbsp;million, around 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, and is largely concentrated in London, the [[Southeast England|South East]] and conurbations in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], the [[North West England|North West]], the [[North East England|North East]] and [[Yorkshire]], which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century. Meadowlands and pastures are found beyond the major cities.

The [[Kingdom of England]]—which [[Statute of Rhuddlan|after 1284]] included Wales—was a sovereign state until 1&amp;nbsp;May 1707, when the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] put into effect the terms agreed in the [[Treaty of Union]] the previous year, resulting in a political union with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to create the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;William E. Burns, ''A Brief History of Great Britain'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fjf4YynnC90C&amp;pg=PT21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. xxi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/ Acts of Union 1707] parliament.uk. Retrieved 27 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, Great Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] through another [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] to become the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922, the [[Irish Free State]] was established as a separate dominion, but the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] reincorporated into the kingdom six Irish counties to officially create the current [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

== Toponymy{{Anchor|Etymology}} ==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{see also|Toponymy of England}}
The name &quot;England&quot; is derived from the [[Old English]] name ''Englaland'', which means &quot;land of the [[Angles]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=England|title=England|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angles were one of the [[Germanic tribes]] that settled in Great Britain during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Angles came from the [[Angeln]] peninsula in the [[Bay of Kiel]] area of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ripley|1869|p=570}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the first known use of &quot;England&quot; to refer to the southern part of the island of Great Britain occurs in 897, and its modern spelling was first used in 1538.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=England&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=England|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attested mention of the name occurs in the 1st century work by [[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', in which the [[Latin]] word ''Anglii'' is used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |title= Germania|publisher=[[Tacitus]]|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an ''angular'' shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Angle&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=Angle|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the [[Saxons]], came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain ''Angli Saxones'' or English Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crystal|2004| pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scottish Gaelic]], another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (''Sasunn''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=John|title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar|year=1848|publisher=Oliver, Boyd and Tweeddale|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Welsh use &quot;''Saesneg''&quot; - a form derived from &quot;Saxon&quot; - to describe the English language.

An alternative name for England is [[Albion]]. The name ''Albion'' originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain. The earliest record of the name appears in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Corpus Aristotelicum|Corpus]], specifically the 4th century BC ''De Mundo'':&lt;ref name=&quot;massey&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massey|2007|p=440}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]] is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands called Britannia; these are [[Albion]] and [[Ireland|Ierne]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;massey&quot;/&gt; The word ''[[Albion]]'' (Ἀλβίων) or ''insula Albionum'' has two possible origins. It either derives from a cognate of the Latin ''albus'' meaning white, a reference to the [[white cliffs of Dover]], the only part of Britain visible from the European Continent,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Room|2006|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or from the phrase in ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'', the &quot;island of the ''Albiones''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Major|2004|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Albion'' is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foster|1988|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another romantic name for England is [[Lloegyr|Loegria]], related to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word for England, ''Lloegr'', and made popular by its use in [[Arthurian legend]].

[[File:Stonehenge.jpg|thumb|alt=Sun shining through row of upright standing stones with other stones horizontally on the top.|[[Stonehenge]], a [[Neolithic]] [[monument]].]]
The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of ''[[Homo antecessor]]'', dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/the-timeline-of-britain/boxgrove.htm|title=500,000 BC&amp;nbsp;– Boxgrove|accessdate=20 December 2010|work=Current Archaeology|publisher=Current Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans are known to have first inhabited the area during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~sgs04rh/SWRivers/Palaeolithic%20Archaeology%20Teaching%20Resource%20Box_Lifestyles_Basic.pdf|title= Palaeolithic Archaeology Teaching Resource Box|publisher= Palaeolithic Rivers of South-West Britain Project(2006)|accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo-east.org.uk/special_projects/eco_culture.htm|title= Chalk east|publisher= A Geo East Project|accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the last [[Last glacial period|ice age]] only large mammals such as [[mammoth]]s, [[bison]] and [[woolly rhinoceros]] remained. Roughly 11,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sea level was lower than now, and Britain was connected by land to both Ireland and [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tertiaryrivers/tectonics.html |title=Tertiary Rivers: Tectonic and structural background |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.

The [[Beaker culture]] arrived around 2500&amp;nbsp;BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tp.revistas.csic.es/index.php/tp/article/viewFile/5/5|title=Function and significance of Bell Beaker pottery according to data from residue analyses|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that major [[Neolithic]] monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]] were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, both of which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made [[bronze]], and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron [[smelting]] allowed the construction of better [[plough]]s, advancing agriculture (for instance, with [[Celtic field]]s), as well as the production of more effective weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bn88JPk_Fr0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inventions+in+trade#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Reid|first=Struan|title=Inventions and Trade.

According to [[John T. Koch]] and others, England in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]], that included the whole of the British Isles and much of what we now regard as France, together with the Iberian Peninsula. [[Celtic languages]] developed in those areas; [[Tartessian language|Tartessian]] may have been the earliest written Celtic language.&lt;ref name=Koch2009&gt;{{cite book | last = Koch | first = John | title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 (2009)| publisher=Palaeohispanica | year = 2009 | pages = 339–351 | url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf | id = | issn = 1578-5386 | accessdate =17 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko |title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature |year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications |isbn=978-1-84217-410-4 |page=384 |url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |title=A Race Apart: Insularity and Connectivity in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 75, 2009 |year=2008| publisher=The Prehistoric Society |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]], deriving from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, arrived from Central Europe. [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans.

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, with probability lying much earlier. According to [[Bede]], missionaries were sent from Rome by [[Pope Eleuterus|Eleutherius]] at the request of the chieftain [[Lucius of Britain]] in AD 180 to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials which were disturbing the church.

Roman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;james_anglosaxons&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview: Anglo-Saxons, 410 to 800|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/overview_anglo_saxons_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2010|first=Edward|last=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the [[Battle of Mons Badonicus|Battle of Mount Badon]], but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a [[Dark Age]]. The nature and progression of the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] from 597 onwards and by Irish missionaries led by [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Christian Tradition|url=http://www.picturesofengland.com/history/england-history-p4.html|publisher=PicturesofEngland.com|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes between the varying influences represented by these missions ended in victory for the Roman tradition.

During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Wessex]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirby|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyon|1960|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the [[Danes]] culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the [[Danelaw]]. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under [[Æthelstan]] in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by [[Eadred]] in 953. A fresh wave of [[Scandinavia]]n attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013 and again by his son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived [[North Sea]] empire that also included [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1042.

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to divorce, under the [[Acts of Supremacy]] in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the [[Church of England]]. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the [[English Reformation|roots of the split]] were more political than theological.{{#tag:ref|As [[Roger Scruton]] explains, &quot;The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the 'Reformation Parliament' of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not until later make substantial change in doctrine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scruton|1982|p=470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535–1542 acts]].

As part of the United Kingdom, the basic political system in England is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The British Parliamentary System|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A591383|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has not been a [[Government of England]] since 1707, when the [[Acts of Union 1707]], putting into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]], joined England and Scotland to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unionwithscotland&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The first Parliament of Great Britain|url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_02_great.html|publisher=Parliament.uk|accessdate=5 September 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080621165514/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_02_great.html |archivedate = 21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the union England was ruled by [[List of English monarchs|its monarch]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. Today England is governed directly by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], although other [[countries of the United Kingdom]] have [[Devolution|devolved]] governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devolution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/devolution.aspx|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom|date=26 March 2009|author=Cabinet Office|authorlink=Cabinet Office|publisher=cabinetoffice.gov.uk|accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] which is the [[lower house]] of the British Parliament based at the [[Palace of Westminster]], there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lists of MPs|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/ |publisher=Parliament.uk |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010]] the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had won an absolute majority in England's 532 contested seats with 61 seats more than all other parties combined (the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House]] not being counted as a Conservative). However, taking Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales into account this was not enough to secure an overall majority, resulting in a [[hung parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What is a hung parliament?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8427233.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 May 2009 | date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve a majority the Conservative party, headed by [[David Cameron]], entered into a coalition agreement with the third largest party, the [[Liberal Democrats]], led by [[Nick Clegg]].

As the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union, there are elections held regionally in England to decide who is sent as [[Members of the European Parliament]]. The [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament election]] saw the regions of England elect the following MEPs: 23 Conservatives, ten Labour, nine [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), nine Liberal Democrats, two [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] and two [[British National Party]] (BNP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=European Election 2009: UK Results|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_999999.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[devolution]], in which other countries of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and [[Northern Ireland]]—each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various [[regions of England]] would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the [[North East England|North East]] in a referendum, this has not been carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;refreject&quot;/&gt;

One major issue is the [[West Lothian question]], in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on legislation affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Lothian question|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7702326.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This when placed in the context of England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and [[top-up fees|free top-up university fees]],&lt;ref name=&quot;msnmoney&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Scottish people better off?|url=http://money.uk.msn.com/consumer/article.aspx?cp-documentid=6543296|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080417222726/http://money.uk.msn.com/consumer/article.aspx?cp-documentid=6543296|archivedate=17 April 2008|publisher=MSN Money|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to a steady rise in [[English nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=English nationalism 'threat to UK'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/596703.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=9 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested the creation of a [[devolved English parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gordon Brown pressed on English parliament|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article4061785.ece|work=The Times  |location=London|accessdate=5 September 2009 | first=Lorraine | last=Davidson | date=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=English votes for English laws' plan by Tories|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/english-votes-for-english-laws-plan-by-tories-857647.html|accessdate=5 September 2009|work=The Independent  | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Grice | date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law ===
{{Main|English law}}
[[File:Royal courts of justice.jpg|thumb|alt=Ornate grey stone building.|right|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]]]]
The [[English law]] legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of [[common law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/definition2.asp?selected=248 ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal systems used in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~law/ASLH/conferences/2000conference/101900345b.htm |title=The Common Law in the British Empire |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |date=19 October 2000 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States (except [[Louisiana]]). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the [[Courts of England and Wales]] continued, under the [[Treaty of Union]], as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in [[court]]s, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[legal precedent]]—''[[stare decisis]]''—to the facts before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] for civil cases, and the [[Crown Court]] for criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in [[England and Wales]]. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judicial functions]] of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=DCA.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime increased between 1981 and 1995, but fell by 42% in the period 1995–2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime over the last 25 years |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |publisher=HomeOffice.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it the [[List of countries by incarceration rate|highest incarceration rate]] in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimebbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=New record high prison population |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7235438.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]], reporting to the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], manages most [[prisons in England|prisons]], housing over 80,000 convicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimebbc&quot; /&gt;

{{England Ceremonial Counties Labelled Map|Londonprefix = Greater|WMsuffix = (county)|float=right|width=400}}

The [[subdivisions of England]] consist of up to four levels of [[administrative division|subnational division]] controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of [[local government in England|local government]]. The highest tier of local government were the nine [[regions of England]]: [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]], [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[East of England|East]], [[South East England|South East]], [[South West England|South West]], and London. These were created in 1994 as [[Government Office]]s, used by the British Government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional Government offices were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiers shed as regional government offices disappear|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/29/regional-government-disappears-1500-jobs-lost |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=16 June 2011 |location=London |first=Hilary |last=Cooper |date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same boundaries remain in use for electing [[Members of the European Parliament]] on a regional basis.

After [[devolution]] began to take place in other parts of the United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] as a counterweight. [[Greater London Authority referendum, 1998|London accepted]] in 1998: the [[London Assembly]] was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the [[northern England devolution referendums, 2004]] in the North East, further referendums were cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;refreject&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece |work=The Times  |location=London |accessdate=5 September 2009 | first=Jill | last=Sherman | coauthors=Andrew Norfolk | date=5 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective [[Regional Development Agency|Regional Development Agencies]] and a new system of [[local authority leaders' board]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prosperous Places|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/citiesandregions/pdf/1073344.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ln5KtF1u|archivedate=5 December 2009 |publisher=communities.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009 |author=Department for Communities and Local Government|authorlink=Department for Communities and Local Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the regional level, all of England is divided into 48 [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicagov&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2002|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the [[Middle Ages]], with some established as recently as 1974.&lt;ref name=maud&gt;{{harvnb|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff]]; these posts are used to represent the [[British monarch]] locally.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicagov&quot; /&gt; Outside [[Greater London]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]], England is also divided into 83 [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties]]; these correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government&lt;ref name=&quot;localgov&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|2009|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.

There are six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;localgov&quot; /&gt; In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the [[metropolitan borough]]s. Elsewhere, 27 [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan &quot;shire&quot; counties]] have a [[county council]] and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or sparsely populated counties; they are known as [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]]. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 [[London borough]]s, plus the [[City of London]] covering a small area at the core, governed by the [[City of London Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Axford|2002|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the most localised level, much of England is divided into [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es with [[Parish councils in England|councils]]; they do not exist in Greater London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|2009|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]]. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom—[[Anglo Scottish border|to the north]] by Scotland and [[Wales-England border|to the west]] by Wales.

In geological terms, the [[Pennines]], known as the &quot;backbone of England&quot;, are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the [[Paleozoic Era]] around 300&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/220026/pennines.html|title=Pennines|publisher=Smmit Post|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their geological composition includes, among others, [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]], and also coal. There are [[karst]] landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of Yorkshire and [[Derbyshire]]. The Pennine landscape is high [[moorland]] in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain three [[national parks in England|national parks]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], [[Northumberland National Park|Northumberland]], and the [[Peak District]]. The highest point in England, at {{convert|978|m|ft}}, is [[Scafell Pike]] in Cumbria.&lt;ref name=&quot;metoffice_nw&quot; /&gt; Straddling the border between England and Scotland are the [[Cheviot Hills]].

The [[English Lowlands beech forests|English Lowlands]] are to the south of the Pennines, consisting of green rolling hills, including the [[Cotswold Hills]], [[Chiltern Hills]], [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]—where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the [[cliffs of Dover]]. The granite Southwest Peninsula in the [[West Country]] includes upland moorland, such as [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]], and enjoys a [[Climate of south-west England|mild climate]]; both are national parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus|title=National Parks&amp;nbsp;– About us|publisher=nationalparks.gov.uk|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Department for Transport]] is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. There are many [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorways in England]], and many other trunk roads, such as the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 Great North Road]], which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle&lt;ref name=&quot;roads&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|UK Parliament|2007|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the [[M6 motorway|M6]], from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] through the [[North West England|North West]] up to the [[Anglo-Scottish border]].&lt;ref name=&quot;roads&quot; /&gt; Other major routes include: the [[M1 motorway|M1]] from London to Leeds, the [[M25 motorway|M25]] which encircles London, the [[M60 motorway|M60]] which encircles Manchester, the [[M4 motorway|M4]] from London to South Wales, the [[M62 motorway|M62]] from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the [[M5 motorway|M5]] from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.&lt;ref name=&quot;roads&quot; /&gt;

[[Bus]] transport across the country is widespread; major companies include [[National Express Group|National Express]], [[Arriva]] and [[Go-Ahead Group]]. The red [[double-decker bus]]es in London have become a symbol of England. There is a [[rapid rail]] network in two English cities: the [[London Underground]]; and the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubwhite&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several tram networks, such as the [[Blackpool tramway]], [[Manchester Metrolink]], [[Sheffield Supertram]] and [[Midland Metro]], and the Tramlink system centred on Croydon in South London.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubwhite&quot; /&gt;

[[Rail transport in England]] is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/johnmoore/1825/sept_27.htm|title=27 September 1825&amp;nbsp;– Opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway|publisher=The Stockton and Darlington Railway|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Britain's {{convert|16116|km|mi}} of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively, although a high proportion of railway lines were closed in the second half of the 20th century. There are plans to reopen lines such as the [[Varsity Line]] between Oxford and Cambridge. These lines are mostly standard gauge ([[single track (rail)|single]], [[double track|double]] or [[quadruple track]]) though there are also a few [[British narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge lines]]. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the [[Channel Tunnel]], which was completed in 1994.

England has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], which is the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|world's busiest airport measured by number of international passengers]].&lt;ref name=wsj230211&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110223-710213.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0OE2ky|archivedate=19 May 2011|title=Delta Expects New Slots To Foster Growth At Heathrow Airport|accessdate=23 March 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal| date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large airports include [[Manchester Airport]], [[London Stansted Airport]], [[Luton Airport]] and [[Birmingham Airport, England|Birmingham Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;airports&quot; /&gt; By sea there is ferry transport, both local and international, including to Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterworks&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Else|2007|p=781}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are around {{convert|7100|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by the [[Canal and River Trust]],&lt;ref name=&quot;waterworks&quot; /&gt; however water transport is very limited. The [[river Thames|Thames]] is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the [[Port of Tilbury]] in the Thames Estuary, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterworks&quot; /&gt;

The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) is the [[Socialised medicine|publicly funded healthcare system]] in England responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the [[National Health Service Act 1946]]. It was based on the findings of the [[Beveridge Report]], prepared by economist and social reformer [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/beveridge_william.shtml|title=BBC History on William Beveridge|accessdate=5 September 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including [[National Insurance]] payments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00724.pdf | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ln5L5oTN | archivedate=5 December 2009| title=NHS Expenditure in England |format=PDF | work=House of Commons Library | accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/NHScosts/DH_087013| title=NHS costs and exemptions| work=Department of Health| accessdate=5 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health]], who sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]].

=== Language ===
{{Main|English language|English language in England|History of the English language}}
[[File:Anglospeak.svg|thumb|right|The [[English-speaking world]]. Countries in dark blue have a majority of native speakers. Countries in light blue have English as an official language, ''de jure'' or ''de facto''. English is also one of the [[Languages of the European Union|official languages of the European Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EUlang&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/languages-of-europe/doc135_en.htm |title=Official EU languages |date=8 May 2009 |publisher =[[European Commission]] |accessdate=16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As its name suggests, the [[English language]], today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue today. It is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language in the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] branch of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arlotto|1971|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman conquest]], the [[Old English|Old English language]] was displaced and confined to the [[Working class|lower social classes]] as [[Norman language|Norman French]] and [[Latin]] were used by the aristocracy.

By the 15th century, English came back into fashion among all classes, though much changed; the [[Middle English]] form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the [[English Renaissance]], many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2003|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern English]] has extended this custom of flexibility, when it comes to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large part to the [[British Empire]], the English language is the world's unofficial ''[[lingua franca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=English: Not America's Language? |url=http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 | first = Mauro E. | last = Mujica | date = 19 June 2003 | location = Washington DC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080117232711/http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 |archivedate=17 January 2008 |work=The Globalist |accessdate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English language learning and teaching]] is an important [[Economics|economic activity]], and includes [[language schools|language schooling]], [[tourism]] spending, and [[publishing]].

[[File:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|alt=Large yellow stone ornate building with buttresses and square central tower.|right|[[Canterbury Cathedral]], seat of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]]]
Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier, in Gaelic and Roman times. It continued through [[Early Insular Christianity]], and today about 72% of English people identify as Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;statsio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8301|publisher=Statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=5 September 2009|author=Office for National Statistics|authorlink=Office for National Statistics}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest form practised in the present day is [[Church of England|Anglicanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Church of England|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/cofe/cofe_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating from the 16th century [[English Reformation|Reformation]] period, with the 1536 split from Rome over [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] wanting to divorce [[Catherine of Aragon]], and the need for the Bible in the [[English language|English tongue]].  The religion regards itself as both Catholic and [[Reformed]].

There are [[High Church]] and [[Low Church]] traditions, and some Anglicans regard themselves as [[Anglo-Catholics]], after the [[Tractarian movement]]. The monarch of the United Kingdom is a titular leader of the Church, acting as its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]. It has the status of [[established church]] in England. There are around 26&amp;nbsp;million adherents to the Church of England and they form part of the [[Anglican Communion]] with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] acting as the symbolic worldwide head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Anglicanism at a Crossroads|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/896/global-anglicanism-at-a-crossroads|publisher=PewResearch.org|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[List of cathedrals in England and Wales|cathedrals]] and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as [[Westminster Abbey]], [[York Minster]], [[Durham Cathedral]] and [[Salisbury Cathedral]].

[[File:George novgorod.jpg|thumb|alt=Icon of man in armour on white horse fighting black dragon to his left.|left|upright|[[Saint George]], the [[patron saint]] of England]]
The second largest Christian practice is the [[Latin Rite]] of the Catholic Church, which traces its formal, corporate history in England to the 6th century with [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine's mission]] and was the main religion on the entire island for around a thousand years. Since its reintroduction after the [[Catholic Emancipation]], the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]] basis where there are 4.5&amp;nbsp;million members (most of whom are English).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=People here 'must obey the laws of the land'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1578212/People-here-must-obey-the-laws-of-the-land.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|accessdate=5 September 2009 | date=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been one Pope from England to date, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]]; while saints [[Bede]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] are regarded as [[Doctors of the Church]].

A form of [[Protestantism]]  known as [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodism]] is the third largest Christian practice and grew out of Anglicanism through [[John Wesley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Methodist Church|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/methodist_1.shtml|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained popularity in the [[mill town]]s of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], and amongst tin miners in [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguae-celticae.org/dateien/Independent_Study_on_Cornish_Language.pdf|title=AN INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC STUDY ON CORNISH|page= 8|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other [[non-conformist]] minorities, such as [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[The Salvation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridge History of Christianity|url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521815000&amp;ss=exc|publisher=Hugh McLeod|accessdate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patron saint of England is [[Saint George]]; his symbolic cross is included in the flag of England, as well as in the Union Flag as part of a combination.&lt;ref name=&quot;flaghistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– History of the Flag|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/gb-hist.html|publisher=FlagSpot.net|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flaghistory&quot; /&gt; There are many other English and associated saints; some of the best known include: [[Cuthbert]], [[Saint Alban|Alban]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], [[Edward the Confessor]], [[John Fisher]], [[Thomas More]], [[Saint Petroc|Petroc]], [[Saint Piran|Piran]], [[Margaret Clitherow]] and [[Thomas Becket]].

The [[Department for Education]] is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gearon|2002|p=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State-run and -funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2003|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, a minority are [[faith school]]s, primarily Church of England or Catholic. Between three and four is nursery school, 4 and 11 is primary school, and 11 to 16 is secondary school. After finishing compulsory education, pupils take a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] examination, following which they may decide to continue in [[further education]] for two years. [[List of further education colleges in England|Further education colleges]], such as [[sixth form colleges]] are either separate or attached to the secondary school institution and prepare students to sit [[A-Level]] examinations, for [[higher education]] at universities.

Although most English secondary schools are [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], in some areas there are selective intake [[grammar school]]s, to which entrance is subject to passing the [[eleven plus exam]].

=== Architecture ===
[[File:St Pauls Cathedral, London.jpg|thumb|alt=White stone building with tower topped with a dome. In the foreground are trees and a red rectangular vertical box with windows.|right|upright|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[English Baroque]]]]
Many ancient [[standing stone]] monuments were erected during the prehistoric period, amongst the best known are [[Stonehenge]], [[Devil's Arrows]], [[Rudston Monolith]] and [[Castlerigg stone circle|Castlerigg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/index.htm|publisher=Stone-Circles.org.uk|title=The Prehistoric Sites of Great Britain|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of [[Ancient Roman architecture]] there was a development of [[basilicas]], [[Roman baths|baths]], [[amphitheaters]], [[triumphal arch]]es, [[villa]]s, [[Roman temple]]s, [[Roman road]]s, [[Roman fort]]s, [[stockade]]s and [[aqueduct]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.castles.me.uk/ancient-roman-architecture-england-wales.htm|publisher=Castles.me.uk|title=Ancient Roman architecture in England and Wales|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best known example is [[Hadrian's Wall]] stretching right across northern England.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman&quot; /&gt; Another well preserved example is the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] at [[Bath, Somerset]].&lt;ref name=&quot;roman&quot; /&gt;

[[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Early Medieval architecture's]] secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with [[thatch]] for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of [[Early Christian Ireland|Hiberno]]—[[Germanic Christianity|Saxon]] [[monasticism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|1985|p=326}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pevsner|1942|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] [[basilica]] and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various [[Castles in England]] were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best known medieval castles include the [[Tower of London]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Durham Castle]] and [[Windsor Castle]] amongst others.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Broadway tower edit.jpg|thumb|alt=Yellow stone tower with two circular turrets which run the height of the building.|left|The [[Broadway Tower]] is a [[folly]], or mock tower, in [[Worcestershire]].]]
Throughout the Plantagenet era an [[English Gothic architecture]] flourished—the [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|medieval cathedrals]] such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[York Minster]] are prime examples.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the [[Norman architecture|Norman base]] there was also [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[List of historic houses in England|great houses]], universities and [[parish church]]es. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]]; the four-centred arch, now known as the [[Tudor arch]], was a defining feature as were [[wattle and daub]] houses domestically. In the aftermath of the [[Renaissance]] a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity, synthesised with Christianity appeared—the [[English Baroque]] style, architect [[Christopher Wren]] was particularly championed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Downes|2007|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgian architecture]] followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the [[Royal Crescent]] at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of [[romanticism]] during Victorian period, a [[Gothic Revival]] was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as [[The Crystal Palace]]. Since the 1930s various [[modernist architecture|modernist]] forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.{{#tag:ref|While people such as [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] and [[Richard Rogers]] represent the modernist movement, [[Prince Charles]] since the 1980s has voiced strong views against it in favour of traditional architecture and put his ideas into practice at his [[Poundbury]] development in Dorset.&lt;ref name=ArchCon4&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8045027.stm|publisher=BBC News| title=Architects to hear Prince appeal | date=12 May 2009| accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects like [[Raymond Erith]], [[Francis Johnson (architect)|Francis Johnson]] and [[Quinlan Terry]] continued to practice in the classical style.|group=nb}}

English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include [[pixie]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf]]s, [[bogeymen]], [[troll]]s, [[goblin]]s and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, for instance the tales featuring [[Offa of Angel]] and [[Wayland the Smith]],&lt;ref name=keary&gt;{{harvnb|Keary|1882|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others date from after the Norman invasion; [[Robin Hood]] and his [[Merry Men]] of [[Sherwood Forest|Sherwood]] and their battles with the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] being, perhaps, the best known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollard|2004|p=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[High Middle Ages]] tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the [[Arthurian myth]].&lt;ref name=woodbbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/arthur_03.shtml |title=King Arthur, 'Once and Future King' |author=Michael Wood|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=higham1&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p=732}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These were derived from [[Anglo-Norman]], French and Welsh sources,&lt;ref name=higham1/&gt; featuring [[King Arthur]], [[Camelot]], [[Excalibur]], [[Merlin]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]] such as [[Lancelot]]. These stories are most centrally brought together within [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.{{#tag:ref|These tales may have come to prominence, at least in part, as an attempt by the Norman ruling elite to legitimise their rule of the British Isles, finding [[Anglo-Saxon]] history ill-suited to the task during an era when members of the deposed [[House of Wessex]], especially [[Edgar the Ætheling]] and his nephews of the Scottish [[House of Dunkeld]], were still active in the isles.&lt;ref name=higham1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lacy|1986|p=649}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] explains; &quot;Over the centuries the figure of Arthur became a symbol of British history—a way of explaining the matter of Britain, the relationship between the Saxons and the Celts, and a way of exorcising ghosts and healing the wounds of the past.&quot;&lt;ref name=woodbbc/&gt;|group=nb}} Another early figure from [[Britons (historic)|British tradition]], [[King Cole]], may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and [[pseudohistory|pseudo-histories]] make up part of the wider [[Matter of Britain]], a collection of shared British folklore.

[[File:Morris men.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men in bright red clothing holding sticks in the air.|[[Morris dance]], an English [[folk dance]]]]
Some folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries; [[Lady Godiva]] for instance was said to have ridden naked on horseback through [[Coventry]], [[Hereward the Wake]] was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, [[Herne the Hunter]] is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] ghost associated with [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] Forest and [[Windsor Great Park|Great Park]] and [[Mother Shipton]] is the archetypal witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|2004|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November people make bonfires, set off [[fireworks]] and eat [[toffee apple]]s in [[Guy Fawkes Night|commemoration]] of the foiling of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] centred around [[Guy Fawkes]]. The chivalrous bandit, such as [[Dick Turpin]], is a recurring character, while [[Blackbeard]] is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as [[Morris dancing]], [[Maypole dance|Maypole dancing]], [[Rapper sword]] in the North East, [[Long Sword dance]] in Yorkshire, [[Mummers Play]]s, [[bottle-kicking]] in Leicestershire, and [[Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake|cheese-rolling]] at [[Brockworth, Gloucestershire|Cooper's Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2008|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] associated with cockneys, the [[Queen's Guard|Royal Guard]], the [[Morris dance|Morris costume]] and [[Beefeater]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/costume.html|publisher=Woodlands-Junior.kent.sch.uk|title=What is England's national costume?|accessdate=09-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most popular cheeses are [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] and [[Wensleydale (cheese)|Wensleydale]].

[[Middle English literature]] emerged with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], author of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', along with [[John Gower|Gower]], the [[Pearl Poet]] and [[William Langland|Langland]]. [[William of Ockham]] and [[Roger Bacon]], who were [[Franciscans]], were major philosophers of the Middle Ages. [[Julian of Norwich]], who wrote ''[[Revelations of Divine Love]]'', was a prominent Christian mystic. With the [[English Renaissance]] literature in the [[Early Modern English]] style appeared.

It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. [[Wynkyn de Worde]] printed ballads of Robin Hood from the 16th century are an important artefact, as are [[John Playford]]'s ''[[The Dancing Master]]'' and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley's]] ''[[Roxburghe Ballads]]'' collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chappell|1966|p=690}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best known songs are ''The Good Old Way'', ''[[Pastime with Good Company]]'', ''[[Maggie May (traditional song)|Maggie May]]'' and ''[[Spanish Ladies]]'' amongst others. Many [[nursery rhymes]] are of English origin such as ''[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]'', ''[[Roses are red]]'', ''[[Jack and Jill (song)|Jack and Jill]]'', ''[[Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush]]'' and ''[[Humpty Dumpty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lax|1989|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early English composers in classical music include Renaissance artists [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]], followed up by [[Henry Purcell]] from the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]]. German-born [[George Frideric Handel]] became a British subject&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/parliamentary_archives/handel_and_naturalisation.cfm|title=British Citizen by Act of Parliament: George Frideric Handel|month=July | year=2009|work=Parliamentary Archives|publisher=parliament.uk|authorlink=Parliament of the United Kingdom|author=United Kingdom Parliament|accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent most of his composing life in London, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, ''[[Messiah (Handel)|The Messiah]]'', ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'', and ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]''. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Frederick Delius]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stradling|1993|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day composers from England include [[Michael Nyman]], best known for ''[[The Piano]]''.

In the field of [[popular music]] many English bands and solo artists have been cited as the most influential and best-selling musicians of all time. Acts such as [[The Beatles]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Elton John]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Rod Stewart]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] are among the highest selling recording artists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt |title=Top Selling Artists |publisher=riaa.com|author=Recording Industry Association of America|authorlink=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many musical genres have origins or strong associations with England, such as [[British invasion]], [[hard rock]], [[glam rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[mod (subculture)|mod]], [[britpop]], [[drum and bass]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]], [[indie rock]], [[gothic rock]], [[shoegazing]], [[acid house]], [[UK garage]], [[trip hop]] and [[dubstep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Else|2007|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large outdoor [[List of music festivals in the United Kingdom|music festivals]] in the summer and autumn are popular, such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[V Festival]], [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. The most prominent [[opera house]] in England is the [[Royal Opera House]] at [[Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foreman&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Foreman|2005|p=371}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Proms]], a season of [[orchestral]] classical music concerts held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], is a major cultural event held annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;foreman&quot; /&gt; [[The Royal Ballet]] is one of the world's foremost classical ballet companies, its reputation built on two prominent figures of 20th century dance, ''[[prima ballerina]]'' [[Margot Fonteyn]] and choreographer [[Frederick Ashton]].

The St George's Cross has been the national [[flag of England]] since the 13th century. Originally the flag was used by the maritime [[Republic of Genoa]]. The English monarch paid a tribute to the [[Doge of Genoa]] from 1190 onwards, so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.
A red cross was a symbol for many [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became associated with [[Saint George]], along with countries and cities, which claimed him as their [[patron saint]] and used his cross as a banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/stgeorge.html |title=St. George&amp;nbsp;– England's Patron Saint |publisher=Britannia.com |accessdate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the [[Union Flag]], a Pan-British flag designed by King [[James I of England|James I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;flaghistory&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Double Delight (Tudor) Rose.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A red and white flower.|The [[Tudor rose]], England's [[national flower|national floral emblem]]]]
There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the [[Tudor rose]], the nation's [[national emblem|floral emblem]], the two-legged dragon ([[white dragon|wyvern]]) depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry, and the Three Lions featured on the [[Royal Arms of England]]. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the [[Wars of the Roses]] as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flowers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page828|title=National flowers|date=13 January 2003|publisher=Number10.gov.uk|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[syncreticism|syncretic]] symbol in that it merged the white rose of the [[House of York|Yorkists]] and the red rose of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]]—cadet branches of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the ''Rose of England''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbynetwork.net/main/s245/st74325.htm|title=England's Rose&amp;nbsp;– The Official History|last=Smith|first=Jed|date=3 June 2005|work=Museum of Rugby, Twickenham|publisher=RugbyNetwork.net|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[oak|oak tree]] is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The [[Royal Oak]] symbol and [[Oak Apple Day]] commemorate the escape of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.

The Royal Arms of England, a national [[coat of arms]] featuring three lions, originated with its adoption by [[Richard the Lionheart]] in 1198. It is [[blazon]]ed as ''gules, three lions passant guardant or'' and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England; it is similar to the traditional arms of [[Normandy]]. England does not have an official designated national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has ''[[God Save the Queen]]''. However, the following are often considered unofficial English national anthems:
''[[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]]'', ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'' (used for England during the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200208050035 | title=Jason Cowley loves the Commonwealth Games|work=New Statesman | accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]''. England's [[National Day]] is 23 April which is [[St George's Day in England|St George's Day]]: St George is the patron saint of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. George&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date=23 April 1998| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/82166.stm | title=The Great Saint George Revival|publisher=BBC News| accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
