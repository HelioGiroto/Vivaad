:''This article refers to the theoretical discipline. For international studies see [[International relations]]''
'''International relations theory''' is the study of international relations from a theoretical perspective; it attempts to provide a [[Model (abstract)|conceptual framework]] upon which [[international relations]] can be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irtheory.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ole Holsti]] describes international relations theories act as a pair of coloured sunglasses, allowing the wearer to see only the salient events relevant to the theory.  An adherent of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] may completely disregard an event that a [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivist]] might pounce upon as crucial, and vice versa. The three most popular theories are realism, liberalism and constructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

International relations theories can be divided into &quot;[[positivist]]/[[rationalist]]&quot; theories which focus on a principally state-level analysis, and &quot;[[Post-positivism in international relations theory|post-positivist]]/[[reflectivist]]&quot; ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security, ranging from class, to gender, to postcolonial security.  Many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in IR theory, including [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivism]], [[Institutionalism in international relations|institutionalism]], [[Marxist international relations theory|Marxism]], [[neo-Gramscianism]], and others.  However, two [[positivist]] schools of thought are most prevalent: [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[Liberal international relations theory|liberalism]]; though increasingly, [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivism]] is becoming mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Reus-Smit, Christian. &quot;Constructivism.&quot; ''Theories of International Relations'', ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], pp.209, 216. Palgrave, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
{{Further|Great Debates (international relations theory)}}

The study of [[International relations]] as theory can be traced to [[E.H. Carr|E.H. Carr's]] &quot;[[The Twenty Years' Crisis]]&quot; which was published in 1939 and to [[Hans Morgenthau|Hans Morgenthau's]] &quot;[[Politics Among Nations]]&quot; published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Burchill, Scott and Linklater, Andrew &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Theories of International Relations'', ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], p.1. Palgrave, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; International relations as a discipline is believed to have emerged after the First World War with the establishment of a Chair of International Relations at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.&lt;ref&gt;Burchill, Scott and Linklater, Andrew &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Theories of International Relations'', ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], p.6. Palgrave, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Early international relations scholarship in the Interwar years focused on the need for the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] system to be replaced with a system of collective security. These thinkers were later described as &quot;Idealists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burchill, Scott and Linklater, Andrew &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Theories of International Relations'', ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], p.7. Palgrave, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading critique of this school of thinking was the &quot;realist&quot; analysis offered by Carr.

'''Explanatory and constitutive approaches in international relations theory''' is a distinction made when classifying international relations theories. Explanatory theories are ones which see the world as something external to theorize about it. A constitutive theory is one which believes that theories actually help construct the world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,Owens, &quot;Alternative approaches to international theory&quot;, &quot;The Globalisation of World Politics&quot;, Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed p176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Realism==
{{Main|Realism in international relations theory}}

{{Further|Classical realism in international relations theory|Neorealism (international relations)|Offensive realism|Defensive realism|Liberal realism|Neoclassical realism|Postclassical realism|Relative gains|Absolute gains}}
[[Image:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thucydides]] author of [[The Peloponnesian War]] is considered one of the earliest &quot;realist&quot; thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;See Forde,Steven,(1995), 'International Realism and the Science of Politics:Thucydides, Machiavelli and Neorealism,' International Studies Quarterly 39(2):141-160&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Realism in international relations|Realism]] or political realism&lt;ref name=&quot;iep.utm.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/polreal/&lt;/ref&gt; has been the dominant theory of [[international relations]] since the conception of the discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Dunne, Tim and Schmidt, Britain, The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, p&lt;/ref&gt; The theory claims to rely upon an ancient tradition of thought which includes writers such as [[Thucydides]], [[Machiavelli]], and [[Hobbes]].  Early realism can be characterized as a reaction against interwar idealist thinking. The outbreak of [[World War II]] was seen by realists as evidence of the deficiencies of idealist thinking. There are various strands of modern day realist thinking. However, the main tenets of the theory have been identified as statism, survival, and self-help.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

*'''Statism:''' Realists believe that nation  states are the main actors in international politics.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.59&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is a state-centric theory of international relations. This contrasts with liberal international relations theories which accommodate roles for [[non-state actors]] and international institutions. This difference is sometimes expressed by describing a realist world view as one which sees nation states as [[billiard balls]], liberals would consider relationships between states to be more of a [[cobweb theory|cobweb]].

*'''Survival:''' Realists believe that the international system is governed by anarchy, meaning that there is no central authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;iep.utm.edu&quot;/&gt; Therefore, international politics is a struggle for power between self-interested states.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Self-help:''' Realists believe that no other states can be relied upon to help guarantee the state's survival.

Realism makes several key assumptions. It assumes that nation-states are unitary, geographically-based actors in an [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchic]] international system with no authority above capable of regulating interactions between states as no true authoritative [[world government]] exists.  Secondly, it assumes that [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[Sovereign state|states]], rather than IGOs, NGOs or MNCs, are the primary actors in international affairs.  Thus, states, as the highest order, are in competition with one another.  As such, a state acts as a [[rationality|rational]] autonomous actor in pursuit of its own self-interest with a primary goal to maintain and ensure its own security—and thus its sovereignty and survival.  Realism holds that in pursuit of their interests, states will attempt to amass [[Natural resource|resources]], and that relations between states are determined by their relative levels of [[power politics|power]]. That level of power is in turn determined by the state's military, economic, and political capabilities.

Some realists (''human nature realists'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Mearsheimer 2001 25–26&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mearsheimer|first=John|title=The Tragedy of Great Power Politics|year=2001|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-07624-0|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  believe that states are inherently aggressive, that territorial expansion is constrained only by opposing powers, while others (''offensive/defensive realists'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Mearsheimer 2001 25–26&quot;/&gt; believe that states are obsessed with the security and continuation of the state's existence.  The defensive view can lead to a [[security dilemma]] where increasing one's own security can bring along greater instability as the opponent(s) builds up its own arms, making security a zero-sum game where only ''relative gains'' can be made.

=== Neorealism ===
{{Main|Neorealism in international relations}}

{{Further|Anarchy in international relations|Neo-neo synthesis}}

Neorealism or structural realism&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199298334/dunne_chap04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a development of realism advanced by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in ''[[Theory of International Politics]]''. It is, however, only one strand of neorealism. [[Joseph Grieco]] has combined neo-realist thinking with more traditional realists. This strand of theory is sometimes called &quot;modern realism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lamy,Steven, Contemporary Approaches:Neo-realism and neo-liberalism in &quot;The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed,p127&lt;/ref&gt; Waltz's neorealism contends that the effect of structure must be taken into account in explaining state behavior. Structure is defined twofold as a) the ordering principle of the international system which is [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchy]] and b) the distribution of capabilities across units. Waltz also challenges traditional realism's emphasis on traditional military power, instead characterizing power in terms of the combined capabilities of the state.'''&lt;ref&gt;Lamy, Steven, &quot;Contemporary mainstream approaches: neo-realism and neo-liberalism&quot;, The Globalisation of World Politics, Smith, Baylis and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, pp.127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberalism==
{{Main|Liberalism in international relations}}
{{Further|Democratic Peace Theory|List of wars between democracies|Commercial liberalism|Sociological liberalism|Republican liberalism|Institutional liberalism|Neoliberalism}}
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Kant's writings on [[perpetual peace]] were an early contribution to [[Democratic peace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;E Gartzk, Kant we all just get along? Opportunity, willingness, and the origins of the democratic peace, American Journal of Political Science, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The precursor to [[liberal international relations theory]] was &quot;[[idealism (international relations)|idealism]]&quot;. Idealism (or [[utopianism]]) was a critical manner by those who saw themselves as 'realists', for instance [[E. H. Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian C. Schmidt, The political discourse of anarchy: a disciplinary history of international relations, 1998, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; In international relations, idealism (also called &quot;Wilsonianism&quot; because of its association with [[Woodrow Wilson]] who personified it) is a school of thought that holds that a state should make its internal political philosophy the goal of its foreign policy. For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. Wilson's idealism was a precursor to liberal international relations theory, which would arise amongst the &quot;institution-builders&quot; after World War II.

Liberalism holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the primary determinant of state behavior.  Unlike realism, where the state is seen as a unitary actor, liberalism allows for plurality in state actions.  Thus, preferences will vary from state to state, depending on factors such as [[culture]], [[economic system]] or [[Form of government|government type]].  Liberalism also holds that interaction between states is not limited to the political/security (&quot;high politics&quot;), but also economic/cultural (&quot;low politics&quot;) whether through commercial firms, organizations or individuals.  Thus, instead of an anarchic international system, there are plenty of opportunities for cooperation and broader notions of power, such as [[cultural capital]] (for example, the influence of [[film]]s leading to the popularity of the country's culture and creating a market for its exports worldwide).  Another assumption is that [[absolute gain (international relations)|absolute gain]]s can be made through co-operation and [[interdependence]]—thus peace can be achieved.

The [[democratic peace]] theory argues that liberal democracies have never (or almost never) made war on one another and have fewer conflicts among themselves. This is seen as contradicting especially the realist theories and this empirical claim is now one of the great disputes in political science. Numerous explanations have been proposed for the democratic peace. It has also been argued, as in the book ''[[Never at War]]'', that democracies conduct diplomacy in general very differently from nondemocracies.  (Neo)realists disagree with Liberals over the theory, often citing structural reasons for the peace, as opposed to the state's government. [[Sebastian Rosato]], a critic of democratic peace theory points to America's behavior towards left-leaning democracies in Latin America during the [[Cold War]] to challenge democratic peace.&lt;ref&gt;Rosato, Sebastian, The Flawed Logic of Democratic Peace Theory, American Political Science Review, Volume 97, Issue 04, November 2003,  pp.585-602&lt;/ref&gt; One argument is that economic interdependence makes war between trading partners less likely.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, Dale, Economic Interdependence and War: A Theory of Trade Expectations, International Security, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Spring, 1996), pp.5-41&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast realists claim that economic interdependence increases rather than decreases the likelihood of conflict.

===Neoliberalism===
{{Main|Neoliberalism in international relations}}
Neoliberalism, liberal institutionalism or [[neo-liberal institutionalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Sutch, Peter, Elias, 2006, Juanita, International Relations: The Basics, Routledge p.11&lt;/ref&gt;  is an advancement of liberal thinking. It argues that international institutions can allow nations to successfully cooperate in the international system.

=== Post-Liberalism ===
Post-liberal theory argues that within the modern, globalized world, states in fact are driven to cooperate, in order to ensure security and sovereign interests. The departure from classical liberal theory is most notably felt in the re-interpretation of the concepts of [[Sovereignty]] and [[Autonomy]]. Autonomy becomes a problematic concept, shifting away from a notion of freedom of self-determination and agency to a heavily responsibility and duty laden concept. Importantly, autonomy is linked to a capacity for good governance. Similarly, sovereignty also experiences a shift from a right to a duty. In the global economy, [[International organisations]] hold sovereign states to account, leading to a situation where sovereignty is co-produced among 'sovereign' states. The concept becomes a variable capacity of good governance and can no longer be accepted as an absolute right. One possible way to interpret this theory, is the idea that in order to maintain global stability and security and solve the problem of the anarchic world system in International Relations, no overarching, global, sovereign authority is created. Instead, states collectively abandon some rights for full autonomy and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=David|title=International Statebuilding - The Rise of the Post-Liberal Paradigm|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-42118-8|pages=43–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructivism==

{{Further|Feminist constructivism|Ontology|Anarchy is What States Make of It}}

[[Image:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|310px|The standing of [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivism]] as an international relations theory increased after the fall of the [[Berlin wall]] (pictured) and [[Communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Walt, Foreign Policy, No. 110, Special Edition: Frontiers of Knowledge. (Spring, 1998), p.41: &quot;The end of the Cold War played an important role in legitimizing contructivist theories because realism and liberalism failed to anticipate this event and had trouble explaining it.&lt;/ref&gt; as this was something not predicted by the existing mainstream theories.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, Colin (2002) ''Political Analysis: A Critical Introduction'', Basingstoke: Palgrave, P. 198&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Constructivism in international relations|Constructivism]] or [[social constructivism]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199285433/jackson_chap06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as a challenge to the dominance of neo-liberal and neo-realist international relations theories.&lt;ref&gt;Hopf, Ted, The Promise of Constructivism in International Relations Theory, International Security, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Summer, 1998), p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Barnett describes constructivist international relations theories as being concerned with how ideas define international structure, how this structure defines the interests and identities of states and how states and non-state actors reproduce this structure.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barnett, &quot;Social Constructivism&quot; in The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, 4th ed, OUP, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; The key tenet of constructivism is the belief that &quot;International politics is shaped by persuasive ideas, collective values, culture, and social identities.&quot; Constructivism argues that international reality is socially constructed by cognitive structures which give meaning to the material world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alder, Emmanuel 1997, p.319&quot;&gt;Alder, Emmanuel, Seizing the middle ground, European Journal of International Relations, Vol .3, 1997, p.319&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emerged out of debates concerning the scientific method of international relations theories and theories role in the production of international power.&lt;ref&gt;K.M. Ferike, International Relations Theories:Discipline and Diversity, Dunne, Kurki and Smith, OUP, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emanuel Adler]] states that constructivism occupies a middle ground between rationalist and interpretative theories of international relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alder, Emmanuel 1997, p.319&quot;/&gt;

The failure of either realism or liberalism to predict the end of the Cold War boosted the credibility of constructivist theory. Constructivist theory criticises the static assumptions of traditional international relations theory and emphasize that international relations is a social construction. Constructivism is a theory critical of the ontological&lt;ref&gt;In international relations ontology refers to the basic unit of analysis that an international relations theory uses. For example for neorealists humans are the basic unit of analysis&lt;/ref&gt; basis of [[rationalist]] theories of international relations. Whereas realism deals mainly with security and material power, and liberalism looks primarily at economic interdependence and domestic-level factors, [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivism]] most concerns itself with the role of ideas in shaping the international system (indeed it is possible there is some overlap between constructivism and realism or liberalism, but they remain separate schools of thought). By &quot;ideas&quot; constructivists refer to the goals, threats, fears, identities, and other elements of perceived reality that influence states and non-state actors within the international system.  Constructivists believe that these ideational factors can often have far-reaching effects, and that they can trump materialistic power concerns.  For example, constructivists note that an increase in the size of the US military is likely to be viewed with much greater concern in [[Cuba]], a traditional antagonist of the US, than in [[Canada]], a close US ally.  Therefore, there must be perceptions at work in shaping international outcomes.  As such, constructivists do not see [[wiktionary:anarchy|anarchy]] as the invariable foundation of the international system,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irtheory.com/know.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but rather argue, in the words of [[Alexander Wendt]], that &quot;anarchy is what states make of it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, Alexander, &quot;Anarchy is what states make of it: the social construction of power politics&quot; in ''International Organization'', vol. 46, no. 2, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Constructivists also believe that [[social norms]] shape and change foreign policy over time rather than security which realists cite.

==Marxism and Critical Theory==
{{Main|Marxist international relations theory}}
{{See also|World-system theory|Neo-Gramscianism|Critical Theory|New Marxism|Dependency theory}}
[[Image:Gramsci.png|thumb|150px|left|[[Antonio Gramsci|Antonio Gramsci's]] writings on the [[hegemony]] of capitalism have inspired [[Marxist international relations theory|Marxist international relations]] scholarship]]
[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Neo-Marxism|Neo-Marxist]] international relations theories are structuralist paradigms which reject the [[realism in international relations|realist]]/[[Liberal international relations theory|liberal]] view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. Marxist approaches argue the position of [[historical materialism]] and make the assumption that the economic concerns transcend others; allowing for the elevation of ''class'' as the focus of study.  Marxists view the international system as an integrated [[capitalism|capitalist]] system in pursuit of [[capital accumulation]]. A sub-discipline of Marxist IR is [[Critical Security Studies]]. Gramscian approaches rely on the ideas of Italian [[Antonio Gramsci]] whose writings concerned the hegemony that capitalism holds as an ideology. Marxist approaches have also inspired [[Critical Theory|Critical Theorists]] such as [[Robert W. Cox]] who argues that &quot;Theory is always for someone and for some purpose&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Robert, Social Forces, States and World Orders: Beyond International Relations Theory
Cox Millennium - Journal of International Studies.1981; 10: 126-155&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable Marxist approach to international relations theory is [[Immanuel Wallerstein|Immanuel Wallerstein's]] [[World-system theory]] which can be traced back to the ideas expressed by Lenin in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of capitalism. World-system theory  argues that globalized capitalism has created a core of modern industrialized countries which exploit a periphery of exploited &quot;Third World&quot; countries. These ideas were developed by the Latin American [[Dependency School]]. &quot;Neo-Marxist&quot; or &quot;New Marxist&quot; approaches have return to the writings of [[Karl Marx]] for their inspiration. Key &quot;New Marxists&quot; include [[Justin Rosenberg]] and [[Benno Teschke]]. Marxist approaches have enjoyed a renaissance since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.

Criticisms of Marxists approaches to international relations theory include the narrow focus on material and economic aspects of life.

==Feminism==
{{Main|Feminism and international relations theory}}
{{Further|Bananas, Beaches and Bases|International Feminist Journal of Politics}}

Feminist approaches to international relations became popular in the early 1990s. Such approaches emphasises that women's experiences continue to be excluded from the study of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, Marysia, Do We Understand Each Other Yet? Troubling Feminist Encounters With(in) British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations, Volume 9, Issue 2 p.304&lt;/ref&gt; International Relations Feminists who argue that gender relations are integral to international relations focus on the role of diplomatic wives and marital relationship that facilitate sex trafficking. Early feminist IR approaches were part of the &quot;[[Great Debates in international relations theory|Third Great Debate]]&quot; between positivists and post-positivists. They argued against what they saw as the positivism and state-centrism of mainstream international relations. [[Christian Reus-Smit]] argues that these approaches did not describe what a feminist perspective on world politics would look like.

The feminist international relations scholar Jacqui True differentiates between empirical feminism, analytical feminism and normative feminism. Empirical feminism sees women and gender relations as empirical aspects of international relations. It is argued that mainstream international relations emphasis on [[anarchy in international relations theory|anarchy]] and [[Public administration|statecraft]] mean that areas of study that make the reproduction of the state system possible are marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, R. and Newland, K. (eds) (1991) ''Gender and International Relations'', (London).&lt;/ref&gt; Analytical feminism claims that the theoretical framework of international relations has a gender bias. Here gender refers not to the &quot;biological&quot; differences between men and women but the social constructs of masculine and feminine identity.&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, &quot;Feminism&quot; in Theories of International Relations, Scott Burchill et al., 3rd ed, Palgrave, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that in mainstream international relations masculinity is associated with objectivity. Analytical feminists would see neo-realism's dislike of domestic explanations for explaining interstate behaviour as an example of this bias. Normative feminist sees theorizing as part of an agenda for change.

Criticisms of  feminist international relations theory include its portrayal of third world women.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, C, (1991) &quot;Under Western Eyes:Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses&quot; in C. Mohanty, T.A. Russo and L.Torres (ed), ''Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism'', Bloomington&lt;/ref&gt;

==English School==
{{Main|English school of international relations theory}}

The '[[English school of international relations theory|English School]]' of international relations theory, also known as [[International Society]], [[Liberal Realism]], Rationalism or the British institutionalists, maintains that there is a 'society of states' at the international level, despite the condition of 'anarchy' (literally the lack of a ruler or world state). Despite being called the English School many of the academics from this school were neither [[English language|English]] nor from the [[United Kingdom]]. A great deal of the work of the English School concerns the examination of traditions of past international theory, casting it, as Martin Wight did in his 1950s-era lectures at the London School of Economics, into three divisions: 1. Realist or Hobbesian (after [[Thomas Hobbes]]), 2.
Rationalist (or Grotian, after [[Hugo Grotius]]), 3. Revolutionist (or Kantian, after [[Immanuel Kant]]). In broad terms, the English School itself has supported the rationalist or Grotian tradition, seeking a middle way (or via media) between the 'power politics' of realism and the 'utopianism' of revolutionism. The English School reject [[behavioralist]] approaches to international relations theory.

== Functionalism ==
{{Main|Functionalism in international relations}}

Functionalism is a theory of international relations that arose principally from the experience of [[European integration]].  Rather than the self-interest that realists see as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on common interests shared by states.  Integration develops its own internal dynamic: as states integrate in limited functional or technical areas, they increasingly find that momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas.  This &quot;[[invisible hand]]&quot; of integration phenomenon is termed &quot;spill-over.&quot; Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration's reach as it progresses.  This usage, and the usage in [[functionalism in international relations]], is the less common meaning of ''functionalism''.

More commonly, however, functionalism is an argument that explains phenomena as functions of a system rather than an actor or actors.  [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] employed a functionalist theory when he argued that the Westphalian international political system arose to secure and protect the developing international capitalist system.  His theory is called &quot;functionalist&quot; because it says that an event was a function of the preferences of a system and not the preferences of an agent.  Functionalism is different from structural or realist arguments in that while both look to broader, structural causes, realists (and structuralists more broadly) say that the structure gives incentives to agents, while functionalists attribute causal power to the system itself, bypassing agents entirely.

State cartel theory in international relations is derived from an old institutional theory of economics, from the theory of private or enterprise [[cartel]]s. It has a German background, because Germany was formerly the land of highest developed economic cartels and the motherland of classical cartel theory. State cartel theory uses a mix of methods ranging from positivist data evaluation to critical socioeconomic analyses or reflexive methods like criticism of thinking or ideology. Among the other theories of International Relations, State cartel theory has most in common with Functionalism in international relations. A bit more than the latter, state cartel theory has its focus on a theory of [[international organizations]].

==Post-structuralism==
{{Main|Post-structuralism in international relations theory}}

Post-structuralism differs from most other approaches to international politics because it does not see itself as a theory, school or paradigm which produces a single account of the subject matter.  Instead, post-structuralism is an approach, attitude, or ethos that pursues critique in particular way.  Post-structuralism sees critique as an inherently positive exercise that establishes the conditions of possibility for pursuing alternatives.

==Post-modernism==
{{Main|Post-modernism and international relations theory}}
Post-modernist approaches to international relations are critical of [[metanarratives]]  and denounces traditional IR's claims to truth and neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Dornelles, F.K. (2010), Postmodernism and IR: From Disparate Critiques to a
Coherent Theory of Global Politics, ''Global Politics Network'' available at http://asrudiancenter.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/krause_dornelles1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postcolonialism==
{{main|Postcolonialism and international relations theory}}
Postcolonial International relations scholarship posits a [[critical theory]] approach to [[International relations]] (IR), and is a non-mainstream area of international relations scholarship. [[Post-colonialism]] focuses on the persistence of colonial forms of power and the continuing existence of racism in world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Smith and Owens, ''The Globalisation of World Politics'', OUP, 4th ed,  p187-189&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary perspectives ==
Evolutionary perspectives, such as from [[evolutionary psychology]], have been argued to help explain many features of international relations. Humans in the ancestral environment did not live in states and likely rarely had interactions with groups outside of a very local area. However, a variety of evolved psychological mechanisms, in particular those for dealing with intergroup interactions, are argued to influence current international relations. These include evolved mechanisms for social exchange, cheating and detecting cheating, status conflicts, leadership, [[ingroup and outgroup]] distinction and biases, coalitions, and violence. Evolutionary concepts such as [[inclusive fitness]] may help explain seeming limitations of a concept such as [[egoism]] which is of fundamental importance to realist and [[rational choice theory|rational choice]] international relations theories.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley A.
