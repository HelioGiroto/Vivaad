      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">{{About|parliamentary political systems|the United States|General Election (disambiguation)}}
In a [[parliamentary system]], a '''general election''' is an [[election]] in which all or most members of a given political body are chosen. The term is usually used to refer to elections held for a nation's primary legislative body, as distinguished from [[by-election]]s and [[local election]]s.

In [[presidential systems]], the term refers to a [[fixed-term election|regularly-scheduled]] election where both the president, and either &quot;[[Staggered election|a class]]&quot; of or all members of the national legislature are elected at the same time. A general election day may also include elections for local officials.

The term originates in the [[United Kingdom general elections]] for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

==In the United Kingdom==
The term general election in the United Kingdom often refers to the election of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. These must be held every five years, but may be held more often at the discretion of the British Prime Minister.

The term may of course also be used to refer to an election to any democratically elected body in which all of the members are up for election. Section 2 of the Scotland Act 1998, for example, specifically refers to ordinary elections to the Scottish Parliament as general elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_2#pt1-pb2-l1g2 Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) - 2. Ordinary general elections]&lt;/ref&gt;

General elections in Britain traditionally take place on a Thursday; the last general election not on a Thursday was that of [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]].

The five year limit on the time of a Parliament can be varied by an Act of Parliament. This was done during both World Wars; the Parliament elected in [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] was prolonged to November 1918, and that elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|November 1935]] lasted until June 1945. The [[House of Lords]] has an absolute vote on any Bill to extend the life of Parliament.

==In Hong Kong==
According to the territory's ''[[Legislative Council Ordinance]]'', fixed term elections are defined as general elections, as opposed to by-elections.

== In India ==

[[Elections in India|General elections in India]] are the largest exercise of democracy in the World. In 2004, Indian elections covered an electorate larger than 670 million people—over twice that of the next largest, the European Parliament elections—and declared expenditure has trebled since 1989 to almost $300 million, using more than 1 million electronic voting machines. The [[Election Commission of India]] coordinates the elections, which owing to the huge size of the electorate is conducted in a phased manner.
In General Elections, the candidates are elected for the [[Lok Sabha]] and they are called MP's (Member of Parliament). They are held every 5 years.

== In South Korea ==
{{see also|Elections in South Korea}}

== Japan ==
See [[Elections in Japan]].

== American usage ==
{{Main|General election (U.S.)}}

In U.S. politics, general elections occur every four years and include the presidential election. Some parallels can be drawn between the general election in parliamentary systems and the biennial [[United States House of Representatives#Elections|elections determining all House seats]], although there is no analogue to &quot;calling early elections&quot; in the U.S., and the members of the elected [[U.S. Senate]] face elections of only one-third at a time at two year intervals including during a general election.

In the [[Louisiana#politics|State of Louisiana]] the expression ''general election'' means the [[runoff election]] which occurs between the two highest candidates as determined by the [[jungle primary]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 of the [http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/louisiana/la-laws/louisiana_revised_statutes_18-401 ''Louisiana Election Code''], incorporating Section 18:401 of the ''Louisiana Revised Statutes''.&lt;/ref&gt;
