'''Animal testing''', also known as '''animal experimentation''', '''animal research''', and '''[[in vivo]] testing''', is the use of non-human animals in experiments (although some research about animals involves only natural behaviors or pure observation, such as a mouse running a [[radial arm maze|maze]] or field studies of [[chimpanzee#social structure|chimp troops]]). Worldwide it is estimated that the number of [[vertebrate]] animals—from [[zebrafish]] to non-human [[primates]]—ranges from the tens of millions to more than 100 million used annually.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Cohn, &quot;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-08-26/health/bs-hs-animal-testing-20100826_1_animal-testing-animal-welfare-act-researchers Alternatives to Animal Testing Gaining Ground],&quot; ''The Baltimore Sun'' 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Invertebrate]]s, mice, rats, birds, fish, frogs, and animals not yet weaned are not included in the figures in the United States; one estimate of mice and rats used in the US alone in 2001 was 80 million.&lt;ref&gt;Carbone, Larry.

==Definitions==
The terms animal testing, '''animal experimentation''', animal research, '''''in vivo'' testing''', and '''[[vivisection]]''' have similar [[denotation]]s but different [[connotation]]s. Literally, &quot;vivisection&quot; means the &quot;cutting up&quot; of a living animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the [[dissection]] of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' defines &quot;vivisection&quot; as: &quot;Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382118?query=Vivisection&amp;ct= &quot;Vivisection&quot;], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007. Also see Croce, Pietro. ''Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health''. Zed Books, 1999, and [http://www.buav.org/pdf/VivisectionFAQs.pdf &quot;FAQs: Vivisection&quot;], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.&lt;/ref&gt; although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is &quot;used only by people who are opposed to such work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions in:

''What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare''. Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;vivisection&quot; is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term &quot;animal experimentation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paixão |first1=RL |last2=Schramm |first2=FR |title=Ethics and animal experimentation: what is debated? |journal=Cadernos de saude publica / Ministerio da Saude, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Escola Nacional de Saude Publica |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=99–110 |year=1999 |pmid=10089552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yarri, Donna.

[[Image:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|[[An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump]], from 1768, by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]]]]
The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] in the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE. [[Aristotle]] (Αριστοτέλης) (384–322 BCE) and [[Erasistratus]] (304–258 BCE) were among the first to perform experiments on living animals.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen and Loew 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen]], a physician in 2nd-century [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], dissected pigs and goats, and is known as the &quot;father of vivisection.&quot;&lt;ref name=lpag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpag.org/layperson/layperson.html#history |title=History of nonhuman animal research|publisher= Laboratory Primate Advocacy Group |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]], an [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic physician]] in 12th-century [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Spain]] who also practiced dissection, introduced animal testing as an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients.&lt;ref name=Rabie2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdel-Halim |first1=RE |title=Contributions of Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) to the progress of surgery: a study and translations from his book Al-Taisir. |journal=Saudi medical journal |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=1333–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16155644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabie2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdel-Halim |first1=RE |title=Contributions of Muhadhdhab Al-Deen Al-Baghdadi to the progress of medicine and urology.

Animals have been used repeatedly through the history of biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the [[Dublin Zoo]]—the fourth oldest zoo in Europe, after Vienna, Paris, and London—were members of the medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive and when they were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-great-zoos-who-2669960.html | work=Irish Independent | first=John | last=Costello | title=The great zoo's who | date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s, [[Louis Pasteur]] convincingly demonstrated the [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] of medicine by inducing [[anthrax]] in sheep.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11544370&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Toxicology]] testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm |title=Taste of Raspberries, Taste of Death.

===Historical debate===
[[Image:Claude Bernard 5.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Claude Bernard]], regarded as the &quot;prince of vivisectors&quot;&lt;ref name=Croce11/&gt; argued that experiments on animals are &quot;entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bernard&gt;[[Claude Bernard|Bernard, Claude]] ''An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine'', 1865. First English translation by Henry Copley Greene, published by Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1927; reprinted in 1949, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As the experimentation on animals increased, especially the practice of vivisection, so did criticism and controversy. In 1655, the advocate of [[Galen]]ic physiology [[Edmund O'Meara]] said that &quot;the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ryder54&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism''. Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANZCCART&gt;[http://www.adelaide.edu.au/ANZCCART/resources/AnimalExperimentation.pdf &quot;Animal Experimentation: A Student Guide to Balancing the Issues&quot;], Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching (ANZCCART), accessed December 12, 2007, cites original reference in Maehle, A-H. and Tr6hler, U. ''Animal experimentation from antiquity to the end of the eighteenth century: attitudes and arguments''. In N. A. Rupke (ed.) Vivisection in Historical Perspective. Croom Helm, London, 1987, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Meara and others argued that animal physiology could be affected by pain during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections on an [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals.&lt;ref name=ANZCCART/&gt; Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle — many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.&lt;ref name=ANZCCART/&gt;

On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. [[Claude Bernard]], known as the &quot;prince of vivisectors&quot;&lt;ref name=Croce11&gt;Croce, Pietro. ''Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health''. Zed Books, 1999, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and the father of physiology—whose wife, Marie Françoise Martin, founded the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883&lt;ref&gt;Rudacille, Deborah. ''The Scalpel and the Butterfly: The Conflict'', Farrar Straus Giroux, 2000, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;—famously wrote in 1865 that &quot;the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen&quot;.&lt;ref name=TelegraphNov2003&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2003/11/24/hsick23.xml &quot;In sickness and in health: vivisection's undoing&quot;, ''The Daily Telegraph, November 2003]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that &quot;experiments on animals ... are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man...the effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree,&quot;&lt;ref name=Bernard/&gt; Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=LaFollette&gt;LaFollette, H., Shanks, N., Animal Experimentation: the Legacy of Claude Bernard, ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1994) pp. 195–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, the physiologist and physician [[Walter Cannon|Dr. Walter B. Cannon]] said &quot;The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, 'Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden of crime.' &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-aps.org/publications/tphys/legacy/1991/issue6/303.pdf The Physiologist at the-aps.org A Physiologist’s Views on the Animal Rights/Liberation Movement]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} by Charles S. Nicoll ''The Physiologist'' 34(6): December 1991&lt;/ref&gt; These divisions between pro- and anti- animal testing groups first came to public attention during the [[brown dog affair]] in the early 1900s, when hundreds of medical students clashed with anti-vivisectionists and police over a memorial to a vivisected dog.&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;Mason, Peter.

In 1822, the first [[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822|animal protection law]] was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876|Cruelty to Animals Act (1876)]], the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote to [[Ray Lankester]] in March 1871: &quot;You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Life-and-Letters-of-Charles-Darwinx29407.html |title='&amp;#39;The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Volume II'&amp;#39; |publisher=Fullbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, John. ''Charles Darwin: A New Life'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991. p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the use of animals in medical research first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when [[Henry Bergh]] founded the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Buettinger, Craig [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13506650.html Antivivisection and the charge of zoophil-psychosis in the early twentieth century.]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} ''The Historian'' 1 January 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulations===
The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the provisions of the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] and the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' (the ''Guide''), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. In general, researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain.&lt;ref name=Carbone68&gt;Carbone, Larry.

Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of [[non-human primates]] always raises what he calls a &quot;red flag of special concern.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carbone 2004, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''Science'' magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Science'' 27 July 2001: Vol. 293. no. 5530, pp. 608 – 609 {{doi|10.1126/science.1061621}} PMID 11474086&lt;/ref&gt;

The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act do not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm#AnimalWelfareAssurance] OLAW policies governing IACUCs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/janqtr/9cfr1.1.htm] Animal Welfare Act definitions&lt;/ref&gt; Animal Welfare Act regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC.

Accurate global figures for animal testing are difficult to obtain.

In 1966, the Laboratory Animal Breeders Association estimated in testimony before Congress that the number of mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits used in 1965 was around 60 million. (Hearings before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Feed Grains, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, 1966, p. 63.) In 2004, the Department of Agriculture listed 64,932 dogs, 23,640 cats, 54,998 non-human primates, 244,104 guinea pigs, 175,721 hamsters, 261,573 rabbits, 105,678 farm animals, and 171,312 other mammals, a total of 1,101,958, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2004 from 195,157 to 64,932, and from 66,165 to 23,640, respectively.

In the UK, Home Office figures show that 3.2 million procedures were carried out in 2007, a rise of 189,500 since the previous year. Four thousand procedures used non-human primates, down 240 from 2006.&lt;ref name=GB14&gt;[http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pfds08/spanimals07.pdf &quot;Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals&quot;, Home Office, July 21, 2008, p. 5]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;procedure&quot; refers to an experiment that might last minutes, several months, or years.

[[Image:Drosophila melanogaster - front (aka).jpg|thumb|[[Drosophila melanogaster|Fruit flies]] are commonly used.]]
Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used, these experiments are largely unregulated by law. The most used invertebrate species are ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a fruit fly, and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a [[nematode]] worm.

=====Cats and dogs=====
{{See also|Laika|Soviet space dogs}}
Cats are most commonly used in neurological research. Over 25,500 cats were used in the U.S. in 2000, around half of whom were used in experiments which, according to the [[American Anti-Vivisection Society]], had the potential to cause &quot;pain and/or distress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aavs.org/images/winter2003_text.pdf Cat madness: human research using cats]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} AAVS newsletter Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs are widely used in biomedical research, testing, and education — particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle. They are commonly used as models for human diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the [[Humane Society of the United States]].&lt;ref name=HSUSDogs&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/dog.html Dog profile, The Humane Society of the United States]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Report for 2005 shows that 66,000 dogs were used in USDA-registered facilities in that year.&lt;ref name=USDA2006/&gt; In the U.S., some of the dogs are purpose-bred, while most are supplied by so-called Class B dealers licensed by the USDA to buy animals from auctions, shelters, newspaper ads, and who are sometimes accused of [[Laboratory animal sources#Bunching|stealing pets]].&lt;ref name=Gillham&gt;Gillham, Christina.

Non-human primates (NHPs) are used in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of [[neurology]], behavior and cognition, reproduction, [[genetics]], and [[xenotransplantation]]. They are caught in the wild or purpose-bred.

Four states in the U.S. — [[Minnesota]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Iowa]] — require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities. Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation.&lt;ref name=ASPCAdealers&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=kids_ri_animaltesting_comefrom Animal Testing: Where Do the Animals Come From?]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

In the European Union, animal sources are governed by ''Council Directive 86/609/EEC'', which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement.&lt;ref name=direct1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986L0609:EN:HTML |title=Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukcites.gov.uk/pdf_files/Sep05GN9%20Primate%20imports.pdf Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)] Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HOStats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm67/6713/6713.pdf |title=&quot;Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals&quot;, Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Home Office, 2004| page=87 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by [[Charles River Laboratories]], or by [[Covance]], which is the single largest [[International primate trade|importer of primates]] into the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070708204056/http://www.ippl.org/04-25-07c.html U.S. Primate Imports Spike] ''International Primate Protection League'' April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frog vivisection.jpg|thumb|right|Prior to dissection for educational purposes, [[chloroform]] was administered to this [[Common Sand Frog|common sand frog]] to induce [[anesthesia]] and death.]]
The extent to which animal testing causes [[pain]] and [[suffering]], and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=IJ |last2=Petherick |first2=JC |title=The implications of cognitive processes for animal welfare |journal=Journal of animal science |volume=69 |issue=12 |pages=5017–22 |year=1991 |pmid=1808195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curtis |first1=SE |last2=Stricklin |first2=WR |title=The importance of animal cognition in agricultural animal production systems: an overview |journal=Journal of animal science |volume=69 |issue=12 |pages=5001–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1808193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2006 about 670,000 animals (57%) (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. About 420,000 (36%) were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 84,000 (7%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.&lt;ref name=USDA2006/&gt;

In the UK, research projects are classified as mild, moderate, and substantial in terms of the suffering the researchers conducting the study say they may cause; a fourth category of &quot;unclassified&quot; means the animal was [[Anesthesia|anesthetized]] and killed without recovering [[consciousness]], according to the researchers. In December 2001, 1,296 (39%) of project licenses in force were classified as mild, 1,811 (55%) as moderate, 63 (2%) as substantial, and 139 (4%) as unclassified.&lt;ref name=RyderSinger&gt;[[Richard D.

The defining text on animal welfare regulation, &quot;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&quot; defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the USA. It states &quot;The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, ILAR, National Research Council, 1996 copyright, pg 64&lt;/ref&gt; The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states &quot;The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol&quot;. Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval.

===Euthanasia===
{{Further|Euthanasia|Animal euthanasia}}
There is general agreement that animal life should not be taken wantonly, and regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible.&lt;ref name=Flecknell/&gt; However, while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, others, such as the [[RSPCA]], argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apc.gov.uk/reference/costbenefit.pdf Animal Procedures Committee: review of cost-benefit assessment in the use of animals in research] The Animal Procedures Committee, June 2003 p46-7&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause [[pain]] and [[suffering]], not whether their death is undesirable in itself.&lt;ref name=Carbone2&gt;Carbone, Larry. &quot;Euthanasia,&quot; in Bekoff, M. and Meaney, C.

Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress.&lt;ref&gt;Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, 1996 Edition, Euthanasia section on pg 65&lt;/ref&gt; The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]], by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. [[Sedative]]s or [[anesthetic]]s such as [[barbiturate]]s can be given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as [[tricaine]]. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include [[decapitation]] (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. [[Cervical dislocation]] (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits.  [[Maceration (food)|Maceration]] (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave [[irradiation]] of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. [[Captive bolt]]s may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious.  [[electric shock|Electrocution]] may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun.  [[Pithing]] (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing [[air embolism]] are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avma.org/resources/euthanasia.pdf |title=AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia, June 2007 edition, Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia |publisher=Avma.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--add subsections on cage sizes; use versus care--&gt;

===Pure research===
Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it may produce unforeseen benefits, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research—research that has a specific practical aim—unclear.&lt;ref name=Lords3&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15006.htm &quot;Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report&quot;], House of Lords, July 16, 2002. See chapter 3: &quot;The purpose and nature of animal experiments.&quot; Retrieved July 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from [[California sea slug|sea slugs]] through to [[armadillo]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Job |first1=CK |title=Nine-banded armadillo and leprosy research |journal=Indian journal of pathology &amp; microbiology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=541–50 |year=2003 |pmid=15025339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include:

* Breeding experiments to study ''[[evolution]]'' and ''[[genetics]]''. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are [[Inbreeding|inbred]] through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Festing|Festing, M.]], ''[http://www.informatics.jax.org/external/festing/mouse/INTRO.shtml &quot;Inbred Strains of Mice and their Characteristics&quot;],'' ''[[The Jackson Laboratory]] ''.

Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of [[Selective breeding|inbred domesticated animals]], such as dog or cattle breeds, for [[Comparative genomics|comparative]] purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their [[ecological niche|niche]]) produce [[adaptation]]s in their physiology and [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]].

===Applied research===
Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. Compared to pure research, which is largely academic in origin, applied research is usually carried out in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], or by universities in commercial partnerships. These may involve the use of [[animal model]]s of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the [[drug discovery]] process. Examples include:

*[[Genetic modification]] of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such as [[single gene disorders]], such as [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramaswamy |first1=S |last2=McBride |first2=JL |last3=Kordower |first3=JH |title=Animal models of Huntington's disease |journal=ILAR journal / National Research Council, Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=356–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17712222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rees |first1=DA |last2=Alcolado |first2=JC |title=Animal models of diabetes mellitus |journal=Diabetic Medicine |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=359–70 |year=2005 |pmid=15787657 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01499.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iwakuma |first1=T |last2=Lozano |first2=G |title=Crippling p53 activities via knock-in mutations in mouse models |journal=Oncogene |volume=26 |issue=15 |pages=2177–84 |year=2007 |pmid=17401426 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1210278}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frese |first1=KK |last2=Tuveson |first2=DA |title=Maximizing mouse cancer models |journal=Nature reviews.

*Studies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops [[pathology]] and symptoms that resemble a human disease.

*Animal testing has also included the use of [[placebo]] testing. In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect, but is administered in order to determine any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com.mutex.gmu.edu/docview/883059783/13A100017D544D5A038/1?accountid=14541&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents released to the news media by the animal rights organization [[Uncaged Campaigns]] showed that, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of [[Novartis]] Pharma AG, in conjunction with Cambridge University and [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], to be used in experiments that involved grafting pig tissues, suffered serious and sometimes fatal injuries.

===Toxicology testing===

{{Further|Draize test|LD50|Acute toxicity|Chronic toxicity}}

Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], on behalf of a wide variety of customers.&lt;ref name=BUAVHPT&gt;[http://www.buav.org/pdf/HouseholdProductTests.pdf Household Product Tests] [[BUAV]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures.&lt;ref name=EU2005&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/5th_stat_rep_lab_animals_en.pdf Fifth Report on the Statistics on the Number of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes in the Member States of the European Union]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} ''Commission of the European Communities'', published November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Nature'', 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;Abbott, Alison.

[[Image:DraizeTest-PETA.jpg|thumb|A rabbit during a [[Draize test]]]]
Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as [[pesticide]]s, [[medication]]s, [[food additives]], packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to [[BUAV]], manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.&lt;ref name=BUAVHPT/&gt;

The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected [[intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[subcutaneous]]ly; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are several different types of [[acute toxicity]] tests. The {{LD50}} (&quot;Lethal Dose 50%&quot;) test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal [[Statistical population|population]]. This test was removed from [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the [[Fixed Dose Procedure|fixed dose procedure]], which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walum |first1=E |title=Acute oral toxicity |journal=Environmental health perspectives |volume=106 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=497–503 |year=1998 |pmid=9599698 |pmc=1533392 |doi=10.2307/3433801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/animals_in_research_news/intergovernmental_organization_eliminates_the_ld50_test.html Inter-Governmental Organization Eliminates the LD50 Test, The Humane Society of the United States]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nature'' writes that, as of 2005, &quot;the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide.&quot;&lt;ref name=Abbott/&gt;

Irritancy can be measured using the [[Draize test]], where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows &quot;continuing signs of severe pain or distress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/9740501E.PDF OECD guideline 405, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humane Society of the United States]] writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_research/rabbit.html Species Used in Research: Rabbit, Humane Society of the United States]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilhelmus |first1=KR |title=The Draize eye test |journal=Survey of ophthalmology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=493–515 |year=2001 |pmid=11425356 |doi=10.1016/S0039-6257(01)00211-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no accepted ''in vitro'' alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the ''low volume eye test'' may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Secchi |first1=A |last2=Deligianni |first2=V |title=Ocular toxicology: the Draize eye test |journal=Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=367–72 |year=2006 |pmid=16954791 |doi=10.1097/01.all.0000244798.26110.00}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hadwen&gt;[http://www.drhadwentrust.org/news/rabbit-eye-test-replacement#fn9909468184ab801ac0cd77 Draize rabbit eye test replacement milestone welcomed]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} ''Dr Hadwen Trust'' 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants.&lt;ref name=Hadwen/&gt;

The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, [[mutagen]]icity, [[carcinogen]]icity, [[teratogen]]icity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.

These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] report, &quot;critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11523&amp;page=R1 Toxicity Testing for Assessment of Environmental Agents&quot;] National Academies Press, (2006), p21.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nature'' reported that most animal tests either over- or underestimate risk, or do not reflect toxicity in humans particularly well,&lt;ref name=Abbott/&gt; with [[false positive]] results being a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hartung T |title=Toxicology for the twenty-first century |journal=Nature |volume=460 |issue=7252 |pages=208–12 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19587762 |doi=10.1038/460208a|bibcode = 2009Natur.460..208H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This variability stems from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Smith LL |title=Key challenges for toxicologists in the 21st century |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

====Cosmetics testing====
{{Main|Testing cosmetics on animals}}
[[Image:NoAnimalTesting.png|left|thumb|Products in Europe not tested on animals carry this symbol.]]
Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests, which are still conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, [[phototoxic]]ity (toxicity triggered by [[ultraviolet]] light) and mutagenicity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Martin &amp; Rowan, Andrew.

Cosmetics testing is banned in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK, and in 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union (EU) agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, [[L'Oreal]], has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg]], asking that the ban be quashed.&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt; The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy.&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;Osborn, Andrew &amp; Gentleman, Amelia.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/animalrights/story/0,11917,1021527,00.html &quot;Secret French move to block animal-testing ban&quot;], ''The Guardian'', August 19, 2003.

===Drug testing===
[[Image:Dogs6CCcopy.jpg|thumb|Beagles used for safety testing of [[pharmaceuticals]] in a British facility]]
Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Currently, all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:
*''metabolic tests'', investigating [[pharmacokinetics]]&amp;nbsp;– how drugs are absorbed, [[Drug metabolism|metabolized]] and [[Excretion|excreted]] by the body when introduced [[Wiktionary:oral|orally]], [[intravenous]]ly, intraperitoneally, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Transdermal patch|transdermally]].
*''toxicology tests'', which gauge [[acute toxicity|acute]], sub-acute, and [[chronic toxicity]]. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that &quot;acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species&quot; covering &quot;at least two different routes of administration&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML |title=EU Directive 2001/83/EC, p.44 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic [[drug metabolism|drug metabolites]] build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML |title=EU Directive 2001/83/EC, p. 45 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''efficacy studies'', which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals. The drug is then administered in a [[Randomized controlled trial|double-blind controlled trial]], which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the [[Dose response|dose-response]] curve.
*Specific tests on ''reproductive function'', ''embryonic toxicity'', or ''carcinogenic potential'' can all be required by law, depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested.

===Education, breeding, and defense===
Animals are also used for [[education]] and training; are bred for use in laboratories; and are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing.&lt;ref name=Lords3/&gt;  For example, in 2008 the United States [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] used live pigs to study the effects of [[improvised explosive device]] explosions on internal organs, especially the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Tom Vanden, &quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20090407/1apigs07_st.art.htm Brain Study, Animal Rights Collide]&quot;, ''[[USA Today]]'', April 7, 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal, Rooshin et al. [http://www.pcrm.org/resch/anexp/abstract_teaching.html ''Replacement Alternatives in Education: Animal-Free Teaching''] abstract from Fifth World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences, Berlin, August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Horst Spielmann, German director of the Central Office for Collecting and Assessing Alternatives to Animal Experimentation, while describing Germany's progress in this area, told German broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] in 2005: &quot;Using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous. In many countries, one can become a doctor, vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1687760,00.html ''Seeking an End to Animal Experimentation''], [[Deutsche Welle]], August 23, 2005.

The ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to much debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rollin |first1=Bernard E. |title=The Regulation of Animal Research and the Emergence of Animal Ethics: A Conceptual History |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |volume=27 |pages=285–304 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8 | pmid=16937023 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species. The dominant ethical position worldwide is that achievement of scientific and medical goals using animal testing is desirable, so long as animal suffering and use is minimized.&lt;ref name=1985Amend&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/pl99198.htm |title=1985 Amendment to Animal Welfare Act |publisher=Nal.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government has additionally required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge.&lt;ref name=SelectComm&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15003.htm |title=Summary of House of Lords Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures |publisher=UK Parliament|date=2002-07-24 |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built [[cenotaph]]s for killed animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rayinfo.koizumiengei.com/anilog/000145.html 韓国・食薬庁で「実験動物慰霊祭」挙行]&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan there are also annual memorial services (''Ireisai'' 慰霊祭) for animals sacrificed at medical school.

A wide range of minority viewpoints exist. The view that animals have moral rights ([[animal rights]]) is a philosophical position proposed by [[Tom Regan]], among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the &quot;subjects of a life&quot; with moral value and therefore moral rights.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter (ed.). &quot;A Companion to Ethics&quot;. Blackwell Companions to Philosophy, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a &quot;moral dilemma&quot; view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research.&lt;ref name=Nuffield&gt;[http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/sites/default/files/files/Animals%20Chapter%2014%20Discussion%20of%20Ethical%20Issues.pdf Page 244, Chapter 14, Discussion of ethical issues] in: [http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/animal-research The ethics of research involving animals] at the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Published 25 05 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist view in animal rights]] holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal.&lt;ref name=Nuffield/&gt;  [[Bernard Rollin]] argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Another prominent position is that of philosopher [[Peter Singer]], who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] moral considerations.&lt;ref name=Rollin1998&gt;Rollin, Bernard E. &quot;The moral status of animals and their use as experimental subjects,&quot; in Kuhse, Helga and Singer, Peter.  &quot;A Companion to Bioethics&quot;. Blackwell Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these arguments have not been widely accepted, governments such as the Netherlands and New Zealand have responded to the concerns by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the [[great apes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gagneux |first1=P |last2=Moore |first2=JJ |last3=Varki |first3=A |title=The ethics of research on great apes |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=27–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16136111 |doi=10.1038/437027a|bibcode = 2005Natur.437...27G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vermij |first1=P |title=Europe's last research chimps to retire |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=9 |issue=8 |page=981 |year=2003 |pmid=12894144 |doi=10.1038/nm0803-981b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised over the mistreatment of primates undergoing testing. In 1985 the case of [[Britches (monkey)|Britches]], a macaque monkey at the [[University of California, Riverside]], gained public attention. He had his eyelids sewn shut and a sonar sensor on his head as part of an experiment to test [[sensory substitution]] devices for blind people. The laboratory was raided by [[Animal Liberation Front]] in 1985, removing Britches and 466 other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Ben A.

===Threats to researchers===
In 2006, a primate researcher at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 [[macaque]] monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malone |first1=B.

Demonstrations were held in front of his home. A [[Molotov cocktail]] was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The [[Animal Liberation Front]] claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/22/animal Throwing in the Towel] David Epstein ''Inside Higher Education, August 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating &quot;you win,&quot; and &quot;please don't bother my family anymore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=241311597601024 Predators Unleashed]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} ''Investor's Business Daily'' 24 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the [[Revolutionary Cells (RCALB)|Animal Liberation Brigade]] placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's [[ophthalmologist]] who [[Animal testing on cats|experiments on cats]] and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Patrick Range.

These attacks, as well as similar incidents that caused the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] to declare in 2002 that the animal rights movement had &quot;clearly taken a turn toward the more extreme,&quot; this prompted the US government to pass the [[Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act]] and the UK government to add the offense of &quot;Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation&quot; to the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=When animal rights turns ugly |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=26 |pages=603–5 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/nbt0608-603 |issue=6 |pmid=18536673 |last1=Huggett |first1=B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such legislation, and the arrest and imprisonment of extremists may have decreased the incidence of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Herbert [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/collapse-in-support-for-animal-rights-extremist-attacks-433872.html &quot;Collapse in support for animal rights extremist attacks&quot;], ''The Independent'', January 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to animal testing==
{{Main|Alternatives to animal testing}}
Scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary. The &quot;three Rs&quot;&lt;ref name=Flecknell&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Flecknell P |title=Replacement, reduction and refinement |journal=ALTEX |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=73–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12098013}}&lt;/ref&gt; are guiding [[Moral obligation|principles]] for the use of animals in research in most countries:
#'''Replacement''' refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aim.
#'''Reduction''' refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals.
#'''Refinement''' refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/page.asp?id=7 |title=What are the 3Rs? |publisher=NC3Rs |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternative methods include [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), which allows scanning of the [[human brain]] ''in vivo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154877.php |title=What Is A PET Scan? How Does A PET Scan Work? |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clinical study design|comparative]] [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies of disease [[risk factor]]s among human populations.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang J, Liu B, Nasca PC, Han W, Zou X, Zeng X, Tian X, Wu Y, Zhao P, Li J.

Available from http://www.medsci.org/v06p0329.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Several invertebrate systems are considered acceptable alternatives to animals in very early stage discovery screens.&lt;ref&gt;Waterfield NR, Sanchez-Contreras M, Eleftherianos I, Dowling A, Yang G, Wilkinson P, Parkhill J, Thomson N, Reynolds SE, Bode HB, Dorus S, Ffrench-Constant RH.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Oct 14;105(41):15967-72. Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of similarities between the innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in certain types of studies. [[Drosophila melanogaster]] and the [[Galleria mellonella]] ([[waxworm]]) have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;plosone.org&quot;/&gt; [[Waxworms]] and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aperis G 2011&quot;/&gt;  The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.

Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kolar R |title=ECVAM: desperately needed or superfluous? An animal welfare perspective |journal=Altern Lab Anim |volume=30 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=169–74 |year=2002 |pmid=12513669}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Schuppli CA, Fraser D, McDonald M |title=Expanding the three Rs to meet new challenges in humane animal experimentation |journal=Altern Lab Anim |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=525–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15656775}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rusche B |title=The 3Rs and animal welfare – conflict or the way forward? |journal=ALTEX |volume=20 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=63–76 |year=2003 |pmid=14671703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official bodies such as the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Test Methods of the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ecvam.jrc.it/&lt;/ref&gt; the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods in the US,&lt;ref&gt;http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; ZEBET in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/zebet_database_on_alternatives_to_animal_experiments_on_the_internet__animalt_zebet_-1508.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods&lt;ref&gt;http://jacvam.jp/en_about/en_about03.html&lt;/ref&gt; (among others) also promote and disseminate the 3Rs. These bodies are mainly driven by responding to regulatory requirements, such as supporting the cosmetics testing ban in the EU by validating alternative methods.

The European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing serves as a liaison between the European Commission and industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/epaa/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The European Consensus Platform for Alternatives coordinates efforts amongst EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecopa.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic centers also investigate alternatives, including the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://caat.jhsph.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; and the NC3Rs in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;
