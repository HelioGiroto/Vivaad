'''Pacific Environment''' is an environmental organization based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[USA]] founded in 1987. Its objective is to protect the living environment of the [[Pacific Rim]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificenvironment.org/article.php?id=58 Pacific Environment : Our Mission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
==Mission statement==
Pacific Environment protects the living environment of the Pacific Rim by promoting grassroots activism, strengthening communities and reforming international policies. This mission is achieved through these actions:&lt;br /&gt;
1.	Support Local Environmental Struggles: Over one-third of Pacific Environment’s budget is dedicated to funding grassroots organizations on the front-lines of the environmental movement.&lt;br /&gt;
2.	Hold Banks and Corporations Accountable: Pacific Environment confronts tax-payer funded banks that back oil, gas, mining and timber extraction and the companies that profit from these often environmentally devastating projects.&lt;br /&gt;
3.	Promote Best Practices: Pacific Environment supports and encourages [[sustainable fishing]], [[renewable energy]] and other initiatives that put environmental protection and communities first.&lt;br /&gt;
4.	Build a Global Movement: By forging coalitions and partnerships with environmentalists and other community members around the Pacific Rim, Pacific Environment is building a united movement to deal with the global threats we face.

==History==

The organization was founded 1987 as Pacific Energy and Resources Center. In 1991, Pacific Environment became the first international organization to bring widespread attention to the threats facing the [[Siberian]] [[taiga]], beginning a long history of work in [[Russia]]. In 1993, a Pacific Environment campaign with Russian partners led to the creation of the Botchi [[Nature Reserve]], protecting valuable forests in the Russian Far East that were to be logged by Weyerhaeuser Corporation. That same year, Pacific Environment worked with the [[Udege]] people in the Russian Far East to protect the 3-million-acre (12,000&amp;nbsp;km²) upper Bikin Watershed against logging by the Hyundai Corporation. This area is now a wildlife refuge. 

By the mid-1990s, they began to focus on the linchpin financial role international institutions were playing in resource extraction in Russia and initiated a long-term effort to link grassroots environmentalists around the Pacific Rim to international policy decisions, particularly those of government-supported [[Export Credit Agencies]]. Pacific Environment pioneered efforts to block the financing of destructive projects and improve others as one of the founding members of an international campaign to reform the social and environmental policies of Export Credit Agencies, known as ECA Watch. While Pacific Environment's biggest successes in the 1990s were in Russia, they also began to focus more broadly on the Pacific Rim. 

In [[China]], Pacific Environment took advantage of the growing opportunities to partner with that country's emerging environmental movement by helping dozens of local groups become more effective watchdogs of local government, especially through the media. They also assisted these groups in encouraging the Chinese government to review environmental impacts. Pacific Environment's partners at Greener Beijing utilized the internet to organize a campaign against consumption of turtle and tortoise species in [[Hainan Province]]. After a government investigation prompted in part by the campaign, the Hainan Yang Sheng Tan Company halted its import of turtle and tortoise species after financial losses and public pressure. And in 2004, Chinese Premiere Wen Jiabao ordered officials to reconsider plans for a dam along the [[Nu River]] after journalists and environmentalists teamed up to spotlight the issue.

==Organisation==
Pacific Environment employs 16 employees located throughout the Pacific Rim with offices in San Francisco, California; Anchorage, Alaska; Washington DC; Vladivostok, Russia; and Beijing, China. The reported operating budget from the 2005-2006 fiscal year was $1.2 Million, with the majority of that coming from foundations.&lt;br /&gt; Pacific Environment splits its activities between five main programs the Russia Program, China Program, Alaska Program, California Energy Program and Responsible Finance Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificenvironment.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=7 Pacific Environment : Our Programs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Pacific Environment takes on specific challenges in key geographic areas throughout the Pacific Rim, and employs key international leverage points to bolster local campaigns. They engage in five major areas of focus outlined below.
===Russia=== 
For the past 20 years, Pacific Environment has partnered with [[Russia]]n environmentalists to ensure the peoples in these regions have a voice in decisions that impact their environment, health and livelihoods. Pacific Environment works alongside Russian and international [[non-profit organization|nonprofits]] to protect wild lands and wildlife, promote responsible fisheries management, and advocate environmental controls on oil, gas and minerals development.

Pacific Environment’s Russia Program has five key campaigns:
# Opposing Oil and gas development on [[Sakhalin Island]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmental-finance.com/onlinews/2007sak.htm Environmental Finance Online News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Siberia Pacific Pipeline
# Preserving the natural habitat in [[Kamchatka]] against [[illegal fishing]] and predatory mining, oil and gas drilling
# Opposing the construction of a dam and pipeline in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] region
# Monitoring and restricting [[mining]]
===China===
Pacific Environment enhances the Chinese environmental movement by:
# providing partners renewed financial support to hire and retain staff enhancing both their professional capacity and efficacy in accomplishing their advocacy and civil society goals.
# organizing a network for partners to share experiences and information relevant to their water pollution work through bi-annual workshops and regular consultation with each other and with Pacific Environment
# assisting partners in developing communications strategies that will enable them to generate media attention on local efforts to fight water pollution.

===Alaska===
Pacific Environment’s Alaska Program partners with native, fishing, environmental and scientific communities to confront cultural and environmental threats to [[Alaska]] and the surrounding waters. These partnerships focus on safeguarding critical habitats, including the world's largest [[salmon run]], the feeding grounds of the endangered northeastern Pacific [[right whale]], old-growth seafloor habitat, and areas essential to community subsistence. The three key campaign goals are:
# Prevent all offshore oil and gas exploration and drilling in [[Bristol Bay]] and the [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] and [[Chukchi Sea]]s
# Dramatically increase shipping safety response and prevention plans along the [[Great Circle Route]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/8016271p-7909205c.html adn.com | alaska : Ship tracks closer to Aleutians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Facilitate an international coalition of stakeholders to protect the unique biodiversity of the [[Bering Sea]]

===California Energy===
Pacific Environment's California energy program works to maintain [[California]]'s commitment to clean energy and reducing [[greenhouse gas]]es by:
# Keeping [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] out of the West Coast
# Promoting Community Choice, a plan that would allow [[San Francisco]] and the East Bay cities of Oakland, [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to buy up to 50% of the cities' electricity from &quot;[[off-grid]]&quot; [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources
# Retrofitting aging, polluting power plants to significantly increase energy efficiency and reduce overall energy demands
===Responsible Finance===
Pacific Environment’s Responsible Finance Campaign promotes environmentally and [[social responsibility|socially sustainable]] policies and practices among public and private finance institutions with interests and projects in less wealthy countries. With a principal focus on the extractive sector (oil, gas, mining, and forestry) operating on the Pacific Rim, Pacific Environment persuades these lending institutions to be more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens’ concerns, particularly in project-affected communities.

The international campaign to reform the policies and practices of public and private banks has expanded its focus to include multilateral development banks, export credit agencies, and large private international banks.  After a decade of campaigning, a basic environmental policy framework is now in place for each of the three classes of institutions. However, proper implementation of these policies has become a vexing challenge especially in countries like Japan, where banks are playing an increasingly proactive role in fulfilling national security goals to obtain extractive and energy resources.
