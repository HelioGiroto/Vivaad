The word ''[[socialism]]'' refers to a broad range of theoretical and historical socio-economic systems, and has also been used by many political movements throughout history to describe themselves and their goals, generating numerous '''types of socialism'''. Different self-described socialists have used the term ''socialism'' to refer to different things, such as an [[economic system]], a type of [[society]], a [[philosophy|philosophical]] outlook, a collection of moral values and ideals, or even a certain kind of human character.
Some definitions of socialism are very vague,&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. ''&quot;What is Socialism?&quot;'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35. Boyle quotes Pierrerismo Joseph Proudhon as stating that socialism is &quot;every aspiration towards the amelioration of society&quot;, and then admitting that, under this definition, &quot;we are all socialists.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while others are so specific that they only include a small minority of the things that have been described as &quot;socialism&quot; in the past. There have been numerous political movements which called themselves socialist under some definition of the term; this article attempts to list them all. Some of these interpretations are mutually exclusive, and all of them have generated debates over the true meaning of socialism.

== Early interpretations ==
The word ''socialism'' was coined in the 1830s, and it was first used to refer to philosophical or moral beliefs rather than any specific political views. For example, [[Alexandre Vinet]], who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as &quot;the opposite of [[individualism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cort, John C. ''&quot;Christian socialism&quot;''. Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Owen]] also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, though he used it with a slightly more specific meaning, to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] claimed that socialism is &quot;every aspiration towards the amelioration of society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. ''&quot;What is Socialism?&quot;'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists - and who would be later called &quot;[[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]&quot; - wrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic [[egalitarianism|equality]]. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the word &quot;socialism&quot; came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine.

Other early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper,&lt;ref name=&quot;fsmitha.com&quot;&gt;http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html&lt;/ref&gt; such as Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsmitha.com&quot;/&gt; The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism, and a belief that science was the key to progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction&quot;&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-280431-6&lt;/ref&gt; Simon's ideas provided a foundation for scientific economic planning and technocratic administration of society.

Other early socialist thinkers, such as Thomas Hodgkin and [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]], based their ideas on [[David Ricardo]]'s economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor &amp;mdash; the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.&lt;ref&gt;http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas embodied early conceptions of free-[[market socialism]].

After the advent of Karl Marx's [[Marxian economics|theory of capitalism]] and [[Scientific socialism]], socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In Marxist theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such, and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of &quot;[[To each according to his contribution|from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between various schools==
Although they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues, and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.

===Theory===
Some branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. utopian socialism); others in the heat of a revolution (e.g. early Marxism, Leninism). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. Stalinism), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. [[Anarcho-Syndicalism]] or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. social democracy).

Some are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. Marxism-Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, revolutionary Marxism, Social Anarchism), whilst others tend to support [[reformism|reform]] instead (e.g. Fabianism, social democracy, Individualist Anarchism). Others believe both are possible (e.g. [[Syndicalism]], various Marxisms). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved.

Socialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable, such as the &quot;[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] liberties&quot; (such as those guaranteed by the U.S. [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. social anarchy, Left-Communism), whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. Marxism-Leninism Maoism). Marx and Engels even held different opinions at different times, and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism).

All socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism), whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). A few are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. environmental leftism) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian Socialists, like [[Robert Owen]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] argued, though not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. Marxian Socialists, on the other hand, determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Also, Marxian Socialists maintain, in contrast to the Utopian Socialists, that the root of injustice is not in how goods ([[commodity|commodities]]) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.

===Practice===
Most forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. [[Bernsteinism]], reformism, reformist Marxism) proposed a mixed market economy instead. [[Mixed economy|Mixed economies]], in turn, can range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small [[cooperative]]s in the planned economy of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists).

Some schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by [[workers' council]]s (e.g. [[syndicalism]], [[Left Communism|Left]] and [[Council communism]], Marxism, [[Anarcho-communism]]). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of &quot;ownership of the [[means of production]].&quot; None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press.

Another issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with [[direct democracy]] and the widespread use of [[referendum]]s), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a [[representative democracy]].

Different ideologies support different governments. For example, in the era of the [[Soviet Union]], western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was basically socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently un-socialist and, in fact, inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as &quot;[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]],&quot; but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual [[#Opposition and criticisms of socialism|critiques against a command economy]], and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.

==Socialist planned economy==
This form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]], and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style command economy]] to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally-planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a single-party political system, and is thus associated with the [[Communist states]] of the 20th century.

===State-directed economy===
A state-directed economy is a system where either the state or [[worker cooperative]]s own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as [[Indicative planning]] or [[Dirigisme]]. This differs from a centralized planned economy (or a command economy) in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism.

State-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism; economic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of &quot;political administration of men, to the administration of things&quot;. 

Elements of state-directed socialist economies include: [[dirigisme]], [[technocracy]], [[Economic planning]] and [[State socialism]].

===De-centralized planned economy===
A de-centralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of worker cooperatives, [[autogestion]] and planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of [[Libertarian Socialism]], [[Syndicalism]] and various forms of communal Utopian socialism.

Examples of de-centralized democratic planning include: [[participatory economics]], [[industrial democracy]], classic [[Soviet democracy]], [[syndicalism]], [[council communism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, ''Ghost of Anarcho-Syndicalism''; [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market socialism==
{{Main|Market socialism}}
Market socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. 

Some forms of market socialism are based on [[Neoclassical school|neoclassical economic theory]], with the aim of attaining [[pareto efficiency]] by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]] and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on [[classical economics]], such as those advocated by [[Thomas Hodgskin]], who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free-market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital.

Other types of market socialist systems, such as Mutualism, are related to the political philosophy of [[Libertarian socialism]].

Examples of market socialism include: [[economic democracy]], the [[Lange Model]], the [[New Economic Mechanism]], [[Ricardian socialism]], [[Liberal socialism]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]].

===Socialist market economy===
A socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute [[state capitalism]], the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations ([[corporatization]]) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods. 

Examples of socialist market economies include: [[Socialist market|Socialist market economy with Chinese Characteristics]] and [[Socialist-oriented market economy]].

==Socialist ideologies==

===Marxist communism===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883)]]
{{Main|Communism|Marxism}}
Marxist communism refers to [[social class|classless]], stateless social organization based upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised, while movements associated with official [[Communist parties]] and [[Communist states]] usually are. A communist economy, in the classic Marxist definition ([[Pure communism]]), refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism.  (See [[post-scarcity]].) This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it. 

The actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the [[State (polity)|state]]. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communist have been [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorships]].

The modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I.  The leftists, led internationally by [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], to distinguish their brand of socialism from the &quot;[[reformist]]&quot; social democrats, were called &quot;Communists&quot;.  However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders, the term Communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as [[Stalinism]] or [[Maoism]].

There is a considerable variety of views among self-identified Communists.  However, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], [[school (discipline)|schools]] of communism associated with [[Karl Marx]] and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. [[Class struggle]] plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital, and the working class.  Marx held that society could not be transformed from the capitalist [[mode of production]] to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Some forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods, during certain historical moments, and under certain circumstances. For example, the [[Paris Commune]] in fact let [[Marx]] reinforce and implement his theories, by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] or even [[anarchism]], was the [[Spanish Revolution]] of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official [[historiography]]), during which much of Spain's economy, in most of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of [[State (polity)|state]], was put under workers' direct collective control.

In addition to this, the term ''communism'' (as well as ''socialism''), is often used to refer to those political and economical systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one [[Single-party state|single]] [[Communist party]], that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a [[totalitarian]] and [[bureaucratic]]. These systems are also often called [[Stalinism]], [[state capitalism]], [[state communism]] or [[state socialism]].

With the [[Soviet Union]]'s creation, after the end of [[Russian Civil War]], that followed to initial success of Red [[October Revolution]] in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries, and the [[Bolshevik party]] itself became [[Communist parties]], owing allegiance of varying degrees to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (see [[Communist International]]). After [[World War II]], regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in [[China]], supported by [[USSR]] and led by [[Mao Zedong]], came to power and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. Among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted a bureaucratic [[communist state]] as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola, and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under [[Communist state]]s.

Communism carries a strong [[social stigma]] in the United States, due to a history of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism in the United States]].&lt;!--research communism in South America--&gt; Since the early 1970s, the term &quot;[[Eurocommunism]]&quot; was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in [[western Europe]], which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the [[Soviet Union]]. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized [[single-party system]]s, and [[Marxist-Leninist]] governments, in [[eastern Europe]], from the late 1980s, and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]] on December 8, 1991, [[Marxist-Leninist]] State communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of '[[Communist states]]'.

====Marxism-Leninism====
{{Main|Marxism-Leninism}}
[[Vladimir Lenin]] never used the term ''Leninism'', nor did he refer to his views as ''Marxism-Leninism''. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). [[Bolshevik]] communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed &quot;Marxism-Leninism,&quot; or sometimes only &quot;Leninism.&quot; Marxism-Leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the [[Comintern]] and of [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] around the world.

===== Stalinism =====
{{Main|Stalinism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
{{Section OR|date=July 2010}}
[[Stalinism]] was the theory and practice of communism practiced by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1928–1953. Stalinism, strictly speaking, refers to a style of government or political structure, rather than an ideology ''per se''; during the period of Stalin's rule in the Soviet Union, Marxism-Leninism was proclaimed the official ideology of the state. The term ''Stalinism'' is sometimes used to denote the brand of [[communism|Communist]] theory that dominated the Soviet Union and the countries within the Soviet sphere of influence during and after the leadership of Stalin. Stalin was not a theoretician, but a communicator who wrote several books in language easily understood, and, in contrast to Marx and Lenin, made few new theoretical contributions. The main contributions of Stalin to Communist theory were ''[[Socialism in One Country]]'' and the theory of [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. The groundwork for the Soviet policy concerning nationalities, was laid in Stalin's 1913 work ''Marxism and the National Question''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The regime claims to apply those ideas in ways fitting the changing needs of society, as with the transition from &quot;[[socialism]] at a snail's pace&quot; in the mid-1920s to the rapid industrialisation of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Five-Year Plans]].{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} 

Whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is still a subject of debate amongst historians and political scientists. Stalin, in contrast to many contemporary revolutionaries, did not write a significant body of theoretical work. Many people who profess [[Marxism]] or [[Leninism]] view Stalinism as a perversion of their ideas. [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], in particular, are virulently [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]], considering Stalinism a counter-revolutionary policy using vague Marxist-sounding rhetoric to achieve power. Trotskyists in particular believe that Stalinism contradicted authentic Marxism and Leninism, and they initially used the term ''Bolshevik-Leninism'' to define their beliefs.

From 1917 to 1924, [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]] and  Stalin often appeared united, but their ideological differences never disappeared. In his dispute with Trotsky, Stalin de-emphasised the role of workers in advanced capitalist countries. For example, he postulated that the United States working class was a bourgeoisified [[labour aristocracy]]). Stalin also polemicised against Trotsky on the role of peasants, as in [[China]], whereas Trotsky was in favor of urban insurrection and over peasant-based [[guerrilla warfare]].{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}

Stalinism has been described as being synonymous with [[totalitarianism]], or a [[tyranny|tyrannical regime]]. The term has been used to describe regimes that fight political dissent through violence, imprisonment, and killings.

===== Maoism =====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:little red book.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Cover of [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung]] with Chinese words &quot;Supreme Directives&quot;]] --&gt;
{{Main|Maoism}}
A key concept that distinguishes [[Maoism]] from other left-wing ideologies is the belief that the [[class struggle]] continues throughout the entire socialist period, as a result of the fundamental [[antagonistic contradiction]] between [[capitalism]] and [[communism]]. Even when the [[proletariat]] has seized state power through a socialist [[revolution]], the potential remains for a [[bourgeoisie]] to restore capitalism. Indeed, Mao famously stated that &quot;the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself&quot;, implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented.

Unlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban [[proletariat]] was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership.

Unlike most other political ideologies, including other [[socialist]] and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral [[military]] doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with [[military strategy]]. In Maoist thought, &quot;political power comes from the barrel of the gun&quot; (one of Mao's quotes), and the [[peasantry]] can be mobilized to undertake a &quot;[[people's war]]&quot; of armed struggle involving [[guerrilla warfare]].

Since the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as &quot;Maoist&quot; have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and the [[New People's Army]] of the [[Philippines]], continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented.

===== Trotskyism =====
[[Trotskyism]] is the theory of Marxism as advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]].  Trotsky considered himself a [[Bolshevik]]-[[Leninism|Leninist]], arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]].  He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.  His politics differed greatly from those of [[Stalinism|Stalin]] or [[Maoism|Mao]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international &quot;[[permanent revolution]]&quot; and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.

====Council and Left communism====
[[Council Communism]] is a current of [[Libertarian Marxism]] that emerged out of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]] in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to [[State Capitalism]]/[[State Socialism]] as well as its advocacy of [[Workers' Councils]] as the basis for [[Socialist State|Workers' Democracy]]. Originally affiliated with the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD), Council Communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater [[Libertarian Socialism]] movement.

Chief among the tenets of Council Communism is its opposition to the [[vanguard party|party vanguardism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Pannekoek36&quot;&gt;[[Anton Pannekoek]] (1936) [http://libcom.org/library/workers-councils-book-pannekoek ''Workers’ Councils'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/notes-trotsky-pannekoek-bordiga-gilles-dauv%C3%A9 ''Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga - Gilles Dauvé'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[democratic centralism]]&lt;ref&gt;Pannekoek, Anton.

Council Communism also stands in contrast to [[Social Democracy]] through its formal rejection of both the [[reformism]] and [[Parliamentarism]]&lt;ref&gt;Ruhle, Otto. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1920/ruhle02.htm &quot;The Revolution Is Not A Party Affair&quot;.] 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before the [[World War I|First World War]], but it only came into focus after 1918 . All left communists were supportive of the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]] but retained a critical view of its development. Some, however, would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a [[proletarian]] or [[socialist]] nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the [[bourgeois]] revolution by creating a [[state capitalism|state capitalist]] system.

===Autonomism===
{{Main|Autonomism}}
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of Italian autonomism]]Autonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.

Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a &quot;bottom up&quot; theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.

Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].

It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.

The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarchism}}
Anarchism is a [[political philosophy]] which considers the [[state (polity)|state]] undesirable, unnecessary and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or [[anarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;

[[Anarchism]] as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the 19th century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, &quot;Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters&quot;, in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, July 25, 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=2003-04-21 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement.  For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley]]'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. 

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn  = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn  = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a Western-backed grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. 

In Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|299px|right|thumb|Proudhon and his children, by [[Gustave Courbet]], 1865]]Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labor movements, then took an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the US.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticized [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to Josiah Warren or another dissident Owenite in the same circles; Wilbur, Shawn, 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This influenced individualist anarchists in the United States such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[William B.

[[Josiah Warren]] proposed similar ideas in 1833&lt;ref&gt;Warren published the periodical &quot;The Peaceful Revolutionist&quot; in 1833, seven years before Proudhon's &quot;What is Property.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; after participating in a failed [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] experiment.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;While more learned men lost faith in utopias and in human nature when the New Harmony experiment failed, Warren became more trusting than before in man's intelligence and perfectibility.&quot; - ''Native American Anarchism'', pg. 94, Eunice Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s and 1850s, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Freedom of association|free association]], voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. Many mutualists believe a market without [[government intervention]] drives prices down to labor-costs, eliminating profit, rent, and interest according to the [[labor theory of value]]. Firms would be forced to compete over workers just as workers compete over firms, raising wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carson |first=Kevin |title=Studies in Mutualist Political Economy |publisher=BookSurge Publishing |chapterurl=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html |year=2007 |isbn=1-4196-5869-7 | chapter-url = Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot; From &quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments.

==== Collectivist anarchism ====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
Collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary&lt;ref name=&quot;Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54&quot;&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; form of anarchism most commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Johann Most]] and the anti-authoritarian section of the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] (1864–1876).&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. 2006. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be initiated by small cohesive elite group through acts of violence, or &quot;[[propaganda by the deed]],&quot; which would inspire the workers to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54&quot;/&gt; Workers would be compensated for their work on the basis of the amount of time they contributed to production, rather than goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. 

Although [[Collectivist anarchism]] shares many similarities with [[Anarchist communism]] there are also many key differences between them. For example collectivist anarchists believe that the economy and most or all property should be collectively owned by society while anarchist communists by contrast believe that the concept of ownership should be rejected by society and replaced with the concept of usage.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Beckman. What is Anarchism?, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Collectivist anarchism|Collectivist anarchists]] often favor using a form of currency to compensate workers according to the amount of time spent contributing to society and production while Anarcho-communists believe that currency and wages should be abolished all together and goods should be distributed &quot;[[From each according to his ability to each according to his need|to each according to his or her need&quot;]].

{{main|Anarchist communism}}
[[File:Kropotkin Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|Anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] believed that in [[anarchy]], workers would spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all society.]]
Anarchist communists propose that a society composed of a number of [[self-governance|self-governing]] [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]] with [[collectivism|collective]] use of the [[means of production]], with [[direct democracy]] as the political organizational form, and related to other communes through [[federation]] would be the freest form of social organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;/&gt; However, some anarchist communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and favor [[consensus democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Déjacque]] was an early anarchist communist and the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Other important anarchist communists include [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]].

In anarchist communism, individuals would not receive direct [[Remuneration|compensation]] for labour (through sharing of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] or payment), but would instead have free access to the resources and surplus of the [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller. ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing (1991) ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin, on the basis of his [[biology|biological]] research and experimentation, believed that humans and human society are more inclined towards efforts for mutual benefit than toward competition and strife.&lt;ref&gt;

Some [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]] saw anarchist communism as their objective; for example, the Spanish CNT adopted [[Isaac Puente]]'s 1932 ''[[libertarian communism|El comunismo libertario]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;&gt;Puente, Isaac &quot;Libertarian Communism&quot; (The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review' #6 Orkney 1982)[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society. 

Anarcho-communism does not always have a [[communitarian]] philosophy. Some forms of anarchist communism are [[egoist anarchism|egoist]] and strongly influenced by radical individualism believing that anarcho-communism does not require a communitarian nature at all. Forms of [[libertarian communism]] such as [[Situationist International|Situationism]] are strongly Egoist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communist [[Emma Goldman]] was influenced by both Stirner and Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as ''Anarchism And Other Essays''.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of [[anarchism]] that focuses on the [[labor union|labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labor unions]] as a potential force for [[revolution]]ary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are:
:# Workers' [[Wiktionary:Solidarity|solidarity]]
:# [[Direct action]]
:# [[Workers' self-management]]
[[File:Anarchist flag.svg|right|thumb|Flag often used by anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists, and the flag of [[Anarchist Catalonia]], a 20th-century example of an anarcho-communist society]]. Workers' solidarity means that anarcho-syndicalists believe all workers—no matter their [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], or [[ethnic]] group—are in a similar situation in regard to their [[Wiktionary:Boss|boss]] ([[class consciousness]]). Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]].

Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.

[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

===Social democracy===
{{Main|Social democracy}}
Social democracy can be divided into classic and modern strands. Classic social democracy was a political philosophy that attempted to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within.  The term ''social democracy'' can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate. 

The [[Socialist International]] (SI) - the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties - defines social democracy as an ideal form of [[representative democracy]], that may solve the problems found in a [[liberal democracy]]. The SI emphasizes the following principles [http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html]: Firstly, ''freedom''{{spaced ndash}} not only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power. Secondly, ''equality and social justice''{{spaced ndash}}not only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities. Finally, ''solidarity''{{spaced ndash}}unity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.

Modern social democracy has abandoned socialism as its goal by rejecting state ownership or direct worker ownership of the means of production and a reorganization of the economy, and instead advocates a [[welfare state]], regulated capitalism and some public ownership of supporting industries. While it is still considered a socialist political movement, modern social democracy advocates capitalist economic systems such as the [[social market economy]], [[Third Way (centrism)|Third-way]] mixed economies and relies on [[Keynesian economics]].

The prime example of social democracy is [[Social welfare in Sweden|Sweden]], which prospered considerably in the 1990s and 2000s. Sweden has produced a robust economy from [[sole proprietorship]]s up through to [[multinational corporation|multinationals]], while maintaining one of the highest [[life expectancy|life expectancies]] in the world, low [[unemployment]] and low [[inflation]], all while registering sizable [[economic growth]]. Many see this as validation of the superiority of social democracy. 

However, others point out that - when compared to other developed countries - Sweden's economic growth fell behind in that period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Also, Sweden experiences welfare dependency of around 20% of the working age population{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} according to the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]]. Likewise, [[crime]] has been steadily rising since the 1960s [http://www.bra.se/extra/pod/?action=pod_show&amp;id=21&amp;module_instance=11]. 

In any case, despite these issues, Sweden continues to be viewed as a model for social-democratic governance due to its strong economy and general social stability.

===Democratic socialism===
{{Main|Democratic socialism}}
Modern [[democratic socialism]] is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy, and in some accounts are identical, while other accounts stress differences.  Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system, while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the [[mixed economy]]) and the [[welfare state]], while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary]] or [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] means.

Democratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the [[welfare state]], but whereas most social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, many democratic socialists view it as a means to an end.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Democratic socialists are also committed to the ideas of the [[Property redistribution|redistribution]] of wealth and power, as well as social ownership of major industries, concepts widely abandoned by social democrats. 

There are no countries in the world that would qualify as a &quot;democratic socialist&quot; state, although some states describe themselves as such, for instance [[Venezuela]], whose leader [[Hugo Chavez]] has claimed that democratic socialism is integral to the [[Bolivarian]] form of socialism that he is trying to promote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sojo|first=Cleto A|title=Venezuela’s Chavez Closes World Social Forum with Call to Transcend Capitalism|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/907|publisher=Venezuela analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious socialism===
{{Main|Religious communism}}
Religious communism is a form of [[communism]] centered on [[religion|religious]] principles. The term usually refers to a number of [[utopia]]n religious societies practicing the voluntary dissolution of private property, so that society's benefits are distributed according to a person's needs, and every person performs labor according to their abilities. The term ''religious communism'' has also been used to describe the ideas of religious individuals and groups who advocate the application of communist policies on a wider scale, often joining secular communists in their struggle to abolish capitalism.

====Christian socialism====
{{Main|Christian socialism}}
{{further2|[[Christian left]] and [[Social Gospel|social gospel]]}}
There are individuals and groups, past and present, that are clearly both Christian and socialist, such as [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], author of ''The Kingdom of Christ'' (1838),and the [[Christian Socialist Movement]] (UK) (CSM), affiliated with the British [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Distributism]], is a [[Third Way (centrism)|third-way]] economic philosophy formulated by such Catholic thinkers as [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] to apply the principles of [[social justice]] articulated by the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Pope [[Leo XIII]]'s encyclical [[Rerum Novarum]].

Various [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clerical parties have at times referred to themselves as &quot;Christian Social.&quot; Two examples are the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] of [[Karl Lueger]] in [[Austria]] before and after [[World War I]], and the contemporary [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]]. Yet these parties have never espoused socialist policies and have always stood at the conservative side of [[Christian Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialdemocraticpartyofamerica.org/politicalspectrum.htm Political Spectrum as seen by the Social Democratic Party of America]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugo Chavez]] of [[Venezuela]] is an advocate of a form of Christian socialism as he claims that [[Jesus Christ]] was a socialist.

Tolstoy takes the viewpoint that all governments who wage war, and churches who in turn support those governments, are an affront to the Christian principles of [[Christian nonviolence|nonviolence]] and [[Nonresistance#Christian theology|nonresistance]]. Although Tolstoy never actually used the term &quot;Christian anarchism&quot; in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', reviews of this book following its publication in 1894 appear to have coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O40-YRkO0t8C&amp;q=%22christian+anarchism%22&amp;dq=%22christian+anarchism%22&amp;cd=6 |title=The review of reviews, Volume 9, 1894, p.306 |edited=William Thomas Stead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sIpNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22christian+anarchism%22&amp;dq=%22christian+anarchism%22 |title=The Speaker, Volume 9, 1894, p.254 |edited=Mather &amp; Crowther}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian anarchist groups have included the [[Doukhobors]], [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and the [[Brotherhood Church]].

====Islamic socialism====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TheGreenBook.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover of English language edition of [[The Green Book]].]] --&gt;
[[Islamic socialism]] is the political ideology of [[Libya]]'s [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], former [[Iraq]]i president [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], [[Syria]]n President [[Hafez Al-Assad]] and of the [[Pakistan]]i leader of [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' (written by [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]) consists of three parts - &quot;The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: 'The Authority of the People'&quot;, &quot;The Solution of the Economic Problem: 'Socialism'&quot;, and &quot;The Social Basis of the Third Universal Theory&quot;. The book is controversial because it completely rejects modern conceptions of [[liberal democracy]] and encourages the institution of a form of [[direct democracy]] based on popular committees. Critics charge that Qaddafi uses these committees as tools of [[autocratic]] political repression in practice.

Scholars have highlighted the similarities between the Islamic economic system and socialist theory. For example, both are against unearned income. [[Islam]] does allow private ownership of [[natural resource]]s and large industries, which are owned collectively, or at least encouraged to be so.

===Regional socialism===

====Arab socialism====
{{Main|Arab socialism}}
The [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] rules [[Syria]] (and ruled [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]]), based on a tradition of [[secular]], non-Marxist socialism. Ba'thist beliefs combine [[Arab Socialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[Pan-Arabism]]. The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the [[Middle East]], which sometimes lean towards [[Islamism]] and [[theocracy]]. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Lynn. ''Imperialism and the gulf war'', [http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/gulfcrisis/c5.html Chapter 5], 1990-91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish republican socialism====
Socialism has traditionally been part of the [[Irish republican]] movement since the early 20th century, when [[James Connolly]], an Irish [[Marxist]] theorist, took part in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.  Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in [[Northern Ireland]] advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist.  The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, promotes social democracy, while militant Republican parties such as [[Sinn Féin]], [[Republican Sinn Féin]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a [[united Ireland]] has been achieved.  The [[Irish Republican Socialist Movement]], encompassing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]], has an ideology which combines [[Marxist-Leninism]] with traditional militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.

===Eco-socialism===
{{Main|Eco-socialism}}
Merging aspects of Marxism, [[socialism]], [[environmentalism]], anarchism and [[ecology]], Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]]. Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green movement]] for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]. At the same time, Eco-socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.&lt;ref name=Babylon&gt;Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-socialists are [[anti-globalisation]]. [[Joel Kovel]] sees [[globalisation]] as a force driven by capitalism - in turn, the rapid [[economic growth]] encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.&lt;ref name=Kovel&gt;Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows [[Marxism|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. As [[Joel Kovel]] explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like [[Joel Kovel|Kovel]] stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities - such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence - are unrewarded, while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.&lt;ref name=Kovel/&gt;

[[Agrarian socialism]] is another variant of eco-socialism.

==== Green anarchism ====
{{Main|Green anarchism}}
Green anarchism, or ecoanarchism, is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[individualist anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoreau&quot;&gt;&quot;Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.&quot;[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html &quot;LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA. EL ANARQUISMO INDIVIDUALISTA ESPAÑOL DURANTE LA DICTADURA Y LA SEGUNDA REPÚBLICA (1923-1938)&quot; by Xavier Diez]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century there emerged an [[Anarcho-naturism|anarchist naturist]] current within [[individualist anarchist]]  circles in France, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismolibertario&quot;&gt;[http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf#search=%22Antonia%20Maym%C3%B3n%22 EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890-1939) by Jose Maria Rosello]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spanishind&quot;&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html &quot;LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA. EL ANARQUISMO INDIVIDUALISTA ESPAÑOL DURANTE LA DICTADURA Y LA SEGUNDA REPÚBLICA (1923-1938)&quot; by Xavier Diez]&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary green anarchists can be described as [[anarcho-primitivist]]s (or anti-[[civilization]] anarchists), though not all green anarchists are primitivists. Likewise, there is a strong critique of modern technology among green anarchists, though not all reject it entirely. Important contemporary currents are [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[social ecology]].

===Nationalist and ethnocentric socialism===

====Ba'athism====
{{main|Ba'athism}}
The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party (also known as the [[Ba'ath Party]]; {{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي&lt;/big&gt;}}) is a [[secularism|secularist]] [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabist]] political party that synthesizes [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]]. It opposes Western [[imperialism]] and calls for the ethnic &quot;awakening&quot; or &quot;resurrection&quot; of the [[Arabs|Arab people]] into a single united state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baath-party.org/eng/constitution1.htm The Baath Arab Socialist Party National Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Ba'ath'', also spelled as ''Ba'th'' or ''Baath'', means resurrection or renaissance. The party's motto, &quot;Unity, Liberty, Socialism&quot; (''wahda, hurriya, ishtirakiya''), was inspired by the French [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] political doctrine linking national unity and social equity.&lt;ref name='Histoire  de Saint-Just Député de la Convention Nationale'&gt;{{cite news | first=Ernest | last=Hamel | coauthors= | title= Histoire  de Saint-Just Député de la Convention Nationale | year=1859 | publisher= Impr. et Librairie Poulet-Malassis et Broise | url = | work = | pages = | accessdate =| language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the slogan, &quot;unity&quot; refers to Arab unity, &quot;liberty&quot; emphasizes being free from foreign control and interference, and &quot;socialism&quot; refers to [[Arab socialism]], not European-style [[Marxism]] or [[communism]].  

The party was founded in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] in 1940 by the Syrian intellectuals [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Bitar]], and since its inception, it has established branches in different Arab countries, although the only countries it has ever held power in are Syria and [[Iraq]]. Aflaq and al-Bitar both studied at the [[Sorbonne]] in the early 1930s, at a time when [[centre-left]] [[Positivism]] was still the dominant ideology amongst France's academic elite. The Ba'ath party included a significant number of [[Christian Arabs]] among its founding members. For them, a resolutely nationalist and secular political framework was a suitable way to avoid a faith-based Islamic orientation and to give non-Muslims full acknowledgement as citizens. 

In 1955, a [[coup d'état]] by the military against the historical leadership of Aflaq and al-Bitar led the Syrian and Iraqi parties to split into rival organizations — the Qotri (Regionalist) Syria-based party and the Qawmi (Nationalist) Iraq-based party.&lt;ref name='The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics'&gt;{{cite news | first=Nikolaos | last=van Dam | coauthors= | title= The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics | year=1979 | publisher= I B Tauris | url = | work = | pages = | accessdate =| language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Ba'ath parties kept their names and maintained parallel structures, but became so antagonistic that the Syrian Ba'ath regime became the only Arab government to support non-Arab [[Iran]] against Iraq during the [[Iran-Iraq War]].

In Syria, the Ba'ath Party has had a [[monopoly]] on political power since the party's 1963 coup. Ba'athists seized power in Iraq in 1963, but were deposed months later. They  returned to power in a 1968 coup and remained the sole party of government until the [[2003 Iraq invasion]]. Since then, the party has been banned in Iraq.

====Kuomintang and Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang====
{{main|Kuomintang|Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang}}
The Kuomintang Party (Chinese National People's Party) was founded in the [[Republic of China]] in 1912 by Dr. [[Sun Yatsen]],  a proponent of [[Chinese nationalism]], who founded [[Revive China Society]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' (Chinese) [http://www.kmt.org.tw/hc.aspx?id=10 &quot;Major Events in KMT&quot; ''History Official Site of the KMT''] last accessed Aug. 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Kuomintang ideology features [[Three Principles of the People]], which are [[nationalism]], [[democracy]] and [[socialism]]. 

The party has adopted a [[One-China policy]], arguing that there is only one state called  [[China]], and that the Republic of China (not the [[People's Republic of China]]) is its [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate government]]. The party has had conflicts with the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=usOMZjTWrJ0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=china+stagnated+feudalism+political#v=onepage&amp;q=guomindang%20marxists&amp;f=false|title=Feudalism and non-European societies|author=T.

The Kuomintang attempted to levy taxes upon merchants in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and the merchants resisted by raising an army, the Merchant's Volunteer Corps.

Chiang Kai-shek led his army of [[Whampoa Military Academy]] graduates to defeat the merchant's army. He was assisted by Soviet advisors, who supplied him with weapons, while the merchants were supplied with weapons from the Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+democracy&amp;q=emocracy+absolutely+impossible#v=onepage&amp;q=merchants%20militia&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=71|isbn=0-7867-1484-0|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=I+have+often+thought+that+i+am+the+most+clever+woman+that+ever+lived,+and+others+cannot+compare+with+me&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=merchants%20levy%20taxes&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=|page=128|isbn=1-4391-4893-7|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British led an international flotilla to support the merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=I+have+often+thought+that+i+am+the+most+clever+woman+that+ever+lived,+and+others+cannot+compare+with+me&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=customs%20surplus%20merchants%20levy%20taxes&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=|page=128|isbn=1-4391-4893-7|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang seized the western-supplied weapons from the merchants, and battled against them. A Kuomintang general executed several merchants, and the Kuomintang formed a Soviet-inspired Revolutionary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+democracy&amp;q=emocracy+absolutely+impossible#v=onepage&amp;q=merchants%20to%20dinner%20revolutionary&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=72|isbn=0-7867-1484-0|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kuomintang's economic and military campaign against merchants continued for many years. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese-made items, fining them. 

The Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang (VNQDD) was based on the Chinese Kuomintang, and incorporated socialism and nationalism as part of its ideology. The party sought independence from French colonial rule in [[Vietnam]] during the early 20th century. Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. From 1928, the VNQDD attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators.

During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]] and, in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945, the VNQDD and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. After a falling out, Ho purged the VNQDD, leaving his communist-dominated [[Vietminh]] unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the [[First Indochina War]], Vietnam was [[Partition of Vietnam|partitioned into two zones]].  The remnants of the VNQDD fled to the anti-communist [[South Vietnam|south]], where they remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.
