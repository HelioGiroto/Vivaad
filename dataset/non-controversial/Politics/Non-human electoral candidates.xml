      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8857">'''Non-human electoral candidates''' have been found in a number of countries. Often, the candidacies are a means of casting a [[protest vote]] or [[satire|satirizing]] the political system. Other times, it is simply done for the entertainment value.

Electoral regulations may explicitly require candidates to be human (or equivalent wording), or may require candidates to do things which animals cannot reasonably do (such as sign their name legibly on a legal form). On some occasions, however, animals have been accepted as candidates, and have even won office.

==Examples==
* [[Incitatus]], the horse of [[Caligula]], who it is alleged became a consul and a priest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 55; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28 LIX.28]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A5855466 Gaius Caligula - Roman Emperor (12 - 41 AD)], [[h2g2]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Molly the Dog, a [[dachshund]] from Oklahoma, named as a candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mollythedog2008.com Molly the dog]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Morris the Cat]] ran as a candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1988]] and the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jiffynotes.com/a_study_guides/book_notes_add/emmc_0001_0001_0/emmc_0001_0001_0_00133.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus the Immortal]], a boar hog that the [[Yippies]] nominated as a candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1968]].
*Cacareco, a [[rhinoceros]] at the [[São Paulo]] zoo, was a candidate for the 1958 city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriaviva.com.br/ocruzeiro/24101959/241059_8.htm Cacareco]&lt;/ref&gt; Electoral officials, of course, did not accept Cacareco's candidacy, but he eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that same election (which was also marked by rampant [[absenteeism]]).  Today, the term &quot;Voto Cacareco&quot; (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil. Cacareco's candidacy inspired the [[Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–1993)|Rhinoceros Party of Canada]], nominally led by the rhinoceros [[Cornelius the First]].
*Tião, a bad-tempered [[chimpanzee]], was put forward by the fictional ''Brazilian Banana Party'' (''Partido Bananista Brasileiro'', actually the satirical group [[Casseta &amp; Planeta]]) as a candidate for the [[Rio de Janeiro]] mayoralty in 1988. The campaign's slogan was &quot;Vote monkey - get monkey&quot; (because people were tired of voting for one platform and then seeing the elected officials implementing another one). There is no official counting (because all votes were recorded as &quot;null&quot;), but it's estimated that Tião received over 400,000 votes, coming third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rio.rj.gov.br/riozoo/tiao.htm Tião's home page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/ext/diariodopassado/20040116/000205438.htm Tião's 31st birthday], O Estado de S. Paulo, 1994-01-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/ultimas/cidades/noticias/2005/mar/18/75.htm Rio Zoo completes 60 years], O Estado de S. Paulo, 2005-03-18&lt;/ref&gt;
*Katten Mickelin (Mickelin the Cat) was the leader of the Swedish Ezenhemmer Plastic Bags and Child Rearing Utensils Party.
*[[New Zealand]]'s [[McGillicuddy Serious Party]] entered a goat in a local [[Waiheke Island]] election, but their attempt to have a hedgehog stand for [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] was unsuccessful.
*[[Dustin the Turkey]], a popular Irish television puppet received thousands of votes in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland's]] 1997 presidential election. Although not being an official candidate there are rumours that he came in fifth, ahead of official candidate [[Derek Nally]].
*[[United States]] film maker [[Michael Moore]] attempted to get a potted [[ficus]] tree onto the ballot as a candidate for [[United States Representative]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0426-09.htm Plant candidate]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[United States]] TV host and [[California]] councilmember [[Charlotte Laws]] had a chicken who ran for Vice President on the Bully ticket in the 2012 election.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_21839829/hen-white-house-just-ticket&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ed the Sock]], a fictional [[sock puppet]], attempted to run for the [[Fed-Up Party]] during the [[Canadian federal election, 2011]].
*The [[Inanimate Objects Party]] encourages write-in votes for inanimate objects, such as an inflatable whale named Arthur Galpin or a dead albino squirrel.
* [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tuxedo-Party/391884324181841 Tuxedo Stan], a cat from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, was a mayoral candidate in the 2012 municipal elections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Tuxedo+Stan+running+mayor+Halifax+video/7362684/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  representing the Tuxedo Party, a political movement aimed to improve the welfare of felines in HRM (Halifax Regional Municipality) &quot;because neglect isn't working&quot;. He has been endorsed by celebrities including [[Anderson_cooper|Anderson Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/anderson-cooper-endorses-tuxedo-stan-for-mayor-1.970833}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Several animals in the US have been elected mayors of small towns such as [[Rabbit Hash, Kentucky]], whose mayor is a black lab named Junior Cochran, and [[Lajitas, Texas]], whose mayor is a beer-drinking goat named Clay Henry III. Both Rabbit Hash and Lajitas are unincorporated towns where the mayoralty is purely a ceremonial position, not an actual leader of government.

*[[Boston Curtis]], a brown mule, was offered as a candidate for a Republican precinct seat in [[Milton, Washington]] in 1938, winning 52 to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788780,00.html &quot;Boston Curtis.&quot; Time Magazine. Published 26 Sept. 1938.] Accessed 11 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Milton_Mule/ Boston Curtis]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The mayor of [[Sunol, California]] was, for 10 years (1981–1990), a black Labrador-Rottweiler named Bosco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=573498 Vanderbilt Television News Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1989, regional council boundaries were redrawn, with an emphasis on catchments being connected. These revised maps made [[Whangamomona]], NZ part of the [[Manawatu-Wanganui]] Region. Residents wanted to continue to be part of the [[Taranaki Region]], and on 1 November 1989, they responded by declaring themselves the &quot;Republic of Whangamomona&quot; at the first Republic Day. At every Republic Day, they vote to either keep the seating President or to vote in a new one. Since 1999, they have had Billy Gumboot the Goat (1999–2001) and Tai the Poodle (2003–2004), the current [[incumbent]] being Murt &quot;Murtle the Turtle&quot; Kennard (2005–Present).
*In 1997, a cat named [[Stubbs (cat)|Stubbs]] was elected mayor of [[Talkeetna, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/17/us/alaska-cat-mayor/index.html |title=Mayor of Alaska village walks on four paws |date=July 17, 2012 |accessdate=July 17, 2012 |last=Yan |first=Holly |work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, a [[Dachshund]] called Saucisse (Sausage), was a candidate for [[Marseille]] ([[France]]) municipal elections. He won 4% of votes. Eight years later, in 2009, he participated the third season of ''[[Secret Story 2009 (France)|Secret Story]]'', the French version of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]''. He entered the house on Day 36. His secret is that he was a candidate at the election of Marseille Mayor. To protect his secret, he entered the house with the nickname &quot;Secret&quot;.
*In 2006, a famous prankster and [[street art]]ist from Szeged, [[Hungary]], proclaimed himself the founder of the [[Hungarian Double-tailed Dog Party]], going as far as to place propaganda ads out on the walls of Szeged's houses, promoting the candidate &quot;István Nagy&quot;, a two-tailed dog.

==Folklore and pop culture==
The notion of animals being elected to office have often been the subject of parody and folklore. In 1972, American singer [[Tom T. Hall]] had a hit with a recording entitled &quot;The Monkey That Became President&quot; which considered a scenario in which said animal was elected to office. [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s 1817 novel ''[[Melincourt (novel)|Melincourt]]'' featured an orangutan as a parliamentary candidate.
