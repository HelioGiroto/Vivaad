[[File:Holyoake2.JPG|thumb|200px|[[George Jacob Holyoake]] (1817–1906), British writer who coined the term &quot;secularism.&quot;]]

'''Secularism''' is the principle of separation of government institutions, and the persons mandated to represent the State, from [[theocracy|religious institutions]] and [[clergy|religious dignitaries]]. In one sense, secularism may assert the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, and the right to freedom from governmental imposition of religion upon the people within a state that is neutral on matters of belief. (See also [[separation of church and state]] and [[Laïcité]].)  In another sense, it refers to the view that human activities and decisions, especially [[political]] ones, should be unbiased by religious influence.&lt;ref&gt;Kosmin, Barry A. &quot;Contemporary Secularity and Secularism.&quot; '''Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives'''. Ed. Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[public reason]].) Some scholars are now arguing that the very idea of secularism will change.&lt;ref&gt;Poddar, Prem and Srinivasan Jain. ‘Secularism as an Idea Will Change: Interview with Homi Bhabha’,''The Book Review'', January 1995. Republished in ''The Hindu''1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Atheism and Irreligion Sidebar}}

Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Epicurus]]; [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Muslim]] [[polymath]]s such as [[Ibn Rushd]]; [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]], [[Voltaire]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Thomas Paine]]; and more recent [[Freethought|freethinkers]], [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], and [[Atheism|atheists]] such as [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]] and [[Bertrand Russell]].

The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely.  In European [[laicism]], it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward [[modernization]], and away from traditional religious values (also known as [[secularization]]).  This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official [[state church]] or other state support of religion.  In the [[United States]], some argue that [[#State secularism|state secularism]] has served to a greater extent to protect religion and the religious from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Yavuz, Hakan M. and John L. Esposio (2003) ‘’Turkish Islam and the Secular State: The Gulen Movement’’.  Syracuse University, pg. xv–xvii.  ISBN 0-8156-3040-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005).  ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 147 (&quot;But with the Second World War just ahead, secularism fo the antireligious type was soon to disappear from mainstream American society, to be replaced by a new complex of ideas that focused on secularizing the state, not on secularizing society.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;  Within countries as well, differing political movements support secularism for varying reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005).  ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 25 (&quot;Together, early protosecularists (Jefferson and Madison) and proto-evangelicals (Backus, Leland, and others) made common cause in the fight for nonestablishment [of religion]{{spaced ndash}}but for starkly different reasons.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term &quot;secularism&quot; was first used by the [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[George Jacob Holyoake ]] in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, G.J. (1896). ''The Origin and Nature of Secularism'', London: Watts and Co. p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term was new, the general notions of [[freethought]] on which it was based had existed throughout [[history]]. In particular, early secular ideas involving the separation of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] can be traced back to [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes) and the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Wahab El Messeri. [http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/tvtk/ch21.htm Episode 21: Ibn Rushd], ''Everything you wanted to know about Islam but was afraid to Ask'', ''Philosophia Islamica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fauzi M. Najjar (Spring, 1996). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_n2_v18/ai_18627295/pg_13 The debate on Islam and secularism in Egypt], ''Arab Studies Quarterly (ASQ)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Holyoake invented the term &quot;secularism&quot; to describe his views of promoting a social order separate from religion, without actively dismissing or criticizing religious belief.  An [[agnostic]] himself, Holyoake argued that &quot;Secularism is not an argument against Christianity, it is one independent of it. It does not question the pretensions of Christianity; it advances others. Secularism does not say there is no light or guidance elsewhere, but maintains that there is light and guidance in secular truth, whose conditions and sanctions exist independently, and act forever. Secular knowledge is manifestly that kind of knowledge which is founded in this life, which relates to the conduct of this life, conduces to the welfare of this life, and is capable of being tested by the experience of this life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13676a.htm ''Secularism''], Catholic Encyclopedia.  Newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Kosmin of the [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture]] breaks modern secularism into two types: hard and soft secularism.  According to Kosmin, &quot;the hard secularist considers religious propositions to be [[epistemological|epistemologically]] illegitimate, warranted by neither reason nor experience.&quot;  However, in the view of soft secularism, &quot;the attainment of absolute truth was impossible and therefore skepticism and tolerance should be the principle and overriding values in the discussion of science and religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/9614BC42-9E4C-42BF-A7F4-0B5EE1009462/0/Kosmin_paper.pdf |title=Kosmin, Barry A. &quot;Hard and soft secularists and hard and soft secularism: An intellectual and research challenge.&quot; |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State secularism==
{{See also|Secular state}}
[[File:Liberte-egalite-fraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Motto]] of the French republic on the [[Tympanum_(architecture)|tympanum]] of a [[Church (building)|church]].]]
In political terms, secularism is a movement towards the separation of religion and government (often termed the [[separation of church and state]]).  This can refer to reducing ties between a government and a [[state religion]], replacing laws based on scripture (such as the [[Torah]] and [[Sharia]] law) with civil laws, and eliminating discrimination on the basis of religion.  This is said to add to democracy by protecting the rights of religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005).  ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 14 (&quot;[Legal secularists] claim that separating religion from the public, governmental sphere is necessary to ensure full inclusion of all citizens.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism is often associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe and plays a major role in [[Western culture|Western society]]. The principles, but not necessarily practices, of [[separation of church and state in the United States]] and ''[[Laïcité]]'' in [[France]] draw heavily on secularism. Secular states also existed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Islam and secularism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). &quot;The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society&quot;, ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), p. 363-385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to the belief in the separation of church and state, secularists tend to prefer that politicians make decisions for secular rather than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005).  ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, policy decisions pertaining to topics like [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[embryonic stem cell]] research, [[same-sex marriage]], and [[sex education]] are prominently focused upon by American secularist organizations such as the [[Center for Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, November 15, 2006 [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/14/AR2006111401176.html &quot;Think Tank Will Promote Thinking&quot; ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfidc.org/declaration.html |title=&quot;Declaration in Defense of Science and Secularism&quot; |publisher=Cfidc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major religions accept the primacy of the rules of secular, democratic society but may still seek to influence political decisions or achieve specific privileges or influence through church-state agreements such as a [[concordat]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Many Christians support a secular state, and may acknowledge that the conception has support in Biblical teachings, particularly the statement of Jesus in the [[Gospel According to Luke|Book of Luke]]: &quot;Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.&quot;{{cn|date=June 2012}}. However, some [[Christian fundamentalist]]s (notably in the United States) oppose secularism, often claiming that there is a &quot;radical secularist&quot; ideology being adopted in current days and see secularism as a threat to &quot;Christian rights&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;christianpost-jerrys-kids&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant forces of religious fundamentalism in the contemporary world are [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] and [[Fundamentalist Islam]].  At the same time, one significant stream of secularism has come from religious minorities who see governmental and political secularism as integral to preserving equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005).  ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the well known states that are often considered &quot;[[constitution]]ally secular&quot; are [[USA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mount|first=Steve|title=&quot;The Constitution of the United States,&quot; Amendment 1 - Freedom of Religion, Press|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am1|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[France]], [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/preamble.htm |title=&quot;Preamble of the Constitution of India&quot; |publisher=Indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Mexico#Article 3|See article 3 of the 1917 Mexican constitution]], and [[Constitution of Mexico#Article 24|Article 24]]. See also Schmitt (1962) and Blancarte (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]], and [[Turkey]] although none of these nations have identical forms of governance.

==Secular society==
In studies of religion, modern [[Democracies]] are generally recognized as secular. This is due to the near-complete [[freedom of religion]] (beliefs on religion generally are not subject to legal or social sanctions), and the lack of authority of religious leaders over political decisions.  Nevertheless, religious beliefs are widely considered{{by whom|date=July 2012}} a relevant part of the political discourse in many of these countries. This contrasts with other Western countries where religious references are generally considered out-of-place in mainstream politics.

The nature of a secular society could characterize a secular society as one which:

# Refuses to commit itself as a whole to any one view of the nature of the universe and the role of man in it.
# Is not homogenous, but is pluralistic.
# Is tolerant. It widens the sphere of private decision-making.
# While every society must have some common aims, which implies there must be agreed on methods of problem-solving, and a common framework of law; in a secular society these are as limited as possible.
# [[Problem solving]] is approached rationally, through examination of the facts.  While the secular society does not set any overall aim, it helps its members realize their aims.
# Is a society without any official images.  Nor is there a common ideal type of behavior with universal application.

Positive Ideals behind the secular society:

# Deep respect for individuals and the small groups of which they are a part.
# Equality of all people.
# Each person should be helped to realize their particular excellence.
# Breaking down of the barriers of class and caste.&lt;ref&gt;''The Idea of a Secular Society'', D. L. Munby, London, Oxford University Press, 1963, pp. 14–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[sociology]] has, since [[Max Weber]], often been preoccupied with the problem of [[authority]] in secularized societies and with [[secularization]] as a sociological or historical process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', Max Weber, London, Routledge Classics, 2001, pp. 123-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth-century scholars whose work has contributed to the understanding of these matters include [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Hans Blumenberg]], [[Meyer Howard Abrams|M.H. Abrams]], [[Peter L. Berger]], [[Paul Bénichou]] and [[D. L. Munby]], among others.

Some societies become increasingly secular as the result of social processes, rather than through the actions of a dedicated secular movement; this process is known as [[secularization]].

==Secular ethics==
{{Main|Secular ethics|Secular religion}}

[[George Holyoake]]'s 1896 publication ''English Secularism'' defines secularism as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Secularism is a code of duty pertaining to this life, founded on considerations purely human, and intended mainly for those who find theology indefinite or inadequate, unreliable or unbelievable. Its essential principles are three: (1) The improvement of this life by material means. (2) That science is the available Providence of man. (3) That it is good to do good. Whether there be other good or not, the good of the present life is good, and it is good to seek that good.&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, George J. (1896). ''English Secularism.'' Chicago: The Open Court Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holyoake held that secularism and [[secular ethics]] should take no interest at all in religious questions (as they were irrelevant), and was thus to be distinguished from strong [[freethought]] and atheism. In this he disagreed with [[Charles Bradlaugh]], and the disagreement split the secularist movement between those who argued that anti-religious movements and activism was not necessary or desirable and those who argued that it was.

Contemporary ethical debate is often described as &quot;secular&quot;, with the work of [[Derek Parfit]] and [[Peter Singer]], and even the whole field of contemporary bioethics, having been described or self-described as explicitly secular or non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |isbn = 0-19-824615-3 |publication-place = Oxford [Oxfordshire] |title = Reasons and persons |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL3172889M/Reasons_and_persons |author = Derek Parfit |publication-date = 1984 |id = 0198246153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], &quot;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/is-secular-moral-theory-really-relatively-young.html Is &quot;Secular Moral Theory&quot; Really Relatively Young?], ''Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog'', June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], &quot;[http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=dawkins_18_2 When Religion Steps on Science's Turf: The Alleged Separation Between the Two Is Not So Tidy]&quot;, ''Free Inquiry'' vol. 18, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|16423736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
{{Main|List of secularist organizations}}
Groups such as the [[National Secular Society]] (United Kingdom) and [[Americans United]] campaign for secularism are often supported by [[Humanism|Humanists]]. In 2005, the National Secular Society held the inaugural &quot;Secularist of the Year&quot; awards ceremony. Its first winner was [[Maryam Namazie]], of the [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran]]. And of the [[Central Council of Ex-Muslims#Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain|Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;

Another secularist organization is the [[Secular Coalition for America]]. The Secular Coalition for America lobbies and advocates for separation of church and state as well as the acceptance and inclusion of Secular Americans in American life and public policy.  While Secular Coalition for America is linked to many secular humanistic organizations and many [[secular humanism|secular humanists]] support it, as with the Secular Society, some non-humanists support it.

Local organizations work to raise the profile of secularism in their communities and tend to include secularists, freethinkers, atheists, agnostics, and humanists under their organizational umbrella.

Student Organizations, such as the [[Toronto Secular Alliance]], try to popularize nontheism and secularism on campus.  The [[Secular Student Alliance]] is an educational nonprofit that organizes and aids such high school and college secular student groups.

In Turkey, the most prominent and active secularist organization is [[Atatürk Thought Association]] (ADD), which is credited for organizing the [[Republic Protests]] – demonstrations in the four largest cities in Turkey in 2007, where over 2 million people, mostly women, defended their concern in and support of secularist principles introduced by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].

[[Leicester Secular Society]] founded in 1851 is the world's oldest secular society.
