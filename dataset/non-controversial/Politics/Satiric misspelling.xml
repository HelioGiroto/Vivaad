A '''satiric misspelling''' is an intentional misspelling of a word, phrase or name for a [[rhetoric]]al purpose. This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, '''k''' replacing '''c'''), or symbol (for example, '''$''' replacing '''s''', '''@''' replacing '''a''', or '''¢''' replacing '''c''').  Satiric misspelling is found particularly in [[Internet slang|informal writing on the Internet]], but can also be found in some serious political writing that opposes the [[status quo]].

== &quot;K&quot; replacing &quot;C&quot; ==
Replacing the letter &quot;c&quot; with &quot;k&quot; in the first letter of a word came into use by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century.  The concept is continued today within the ranks of the Klan.

[[Image:Barc okupa.jpg|right|thumb|Barcelona squat and anarchist center, labeled &quot;OKUPA Y RESISTE&quot;]]

In the 1960s and early 1970s in the [[United States]], [[left-wing politics|leftists]], particularly the [[Yippies]], sometimes used &quot;Amerika&quot; rather than &quot;America&quot; in referring to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://web.archive.org/web/20080123223245/http://www.schwarzreport.org/Newsletters/1969/november15,69.htm] [http://hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=81] [http://web.archive.org/web/20060317052039/http://riseup.net/sds/graphics.htm] [http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/sixties/radical.html] [http://www1.american.edu/bgriff/H207web/sixties/rubinchildofAmerika.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used as a political statement today.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jasonalexandercruz.com/] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/guinnessgurl/sets/148438/]&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that this was originally an allusion to the [[German language|German]] spelling of America, and intended to be suggestive of [[Nazism]], a hypothesis that the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' supports.

In broader usage, the replacement of the letter &quot;C&quot; with &quot;K&quot; denotes general political skepticism about the topic at hand and is intended to discredit or debase the term in which the replacement occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.le-saint.com/wear.html LeSaint's Sloth Cave]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors sometimes spell former U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]]'s name as &quot;Klinton&quot; or &quot;Klintoon&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A similar usage in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan Language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} is to write &quot;''okupa''&quot; rather than ''&quot;ocupa&quot;'' (often on a building or area occupied by [[squatter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|url=http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611121504/http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp|archivedate=June 11, 2008|title=comunidades.calle22.com - TODOS SOMOS OKUPAS|date=20080611121504}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the name adopted by ''okupación'' activist groups), which is particularly remarkable because the letter &quot;k&quot; is rarely found in either Spanish, Portuguese or Italian words. It stems from [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] movements which used &quot;k&quot; to signal rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez González, Félix. (2006). &quot;Medios de comunicación y contracultura juvenil&quot;. In ''Círculo'' 25:5&amp;ndash;30 [http://www.ucm.es/info/circulo/no25/rodriguez.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===KKK replacing C or K===
A common satiric usage of the letters ''kkk'' is the spelling of ''America'' as ''Amerikkka'', alluding to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], drawing to a perceived notion of an underlying or inherent [[Racism in the United States|racism]] in American society. The earliest known usage of ''Amerikkka'' recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in 1970, in a journal called ''Black World.'' Presumably, this was an extrapolation from the then already widespread ''Amerika''.

The spelling ''Amerikkka'' came into greater use after the 1990 release of the [[gangsta rap]] album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' by [[Ice Cube]], also used by rapper [[Spice 1]] for his album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Nightmare]]'' and by [[Shock Rock]] band, [[Undercover Slut]] for their album ''&quot;Amerikkka Macht Frei&quot;''.

The letters ''KKK'' have been inserted into many other words, to indicate similar perceived racism, oppression or corruption. Examples include:

* ''Republikkkan'' ([[Republican Party (United States)|U.S. Republican Party]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|url=http://www.blackstripe.com/archives/views/abanks/shrub.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080325024722/http://www.blackstripe.com/archives/views/abanks/shrub.html|archivedate=March 25, 2008|title=The Blackstripe - Stolen 2000 Election|date=20060225154916}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Demokkkrat'' ([[United States Democratic Party]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iww.org/~iw/mar1997/stories/letter2.html]{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Kkkapitalism'' ([[capitalism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|url=http://home4.inet.tele.dk/lepan/lene/indiana/mscritical.htm|title=From Critical Reflections to Forward Progression|date=20051104162056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency signs replacing similar letters ==
The [[US dollar|dollar]] sign ($) can be inserted in the place of the letter &quot;S&quot;, the [[euro]] sign (€) in place of &quot;E&quot;, the [[yen]] (¥) sign in place of &quot;Y&quot;, the [[South Korean won|won]] (₩) sign in place of &quot;W&quot;, or the [[GBP|pound]] (£) sign in place of &quot;L&quot; to indicate [[plutocracy]], [[greed (emotion)|greed]], [[political corruption|corruption]], or the perceived immoral, unethical, or pathological accumulation of [[money]]. For example:

* Bu$h ([[George W. Bush]], [[George Herbert Walker Bush]], or any member of the [[Bush family]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledevoir.com/non-classe/41033/stoppez-bu-h |title=«Stoppez Bu$h |publisher=Le Devoir |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.democrats.com/view.cfm?id=8158 |title=Caught in the Crossfire: What Will Bu$h Do About Corporate Corruption? |publisher=Archive.democrats.com |date=June 28, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2003/11/281262.html |title=UK Indymedia - Stop Bu$h - National Demonstration - Thursday 20th |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date=November 20, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* E$$o / €$$o ([[Esso]] or [[Exxon Mobil]]): used by the UK-based [[Stop Esso campaign]] encouraging people to [[boycott]] Esso, in protest against Esso's opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]]
* &quot;[[Green Chri$tma$]]&quot;, a song by [[Stan Freberg]], satirizing over-commercialization of [[Christmas]]
* Micro$oft, M$, M$FT ([[Microsoft]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=micro%24oft |title=micro$oft |publisher=Urban Dictionary |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; used to emphasize the allegation that Microsoft has business practices that focus on making money rather than producing good products or looking after the end user's needs and interests. [[United States v. Microsoft|Microsoft was found to have violated]] United States [[Competition law|anti-trust]] law by taking unfair advantage of its [[monopoly]] position by giving [[Internet Explorer]] away for free to anyone who purchased a Windows or Macintosh computer and pre-installing it on Windows computers so that you can use the internet right out of the box. See also: [[Criticism of Microsoft]]. A relevant misspelling is had in [[Bill Gates|Microsoft's founder's name]], Bill Gate$, and another relevant misspelling in the [[Steve Ballmer|current CEO's name]], $teve Ba££mer.
* App£e, ([[Apple Inc.]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=11:20&amp;nbsp;pm |url=http://www.tribalwar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=430812 |title=App£e is the new Micro$oft by scy7he - TribalWar Forums |publisher=Tribalwar.com |date=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used in a similar way as Micro$oft, but with the Apple company. Relates to the allegation that the company charges high prices for their products. Also criticized for taking advantage of loyal customers and upgrading products annually for an expensive price. Similarly, $teve Job$ is used for [[Steve Jobs|the company's former chief executive]] just like &quot;Bill Gate$&quot; is used for Microsoft's former chief executive. See also [[Criticism of Apple Inc.]] for a full list.
* Co$, or $cientology ([[Church of Scientology]]): used by opponents to the Church of Scientology to imply that the religion is founded solely on financial rather than spiritual motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|url=http://www.xenu.org/cartoon/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310030404/http://www.xenu.org/cartoon/|archivedate=March 10, 2007|title=The $cientology Cartoon Page|date=20070302124138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Orac£e ([[Oracle Corporation]]): Used by critics of Oracle Corporation after they acquired [[Sun Microsystems]] and their habit of being a [[patent troll]] (used in a similar way as M$ and App£e). &quot;£arry €££i$on&quot; is also used to insult Oracle Corporation in a similar way as &quot;Bill Gate$&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showpost.php?p=4118295 |title=View Single Post - LXer: Ballmer: Android ain't free.

*[[Kesha|Ke$ha]]: Pop music artist.

A recent related usage is replacing &quot;E&quot; with the [[Euro]] sign (&quot;€&quot;) as in &quot;I€€€&quot; (used by critics of the copyright policy of the [[IEEE]]), &quot;€$$O&quot;, &quot;€urope&quot;, and &quot;€C&quot; (used by critics of the European Commission who accuse it of involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption (political)|corruption]]).

== &quot;@&quot; replacing &quot;A&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, or &quot;O&quot;&lt;span id=&quot;@replacing&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- linked from &quot;At sign&quot; --&gt;==
Since at least 1980, people have used the &quot;at sign&quot; (&quot;[[@]]&quot;) as a representation of the [[Anarchy a|circled letter A]]. This has been extended to substituting it for the letter &quot;A&quot; as in the [[crass]] [[fanzine]] &quot;Toxic Gr@fity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/1980.html SOUTHERN | crass records &gt; crass discography, 1980]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often used to combine feminine and masculine words in Spanish, such as Latin@ to mean Latino/Latina{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Hidden puns ==
Occasionally a word written in its orthodox spelling is altered with internal capital letters, hyphens, italics, or other devices so as to highlight a fortuitous pun. Some examples:

* After the controversial [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential elections]], the alleged improprieties of the election prompted the use of such titles as &quot;pResident&quot; and &quot;(p)resident&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060318112153/http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20010326&amp;s=contest |title=Name the President! |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=March 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.gainesvillehumanists.org/alerts.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=May 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[George W. Bush]]. The same effects were also used for [[Bill Clinton]] during and after Clinton's impeachment hearings. These devices were intended to suggest that the president was merely the ''resident'' of the [[White House]] rather than the legitimate ''president'' of the US.
* Similarly, the controversial [[United States]] law, the ''[[USA PATRIOT Act]]'', is sometimes called the &quot;patRiot Act&quot;, &quot;(pat)Riot Act&quot;, &quot;PAT Riot Act&quot;, &quot;PAT RIOT Act&quot;, or &quot;You Sap At Riot Act&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stallman.org/pat-riot-act.html |title=PAT RIOT Act - Richard Stallman |publisher=Stallman.org |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=115660&amp;cid=9794643 |title=Slashdot Comments &amp;#124; British Columbia Acts Against Patriot Act |publisher=Yro.slashdot.org |date=July 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by its opponents.
* The perception that membership in the United Nations is counter to US interests and sovereignty is denoted by the terms &quot;Un-ited Nations&quot; or &quot;EU-nited Nations&quot; (similarity to EU - European Union). Similarly, the perception that the United Nations is ineffectual (castrated) is denoted by the term &quot;EUN-ited Nations&quot; (similarity to [[eunuch]]).
* Feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]] has used a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] to make a point about [[patriarchy]]: &quot;gyn/ecology&quot;, &quot;stag/nation&quot;, &quot;the/rapist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/17feature.html Salon Ivory Tower | Battling stag/nation]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In French, where ''con'' is an insulting word meaning &quot;moron&quot;, the word ''conservateur'' (conservative) has been written &quot;con-servateur&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611134857/http://membres.lycos.fr/prince2/Elections/J30.HTM |title=Elections Québec '98 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;con… servateur&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chantiers.org/cri.htm |title=cri |publisher=Chantiers.org |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;con(servateur)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611123723/http://www.france-mail-forum.de/fmf31/pol/31ruscio.htm |title=France-Mail-Forum Nr. 31: Politique et histoire |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American English term ''neo-con'', an abbreviation of ''[[Neoconservatism|neo-conservative]]'', becomes a convenient pun when used in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=893321 |title=Les deux vies de « Wolfie », le « néo-con » au « coeur qui saigne |publisher=LeMonde.fr |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English, the first syllable of ''con''servative can be emphasized to suggest a [[con artist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AUTHOR: Jane Kleeb |url=http://www.boldnebraska.org/con-servative-bait-and-switch |title=&quot;Con&quot;servative Bait and Switch |publisher=Boldnebraska.org |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the same lines, intentional misspellings can be used to promote a specific negative attribute, real or perceived, of a product or service. This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities. Examples: 
* The term &quot;Windoze&quot;, which emerged on [[Usenet]] in the early 1990s and was subsequently added to the [[Jargon File]], is used in reference to [[Microsoft Windows]]. Doze is a paraphrase of DOS,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} the operating system that Windows used until Windows 95, which was considered negative compared to other &quot;real&quot; multitasking operating systems. &quot;Winblows&quot; and &quot;Winbloze&quot; are also similar to &quot;Windoze&quot; in reference to [[Microsoft Windows]] as well. A similar one for [[Linux]] is &quot;Linsux&quot;.
* Another way is to transpose letters (pronunciation is less important). For example, &quot;Untied.com&quot; has been set up for critics of [[United Airlines]].
* There are also various misspellings like this for specific Windows versions as well. For example, &quot;XPee&quot; for [[Windows XP]], &quot;Vi$ta&quot; or &quot;$hista&quot; for [[Windows Vista]], and &quot;$leven&quot; or &quot;$levin&quot; for [[Windows 7]] are all widely used on various [[Internet forum|Web forums]] and other sites (such as [[LinuxQuestions.org]]). Additionally, people having [[bloatware]] and [[Software incompatibility|incompatibility]] problems with Windows Vista refer to it as Windows [[wikt:hasta la vista|Hasta La Vista]], satirizing the problems it introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=computer_guy |url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=windows%20hasta%20la%20vista |title=windows hasta la vista |publisher=Urban Dictionary |date=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The British daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' is sometimes referred to by its anagram, &quot;The [[Grauniad]]&quot; (as originated with the satiric journal ''[[Private Eye]]''), satirizing the newspaper's poor proofreading and frequent typographical errors.
* The [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] is referred to as FIArrari, mostly when they favor [[Scuderia Ferrari]].
* It is quite common for users of rival [[social network]]s to refer to [[Facebook]] CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] as &quot;Suckerberg&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?ix=aca&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Suckerberg%22&lt;/ref&gt; to make fun of Facebook's strong network effect and vaguely Microsoft-like business practices.

Some [[toponyms|place names]] are also spelled differently in order to emphasize some political view. For instance, ''Brasil'' (the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] spelling of &quot;[[Brazil]]&quot;), is sometimes misconstrued as a typo for ''Brazil'' in English texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil Dictionary - Definition of brasil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the English spelling ''Brazil'' is used in Portuguese pieces of text as a way to denote [[Anti-Americanism]] or [[Anti-globalization|Anti-globalization sentiment]].

Journalists may make a politicized [[editing|editorial decision]] by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticities, dialect variants, or interjections.

Intentional misspellings, or spellings used to emphasize [[dialect]], are often used to suggest illiteracy or ignorance. Witness such permutations as &quot;pubblik skoolz&quot;, or &quot;public screwels&quot;, the latter initially associated with [[talk radio]]. A similar phenomenon would be T-shirts saying &quot;I is a kollege stoodent,&quot; &quot;Hookt on Foniks Wurks Fur Mee!&quot; or some such, suggesting that college students are ignorant.

Misspellings may also be used to indicate a speaker's accent, when the writer finds that accent worthy of ridicule. A well-known example is ''[[nucular]]'', perceived as a regional or uneducated pronunciation of ''nuclear''; ''Hahvahd'' is meant to reflect the [[Boston accent|local pronunciation]] of [[Harvard University]].
