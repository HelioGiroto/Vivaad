The college is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]]; however, the curriculum is secular and the student body is composed of people from many different religious backgrounds. Hendrix is a member of the [[Associated Colleges of the South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCMemberList|url=http://www.colleges.org/institutions.html|publisher=Associated Colleges of the South|accessdate=8/9/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its current president is Dr. James Timothy Cloyd. Hendrix College is listed in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.&lt;ref name=CollegesThatChangeLives /&gt; 

== College history ==
Hendrix College was founded as a primary school called Central Institute in 1876 at [[Altus, Arkansas]], by Rev. Isham L. Burrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James E.|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=13-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 it was renamed Central Collegiate Institute when secondary and collegiate departments were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James E.|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year the first graduating collegiate class, composed of three women, were awarded &quot;Mistress of English Literature&quot; degrees.&lt;ref name=CentennialHistory&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James E.|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, three conferences of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]] purchased the school.&lt;ref name=FaulknerFactsandFiddlings&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meriwether|first=Robert W.|title=Hendrix College and Its Relationship to Conway and Faulkner County, 1890-1934|journal=Faulkner Facts and Fiddlings|year=1984|volume=XXVI|issue=2|pages=1-45|url=http://www.faulknerhistory.com/articles/Hendrixcollege.htm|accessdate=8/8/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This began the school's relationship with the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]] and later [[The Methodist Church (USA)|The Methodist Church]], and [[United Methodist Church]]. The Central Collegiate Institute was renamed Hendrix College in 1889 in honor of Rev. [[Eugene Russell Hendrix]], a presiding bishop over three Arkansas Methodist conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same year, the primary school was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Hendrix College was initially designated a male college, but as early as 1889, the class catalog allowed for the enrollment of women who were interested in the college's course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meriwether|first=Robert W.|title=Hendrix College and Its Relationship to Conway and Faulkner County, 1890-1934|journal=Faulkner Facts and Fiddlings|year=1984|volume=XXVI|issue=2|pages=1-45|url=http://www.faulknerhistory.com/articles/Hendrixcollege.htm|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1890, after receiving bids from seven other Arkansas towns, Hendrix Board of Trustees chose Conway as the new location for the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 the secondary department was discontinued. A bid was accepted in 1929 to merge the college with Henderson-Brown College, a private college in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas]]. The merger briefly created Hendrix-Henderson College, until two years later when the Board of Trustees removed &quot;Henderson&quot; from the name. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=120-123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this merger, the Hendrix Bull Dogs became the Hendrix Warriors, and the college newspaper, formerly the ''Bull Dog,'' was renamed the ''College Profile.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meriwether|first=Robert W.|title=Hendrix College and Its Relationship to Conway and Faulkner County, 1890-1934|journal=Faulkner Facts and Fiddlings|year=1984|volume=XXVI|issue=2|pages=1-45|url=http://www.faulknerhistory.com/articles/Hendrixcollege.htm|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The newly formed college was planning to move the school to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but the city of Conway was able to raise $150,000 to keep the school located at Hendrix's campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meriwether|first=Robert W.|title=Hendrix College and Its Relationship to Conway and Faulkner County, 1890-1934|journal=Faulkner Facts and Fiddlings|year=1984|volume=XXVI|issue=2|pages=1-45|url=http://www.faulknerhistory.com/articles/Hendrixcollege.htm|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later the name of the college reverted back to Hendrix College after a short period of being named Trinity College, which was opposed by many students and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=James|title=Hendrix College A Centennial History|year=1984|publisher=Hendrix College Centennial Committee|location=Conway, AR|isbn=0914546546|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college merged with Galloway Woman’s College in [[Searcy, Arkansas]] in 1933, during the [[Great Depression]]. Hendrix College retained its location and facilities during this merger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hendrix.edu/abouthendrix/about.aspx?id=87&amp;ns1_mtid=87&amp;ns1_mtt=1&amp;ns1_mid=17 Hendrix College - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
