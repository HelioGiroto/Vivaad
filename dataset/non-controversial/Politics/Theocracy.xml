{{Forms of government}}'''Theocracy''' is a form of government in which God is the Civil Ruler and the official policy is governed by immediate [[religion|divine]] guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided, or is pursuant to the doctrine of a particular religion or religious group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary it is also gay/theocracy|title=Theocracy; Dictionary – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethosofliberty.com/deliquo.htm &quot;Theocracy - The rule of law is derived from religious doctrine and its decrees are absolute. This type of government is evidenced by a strict Islamic state (a rule of law under the religious code of the Islamic religion).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reasoned.org/glossary.htm &quot;theocracy - Rule by religion. A government that is based on theistic beliefs. Iran is a theocracy. As well was ancient India, in some forms of Hinduism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of the theocratic government, &quot;God himself is recognized as the head&quot; of the state,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] &quot;A form of civil government in which God himself is recognized as the head.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; hence the term ''[[:wikt:theocracy|theocracy]]'', from the Greek {{lang|grc|θεοκρατία}} &quot;rule of God&quot;, a term used by [[Josephus]] for the [[kingdoms of Israel and Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;English form the 17th century ([[OED]]).
The Greek term is explicitly coined by Josephus and isn't attested elsewhere in Ancient Greek; Josephus marks it as a [[nonce word|nonce]] coinage by calling it a &quot;strained expression&quot;.
W. Whiston tr. [[Josephus]], ''Against Apion'' ii. §17 (1814) IV. 340: &quot;He [Moses] ordained our government to be what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy&quot;, translating  {{lang|grc|ὡς δ'ἄν τίς εἴποι, βιασάμενος τὸν λόγον, θεοκρατίαν}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; A theocracy may have an administrative [[hierarchy]] of the government identical with the administrative hierarchy of the religion, or it may have two 'arms,' but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy.

Taken literally or strictly, ''theocracy'' means rule by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal &quot;rule of the heart&quot;, especially in its biblical application. The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ''ecclesiocracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth ''Biblical Theocracy: A vision of the biblical foundations for a Christian political philosophy''] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1993), introduced these more precise uses of the terms in arguing that theocracy (in this pure sense) is the only political system defended in the [[Bible]]. While Palmquist defends theocracy in this pure form as a viable (though &quot;non-political&quot;) political system, he warns that what normally goes by this name is actually ecclesiocracy, the most dangerous of all political systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a direct personal connection with God. For example, a [[prophet]] like [[Moses]] led the Israelites, and the prophet [[Muhammad]] ruled the early Muslims. Law proclaimed by the ruler is also considered a divine revelation, and hence the law of God. An '''ecclesiocracy''', on the other hand, is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation. For example, the [[prince-bishop]]s of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal ruler. The papacy in the Papal States occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the pope did not claim he is a prophet who receives revelation from God, but merely the (in rare cases infallible) interpreter of already-received revelation.
Religiously endorsed monarchies fall between these two poles, according to the relative strengths of the religious and political organs.

Theocracy should be distinguished from other, secular, forms of government that have a [[state religion]], or are merely influenced by theological or moral concepts, and [[monarchies]] held &quot;[[By the Grace of God]]&quot;. In the most common usage of the term, some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant [[religion]] (e.g., the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] emperor as patron of the head of the official Church); the government claims to rule on behalf of [[God]] or a higher power, as specified by the local religion, and divine approval of government institutions and laws. These characteristics apply also to a [[Caesaropapism|caesaropapist]] regime. The Byzantine Empire however was not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor, not vice versa; similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break away from Rome so the royal (and, especially later, parliamentary) power could assume full control of the now [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] hierarchy and confiscate most church property and income.

Secular governments can also coexist with a [[state religion]] or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in [[Israel]] marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example) exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions. India similarly delegates control of marriage and some other civil matters to the religious communities, in large part as a way of accommodating its Muslim minority.

==Etymology==
The word ''theocracy'' originates from the Greek {{lang|grc|θεοκρατία}}, meaning &quot;the rule of God&quot;. This in turn derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:θεός|θεός]] (''theos''), meaning &quot;god&quot;, and [[:wikt:κρατέω|κρατέω]] (''krateo''), meaning &quot;to rule.&quot; Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was &quot;rule by [[god]](s)&quot; or human incarnation(s) of god(s).

It was first coined by [[Josephus Flavius]] in the first century A.D. to describe the characteristic government for [[Jew]]s. Josephus argued that while the Greeks recognized three types of government: [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[anarchy]], the Jews were unique in that they had a system of government that did not fit into those categories. Josephus understood theocracy as a fourth form of government in which only God and his law is sovereign. Josephus' definition was widely accepted until the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, when the term started to collect more universalistic{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} and negative [[connotation]]s, especially in [[Hegel]]'s hands. The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning &quot;sacerdotal government under divine inspiration&quot; (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning &quot;priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power&quot; is recorded from 1825.

==Current theocracies==

===Christian theocracies===

====Holy See (Vatican City)====
{{Main|Politics of Vatican City}}
Following the unification of Italy, [[Vatican City]] became the last surviving territory of the former [[Papal States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wfbvat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vt.html |title=CIA World Factbook – Holy See |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1929, the State of Vatican City was formally recognized as an independent state through treaties with the Italian government.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfbvat&quot;/&gt;  The head of state of the Vatican is the [[pope]], elected by the [[College of Cardinals]], an assembly of Senatorial-princes of the Church, who are usually clerics, appointed as Ordinaries, but in the past have also included men who were not bishops nor clerics.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfbvat&quot;/&gt;  A pope is elected for life, and voting is limited to cardinals under 80 years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfbvat&quot;/&gt;  A Secretary for Relations with States, directly responsible for international relations, is appointed by the pope.  The Vatican legal system is rooted in [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] but ultimately is decided by the pope; the Bishop of Rome as the [[Supreme Pontiff]], ''&quot;has the fullness of legislative, executive and judicial powers.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]]'', Art. 1 §1&lt;/ref&gt; Although the laws of Vatican City come from the secular laws of Italy, under article 3 of the Law of the Sources of the Law, provision is made for the supplementary application of the “laws promulgated by the Kingdom of Italy.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/vatican.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the Vatican can also be considered an ecclesiocracy (ruled by the [[Catholic Church|Church]])

===Islamic states or Islamic theocracies===
{{main|Islamic state}}
{{main|Sharia}}
An [[Islamic state]] is a state that has adopted [[Islam]], specifically Sharia, as its foundations for political institutions, or laws, exclusively, and has implemented the Islamic ruling system ''khilafah'' (Arabic: خلافة), and is therefore a theocracy. Although there is much debate as to which states or groups operate strictly according to Islamic Law, Sharia is the official basis for state laws in the following countries: [[Religion_in_Yemen#Freedom_of_religion|Yemen]], [[Freedom of religion in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Islam in Somalia|Somalia]], [[Religion in Sudan|Sudan]], [[Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Mauritania]], [[Oman]] and [[Iran]]. In [[Nigeria]], the constitution provides that states may elect to use Shari'a laws and courts, though non-Muslims are not required in any state to submit to Shari'a jurisdiction and adherence varies by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71318.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2006: Nigeria |publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human rights and Labor |accessdate=28 August 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saudi Arabia]] maintains religious courts for all aspects of law and has [[religious police]] to maintain social compliance. Also [[Iran]] maintains religious courts for all aspects of law and has [[religious police]] to maintain social compliance,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} while its government is described by the [[United States|US]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] as a &quot;[[Islamic republic|theocratic republic]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfbiran&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=CIA World Factbook – Iran |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's head of state, or Supreme Leader, is appointed by an elected body called [[Assembly of Experts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wfbiran&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], [http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/government/constitution-8.html ''Articles 107-112''].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Guardians]], considered part of the executive branch of government, is responsible for determining if legislation is in line with Islamic law and customs (the [[Sharia]]), and can bar candidates from elections, and greenlight or ban investigations into the election process.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfbiran&quot;/&gt; [[Pakistan]] has Islam as its only official religion and its [[Federal Shariat Court]] has the duty of striking down any law not complying with the [[Sharia]] code of Islamic law; however, ruling falls upon legal scholars who, while required to be Muslim, are not religious clergy.

===Central Tibetan Administration===
The [[Central Tibetan Administration]], colloquially known as the Tibetan government in exile, is a [[Tibetan exile]] organisation with a state-like internal structure. According to its charter, the position of head of state of the Central Tibetan Administration belongs ''ex officio'' to the current [[Dalai Lama]], a religious hierarch. In this respect, it continues the traditions of the [[Ganden Podrang|former government of Tibet]], which was ruled by the Dalai Lamas and their ministers, with a specific role reserved for a class of [[monk official]]s.

On March 14, 2011, at the [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s suggestion, the parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration began considering a proposal to remove the Dalai Lama's role as head of state in favor of an elected leader.

===States with official state religion===

{{main|State religion}}
Having a state religion is not sufficient to be a theocracy. Many countries have a state religion without government directly deriving its powers from a divine authority, or direct government powers exercised by religious authority.

==Historic states with theocratic aspects==
{{See also|Imperial cult}}
The largest and best known theocracies in history were the [[Umayyad]] and early Abassid [[Caliphate]], and the [[Papal States]]. And as with any other state or empire, [[pragmatism]] was part of the politics of these ''[[de jure]]'' theocracies.

===Antiquity===
{{further|Imperial cult|State church of the Roman Empire|Israelites}}

The [[imperial cult]]s in [[Ancient Egypt]] and elsewhere deified the ruling monarch, so that the state religion was dedicated to the worship of the ruler as a deity, or the incarnation of a deity.

Early [[Israelites|Israel]] was ruled by Judges before instituting a monarchy. The Judges were believed to be representatives of YHWH or Jehovah God.

In ancient and medieval Christianity, [[Caesaropapism]] is the doctrine where a head of state is at the same time the head of the church.

===Christian===
[[Geneva]], during the period of [[John Calvin]]'s greatest influence and the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] of the &quot;[[Puritans]]&quot; had many characteristics of Protestant theocracies.

During the short reign (1494–1498) of [[Girolamo Savonarola]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest, the city of Florence could have been considered a theocracy. During his rule, un-Christian books, statues, poetry, and other items were burned (in the [[Bonfire of the Vanities]]), [[sodomy]] was made a capital offense, and other Christian practices became law.

Although having a lay ruler (the King of Jerusalem) the Crusader [[Outremer|Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (1099-1299) is considered to have some theocratic influences.

Also the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector is also considered to have a considerable amount of theocratic influence.

The [[Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace]], the rebel faction of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] in 1860s [[Qing China]] was a heterodox Christian Theocracy led by the self-proclaimed younger brother of [[Jesus Christ]], [[Hong Xiuquan]]. This theocratic state fought one of the most destructive wars in history, essentially being a haphazard proto - [[Communist]] military dictatorship, against the [[Qing Dynasty]] for fifteen years before being crushed following the fall of the capital [[Nanking]].

===Mormonism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
{{main|Theodemocracy|State of Deseret}}
Another ecclesiocracy was the administration of the short-lived [[State of Deseret]], an independent entity briefly organized in the American West by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Its original borders stretched from western [[Colorado]] to the [[southern California]] coast. When the Mormons arrived in the valley of the [[Great Salt Lake]] in 1847, the [[Great Basin]] was still a part of Mexico and had no secular government. As a result, [[Brigham Young]] administered the region both spiritually and temporally through the highly organized and centralized [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]]. This original organization was based upon a concept called [[theodemocracy]], a governmental system combining Biblical theocracy with mid-19th-century American political ideals, including heavy reliance upon the U.S. Constitution.

The [[treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo]] resulted in the [[Mexican Cession]] by which Deseret was incorporated into the United States. In 1849, the Saints organized a secular government in Utah, although many ecclesiatical leaders maintained their positions of secular power. The Mormons also petitioned Congress to have Deseret admitted into the Union as a state. However, under the [[Compromise of 1850]], [[Utah Territory]] was created and Brigham Young was appointed governor. In this situation, Young still stood as head of the LDS Church as well as Utah's secular government.

After the abortive [[Utah War]] of 1857–1858, the replacement of Young by an outside Federal Territorial Governor, the eventual resolution of controversies regarding [[plural marriage]], and accession by Utah to statehood, the apparent temporal aspects of LDS [[theodemocracy]] receded markedly. However, — like many Christians, Jews, and Muslims — Latter-day Saints regard some form of theocracy with God as the head (king) of a chiliastic world government to be the true political ideal.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} But, until the [[Second Coming of Christ]], the Mormons teach in their 12th Article of Faith: submission to the powers that be. But true to their beliefs in individual liberty and moral accountability, they exhibit a strong preference for democratic-republican, representative government as embodied in the [[Constitution of the United States]].

===Montenegro===
[[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro]] offers a singular example of monarchs willingly turning their power to ecclesiastic authority (Montenegrin Orthodox), as the last of the [[House of Crnojević]] (styled [[Grand Voivode]], not sovereign princes) did, in order to preserve national unity before the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] onslaught as a separate [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] under an autochthonous [[ethnarch]]. When Montenegro re-established secular dynastic succession by the proclamation of princedom in 1851, it did so in favor of the last [[Prince-bishop]], who changed his style from ''[[Vladika]] i upravitelj Crne Gore i Brde'' &quot;Vladika (Bishop) and Ruler of Montenegro and Brda&quot; to Po ''Bozjoj milosti [[knjaz]] i [[gospodar]] Crne Gore i Brde'' &quot;[[By the grace of God]] Prince and Sovereign of Montenegro and Brda&quot;, thus rendering his ''de facto'' dynasty (the Petrović-Njegoš family since 1696) a hereditary one.

===Islam===
Islam for centuries successfully implemented a theocracy. Starting from the time when the Prophet Muhammad established the Islamic State in Medina in the 7th century all the way to the early 20th century when the last Caliphate was dissolved in Turkey. After the time of the Prophet, Caliphs (from the Arabic word ''Khalifah'' which means successor of the Prophet), would rule according to the Law of Islam, which consists of the law found in the Quran and in the narrations from the Prophet. Although the Caliphs did not receive revelation directly from [[Allah]] as did the Prophet, they were required to base all of their decrees on some evidence found in the revealed text. This connection with the revealed text demonstrated that Allah was the ultimate authority.

===Buddhism===
Unified religious rule in Tibet began in 1642, when the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]] allied with the military power of the Mongol [[Gushri Khan]] to consolidate the political power and center control around his office as head of the Gelug school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

This form of government is known as the [[dual system of government]]. Prior to 1642, particular monasteries and monks had held considerable power throughout Tibet, but had not achieved anything approaching complete control, though power continued to be held in a diffuse, feudal system after the ascension of the Fifth Dalai Lama.  Power in Tibet was held by a number of traditional elites, including members of the nobility, the heads of the major Buddhist sects (including their various [[tulku]]s), and various large and influential monastic communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The [[Outer Mongolia (1911–1919)|Bogd Khaanate]] period of [[Mongolia]] (1911-1919) is also cited as a former Buddhist theocracy.

==Alleged theocracies==

===United States of America===

Critics have argued that the [[United States|US]] state of [[Utah]] is a theocracy. They point out that all of the state's representatives in Congress, all of its [[Supreme Court of Utah|Supreme Court]], 90% of its [[Utah Legislature|legislature]] and 80% of its state and federal judges belong to the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/04/06/320237/-Understanding-Mormon-Theocracy-and-Dominionism |title=Understanding Mormon Theocracy and Dominionism |first=Brahman |last=Colorado |publisher=''Daily Kos'' |date=April 6, 2007 |accessdate=28 August 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0104.mencimer.html |first=Stephanie |last=Mencimer |title=Theocracy in America |publisher=''Washington Monthly'' |date=April 2001 |accessdate=28 August 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/11/local/me-39715 |first=Paul |last=Foy |title='All-Mormon Supreme Court Spells Theocracy to Disgruntled Utahans' |publisher=''LA Times'' |date=June 11, 2000 |accessdate=28 August 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/976398 'The Mormons: The church of the West', ''The Economist'']&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2012, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] filed a lawsuit against government officials in [[Colorado City, Arizona]] and [[Hildale]], Utah, for alleged [[civil rights]] violations, including acting as de facto agents for the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] - a Mormon sect that split off in order to continue the practice of [[polygamy]] - denying ex-members and non-members of the Church access to everything from police services to housing and utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54351763-78/town-attorney-arizona-colorado.html.csp |first=Lindsay |last=Whitehurst |title=Polygamous towns face federal lawsuit for religious discrimination |publisher=''Salt Lake Tribune'' |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=28 August 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional theocracies==

Depictions of a fictional society dominated by a theocracy recur in [[science fiction]], [[speculative fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. Such depictions are mostly [[Utopian and dystopian fiction#Dystopian fiction|dystopian]], and in some cases humorous or satirical; positively presented theocracies are very much the exception.
