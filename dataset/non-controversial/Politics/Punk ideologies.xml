'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[rebellion]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[individualism]], [[Freethought|free thought]] and discontent. Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music, [[punk literature]], [[spoken word]] recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as [[protest]]s, [[boycott]]s, [[squatting]], vandalism, or property destruction. 

[[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[hippie]] counterculture. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. Punk visual art also often includes those types of messages. Many punks wear second hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology.

Because [[anti-establishment]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, magazines, posters and flyers.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], but some punk bands have promoted religions such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Taqwacore|Islam]], the [[Rastafari movement]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

==Specific ideologies and philosophies==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to [[libertarian socialism]] or [[anarchism]] as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed &quot;peace punks&quot; or &quot;[[anarcho-punk]]s.&quot; Whereas some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] sang about general [[anarchy]], they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, they are not considered part of anarcho-punk.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, ISBN 978-1-901447-70-5&lt;/ref&gt; Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Dick Lucas]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

===Apolitical===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song &quot;Violence Now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

===Christianity===
[[Christian punk]] is a small sub-genre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]], but others reject that association. Examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[The Crucified]], [[MxPx]] and [[Flatfoot 56]].

===Conservatism and right-libertarianism===
{{Further2|[[Conservative Punk]]}}
A small number of punks are [[Conservatism|conservative]] or [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]], 
rejecting anarchism, liberalism, communism and socialism in favor of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state| minimal government]] and individualist ownership of property.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Notable conservative punks include: [[Michale Graves]], [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Lee Ving]], [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Dave Smalley]] and [[Barry Donegan]].

===Krishna===
{{Further|Hardcore punk#1990s}}
In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (rock singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661 Punkbands: 108 review]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the hardcore scene that became known as Krishna-core.

===Neo-Nazism===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[far-right politics|far right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

===Nihilism===
Centering around a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some [[protopunk]] and early punk rock. Notable nihilist punks include: [[Iggy Pop]], [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Richard Hell]].

===Liberalism===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], [[Crashdog]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Justin Sane]], [[Tim Armstrong]] and [[Tim McIlrath]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

===Straight edge===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the American hardcore punk scene, involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it's a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. Notable straight edgers: [[Ian MacKaye]], [[Tim McIlrath]], [[Justin Sane]], and [[Davey Havok]].

===Socialism===
[[The Clash]] were the first blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene. Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]]. Many Oi! bands sang about [[unemployment]], economic inequality, working class power and police harassment. In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], [[Joe Strummer]], [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]].

The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was allegedly an early influence on the punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. ISBN 0-571-23228-0&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren’s partner and the band’s designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

===Islam===
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred around [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]]. [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

==Criticism of punk ideologies==
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs &quot;[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]&quot; and &quot;[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]&quot;. [[Crass]]'s song &quot;White Punks on Hope&quot; criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song &quot;Punk is Dead&quot; attacked corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs criticizing aspects of the punk subculture, and he once accused the punk magazine ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' of &quot;punk fundamentalism&quot; when they refused to advertise [[Alternative Tentacles]] records because they said the records &quot;weren't punk&quot;. 

The [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]' [[Michale Graves]], a [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become &quot;[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]&quot;. 

Author [[Jim Goad]] has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay &quot;The Underground is A Lie!&quot;, Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from [[middle class|middle]] to [[upper class]] backgrounds. In ''Farts from Underground'', Goad claimed that the [[DIY ethic]] never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argued that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.
