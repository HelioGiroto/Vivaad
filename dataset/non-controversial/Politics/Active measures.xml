'''Active Measures''' ({{lang-ru|Активные мероприятия}}) were a form of political warfare conducted by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[security]] services ([[Cheka]], [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]], [[NKVD]], [[KGB]]) to influence the course of world events, &quot;in addition to collecting intelligence and producing politically correct assessment of it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;&gt;Mitrokhin, Vasili, Christopher Andrew (2000). The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West. Gardners Books. ISBN 0-14-028487-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Active measures ranged &quot;from media manipulations to ''special actions'' involving various degrees of violence&quot;. They were used both abroad and domestically. They included [[disinformation]], [[propaganda]], [[counterfeit]]ing official documents, [[assassination]]s, and [[political repression]], such as penetration in churches, and persecution of political dissidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt;

Active measures included the establishment and support of international [[front organizations]] (e.g. the [[World Peace Council]]); foreign [[communist]], [[socialist]] and [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] parties; [[wars of national liberation]] in the [[Third World]]; and underground, revolutionary, [[insurgency]], [[Crime|criminal]], and [[terrorism|terrorist]] groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt; The intelligence agencies of [[Eastern Bloc]] states also contributed to the program, providing operatives and intelligence for assassinations and other types of covert operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt;

Retired KGB Maj. Gen. [[Oleg Kalugin]] described active measures as &quot;the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence&quot;: &quot;Not intelligence collection, but subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kalugin&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/21/interviews/kalugin/ Interview of Oleg Kalugin on CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Active measures was a system of special courses taught in the [[Yuri Andropov|Andropov]] Institute of [[KGB]] situated at [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] headquarters in Yasenevo, near Moscow. The head of &quot;active measures department&quot; was [[Yuri Modin]], former controller of the [[Cambridge Five]] spy ring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt;

==Active measures against the &quot;Main Adversary&quot;==
A few claims of active measures against the [[United States]] were described in the [[Mitrokhin Archive]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt;
*Promotion of false [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|John F. Kennedy assassination theories]], using writer [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]].
*Discrediting of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), using historian [[Philip Agee]] (codenamed PONT).
*Exposing [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] as a [[J._Edgar_Hoover#Personal_life|homosexual]].
*Attempts to discredit [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] by placing publications portraying him as an &quot;[[Uncle Tom]]&quot; who was secretly receiving government subsidies.
*Stirring up racial tensions in the United States by mailing bogus letters from the [[Ku Klux Klan]], placing an explosive package in &quot;the Negro section of New York&quot; (operation PANDORA), and spreading conspiracy theories that [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination]] had been planned by the US government.
*Starting rumors that fluoridated drinking water was in fact a plot by the US government to effect population control.
*Starting rumors that the moon landing was a hoax and the money ostensibly used by NASA was in actuality used by the CIA.
*Fabrication of the story that the [[HIV]] virus was [[Operation INFEKTION|manufactured by US scientists]] at [[Fort Detrick]]; the story was planted by Soviet KGB officers in the Pro-Soviet Indian newspaper &quot;The Patriot&quot; in 1983.  The claims were subsequently spread by the Soviet press in a process that was well documented by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Information Agency. The Soviet's AIDS fabrication was officially disavowed in the fall 1987.

==Supporting political movements==
[[GRU]] alone spent more than $1 billion for [[propaganda]] and [[peace movements]] against [[Vietnam War]], which was a &quot;hugely successful campaign and well worth the cost&quot;, according to the allegations of GRU defector [[Stanislav Lunev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunev&quot;&gt;[[Stanislav Lunev]]. Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev, Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. ISBN 0-89526-390-4&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that &quot;the GRU and the KGB helped to fund just about every [[antiwar movement]] and organization in America and abroad&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunev&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Oleg Kalugin]], &quot;the Soviet intelligence was really unparalleled. ... The KGB programs -- which would run all sorts of [[congress]]es, peace congresses, youth congresses, festivals, [[women's movement]]s, [[trade union]] movements, campaigns against U.S. missiles in Europe, campaigns against neutron weapons, allegations that [[AIDS]]... was invented by the CIA... all sorts of forgeries and faked material -- [were] targeted at politicians, the academic community, at the public at large.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kalugin&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Sergei Tretyakov (intelligence officer)|Sergei Tretyakov]], &quot;The KGB was responsible for creating the entire [[nuclear winter]] story to stop the [[Pershing II|Pershing missiles]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Comrade J&quot;&gt;Pete Earley, &quot;Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia's Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War&quot;, Penguin Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-399-15439-3, pages 167-177&lt;/ref&gt; Tretyakov says that from 1979 the KGB wanted to prevent the United States from deploying the missiles in Western Europe and that, directed by [[Yuri Andropov]], they used the [[Soviet Peace Committee]], a government organization, to organize and finance  demonstrations in Europe against US bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comrade J&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN Opposition to the Bomb&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/the.bomb/opposition/ Opposition to The Bomb: The fear, and occasional political intrigue, behind the ban-the-bomb movements]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscow and the Peace, Offensive&quot;&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/russiaandeurasia/bg184.cfm 1982 Article &quot;Moscow and the Peace, Offensive&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that misinformation based on a faked &quot;doomsday report&quot; by the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] about the effect of nuclear war on climate was distributed to peace groups, the environmental movement and the journal [http://ambio.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-moreinfo&amp;issn=0044-7447 ''Ambio''],&lt;ref name=&quot;Comrade J&quot;/&gt; which carried a key article on the topic in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Crutzen]] and John Birks, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/4312777?cookieSet=1 &quot;The atmosphere after a nuclear war: Twilight at noon&quot;], ''Ambio'', 11, 1982, pp.114-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installing and undermining governments==
After [[World War II]] Soviet security organizations played key role in installing puppet Communist governments in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], and later [[Afghanistan]]. Their strategy included mass [[political repression]]s and establishment of subordinate secret services in all occupied countries&lt;ref name=&quot;Ovseenko&quot;&gt;Antonov-Ovseenko, Anton, Beria, Moscow, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordievsky&quot;&gt;Gordievsky, Oleg; Andrew, Christopher (1990). KGB: The Inside Story. Hodder &amp; Stoughton. ISBN 0-340-48561-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the active measures were undertaken by the Soviet secret services against their own governments or Communist rulers. Russian historians [[Anton Antonov-Ovseenko]] and [[Edvard Radzinsky]] suggested that [[Joseph Stalin]] was killed by associates of [[NKVD]] chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], based on the interviews of a former Stalin's body guard and circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radzinsky&quot;&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]] Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives (1997) ISBN 0-385-47954-9&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Yevgeniya Alabts allegations, Chief of the [[KGB]] [[Vladimir Semichastny]] was among the plotters against [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albats&quot;/&gt; KGB chairman [[Yuri Andropov]] reportedly struggled for power with [[Leonid Brezhnev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Soloviev&quot;&gt;Vladimir Solovyov and Elena Klepikova (translated by Guy Daniels) ''Yuri Andropov, a secret passage into the Kremlin'' London: R. Hale, 1984. ISBN 0-7090-1630-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was organized by [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albats&quot;&gt;Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia--Past, Present, and Future. 1994. ISBN 0-374-52738-5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktor Pavlovich Barannikov|Gen. Viktor Barannikov]], then the former State Security head, became one of the leaders of uprising against [[Boris Yeltsin]] during [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albats&quot;/&gt;

Current Russian [[security]] organization [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] allegedly works to undermine governments of [[Baltic states]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Soldatov2&quot;&gt;[http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/22n/n22n-s15.shtml Special services of Russian Federation work in the former Soviet Union (Russian)] - by Andrei Soldatov and Irina Dorogan, [[Novaya Gazeta]], 27 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2011}} and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giorgadze&quot;&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=1&amp;id=703046 Moscow Accused of Backing Georgian Revolt] - by Olga Allenova and Vladimir Novikov, Kommersant, September 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy]] several Russian GRU officers were accused by Georgian authorities of preparations to commit sabotage and terrorist acts{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

==Puppet rebel forces==

===Trust operation===
In &quot;[[Trust Operation]]&quot; (1921&amp;ndash;1926), the [[State Political Directorate]] (OGPU) set up a fake anti-[[Bolshevik]] underground organization, &quot;Monarchist Union of Central Russia&quot;. The main success of this operation was luring [[Boris Savinkov]] and [[Sidney Reilly]] into the Soviet Union, where they were arrested and executed.

===Basmachi revolt===
During the [[Basmachi Revolt]] in [[Central Asia]], special military detachments were masqueraded as [[Basmachi]] forces and received support from British and Turkish intelligence services. Operations of these detachments facilitated collapse of Basmachi movement and led to assassination of [[Enver Pasha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodansk&quot;&gt;[[Yossef Bodansky]] ''The Secret History of the Iraq War'' (Notes: The historical record). Regan Books, 2005, ISBN 0-06-073680-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post World War II counter-insurgency operations===
Following [[World War II]], various partisan organisations in the Baltic States, Poland and Western Ukraine (including some previous collaborators of Germany) fought for independence of their countries against the Soviet forces. Many [[NKVD]] agents were sent to join and penetrate the independence movements. Many puppet rebel forces were created by the NKVD and permitted to attack local Soviet authorities to gain credibility and exfiltrate senior NKVD agents to the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodansk&quot;/&gt;

==Political assassinations==
The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] claimed to have a conversation he had with [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], who told him about &quot;ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill&quot;: [[Laszlo Rajk]] and [[Imre Nagy]] from Hungary; [[Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu]] and [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] from Romania; [[Rudolf Slánský]] and [[Jan Masaryk]] from [[Czechoslovakia]]; the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]; [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], President of [[Pakistan]]; [[Palmiro Togliatti]] from Italy; [[John F. Kennedy]]; and [[Mao Zedong]]. Pacepa provided some other claims, such as a plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of [[Lin Biao]] organized by the [[KGB]] and alleged that &quot;among the leaders of Moscow’s satellite intelligence services there was unanimous agreement that the KGB had been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacepa0&quot;&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ=  The Kremlin’s Killing Ways] - by Ion Mihai Pacepa, National Review Online, November 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The second President of [[Afghanistan]] [[Hafizullah Amin]] was killed by KGB [[Alpha Group]] in [[Operation Storm-333]]. Presidents of the unrecognized [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] organized by Chechen separatists including [[Dzhokhar Dudaev]], [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiev]], [[Aslan Maskhadov]], and [[Abdul-Khalim Saidullaev]] were killed by [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] and affiliated forces.

Other widely publicized cases are murders of Russian communist [[Leon Trotsky]] and Bulgarian writer [[Georgi Markov]].

There were also allegations that the KGB was behind the assassination attempt against the [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1981. The Italian [[Mitrokhin Commission]], headed by senator [[Paolo Guzzanti]] ([[Forza Italia]]), worked on the Mitrokhin Archives from 2003 to March 2006. In a draft report, senator Guzzanti revived the &quot;Bulgarian connection&quot; theory concerning [[Mehmet Ali Agca]]'s 1981 assassination attempt against the [[Pope John Paul II]]. Guzzanti declared that &quot;beyond any reasonable doubt &quot;the KGB was behind the assassination attempt against the Pope John Paul II in 1981&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot;&gt;[http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/03/02/D8G3J3J00.html Italian Panel: Soviets Behind Pope Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacepa0107&quot;&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTUzYmJhMGQ5Y2UxOWUzNDUyNWUwODJiOTEzYjY4NzI= &quot;Moscow’s Assault on the Vatican&quot;] - by Ion Mihai Pacepa, National Review Online, January 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The commission draft report has no bearing on any judicial investigations, which have long been closed. The Italian draft report said Soviet military intelligence - and not the KGB - was responsible. In Russia, Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Boris Labusov called the accusation &quot;absurd.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot;/&gt; The Italian Mitrokhin commission received criticism during and after its existence.&lt;ref name=Unit&gt;''[[L'Unità]]'', 1 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was closed in March 2006 without any proof brought to its various controversial allegations, including the claim that [[Romano Prodi]], former and current Prime minister of Italy and former [[President of the European Commission]] was the &quot;KGB's man in Europe.&quot; One of the informer of Guzzanti, [[Mario Scaramella]], has been arrested for defamation and arms trade end of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 December 2006 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/italy/story/0,,1962357,00.html Spy expert at centre of storm] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guerrilas==

===Promotion of guerrilla organizations worldwide===
Soviet secret services have been described as &quot;the primary instructors of guerrilas worldwide&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunev&quot;&gt;[[Stanislav Lunev]]. ''Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev'', Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. ISBN 0-89526-390-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Suvorov]] ''[http://lib.ru/WSUWOROW/intelligence_engl.txt Inside Soviet Military Intelligence]'', 1984, ISBN 0-02-615510-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Suvorov]] ''[http://lib.ru/WSUWOROW/specnaz_engl.txt Spetsnaz]'', 1987, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, ISBN 0-241-11961-8&lt;/ref&gt; According to  [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], KGB General Aleksandr Sakharovsky once said: &quot;In today’s world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacep2&quot;&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjUzMGU4NTMyOTdkOTdmNTA1MWJlYjYyZDliODZkOGM= Russian Footprints] - by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], National Review Online, August 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that &quot;Airplane hijacking is my own invention&quot;.
In 1969 alone 82 planes were hijacked worldwide by the KGB-financed  [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacep2&quot;/&gt; [[George Habash]], who worked under KGB guidance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt; explained:
:&quot;Killing one Jew far away from the field of battle is more effective than killing a hundred Jews on the field of battle, because it attracts more attention.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacep2&quot;/&gt;

Lt. General [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] described operation &quot;SIG&quot; (“[[Zionist]] Governments”) that was devised in 1972, to turn the whole Islamic world against [[Israel]] and the [[United States]]. KGB chairman [[Yury Andropov]] allegedly explained to Pacepa that
:&quot;a billion adversaries could inflict far greater damage on America than could a few millions. We needed to instill a [[Nazi]]-style hatred for the [[Jews]] throughout the [[Islamic world]], and to turn this weapon of the emotions into a terrorist bloodbath against [[Israel]] and its main supporter, the [[United States]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NjUzMGU4NTMyOTdkOTdmNTA1MWJlYjYyZDliODZkOGM= Russian Footprints. What does Moscow have to do with the recent war in Lebanon?] by [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following liberation organizations have been allegedly established by the KGB: [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], [[National Liberation Army (Bolivia)|National Liberation Army of Bolivia]] (created in 1964 with help from [[Ernesto Che Guevara]]); [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|the National Liberation Army of Colombia]] (created in 1965 with help from [[Cuba]]), [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] in 1969, and the [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia|Secret Army for Liberation of Armenia]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;pacepa4&quot;&gt;[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=12387 From Russia With Terror], [[FrontPageMagazine.com]], interview with [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], March 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
