'''Washington and Lee University''' (informally called '''Washington and Lee''' or '''W&amp;L''') is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts university]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], United States.

The classical school from which Washington and Lee descended was established in 1749 as '''Augusta Academy''',&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x22.xml |title=A History :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of its present location.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;/&gt; In 1776 it was renamed '''Liberty Hall''' in a burst of revolutionary fervor.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;/&gt; The academy moved to Lexington in 1780, when it was chartered as '''Liberty Hall Academy''', and built its first facility near town in 1782.

In 1796, [[George Washington]] endowed the academy with the largest gift ever given to an educational institution at that time: $20,000 in stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;/&gt; The gift rescued Liberty Hall from near-certain insolvency. In gratitude, the trustees changed the school's name to '''Washington Academy'''; in 1813 it was chartered as '''Washington College'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;/&gt; Dividends from Washington's gift continue to help pay part of the cost of each student's education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsoffice.wlu.edu/Facts.html |title=Facts about W&amp;L-Washington and Lee University |publisher=Newsoffice.wlu.edu |date=2000-07-01 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Lee]] was its president after the Civil War in 1865 until his death in 1870. The school was renamed Washington and Lee University and its motto, Nōn Incautus Futūrī', meaning &quot;''Not unmindful of the future'',&quot; is an adaptation of the Lee family motto.

The University consists of three academic units: The College; the Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics; and the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|School of Law]]

==History==
[[File:George Washington by Gilbert Stuart Yale University Art Gallery portrait.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[George Washington]], the university's first major benefactor]]
Liberty Hall Academy became a college when it granted its first bachelor of arts degree in 1785,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braintrack.com/college/u/washington-and-lee-university |title=Washington And Lee University |publisher=Braintrack.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the ninth oldest institution of higher education in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;/&gt; [[George Washington]] gave the school its first significant [[Financial endowment|endowment]] in 1796, $20,000, at the time the largest gift ever given to an educational institution in the United States, and Washington's gift continues to provide nearly $1.87 a year toward every student's tuition.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;/&gt; Trustees changed the name of the school to Washington Academy, and later Washington College, to honor him.&lt;ref name=&quot;wlu.edu&quot;/&gt; Among many alumni who have followed in Washington's footsteps by donating generously, [[Rupert Johnson, Jr.]], a 1962 graduate who is vice chairman of the $600-billion [[Franklin Templeton]] investment management firm, gave $100 million to Washington and Lee in June 2007, establishing a merit-based financial aid and curriculum enrichment program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wlu.edu/x26096.xml | title=W&amp;L Concludes Outstanding Fund-Raising Year | publisher=W&amp;L | date=August 12, 2008 | accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sacs.wlu.edu/documents/100MillionGiftAnnouncement.pdf | title=Washington and Lee University Receives $100 Million  Gift, One of the Largest Ever to a Liberal Arts College | publisher=W&amp;L | date=June 7, 2007 | accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberty Hall is said to have admitted its first [[African-American]] student when [[John Chavis]], a [[free black]], enrolled in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wlu.edu/x9651.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Chavis accomplished much in his life including fighting in the [[American Revolution]], studying at both Liberty Hall and the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]), becoming an ordained Presbyterian minister, and opening a school that instructed white and poor black students in [[North Carolina]]. He is believed to be the first black student to enroll in higher education in the United States, although he did not receive a degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbhe.com/timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt; Washington and Lee enrolled its next African-American student in 1966 in the law school.

The campus took its current architectural form in the 1820s when a local merchant, &quot;Jockey&quot; John Robinson, an uneducated Irish immigrant, donated funds to build a central building. For the dedication celebration in 1824, Robinson supplied a huge barrel of whiskey, which he intended for the dignitaries in attendance. But according to a contemporary history, the rabble broke through the barriers and created pandemonium, which ended only when college officials demolished the whiskey barrel with an ax. A justice of the Virginia State Supreme Court, [[Christian Compton]] ('50 undergraduate, '53 law), re-created the episode in 1976 for the dedication of the new law school by having several barrels of Scotch imported (without the unfortunate dénouement).

===The Lee years===
[[File:President's House Washington and Lee Lexington Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|250px|President's House, begun in 1868 as residence for General [[Robert E. Lee]]]]
After the [[American Civil War]], General [[Robert E. Lee]] turned down several financially tantalizing offers of employment that would merely have traded on his name,&lt;ref&gt;http://dsuka.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=29&lt;/ref&gt; and instead accepted the post of college president for three reasons. First, he had been superintendent of [[West Point]], so higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he believed that it was a position in which he could actually make a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of [[Martha Washington]]. Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so it is hardly surprising that he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.

Arguably Lee's finest achievement was transforming a small, not particularly distinguished Latin academy into a forward-looking institution of higher education (&quot;not unmindful of the future&quot;). He established the first journalism courses (which didn't last long, if offered at all),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlu.edu/x52085.xml Washington and Lee University] website.&lt;/ref&gt; and he added both a business school and a law school to the college curriculum, under the conviction that those occupations should be intimately and inextricably linked with the liberal arts. That was a radical idea: Journalism and law had always been considered technical crafts, not intellectual endeavors, and business was even worse. Yet Lee's concept has become universally accepted, and today it would seem subversive if anyone suggested that education in journalism, business, and law should be kept separate from the liberal arts and sciences.

Lee was also the father of an Honor System and a speaking tradition at Washington College that continue to the present time. And, ardent about restoring national unity, he successfully recruited students from the North as well as the [[Southern United States|South]].

Lee died on October 12, 1870, after just five years as Washington College president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Lee&amp;GSfn=Robert&amp;GSmn=Edward&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=615&amp; |title=Robert Edward Lee (1807 - 1870) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school's name was almost immediately changed to link his with Washington's. His son, [[George Washington Custis Lee]], followed as the school's next president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Washington_and_Lee_University |title=List of Presidents of Washington and Lee University - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Lee and much of his family - including his wife, his seven children, and his father, the Revolutionary War hero [[Henry Lee III|&quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee]] - are buried in the [[Lee Chapel]] on campus,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gsr&amp;GScid=641527&lt;/ref&gt; which faces the main row of antebellum college buildings. Robert E. Lee's beloved horse, [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]], is buried outside, near the wall of the Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GScid=641527&amp;GRid=3082&amp; |title=Traveller (1857 - 1870) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:Washington College Lexington Virginia 1845.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|''Washington College at Lexington'', 1845]]
The row of brick buildings that form the Colonnade, which traces to 1824, is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x8.xml |title=About W&amp;L :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, the [[Lee Chapel]] is also a National Historic Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/vamainstreet/was.HTM |title=Washington and Lee University: Virginia Main Street Communities: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British writer [[John Cowper Powys]] once called W&amp;L the &quot;most beautiful college campus in America.&quot; The poet and dramatist [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]] remarked, &quot;If this scene were set down in the middle of Europe, the whole continent would flock to see it!&quot;

In recent years the university has invested heavily in upgrading and expanding its academic, residential, athletic, research, arts and extracurricular facilities. The new facilities include an undergraduate library, gymnasium, art/music/theater complex, dorms, student center, student activities pavilion and tennis pavilion, as well as renovation of the journalism and commerce buildings and renovation of every fraternity house and construction of several sorority houses. Lewis Hall, the 30-year-old home of the law school, as well as athletic fields and the [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] Historic Front Campus buildings, are all currently undergoing major renovation.

In 1977, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published a cartoon showing a family in a car in front of the Washington and Lee campus. The caption was: &quot;The College of Your Choice&quot;.

==Organization and administration==
{{Main|List of Presidents of Washington and Lee University}}
The school is governed by a Board of Trustees that has a maximum of 34 members.  Trustees are elected to four-year terms, and are allowed to serve a second-four year term. Trustees shall be nominated by the Committee on Trusteeship and elected by the Board. The Rector is the presiding officer of the Board of Trustees and is a trustee elected by the board for a four-year term. The Board meets in February, May, and October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x2137.xml|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undergraduate calendar is an unusual three-term system with 12-week fall and winter terms followed by a four-week spring term. The spring-term courses include topical, often unique, seminars, faculty-supervised study abroad, and some domestic and international internships. The law calendar consists of the more traditional early-semester system.

===Demographics===
Washington and Lee was essentially all male until 1972, when women were admitted to the [[law school]]; the first female undergraduates enrolled in 1985.

As of 2006, the University's undergraduate population was equally divided between men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ie.wlu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ie.wlu.edu/ |title=Institutional Effectiveness :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=ie.wlu.edu |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the number of women receiving undergraduate degrees exceeded the number of men for the first time in the school's history. The law school population is more generally 40 percent women, 60 percent men.

In 1795, the first known [[Black]] person was admitted to the school, John Chavis, who became a teacher and [[Presbyterian]] minister. Walter Blake and Carl Linwood Smothers become the first African-American students to graduate from Washington and Lee University in 1972, the same year women were first admitted. The University has worked to increase the number of minority faculty and students. Minority students now comprise approximately 15 percent of the student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x48564.xml |title=University Chronology :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor system===
[[File:2008-0831-WashingtonandLeeUniversity.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Iconic buildings of Washington and Lee University. From left to right: Newcomb Hall, Payne Hall, Washington Hall (center), Robinson Hall, Tucker Hall.]]
Washington and Lee maintains a rigorous [[honor system]] that traces directly to Robert E. Lee, who said, &quot;We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman.&quot;&lt;ref name=honor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x36856.xml|title=Student Judicial Council|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students, upon entering the university, vow to act honorably in all academic and nonacademic endeavors. 

The Honor System is administered by students through the Executive Committee of the Student Body (and has been since 1905).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Any student found guilty of an Honor Violation by his or her peers is subject to a single sanction: expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x48252.xml|title=Enforcement Procedure|accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honor System is defined solely by students, and there is an appeal process. Appeals are heard by juries composed of students drawn randomly by the University Registrar. A formal assessment of the Honor System's &quot;White Book,&quot; occasionally including referenda, is held every three years to review the tenets of the Honor System. Overwhelmingly, students continue to support the Honor System and its single sanction, and they and alumni point to the Honor System as one of the distinctive marks they carry with them from their W&amp;L experience.&lt;ref name=honor2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x34.xml|title=The Honor System|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington and Lee's Honor System is distinct from others such as those found at the neighboring [[Virginia Military Institute]] and the [[University of Virginia]] because it is not codified. That is to say, unlike those others, Washington and Lee's does not have a list of rules that define punishable behavior—beyond the traditional guide of the offenses lying, cheating or stealing. Exams at W&amp;L are ordinarily unproctored and self-scheduled. It is not unusual for professors to assign take-home, closed-book finals with an explicit trust in their students not to cheat. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Robert E. Lee]], [[List_of_Presidents_of_Washington_and_Lee_University|President of Washington College]] from 1865-1870]]
The Honor System is strongly enforced. In most years, only a few students withdraw in the face of an honor charge or after investigations and closed hearings conducted by the Executive Committee of the Student Body, the University's elected student government (with the accused counseled by Honor Advocates, often law students). In recent years, four or five students have left each year.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Students found guilty in a closed hearing may appeal the verdict to an open hearing before the entire student body, although this option is rarely exercised. If found guilty at an open trial, the student is dismissed from the university permanently.&lt;ref name=honor2/&gt;

Separately from the student-run honor system, the Student-Faculty Hearing Board hears allegations of prohibited student discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and hazing by individuals and retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x36855.xml|title=Student-Faculty Hearing Board|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics and reputation==
[[File:WashingtonLeeUniversity.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia]]
Today the university has about 2,000 undergraduate students and 400 in the School of Law. Both the undergraduate and law schools are near the top of the ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' rankings for national liberal arts colleges and law schools, respectively. In the 2013 guide, the undergraduate college is ranked number 14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges/spp+25 | title=America's Best Colleges 2013: Liberal Arts Colleges: Top Schools |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= date=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst national liberal arts colleges and the law school is ranked number 24 nationally amongst all law schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings | title=America's Graduate Schools 2013: Best Law Schools |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= 2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 [[Forbes Magazine]] college rankings place W&amp;L 15th, twenty one places ahead of nearby academic rival [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/ | work=Forbes | title=America's Top Colleges | date=Retrieved 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The admissions rate for the class of 2016 was 18 percent. &quot;The average combined score on the math and verbal sections of the SAT is 1,415 (of a possible 1,600). The average score on the ACT is 31.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.blogs.wlu.edu/2012/03/30/wl-offers-admissions-to-18-of-strong-applicant-pool/ W&amp;L Offers Admissions to 18 Percent of Strong Applicant Pool], Washington &amp; Lee University. By Jeff Hanna. 30 March 2012. Retrieved 9 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington and Lee is divided into three schools: (1) The College, where all undergraduates begin their studies, encompassing the liberal arts, humanities and hard sciences, with notable interest among students in pre-health and pre-law studies; (2) the Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics, which offers majors in accounting, business administration, economics, politics, and public accounting; and (3) [[Washington and Lee School of Law|the School of Law]], which offers Juris Doctor and Master of Laws degrees.

More than 1,100 undergraduate courses are offered. There are no graduate or teaching assistants; every course is taught by a faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x1584.xml |title=Departments and Programs:: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university libraries contain has more than 700,000 volumes (and a vast electronic network). The law library has an additional 400,000 volumes as well as extensive electronic resources.

Washington and Lee offers 42 undergraduate majors (including interdisciplinary majors in [[neuroscience]], [[Medieval studies|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] studies, and [[Russian area studies]]), 20 minors, and additional interdisciplinary programs in [[African-American studies]], [[East Asian studies]], [[environmental studies]], [[Latin American studies|Latin American]] and [[Caribbean studies]], [[poverty]] and human capability studies ([http://shepherd.wlu.edu/ Shepherd Program]), and [[women's and gender studies]].

Though the university has refused since 2003 to submit data to ''Princeton Review'', the 2006 edition of ''The Best 357 Colleges'' ranked W&amp;L highly in its for &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience,&quot; &quot;Professors Get High Marks,&quot; and &quot;Professor Accessibility&quot;.  In the 2007 edition, Washington and Lee was ranked fourth in &quot;Professors Get High Marks&quot; and sixth in &quot;Professor Accessibility&quot;. Combining academics with an active social culture, Washington and Lee ranked 14th in &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience for Undergraduates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/generalinfo.asp?listing=1022835&amp;LTID=1 |title=Washington and Lee University |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The school offers undergraduate students research opportunities. The R.E. Lee Undergraduate Research Program funds summer research under the supervision of faculty members. The Student Summer Independent Research program supports seniors conducting independent research in the social sciences, humanities and the arts.  The Leyburn Scholars Program in Anthropology provides stipends supporting student research in anthropology during both the academic year and summer. The school also conducts a biannual undergraduate research conference called Science, Society, and the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x32490.xml|title=Student Research|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee Univ.|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
===Athletics===
The school's teams are known as &quot;The Generals&quot; and compete in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] in the [[Old Dominion Athletic Conference]] and the [[Centennial Conference]] for wrestling.

===Student activities===
Every four years, the school sponsors the [[Washington and Lee Mock Convention]] for whichever political party ([[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] or [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]) does not hold the Presidency. The Convention has received gavel-to-gavel coverage on C-SPAN and attention from many other national media outlets. The convention has correctly picked the out-of-power nominee for 18 of the past 23 national elections. It has been wrong twice since 1948,&lt;ref&gt;''US News and World Report'', &quot;Campus Pundits' Winning Record,&quot; January 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; including its incorrect choice of Hillary Clinton in 2008. In 1984, the failure of the scoreboard significantly slowed the vote tally process and almost led to a wrong selection.&lt;ref&gt;''W&amp;L Mock Convention 2008 Official Site''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Washington Post declared Washington and Lee's Mock Convention &quot;one of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious mock conventions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington and Lee University has several mysterious societies including the [[Cadaver Society]], the [[Sigma Society]], and the Mongolian Minks.

===Media and culture===
The eminent photographer [[Sally Mann]] got her start at Washington and Lee, photographing the construction of the law school while a university employee. The photos eventually became the basis of a one-woman exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C.

Secretariat, who holds the record for the fastest time in the Kentucky Derby and winner of the Triple Crown in 1973, wore blue and white (as vividly shown in the 2010 Disney movie) because his owner, Christopher Chenery, was a graduate and trustee of Washington and Lee.

A Washington and Lee art history professor, Pamela Hemenway Simpson, in 1999 wrote the only scholarly book on linoleum, giving it the title ''Cheap, Quick and Easy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1572330376 |title=Cheap, Quick and Easy |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book also examines other home-design materials once used by the lower classes to emulate their betters. More recently, she has become an expert, perhaps the leading academic expert, on [[butter sculpture]].

Washington and Lee is home to a collection of 18th- and 19th-century Chinese and European porcelain, the gift of Euchlin Dalcho Reeves, a 1927 graduate of the law school, and his wife, Louise Herreshoff. In 1967, Mr. Reeves contacted Washington and Lee about making &quot;a small gift,&quot; which turned out to be a collection of porcelain so vast that it filled two entire houses which he and his wife owned in Providence, Rhode Island. A number of dirt-covered picture frames, found in the two houses, were put on the van along with the porcelain. Soon it was discovered that the frames actually contained Impressionist-like paintings created by Louise as a young woman in the early days of the century. Mrs. Reeves had, it turned out, been a painter of stupendous talent, certified when in 1976 the Corcoran Gallery in Washington mounted a posthumous one-woman exhibition of her works. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0977722007 Their story] is helped by the fact that he (&quot;Boy&quot;) was almost 30 years younger than she (&quot;Dol&quot;).

The world's first recorded streaker &amp;mdash; [[George William Crump]] &amp;mdash; was a student at Washington College, in 1804. He later became a [[U.S. Congressman]].

===Music===
Before it morphed into a [[Swing music|swing]], [[Dixieland]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] standard, &quot;The [[Washington and Lee Swing]]&quot; was one of the most well known &amp;mdash; and widely borrowed &amp;mdash; football marches ever written, according to [[Robert Lissauer]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music in America.'' Schools and colleges from Tulane to Slippery Rock copied it (sometimes with attribution). It was written in 1910 by Mark W. Sheafe, '06, [[Tod Robbins|Clarence A. (Tod) Robbins]], '11, and Thornton W. Allen, '13. It has been recorded by virtually [http://wlubookstore.collegestoreonline.com/ePOS/form=robots/item.html&amp;item_number=M102&amp;store=425&amp;design=425# every important jazz and swing musician], including Glenn Miller (with Tex Beneke on vocals), Louis Armstrong, Kay Kyser, Hal Kemp and the Dukes of Dixieland. &quot;The Swing&quot; was a trademark of the New Orleans showman [[Pete Fountain]]. The trumpeter Red Nichols played it (and Danny Kaye pretended to play it) in the 1959 movie [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052809/ ''The Five Pennies.]'' (Here&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizpubs.com/swing.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; is an audio excerpt from a 1944 recording by Jan Garber, a prominent dance-band leader of the era.

The &quot;Swing&quot; was parodied in &quot;[http://www.bizpubs.com/dummy.mp3 The Dummy Song]&quot; by Ray Brown and Lew Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;who also wrote &quot;Birth of the Blues,&quot; &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird,&quot; &quot;Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries.&quot; &quot;You're the Cream in My Coffee&quot; and &quot;Keep Your Skirts Down, Mary Ann&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Dummy&quot; was recorded by NRBQ, [http://www.napster.com/search/results.html?type=Track&amp;query=dummy+song Louis Armstrong, Louis Prima] and Glenn Miller's vocal jazz group, the Modernaires, among many others, and was used in the movie ''You've Got Mail.''

==In literature==
A fictionalized representation of the University appears in [[L'Étudiant étranger]] by [[Philippe Labro]] (1986, Editions Gallimard), translated into English two years later and published as ''The Foreign Student'' (Ballantine Books)[http://www.amazon.com/The-Foreign-Student-Philippe-Labro/dp/0345346963/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331508841&amp;sr=8-2]. In 1994 it was made into a movie, starring Robin Givens and Marco Hofschneider, but it grossed only $113,000 at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109828/business&lt;/ref&gt;

Other novels about the university include ''Geese in the Forum'' (Knopf, 1940) by Lawrence Edward Watkin, a professor of English who went on to become a screenwriter for Disney (the college faculty were the titular geese); ''The Hero'' (Julian Messner, 1949), by Millard Lampell, filmed as ''[[Saturday's Hero]],'' starring Donna Reed and John Derek (Columbia Studios, 1951), about a football player who struggles to balance athletics, academics and a social life; and ''A Sound of Voices Dying'' by Glenn Scott (E.P. Dutton, 1954), released in a paperback edition in 1955 under the new title ''Farewell My Young Lover'' (replete with a lurid illustration on the cover).[http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Young-Lover-Sound-Voices/dp/B001VNWLE8]
