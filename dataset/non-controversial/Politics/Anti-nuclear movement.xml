{{Anti-nuclear movement}}

The '''anti-nuclear movement''' is a [[new social movements|social movement]] that opposes various [[nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]]. Many [[direct action]] groups, [[Environmentalism|environmental]] groups, and [[professional]] organisations&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Fox Butterfield. [http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/27/us/professional-groups-flocking-to-antinuclear-drive.html Professional Groups Flocking to Antinuclear Drive], ''The New York Times'', March 27, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty.virginia.edu&quot;&gt;William A.

Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|anti-nuclear groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], and the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]]. The initial objective of the movement was [[nuclear disarmament]], though the focus has shifted to include opposition to the use of [[nuclear power]].

There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. A protest against nuclear power occurred in July 1977 in [[Bilbao]], Spain, with up to 200,000 people in attendance. Following the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, an anti-nuclear protest  was held in New York City, involving 200,000 people. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] west of Hamburg; some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. The largest anti-nuclear protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in [[New York City]] against [[nuclear weapons]].  A 1983 nuclear weapons protest in [[West Berlin]] had about 600,000 participants. In May 1986, following the [[Chernobyl disaster]], an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program.

For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following [[public relations]] activities by the nuclear industry,&lt;ref name=&quot;Diane Farseta 38–56&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=The Campaign to Sell Nuclear |author=Diane Farseta  |date=September 1, 2008, vol. 64 no. 4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages=38–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nuclear Charm Offensive&quot;&gt;Jonathan Leake.

Scientists and diplomats have debated [[nuclear weapons]] policy since before the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=brow&gt;Jerry Brown and [[Rinaldo Brutoco]] (1997). ''Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear Movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age'', Twayne Publishers, pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt; The public became concerned about [[nuclear weapons testing]] from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. In 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name=dagmar2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dagmar-wilson-20110130,0,5499397.story |title=Dagmar Wilson dies at 94; organizer of women's disarmament protesters |author=Woo, Elaine |date=January 30, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24wilson.html |title=Dagmar Wilson, Anti-Nuclear Leader, Dies at 94 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=January 23, 2011  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, many countries ratified the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing.&lt;ref name=rudig2&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990).

Some local opposition to [[nuclear power]] emerged in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name=well&gt;Paula Garb. [http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm  Review of Critical Masses], ''Journal of Political Ecology'', Vol 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.&lt;ref name=rudig&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in [[Wyhl]], Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;pub&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;got&quot;/&gt; Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=jimfalk&gt;Jim Falk (1982).

===Anti-nuclear concerns===

====Concerns about nuclear weapons====
[[Image:fallout shelter.jpg|thumb|A sign pointing to an old fallout shelter in [[New York City]].]]
{{See also|Nuclear weapons debate|Uranium mining debate}}
There is the existential threat of [[nuclear war]] by accidental or deliberate nuclear strike,&lt;ref name=Fridab/&gt; and many local communities are affected by [[nuclear weapons testing]], [[uranium mining]], and radioactive waste disposal.&lt;ref name=Fridab&gt;Frida Berrigan. [http://www.fpif.org/articles/the_new_anti-nuclear_movement The New Anti-Nuclear Movement] ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', April 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridding the world of nuclear weapons has been a cause of the pacifist left for decades. But more recently mainstream politicians and retired military leaders have advocated disarmament. In January 2007 a seminal article appeared in the ''Wall Street Journal'', authored by [[Henry Kissinger]], [[William Perry|Bill Perry]], [[George Shultz]] and [[Sam Nunn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-new-abolitionists |title=The new abolitionists |author=Hugh Gusterson |date=30 March 2012  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt; These men were veterans of the [[cold-war]] who believed in using nuclear weapons for [[nuclear deterrence|deterrence]]. But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that instead of making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme concern:&lt;ref name=globalzero&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18836134 |title=Nuclear endgame: The growing appeal of zero |author= |date=June 16, 2011 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device. Only by a concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying trend be reversed.&lt;ref name=globalzero/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast political scientist [[Kenneth Waltz]] argues that Nuclear weapons explain the relative peace the world has experienced since [[World War II]], and the downturn in the historically high number of war deaths that were prevalent prior to their invention. He argues they prevented the [[Cold War]] turning hot, via [[deterrence theory]] and by being such destructive weapons have brought a relative peace and stability worldwide through the [[Stability–instability paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm Kenneth Waltz, “The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: More May be Better,”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Waltz]] in the July 2012 issue of [[Foreign Affairs]] has also stated that Most U.S., European, and Israeli commentators and policymakers warn that a nuclear-armed Iran would be the worst possible outcome of the current standoff. In fact, it would probably be the best possible result: the one most likely to restore stability to the Middle East, as Israel's monopoly on [[Nuclear Weapons]] begs to be balanced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137731/kenneth-n-waltz/why-iran-should-get-the-bomb Nuclear Balancing Would Mean Stability&lt;/ref&gt;

Some climate scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions from climatic effects alone. As there might also be much soot thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, causing food chain disruption in what is termed a [[Nuclear Winter]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Yam. Nuclear Exchange, ''Scientific American'', June 2010, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon. Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, ''Scientific American'', January 2010, p. 74-81.&lt;/ref&gt; However this hypothesis is highly controversial as nuclear winter results have been used as a politically motivated tool to promote particular stands on nuclear policy-making,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/pubs/88spp.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the underlying assumptions in the Nuclear Winter climatology papers to date are in disrepute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v475/n7354/full/475037b.html Nuclear winter was and is debatable - 2011 Seitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the era of [[nuclear weapons testing]] many local communities were affected, and some are still affected by [[uranium mining]], and radioactive waste disposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fridab&quot;/&gt;

The public &quot;perceives nuclear power as a very risky technology&quot; and, around the world, nuclear energy has declined in popularity since the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V. Ramana]]

''Nuclear Power is Not the Answer to Global Warming or Anything Else'', Melbourne University Press, ISBN 0-522-85251-3, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of nuclear power have raised a number of related concerns:&lt;ref name = bm&gt;[[Brian Martin (professor)|Brian Martin]]. [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/07sa.html Opposing nuclear power: past and present], ''Social Alternatives'', Vol. 26, No. 2, Second Quarter 2007, pp. 43-47.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nuclear accident]]s: a concern that the core of a nuclear power plant could overheat and melt down, releasing radioactivity.
*[[Radioactive waste disposal]]: a concern that nuclear power results in large amounts of radioactive waste, some of which remains dangerous for very long periods.
*[[Nuclear proliferation]]: a concern that the facilities and expertise to produce nuclear power can be readily adapted to produce [[nuclear weapons]].
*[[Economics of new nuclear power plants|High cost]]: a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive.
*[[Nuclear terrorism]]: a concern that nuclear facilities could be targeted by terrorists or criminals.
*Curtailed [[civil liberties]]: a concern that the risk of nuclear accidents, proliferation and terrorism may be used to justify restraints on citizen rights.

Of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive waste have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide.&lt;ref name = bm/&gt; Anti-nuclear campaigners point to the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima nuclear emergency]] as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/22/japan-nuclear-crisis-uk-power-stations |title=Japan nuclear crisis puts UK public off new power stations |author=Bibi van der Zee |date=22 March 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his book ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', [[Jim Falk]] explores connections between technological concerns and political concerns. Falk suggests that concerns of citizen groups or individuals who oppose nuclear power have often focused initially on the &quot;range of physical hazards which accompany the technology&quot;. Concern often starts with a single issue, such as [[radioactive waste]], but over time concerns usually spread and the focus broadens. Falk suggests that with a richer and more sophisticated understanding of issues comes more concerns and eventually, almost inevitably says Falk, this leads to a &quot;concern over the political relations of the nuclear industry&quot;.&lt;ref name=jimfalk2&gt;[[Jim Falk]] (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 327-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Vidal]] has said &quot;The point is that right across the world it is not just the nuclear technology which is so offensive to people, but the arrogance, callousness and ruthless steamrollering of any opposition that invariably accompanies nuclear projects. What the pro-nuclear folk here do not seem to understand is that the abuse of political power is as dangerous as the power source itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/feb/29/nuclear-power-energy-protest-hinkley?newsfeed=true |title=The abuse of political power is as dangerous as nuclear power itself |author=John Vidal |date=29 February 2012  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falk argues that if all the different concerns over the physical hazards of nuclear power were distilled into one succinct statement, it might be this: &quot;that it is a technology whose safety people deeply distrust&quot;.  Falk says that that distrust also applies more widely, to the whole nuclear enterprise:&lt;ref name=jimfalk2/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People must have come not only to distrust the safety of the technology but also the authority of those who have assured them so confidently that nuclear power is safe. In this sense people distrust the entire nuclear enterprise -- not only its technology, but the public and private organizations, the political parties, and those often prestigious scientists who advocate and assist in the development of nuclear power.&lt;ref name=jimfalk2/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, [[Baruch Fischhoff]], a social science professor said that many people really do not trust the nuclear industry. He stated that &quot;although it hasn’t done anything recently to lose the general public’s trust, it hasn’t done anything to gain people’s trust&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/energy-environment/22NUKE.html?pagewanted=all  Edging Back to Nuclear Power] ''New York Times'', April 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M.V. Ramana]] says that &quot;distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy is widespread&quot;, and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that &quot;only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry&quot;. This public distrust is periodically reinforced by nuclear safety violations, or through ineffectiveness or corruption of the nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=M. V. Ramana |date=July 2011 vol. 67 no. 4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |pages=47–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has &quot;tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power&quot;, including the publication of  numerous &quot;fact sheets&quot; that discuss issues of public concern. M.V. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V. Ramana]] |date=July 2011 vol. 67 no. 4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There is a split amongst many anti-Nuclear advocates, with some within the movement being completely against all Nuclear technology and others opposed only to Nuclear weapons. One organization within the movement which completely supports nuclear reactors but advocates for the elimination of Nuclear weapons is the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]. Amongst the pro-Nuclear reactor section of the movement, one factor influencing their support of reactors is due to the appeal that reactors have at reducing Nuclear weapons arsenals through the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]], a program which has thus far eliminated 425 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, the equivalent of 17,000 nuclear warheads, by converting it into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors, and is the single most successful non-proliferation program to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebulletin.org&quot;&gt;http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/support-of-the-megatons-to-megawatts-program  The Bulletin of atomic scientists support the megatons to megawatts program&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usec.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Usable nuclear energy in ICBM.png|thumb|right|250px|]]

Anti-Nuclear weapon advocates, such as the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] want to see the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] not only continue but be expanded,&lt;ref name=&quot;thebulletin.org&quot;/&gt; whereas others within the anti-Nuclear movement are more concerned with immediately shutting down all the Nuclear reactors in the world. The program appeals to anti-Nuclear weapon advocates as it provides a financial incentive for countries with vast quantities of Nuclear weapons, like Russia, to dismantle their arsenal and sell the fissile fuel contained within to operators of Nuclear reactors.

The [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] has been hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of Nuclear Weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebulletin.org&quot;/&gt; However without an increase in Nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and downblending has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament.
Currently, according to Harvard professor Matthew Bunn: The Russians are not remotely interested in extending the program beyond 2013. We've managed to set it up in a way that costs them more and profits them less than them just making new low-enriched uranium for reactors from scratch. But there are other ways to set it up that would be very profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in boosting their nuclear exports.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121125743&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear reactor proponents have also tried to regain public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. These designs include those that  incorporate passive safety and Small Modular Reactors.

A major nuclear fusion research and development program is underway called the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]]. It involves the European Union, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Russia, and the USA. According to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear [[fusion power]] “remains a distant dream”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/anti-nuclear/issues/nfc/power/new-reactor-types/ |title=New Reactor Types - pebble bed, thorium, plutonium, fusion |author=Jim Green |year=2012 |work=Friends of the Earth }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Nuclear Association]] says that fusion &quot;presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |title=Nuclear Fusion Power |author= World Nuclear Association |year=2005 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-nuclear groups advocate reduced reliance on Nuclear reactor-produced medical radioisotopes, used in essential diagnostic procedures and [[radiopharmaceutical]]s, through the use of alternative radioisotope production and alternative clinical technologies which have, as of yet, to be proven feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medical radioisotope supply options for Australia |author=Jim Green |date= |work= Friends of the Earth }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 [[Cyclotrons]] have been demonstrated to hold the promise of potentially displacing Nuclear reactors as the source of [[Technetium-99m]] but as of yet the technology is only in the demonstration phase and no Medical exams have been conducted with the Cyclotron produced isotope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/02/nuclear-reactors-not-needed-to-m.html?ref=hp |title=Nuclear Reactors Not Needed to Make the Most Common Medical Isotope |author= Robert F.

Although the anti-nuclear movement desire for an increase in high power Cyclotrons at hospitals that perhaps may someday be capable of completely replacing Nuclear reactor produced [[radiopharmaceutical]]s. Cyclotrons also pose a proliferation risk as they are also capable of being used to enrich uranium, and large cyclotrons known as [[Calutrons]] were used in the [[Manhattan Project]] to produce enriched Uranium and similarly were used in Saddam Hussein's Nuclear program.

In 1971, the town of [[Wyhl]], in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue.  In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;Stephen Mills and Roger Williams (1986).

===Deaths and injuries===
Casualties during anti-nuclear protests include:

*On 9 December 1982, [[Norman Mayer]], an American anti-nuclear weapons activist was shot and killed by the [[United States Park Police]] after threatening to blow up the [[Washington Monument]], [[Washington, D.C.]], unless a national dialogue on the threat of nuclear weapons was seriously undertaken.

*On 10 July 1985, the flagship of [[Greenpeace]], [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|Rainbow Warrior]], was sunk by French agents in New Zealand waters, and a Greenpeace photographer was killed.  The ship was involved in protests against [[nuclear weapons testing]] at [[Mururoa Atoll]]. The French Government initially denied any involvement with the sinking but eventually admitted its guilt in October 1985. Two French agents pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter and the French Government paid $7 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Newtan, Samuel Upton (2007).

===Recent developments===
For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following [[public relations]] activities by the nuclear industry,&lt;ref name=&quot;Diane Farseta 38–56&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nuclear Charm Offensive&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ucsusa.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek.com&quot;/&gt; [[nuclear reactor technology#Advanced reactors|advances in nuclear reactor designs]], and concerns about [[climate change]], nuclear power issues came back into [[energy policy]] discussions in some countries.

==Impact==

===Impact on popular culture===
{{See also|List of films about nuclear issues}}
Beginning in the 1960s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' and [[List of films about nuclear issues|feature films]] such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Rainbow Warrior (film)|The Rainbow Warrior]]'' (1992).

''Dr. Strangelove'' explored &quot;what might happen within the Pentagon ... if some maniac Air Force general should suddenly order a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union&quot;. One reviewer called the movie &quot;one of the cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been on the screen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bosley Crowther. [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173DE367BC4950DFB766838F679EDE Movie Review: Dr. Strangelove (1964)] ''The New York Times'', January 31, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The China Syndrome'' has been described as a &quot;gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power&quot; which had an extra impact when the real-life accident at the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear plant]] occurred several weeks after the film opened. [[Jane Fonda]] plays a TV reporter who witnesses a near-[[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] (the &quot;[[China Syndrome (nuclear meltdown)|China syndrome]]&quot; of the title) at a local nuclear plant, which was averted by a quick-thinking engineer, played by [[Jack Lemmon]]. The plot suggests that corporate greed and cost-cutting &quot;have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9338/The-China-Syndrome/overview The China Syndrome (1979)] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Silkwood'' was inspired by the true-life story of [[Karen Silkwood]], who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[plutonium]] plant where she worked.&lt;ref name=contr/&gt;

[[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) was a musical group founded in 1979 by [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], following the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]].  The group organized a series of five ''No Nukes'' concerts held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City in September 1979.  On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large anti-nuclear rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the [[Battery Park City]] [[landfill]] in New York.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Herman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nearly 200,000 Rally to Protest Nuclear Energy |url= |work=[[New York Times]] |page=B1 |date=September 24, 1979 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', and a film, also titled ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]'', were both released in 1980 to document the performances.

In 2007, Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash, and Jackson Browne, as part of the [[No Nukes group]], recorded a [[music video]] of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song &quot;[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nukefree.org/node/96 “For What It’s Worth,” No Nukes Reunite After Thirty Years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirs.org/home.htm Musicians Act to Stop New Atomic Reactors]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Lawrence S. Wittner]] has argued that anti-nuclear sentiment and activism led directly to government policy shifts about nuclear weapons. Public opinion influenced policymakers by limiting their options and also by forcing them to follow certain policies over others. Wittner credits public pressure and anti-nuclear activism with &quot;Truman’s decision to explore the [[Baruch Plan]], Eisenhower’s efforts towards a nuclear test ban and the 1958 testing moratorium, and Kennedy’s signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

The proliferation of nuclear weapons became a presidential priority issue for the [[Carter Administration]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name = gamson/&gt; To deal with proliferation problems, President Carter promoted stronger international control over nuclear technology, including nuclear reactor technology. Although a strong supporter of nuclear power generally, Carter turned against the breeder reactor because the [[plutonium]] it produced could be diverted into nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name = gamson&gt;William A.

For many years after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries. In recent years, intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear power issues back to the forefront of policy discussion in the [[nuclear renaissance]] countries.&lt;ref name = markd/&gt;&lt;ref name=res/&gt; But some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy.&lt;ref name=res&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS101123+06-May-2009+BW20090506 Research and Markets: International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power] ''Reuters'', May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumping of foreign radioactive waste and development of nuclear weapons in the country is outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/peace/nukefree.html New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite common misconception, this act does not make nuclear power plants illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf97.html|title=Nuclear Energy Prospects in New Zealand|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=2009-04|accessdate=2009-12-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100103024718/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf97.html| archivedate= 3 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey shows that 19% of New Zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy source, while 77% prefer [[wind power]] as the best energy source.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVNZ_1690587&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/413551/1690587 |title=Nuclear power backed by 19% |date=7 April 2008 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland has no plans to change its non-nuclear stance and pursue nuclear power in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0023/sec0018.html Electricity Regulation Act, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Navajo Nation]] forbids uranium mining and processing in its land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wise-uranium.org/uregusa.html#NAVCOUTLAWSU Navajo Nation outlaws uranium mining]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a 2007 [[University of Maryland]] survey showed that 73 percent of the public surveyed favours the elimination of all nuclear weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 59 percent support reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to 400 weapons each. Given the unpopularity of nuclear weapons, U.S. politicians have been wary of supporting new nuclear programs. Republican-dominated congresses &quot;have defeated the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s plan to build so-called 'bunker-busters' and 'mini-nukes'.&quot;&lt;ref name=lawsw/&gt;

As of 2011, Australia has no nuclear power stations and the current [[Gillard Government|Gillard Labor government]] is opposed to [[Nuclear power in Australia|nuclear power for Australia]]. Australia also has no nuclear weapons.

Thirty-one countries operate nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mycle Schneider]], [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]], Antony Froggatt, Doug Koplow (August 2009).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, some 26,000 nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the nine nuclear powers, with thousands on hair-trigger alert. Although U.S., Russian, and British nuclear arsenals are shrinking in size, those in the four Asian nuclear nations—China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea—are growing, in large part because of tensions among them. This Asian arms race also has possibilities of bringing Japan into the nuclear club.&lt;ref name=lsw/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During [[Barack Obama]]'s successful U.S. presidential election campaign, he advocated the abolition of nuclear weapons.  Since his election he has reiterated this goal in several major policy addresses.&lt;ref name=lsw/&gt; In 2010, the Obama administration [[New START|negotiated a new weapons accord with Russia]] for a reduction of the maximum number of deployed nuclear weapons on each side from 2,200 to between 1,500 and 1,675—a reduction of some 30 percent. In addition, President Obama has committed $15 billion over the next five years to improving the safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bernstein.

Following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], the Italian government put a one-year moratorium on plans to revive nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9M504RG0.htm |title=Italy puts 1 year moratorium on nuclear |date=March 23, 2011  |work=Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11&amp;mdash;12 June 2011, Italian voters passed a referendum to cancel plans for new reactors.  Over 94% of the electorate voted in favor of the construction ban, with 55% of the eligible voters participating, making the vote binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://referendum.interno.it/referendum/refe110612/RFT0003.htm | title= Italy Nuclear Referendum Results  | date= June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s coalition announced on May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and anti-nuclear protests within Germany. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530 |title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest |author=Annika Breidthardt |date=May 30, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion surveys on nuclear issues===
{{Main|Public opinion on nuclear issues}}
In 2005, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the ''Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues'' report.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt;  Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist acts involving radioactive materials]] at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt; Stressing the [[climate change]] benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name= IAE&gt;[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (2005). [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries] pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.&lt;ref name=rb2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black  |date=25 November 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-nuclear organizations==
{{See also|List of anti-nuclear groups|List of anti-nuclear power groups|List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States}}
[[Image:Nirs logo.gif|thumb|Logo of the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]]]]

The anti-nuclear movement is a [[new social movements|social movement]] which operates at the local, national, and international level. Various types of groups have identified themselves with the movement:&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty.virginia.edu&quot;/&gt;

* [[direct action]] groups, such as the [[Clamshell Alliance]] and [[Shad Alliance]];
* [[Environmentalism|environmental]] groups, such as [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Greenpeace]];
* [[consumer protection]] groups, such as [[Ralph Nader]]'s [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Critical Mass|Critical Mass]];
* [[professional]] organisations,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; such as [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] and [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]; and
* [[political party|political parties]] such as [[European Free Alliance]].

Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public [[protest]]s and acts of [[civil disobedience]] which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. Other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government authorities, influencing [[public policy]] through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections. Anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licencing proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt. [http://www.marcuse.org/harold/hmimages/seabrook/861KitscheltAntiNuclear4Democracies.pdf Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies] ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-nuclear power organisations have emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme. Protest movements against nuclear power first emerged in the USA, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. Fuelled by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years &quot;made nuclear energy untenable in many countries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on [[nuclear power]] and energy issues.&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that &quot;his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald. [http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/nuclear-agency-s-chief-praises-watchdog-groups.html?pagewanted=1 Nuclear Agency's Chief Praises Watchdog Groups], ''The New York Times'', June 23, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some environmentalists criticise the anti-nuclear movement for under-stating the environmental costs of fossil fuels and non-nuclear alternatives, and overstating the environmental costs of nuclear energy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.ecolo.org/media/articles/articles.in.english/love-indep-24-05-04.htm James Lovelock: Nuclear power is the only green solution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401209.html Going Nuclear]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the numerous nuclear experts who have offered their expertise in addressing controversies, [[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]], Professor Emeritus of Physics at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], is likely the most frequently cited.  In his extensive writings he examines the safety issues in detail.  He is best known for comparing nuclear safety to the relative safety of a wide range of other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/ Bernard Cohen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/BOOK.html The Nuclear Energy Option]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-nuclear activists are accused of representing the risks of nuclear power in an unfair way. ''The War Against the Atom'' (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could be held responsible for about 100 deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel MacCracken, ''The War Against the Atom'', 1982, Basic Books, pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuclear Energy Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nei.org/ Nuclear Energy Institute] website&lt;/ref&gt; (NEI) is the main lobby group for companies doing nuclear work in the USA, while most countries that employ nuclear energy have a national industry group. The [[World Nuclear Association]] is the only global trade body.  In seeking to counteract the arguments of nuclear opponents, it points to independent studies that quantify the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and compares them to the costs and benefits of alternatives.  NEI sponsors studies of its own, but it also references studies performed for the [[World Health Organisation]],&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health: Budapest, Hungary, 23–25 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[International Energy Agency]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://ww.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ElecCostSUM.pdf Executive Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; and by university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Rabl and Mona. Dreicer, Health and Environmental Impacts of Energy Systems.  ''International Journal of Global Energy Issues'', vol.18(2/3/4), 113-150 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the anti-nuclear movement point to independent studies that show that the capital resources required for renewable energy sources are higher than those required for nuclear power.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Some people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, criticise the movement on the basis of the claim that nuclear energy is necessary for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These individuals include [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; originator of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; a co-founder of [[Greenpeace]] and former director of Greenpeace International, [[George Monbiot]] and [[Stewart Brand]], creator of the [[Whole Earth Catalog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/article/16398/ Environmental Heresies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/science/earth/27tier.html?ex=1330405200&amp;en=e561a6494b06049d&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg An Early Environmentalist, Embracing New ‘Heresies’]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/ James Lovelock]&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2008 interview, Moore said that &quot;It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-nuclear organisations have acknowledged that their positions are subject to review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-22-nuclear-power_N.htm Some rethinking nuke opposition] USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear-energy opponents take the position that militant environmentalist organisations have not changed their views:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While some environmentalists, in the interests of reducing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions associated with burning carbon-based fuels, have switched from anti- to pro-nuclear power in recent years, it is clear that many — if not most — of the militant environmentalist organizations remain adamantly opposed to the expansion of nuclear power. Many even propose decommissioning and dismantling the existing nuclear power electrical plants.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Jasper.  [http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/world-mainmenu-26/europe-mainmenu-35/2569-ngo-demonstrators-no-to-coal-no-to-oil-no-to-nuclear NGO Demonstrators: No to Coal, No to Oil, No to Nuclear] ''New American'', 16 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In April 2007, Dan Becker, Director of Global Warming for the Sierra Club, declared, &quot;Switching from dirty coal plants to dangerous nuclear power is like giving up smoking cigarettes and taking up crack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstrib.com/featured-series/energy-series/Articles/A_7-20-2007_1_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  James Lovelock, who originally proposed the Gaia hypothesis, criticizes holders of such a view: &quot;Opposition to nuclear energy is based on irrational fear fed by Hollywood-style fiction, the Green lobbies and the media.&quot;  &quot;. . .I am a Green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecolo.org/media/articles/articles.in.english/love-indep-24-05-04.htm The Independent, 24 May 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The German decision to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima accident is also regarded as irrational fear driving energy policy. The switch to other forms of energy is expected to cost around $340 billion over 10 years in required investments alone (which represents over 3% of German GDP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.technologyreview.com/featured-story/428145/the-great-german-energy-experiment/&lt;/ref&gt; The German shift is already increasing carbon emissions and electricity prices in Germany, and might endanger the shift away from coal power in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globe-net.com/articles/2011/june/3/german-nuclear-phase-out-ignites-push-for-coal,-gas/?sub=&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the expected increased demand for natural gas that Germany will require to run it's economy is causing Russia to extend the lives of its RBMK (Chernobyl-type) reactors in order to be able to sell more of its gas to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904563904576584831235317422.html  The Wall Street Journal Russia to Extend Life of Aging Reactors

George Monbiot, an English writer known for his environmental and political activism, once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;George Monbiot [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2000/mar/30/energy.nuclearindustry?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 &quot;The nuclear winter draws near&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 30 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011.
