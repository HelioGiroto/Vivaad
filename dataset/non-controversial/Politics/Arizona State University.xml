==History==
{{Main|History of Arizona State University}}

===1885–1929===
[[File:Pres. Theodore Roosevelt at Old Main of Arizona State University.jpg|thumb|250px|left|President Theodore Roosevelt addresses a crowd of students on the steps of the Old Main at Arizona State University. March 20, 1911.]]
Originally named the ''Tempe Normal School'', the institution was founded on March 12, 1885, after John Samuel Armstrong first introduced House Bill 164, &quot;An Act to Establish a [[Normal school]] in the [[Territory of Arizona]] to the [[13th Arizona Territorial Legislature|13th Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Arizona Territory]]. Instruction was instituted on February 8, 1886 under the supervision of Principal Hiram Bradford Farmer. Land for the school was donated by [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] residents George and Martha Wilson, allowing 33 students to meet in a single room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/about/history/more.html More ASU History]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the school's name was changed from Tempe Normal School to the ''Normal School of Arizona''. Before becoming a college, the [[Normal School]] enrolled high school students with no other secondary education facilities. Under the 30 year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still currently in use. Matthews envisioned an &quot;evergreen campus,&quot; with many shrubbery brought to the campus. He also implemented the planting of [[Palm Walk]], now one of the feature landmarks of the Tempe campus. His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having the honor of being declared a nationally recognized arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/fm/arboretum.htm The Arboretum at Arizona State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm Archives &amp; Special Collections, Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Although enrollment increased by almost 100% during his tenure due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm Eighth President Ralph Waldo Swetman 1930–1933]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930–1989===
[[Image:FLW Gammage Auditorium ASU PHX AZ 20186.JPG|thumb|250px|right|ASU's [[Gammage Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]
In 1933, [[Grady Gammage]], then president of Arizona State Teachers College at [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], became president of ''Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe'', a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years. Like his predecessor, Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus. Dr. Gammage oversaw the development of the university, graduate programs, and the renaming of the ''Arizona State College'' to Arizona State University in 1958.

By the 1960s, with the presidency of Dr. [[G. Homer Durham]], Arizona State University began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and other doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn, 1969–71, John W. Schwada, 1971–81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981–89—and Interim President Richard Peck, 1989, led the university to increased academic stature, creation of the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West Campus]], and rising enrollment.

===1990–present===
Under the leadership of Dr. Lattie F. Coor, from 1990 to June 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] and extended education sites. His commitment to diversity, quality in [[undergraduate education]], research, and economic development underscored the university's significant gains in each of these areas over his 12-year tenure. Part of Dr. Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fund-raising campaign: Through private donations, more than $500 million was invested in targeted areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of the [[Barrett, The Honors College|Barrett Honors College]], the [[Herberger College of the Arts|Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts]], and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|250px|right|ASU's [[Biodesign Institute]] in Tempe campus]]
On July 1, 2002, [[Michael M. Crow|Michael Crow]] became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, President Crow outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a &quot;[http://newamericanuniversity.asu.edu/ New American University]&quot;—one that would be open and inclusive. Further, Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into &quot;One University in Many Places&quot; by merging ASU's several campuses into a single institution, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU embarked on an aggressive years-long research facility capital building effort, resulting in the establishment of the [[Biodesign Institute]] and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of three [[Nobel Laureates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20091012_ostrom_nobel Nobel Prize Winners] ASU News&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ASU's [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix]] campus was vastly expanded with several of the University's colleges and schools relocated to the downtown campus.

The [[Late-2000s recession|economic downturn]] that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/01/16/20090116capitol-budget0116.html Budget Cuts Proposal] Arizona Republic&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these cuts, ASU underwent several rounds of reorganizations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20090121_reorg Academic Reorganization]&lt;/ref&gt; combining academic departments, consolidating colleges and schools, and reducing university staff and administrators. But, with an economic recovery underway in 2011, ASU continued its campaign by expanding the West and Polytechnic Campuses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2011/06/19/20110619asu-academic-villages.html ASU Building Academic Villages]&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing a set of low-cost, teaching-focused extension campuses in [[Lake Havasu City]] and [[Payson, Arizona]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://havasu.asu.edu Colleges @ ASU – Lake Havasu]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011, ASU launched a collaboration with the [[Mayo Clinic]] to create a medical school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2011/09/27/20110927mayo-clinic-plans-medical-school-scottsdale.html Mayo Clinic Medical School] The Arizona Republic&lt;/ref&gt;. As part of the collaboration with Mayo, ASU moved some academic departments onto the Mayo Clinic campus in Scottsdale, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mayo.asu.edu/ ASU-Mayo Clinic Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;. Mayo Medical and ASU have instituted a &quot;Premedical Scholar Program&quot; to further ASC Clinical partnering program mission.   ASU has created a network with its clinical partners —area hospitals and healthcare organizations—to provide inspiration, test innovations and real-world training for its students, and to bring research back to the community in which it exists [http://clinicalpartnerships.asu.edu/home].

{{Main|Arizona Board of Regents}}

The Arizona Board of Regents governs Arizona State University as well as the other state's public universities; [[University of Arizona]] and [[Northern Arizona University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azregents.edu/universities/arizonastateuniversity/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;The Board of Regents is composed of twelve members including eleven voting, and one non-voting. Members of the boards are the Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction that act as an ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regent members with eight years term that are appointed by the Governor, and two Student Regents with two years term, being a non-voting apprentice term on its first year. [[Arizona Board of Regents|ABOR]] provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has multiple campus locations, covering the Phoenix metropolitan areas including the Main Tempe campus in Tempe, the West campus and Downtown Phoenix campus both in Phoenix, and the Polytechnic campus in Mesa. It also offers courses and degrees through ASU online to forward the mission of the university. 

The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered as the chief executive officer and the chief budget officer of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd102.html&lt;/ref&gt;The president is responsible for the execution of measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the property of the university, and acts as the official representative of the university to the Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azregents.edu/policymanual/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asu.edu/admin/&lt;/ref&gt; The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels. The 16th and current ASU president is Michael M. Crow, and has served since July 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://president.asu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; 

ASU is organized into 16 schools and colleges that are spread out across the four campuses. It offers 153 bachelor's degree programs, 147 master's degree program, 83 doctoral programs and one law degree program. 

==Campuses and locations==
ASU's academic programs are spread across four campuses in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]]; however, unlike most multi-campus institutions, ASU describes itself as &quot;one university in many places,&quot; meaning that it is not a [[university system]] with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.asu.edu One University in Many Places] Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;xvjbbz&quot;&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/provost/about/oneuniversity.html One University in Many Places] Explanation of the ASU campus organization&lt;/ref&gt; Inter-campus shuttles and [[light rail]] allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU includes a fifth &quot;virtual campus&quot; for [[online education|online]] and extended education.

===Tempe campus===
[[File:Asu campus 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Overlooking the Tempe campus from atop [[Hayden Butte]]]]
{{Main|Arizona State University at the Tempe campus}}
ASU's Tempe campus is located in downtown [[Tempe, Arizona]], about eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) east of downtown Phoenix. The campus is considered urban, and is approximately {{convert|642|acre|km2|1}} in size. The campus is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/asuwebrw/entrance/tempe/ ASU's Tempe campus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azarboretum.org/ Arizona Arboretums And Botanical Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tempe campus is also the largest of ASU's campuses, with 59,794{{Cref|a}} students enrolled in at least one class on campus.&lt;ref name=enroll11&gt;[http://uoia.asu.edu/sites/default/files/quickfacts/Quick_Facts_Fall_2011.pdf]. 2011 Quick Facts. Retrieved Jan 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tempe campus is ASU's original campus, and [[Old Main (Arizona State University)|Old Main]], the first building constructed, still stands today. There are many notable landmarks on campus, including [[Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Palm Walk, which is lined by 111 palm trees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vpsa.asu.edu/UGA/360/campus.asp?campusid=1 Arizona State University: Virtual Tour]&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Trumbull Hayden Library, the University Club Building, and University Bridge. In addition, the campus has an extensive public art collection, considered one of the ten best among university public art collections in America according to ''Public Art Review''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring/Summer 2006|title=Big Ten|journal=Public Art Review|volume=17|issue=2|pages=24–5|issn=1040-211X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the northwest edge of campus is the Mill Avenue district (part of [[Tempe, Arizona|downtown Tempe]]) which has a college atmosphere that attracts many students to its restaurants and bars. The Tempe campus is also home to all of the university's athletic facilities.

===West campus===
[[File:Asu fletcher lib.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Fletcher Library, West campus]]
{{Main|Arizona State University at the West campus}}
The West campus was established in 1984 by the Arizona Legislature and sits on {{convert|250|acre|km2}} in a suburban area of northwest Phoenix. The West campus lies about {{convert|12|mi|km}} northwest of downtown Phoenix, and about {{convert|18|mi|km}} northwest of the Tempe campus. The West campus is designated as a [[Phoenix Points of Pride|Phoenix Point of Pride]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Point of Pride&quot;&gt;[http://phoenix.gov/NEWSREL/ARCHIVE/2008/MARCH/2803newpride.html 2008 Phoenix Points of Pride]&lt;/ref&gt; and is nearly completely powered by a 4.6[[megawatt|MW]] [[solar array]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asu.edu/fm/documents/oua/campus_solarization_status_update.pdf Campus Solarization Update] Campus Solarization Project January, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This campus is home to the [[New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences]], the [[Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College]], and selected programs of the [[W.P. Carey School of Business]].
The campus, patterned after the University of Oxford’s architecture, is currently building a new residence hall, dining facility and recreation center to open in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://asunews.asu.edu/20120126_westrecreation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polytechnic campus===
[[File:ASU Poly - West - 2009-02-25.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Picacho Hall (left) and Peralta Hall (right) at the Polytechnic campus]]
{{Main|Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus}}
Founded in 1996 as &quot;ASU East,&quot; the ASU Polytechnic campus serves 10,521 students and is home to more than 40 bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in professional and technical programs through the College of Technology and Innovation, and selected programs of the [[W.P. Carey School of Business]]/Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management, [[Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College]], the School of Letters and Sciences, and College of Nursing and Health Innovation.

The Polytechnic campus sits on the former [[Williams Air Force Base]].

===Downtown Phoenix campus===
[[Image:ASUDowntown1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Downtown Phoenix campus]]
{{Main|Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus}}
