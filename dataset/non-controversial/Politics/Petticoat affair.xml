The '''Petticoat affair''' (also known as the '''Eaton affair''' or the '''Eaton malaria''') was an 1830&amp;ndash;1831 [[List of state and local political scandals in the United States|U.S. scandal]] involving members of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Jackson]]'s [[Presidential cabinet|Cabinet]] and their wives.  Although it started over a private matter, it affected the political careers of several men and resulted in the informal &quot;[[Kitchen Cabinet]]&quot;. The 1936 film ''[[The Gorgeous Hussy]]'' is based on the affair.

==Background==
[[Margaret O'Neill Eaton|Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; O'Neale]] (or O'Neill) was the daughter of William O'Neale, who owned a [[Washington, D.C.]] boarding-house called the Franklin House, a social center for many politicians.  Margaret was well-educated; she studied [[French (language)|French]], among other subjects, and was known for her ability to play the piano.&lt;ref name=historynet&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/andrew-jackson-the-petticoat-affair-scandal-in-jackons-white-house.htm/4 &quot;Andrew Jackson: The Petticoat Affair, Scandal in Jackson's White House&quot;], History Net, accessed August 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was also renowned for having a &quot;vivacious&quot; temperament. In 1816, Margaret married her first husband [[John B. Timberlake]], a [[purser]] in the [[United States Navy]].  She was 17, and he was 39.  Timberlake had been heavily in debt for years.  They had three children together, with one dying in infancy.

The Timberlake couple had been friends with Senator [[John Henry Eaton]] since 1818, when Eaton was a 28-year-old widower and newly-elected U.S. Senator.  After Timberlake told Eaton about their financial problems, Eaton unsuccessfully attempted to get the Senate to pass a petition to pay Timberlake's debts accrued while in the Navy.  While away on a four-year sea voyage on the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']], Timberlake died of pulmonary disease in 1828, although there were allegations he committed suicide.&lt;ref name=historynet/&gt;

==Scandal==
With the encouragement of President Andrew Jackson, who liked them both, Peggy Timberlake and Eaton married shortly after her husband's death, although according to the social morals of the day, it would have been more proper for them to wait for a longer [[mourning|mourning period]].  Their actions scandalized respectable people of the capital, especially many women.  [[Second Lady of the United States|Second Lady]] [[Floride Calhoun]], the wife of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]], led a phalanx of other Cabinet wives in an &quot;anti-Peggy&quot; coalition. [[Martin Van Buren]], a widower and the only unmarried member of the Cabinet, allied himself with the Eatons.

Jackson was sympathetic to the Eatons, in part, perhaps, because his own beloved late wife, [[Rachel Donelson Robards]], had been the subject of innuendo, as it was revealed that her first marriage had not yet been legally ended at the time of her wedding to Jackson. Jackson believed such rumors were the cause of Rachel's heart attack and death on December 22, 1828, several weeks after his election.  Even Rachel's niece [[Emily Donelson]], whom Jackson called on as his surrogate &quot;[[First Lady]]&quot;, sided with the Calhoun faction.

Jackson appointed Eaton as his Secretary of War, hoping to limit the rumors, but the scandal intensified. Jackson felt political opponents, especially those around Calhoun, were feeding the controversy.&lt;ref name=historynet/&gt;  The controversy finally resulted in the resignation of almost all members of the Cabinet over a period of weeks in the spring of 1831. Postmaster General [[William T. Barry]] would be the lone member to stay.

==Aftermath==
Jackson elevated Van Buren as his favorite and replaced Calhoun as vice presidential running mate in his re-election campaign. Van Buren thus became the ''de facto'' heir to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  In regard to these events, Van Buren remarked:
{{Cquote2| I [would] rather have live vermin on my back than the tongue of one of these Washington women on my reputation.| Martin Van Buren &lt;ref&gt;Widmer, Edward L. 2005. ''Martin Van Buren'': The American Presidents Series, The 8th President, 1837-1841 Time Books. ISBN 978-0-7862-7612-7 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Emily Donelson had supported Floride Calhoun, Jackson kept his niece as his official hostess.

John Calhoun and his wife returned to South Carolina.  In 1832, he won a seat in the [[U.S. Senate]].  He advocated states' rights, slavery, and economic issues affecting the South, eventually including secession from the Union.
