The '''water fluoridation controversy''' arises from moral, ethical&lt;ref name=Cross2003/&gt;, political, and safety concerns regarding the [[water fluoridation|fluoridation]] of public [[Water supply|water supplies]]. The controversy occurs mainly in English-speaking countries, as [[Continental Europe]] does not practice water fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Martin1989/&gt;  Those opposed argue that water fluoridation may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and has a dosage that cannot be precisely controlled.&lt;ref&gt;American Public Health Association Community Water Fluoridation in the United States 10-28-’08 http://www.apha.org/advocacy/policy/policysearch/default.htm?id=1373&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recommendations for using Fluoride to Prevent and Control Dental Caries in the United States, Centers for Disease Control 8-17-’01 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Autio-Gold, Jaana; Courts, Frank, Assessing the effect of fluoride varnish on early enamel carious lesions in the primary dentition, J.

At the dosage recommended for water fluoridation, the only known adverse effect is [[dental fluorosis]], which can alter the appearance of children's teeth during [[tooth development]]. Dental fluorosis is considered cosmetic and unlikely to represent any other effect on public health.&lt;ref name=NHMRC/&gt;  Despite opponents' concerns, water fluoridation has been effective at reducing cavities in both children and adults.&lt;ref name=Parnell&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Parnell C, Whelton H, O'Mullane D |title=Water fluoridation |journal=Eur Arch Paediatr Dent |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=141–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19772843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to fluoridation has existed since its initiation in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=Martin1989&gt;[[Brian Martin (professor)|Martin B.]] (1989) [http://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/pubs/89sq.html The sociology of the fluoridation controversy: a reexamination]. ''Sociological Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, some  opponents of water fluoridation suggested that fluoridation was a communist plot to undermine public health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston | first = Robert D | title = The Politics of Healing | publisher = Routledge | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-93339-0| page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
Many who oppose water fluoridation consider it to be a form of compulsory mass medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenparty.org.uk&quot;&gt;UK Green Party. (2003). [http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/reports/2003/F%20illegality.htm Water fluoridation contravenes UK law, EU directives and the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine]. Press office briefing. accessdate 2008-08-03&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that consent by all water consumers cannot be achieved, nor can water suppliers accurately control the exact levels of fluoride that individuals receive, nor monitor their response.

In the United Kingdom the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] refers to fluoride as a poison, claims that water fluoridation violates Article 35 of the [[European Charter of Fundamental Rights]], is banned by the UK poisons act of 1972, violates Articles 3 and 8 of the [[Human Rights Act]] and raises issues under the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greenparty.org.uk&quot;/&gt;

Water fluoridation has also been criticized by Cross and Carton for violating the [[Nuremberg Code]] and the Council of Europe's Biomedical Convention of 1999.&lt;ref name=Cross2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cross DW, Carton RJ |title=Fluoridation: a violation of medical ethics and human rights |journal=Int J Occup Environ Health |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=24–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12749628 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dentistry professor David Locker and philosopher Howard Cohen argued that the moral status for advocating water fluoridation is &quot;at best indeterminate&quot; and could even be considered immoral because it infringes upon autonomy based on uncertain evidence, with possible negative effects.&lt;ref name=LockerCohen2001&gt;Cohen H, Locker D. (2002). [http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-67/issue-10/578.html The Science and Ethics of Water Fluoridation]. J Can Dent Assoc 2001; 67(10):578-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

A research article suggested applying the [[precautionary principle]] to this controversy, which calls for [[public policy]] to reflect a conservative approach to minimize risk in the setting where harm is possible (but not necessarily confirmed) and where the science is not settled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tickner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tickner J, Coffin M |title=What does the precautionary principle mean for evidence-based dentistry? |journal=J Evid Based Dent Pract |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=6–15 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=17138389 |doi=10.1016/j.jebdp.2005.12.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the dosage recommended for water fluoridation, the only clear adverse effect is [[dental fluorosis]], which can alter the appearance of children's teeth during [[tooth development]].

The WHO set a general guideline of 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/L concentration of fluoride in drinking water to avoid adverse effects of higher concentrations including severe dental fluorosis and [[skeletal fluorosis]], as these effects were minimal at this concentration or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Human health effects |title=Fluoride in Drinking-water |author=Fawell J, Bailey K, Chilton J, Dahi E, Fewtrell L, Magara Y |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=92-4-156319-2 |year=2006 |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=28 February 2009 |pages=29–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a 12-person [[U.S. National Research Council]] (NRC) committee reviewed the health risks associated with fluoride in the water&lt;ref name=NRC2006&gt;{{cite book |title= Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA's Standards |author= National Research Council |location= Washington, DC |publisher= National Academies Press |isbn=0-309-10128-X |year=2006 |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11571#toc |laysummary=http://dels.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/fluoride_brief_final.pdf |laysource=NRC |laydate=24 September 2008}}.

Although it did not comment on water fluoridation's safety, three of the panel members, namely Robert Isaacson,  Kathleen Thiessen and Hardy Limeback,  expressed {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} their opposition to water fluoridation after the study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Budnick N |year=2006 |url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/print_story.php?story_id=34527 |title=Fluoride foes get validation |work=[[Portland Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LimebackStandardTimes&gt;{{cite news |author=Limeback H |date=14 May 2006 |url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/05-06/05-14-06/02opinion.htm |title=GUEST VIEW: The evidence that fluoride is harmful is overwhelming |work=The Standard Times |location=South Coast, MA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the chair, John Doull, suggested that the issue should be reexamined.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fagin D |title=Second thoughts about fluoride |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=298 |issue=1 |pages=74–81 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18225698 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0108-74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because water fluoridation provided is not individually controlled, opponents express concern for vulnerable populations such as children, nutritionally deficient individuals, and [[renal]]ly impaired individuals. The National Research Council states that children have a higher daily average intake than adults per kg of bodyweight.&lt;ref name=NRC2006/&gt;{{rp|23}} Those who perspire heavily or have kidney problems consume more water and thus also have a greater intake.

{{Bad summary|section|Water fluoridation#Effectiveness}}
The available evidence shows that water fluoridation is effective in reducing cavities (see [[water fluoridation#Effectiveness|effectiveness section of the main article]]). The most comprehensive [[systematic review]] found that fluoridation was [[Association (statistics)|statistically associated]] with a decreased proportion of children with cavities (the [[median]] of mean decreases was 14.6%, the [[Range (statistics)|range]] −5 to 64%), and with a decrease in decayed, [[Tooth loss|missing]], and [[Dental restoration|filled]] [[primary teeth]] (the median of mean decreases was 2.25&amp;nbsp;teeth, the range 0.5 to 4.4&amp;nbsp;teeth),&lt;ref name=YorkReview2000/&gt; which is roughly equivalent to preventing 40% of cavities.&lt;ref name=Yeung-adults&gt;{{cite journal |author= Yeung CA |title=Fluoride prevents caries among adults of all ages |journal=[[Evid Based Dent]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=72–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17891121 |doi=10.1038/sj.ebd.6400506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: many studies did not attempt to reduce [[observer bias]], control for [[confounding factor]]s, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis.&lt;ref name=YorkReview2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=McDonagh MS, Whiting PF, Wilson PM, Sutton AJ, Chestnutt I, Cooper J, Misso K, Bradley M, Treasure E, Kleijnen J |title=Systematic review of water fluoridation |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7265 |pages=855–9 |date=7 October 2000 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7265.855 |pmid=11021861 |pmc=27492 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/321/7265/855.pdf |format=PDF}} Full report: {{cite book |author=McDonagh MS, Whiting PF, Bradley M, Cooper J, Sutton AJ, Chestnutt I, Misso K, Paul Wilson P, Treasure E, Kleijnen J |title=A Systematic Review of Public Water Fluoridation |publisher=NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination |date=September 2000 |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/CRD_Reports/crdreport18.pdf |isbn=1-900640-16-3 }} Authors' commentary: {{cite journal |author=Treasure ET, Chestnutt IG, Whiting P, McDonagh M, Wilson P, Kleijnen J |title=The York review—a systematic review of public water fluoridation: a commentary |journal=[[Br Dent J]] |volume=192 |issue=9 |pages=495–7 |year=2002 |pmid=12047121 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4801410a |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v192/n9/full/4801410a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is largely due to the topical effect of fluoride ions in the mouth rather than the systemic effect of ingestion.&lt;ref name=Pizzo&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pizzo G, Piscopo MR, Pizzo I, Giuliana G |title=Community water fluoridation and caries prevention: a critical review |journal=[[Clin Oral Investig]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |year=2007 |pmid=17333303 |doi=10.1007/s00784-007-0111-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluoridation opponents have challenged the efficacy of fluoridation,although their arguments have been accused of bias.&lt;ref name=Spencer1998&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spencer AJ |year=1998 |title=New, or biased, evidence on water fluoridation? |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=149–154 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-842X.1998.tb01161.x |pmid=9599869}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large study of water fluoridation's efficacy was conducted by the National Institute of Dental Research in 1988, which officially found &quot;20 percent fewer decayed tooth surfaces&quot; corresponding to &quot;less than one cavity per child&quot;. Arguing that the study had errors, the data was reanalyzed by fluoridation opponent John A. Yiamouyiannis, whose results indicated no statistically significant difference in [[tooth decay]] rates among children in fluoridated and nonfluoridated communities. Conversely, fluoridation proponents argued that Yiamouyiannis' work had errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horowitz HS |title=Why I continue to support community water fluoridation |journal=[[J Public Health Dent]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=67–71 |year=2000 |pmid=10929563 |doi= 10.1111/j.1752-7325.2000.tb03297.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 fluoridation opponent [[Mark Diesendorf]] pointed out the substantial declines in tooth decay in nonfluoridated European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diesendorf M |title=The mystery of declining tooth decay |journal=Nature |volume=322 |issue=6075 |pages=125–9 |year=1986 |pmid=3523258 |doi=10.1038/322125a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This failed to account for the fluoride added to table salt in continental Europe. Although fluoridation may still be a relevant public health measure among the poor and disadvantaged, it may be unnecessary for preventing tooth decay, particularly in industrialized countries where tooth decay is rare.&lt;ref name=Pizzo/&gt;

== Statements against ==
In 1992, speaking on the Canadian television program ''[[Marketplace (TV series)|Marketplace]]'', former [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] scientist [[Robert Carton]] claimed that &quot;fluoridation is the greatest case of scientific fraud of this century.&quot; The practice was described as the &quot;longest running public health controversy in North America&quot; in the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Looking back at 40 years of fluoride |work=Marketplace |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company |date=24 November 1992 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/health/public-health/the-fluoride-debate/looking-back-at-40-years-of-fluoride.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a presentation to the [[California Assembly]] Committee of Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials, [[Richard Foulkes]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [water fluoridation] studies that were presented to me were selected and showed only positive results. Studies that were in existence at that time that did not fit the concept that they were &quot;selling,&quot; were either omitted or declared to be &quot;bad science.&quot; The endorsements had been won by coercion and the self-interest of professional elites. Some of the basic &quot;facts&quot; presented to me were, I found out later, of dubious validity. We are brought up to respect these persons in whom we have placed our trust to safeguard the public interest. It is difficult for each of us to accept that these may be misplaced.{{cn|date=September 2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2001 study found that &quot;fluoride, particularly in toothpastes, is a very important preventive agent against dental caries,&quot; but added that &quot;additional fluoride to that currently available in toothpaste does not appear to be benefiting the teeth of the majority of people.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sheiham&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Sheiham A |title=Dietary effects on dental diseases |journal=Public Health Nutr |volume=4 |issue=2B |pages=569–91 |year=2001 |pmid=11683551 |doi=10.1079/PHN2001142 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1357436&amp;aid=1357428 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Chiropractor's Association]] opposes mass water fluoridation, considering it &quot;possibly harmful and deprivation of the rights of citizens to be free from unwelcome mass medication.&quot;&lt;ref name='ICA_position'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiropractic.org/index.php?p=ica/policies |title=ICA Policy Position Statements |accessdate=2008-08-28 |publisher=International Chiropractors Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Sierra Club]] opposes mandatory water fluoridation.  Some reasons cited include possible adverse health effects, harm to the environment, and risks involving sensitive populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Club Policy on Fluoride in Drinking Water |author=Board of Directors|date=19 June 2008 |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/policy/conservation/water_fluoridation.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Citing impacts on the environment, the economy and on health, the [[Green Party of Canada]] seeks a ban on artificial fluoridation products.  The Canadian Green Party adopted in 2010 a platform position which considers water fluoridation to be unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rodriguez-Larrain, Claudia |title=Ban on artificial water fluoridation, a new policy |publisher=Green Party of Canada |url=http://greenparty.ca/blogs/15909/2010-08-26/engage-elizabeth-may-new-policy-ban-fluoridation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arvid Carlsson]], winner of the 2000 [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]], opposes water fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_498843.svd |trans_title=Fluoride in drinking water can cause cancer |newspaper=Svenska Dagbladet |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Torell P, Forsman B |trans_title=Arvid Carlsson's fluoride ponderings 1978 |language=Swedish |journal=Tandlakartidningen |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=142–57 |year=1979 |month=February |pmid=287207 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He took part in the debate in Sweden, where he helped to convince Parliament that it should be illegal due to ethics. He believes that it violates modern pharmacological principles, which indicate that medications should be tailored to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bryson, Christopher |title=The Fluoride Deception |page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=q3v_JgjZ6fsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA240,M1 240] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociologist]] [[Brian Martin (professor)|Brian Martin]] states that sociologists have typically viewed opposition to water fluoridation as irrational, although critics of this position have argued that this rests on an uncritical attitude toward scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=Martin1989/&gt;

On 15 April 2008, the United States [[National Kidney Foundation]] (NKF) updated their position on fluoridation for the first time since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_12710.cfm|title=Kidney Patients Should be Notified of Potential Risk from Fluorides and Fluoridated Drinking Water|publisher=Organic Consumers Association|date=3 June 2008|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly an endorser of water fluoridation, the group is now neutral on the practice. The report states, ''&quot;Individuals with CKD should be notified of the potential risk of fluoride exposure by providing information on the NKF website including a link to the report in brief of the NRC and the Kidney Health Australia position paper.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidney.org.au//LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=yYXcj2v4%2fqQ%3d&amp;tabid=635&amp;mid=1590 |title=The risks of consumption of fluoridated water for people with chronic kidney disease |publisher=Kidney Health Australia |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidney.org.au//LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=4oSJIfzbkZ0%3d&amp;tabid=635&amp;mid=1590 |title=2011 Review of Kidney Health Australia fluoride position statement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling for additional research, the foundation's 2008 position paper states, however, that there is insufficient evidence to recommend fluoride-free drinking water for patients with renal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Kidney Foundation |url=http://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/Fluoride.cfm |title=Fluoride Intake in Chronic Kidney Disease |date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements for==
The fluoridation of public water has been hailed by the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control]] as one of the top medical achievements of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm |title=Ten Great Public Health Achievements – United States, 1900–1999 |publisher=[[U.S. Centers for Disease Control]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is ranked No. 9 on this list ahead of &quot;Recognition of [[Health effects of tobacco|tobacco use as a health hazard]].&quot;&lt;ref name=CDC-1999&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Division of Oral Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC |title=Achievements in public health, 1900–1999: Fluoridation of drinking water to prevent dental caries |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=48 |issue=41 |pages=933–40 |year=1999 |pmid= |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4841a1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Dental Association calls water fluoridation &quot;unquestionably one of the safest and most beneficial, cost-effective public health measures for preventing, controlling, and in some cases reversing, tooth decay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ada.org/2467.aspx |title=Fluoride &amp; Fluoridation |publisher=[[American Dental Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health Canada]] supports fluoridation, citing a number of international scientific reviews that indicate &quot;there is no link between any adverse health effects and exposure to fluoride in drinking water at levels that are below the maximum acceptable concentration of 1.5 mg/L.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/water-eau/faq_fluoride-fluorure-eng.php |title=Fluoride in Drinking Water |publisher=[[Health Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] says fluoridation is an effective way to prevent tooth decay in poor communities. &quot;In some developed countries, the health and economic benefits of fluoridation may be small, but particularly important in deprived areas, where water fluoridation may be a key factor in reducing inequalities in dental health.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/oralhealth/en/index2.html |title=Water fluoridation |work=World Water Day 2001: Oral health |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 meta-analysis of published research into fluoride's effect on [[osteoporosis]] found that daily doses of up to 20 mg fluoride significantly increased bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Osteoporos Int. |date=March 2008 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=257–68 |title=Effects of treatment with fluoride on bone mineral density and fracture risk—a meta-analysis |author=Vestergaard P, Jorgensen NR, Schwarz P, Mosekilde L |pmid=17701094 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use throughout the world==
{{Main|Fluoridation by country}}
Water fluoridation is used in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, and Australia, and a handful of other countries.  The following nations previously fluoridated their water, but stopped the practice, with the years when water fluoridation started and stopped in parentheses:
*Federal Republic of Germany (1952–1971)
*Sweden (1952–1971)
*Netherlands (1953–1976)
*Czechoslovakia (1955–1990)
*German Democratic Republic (1959–1990)
*Soviet Union (1960–1990)
*Finland (1959–1993)
*Japan (1952–1972){{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the United Kingdom a [[Strategic Health Authority]] can direct a water company to fluoridate the water supply in an area if it is technically possible. The strategic health authority must consult with the local community and businesses in the affected area. The water company will act as a contractor in any new schemes and cannot refuse to fluoridate the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedutilities.com/About-your-water.aspx |title=About your water |publisher=United Utilities }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] had a commentary, &quot;Large temporal reductions in tooth decay, which cannot be attributed to fluoridation, have been observed in both unfluoridated and fluoridated areas of at least eight developed countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v322/n6075/abs/322125a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=322 |issue=6075 |pages=125–129 |date=10 July 1986 |title=The mystery of declining tooth decay |author=Diesendorf M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas with complex water sources, water fluoridation is more difficult and more costly. Alternative fluoridation methods have been proposed, and implemented in some parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is currently assessing the effects of fluoridated toothpaste, milk fluoridation and salt fluoridation in Africa, Asia, and Europe.  The WHO supports fluoridation of water in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/oral_health/media/en/orh_report03_en.pdf |title=World Oral Health Report |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=4 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of water fluoridation}}

The first large fluoridation controversy occurred in Wisconsin in 1950. Fluoridation opponents questioned the ethics, safety, and efficacy of fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Musto&gt;{{cite journal |author=Musto RJ |title=Fluoridation: why is it not more widely adopted? |journal=CMAJ |volume=137 |issue=8 |pages=705–8 |year=1987 |month=October |pmid=3651941 |pmc=1267306 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand was the second country to fluoridate, and similar controversies arose there.&lt;ref name=Wrapson&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40111610 | year = 2005 | title = Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies in New Zealand:‘Magic Bullet,’Rat Poison, or Communist Plot? | journal = Health and History | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 17–29 | url = http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/hah/7.2/wrapson.html | author = Wrapson J | jstor = 40111610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears about fluoride were likely exacerbated by the reputation of fluoride compounds as insect poisons and by early literature which tended to use terms such as &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;low grade chronic [[fluoride poisoning]]&quot; to describe mottling from consumption of 6&amp;nbsp;mg/L of fluoride prior to tooth eruption, a level of consumption not expected to occur under controlled fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richmond VL |title=Thirty years of fluoridation: a review |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=129–38 |year=1985 |month=January |pmid=3917599 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3917599}}&lt;/ref&gt; When voted upon, the outcomes tend to be negative, and thus fluoridation has had a history of gaining through administrative orders in North America.&lt;ref name=Musto/&gt; Theories for why the public tends to reject fluoridation include &quot;alienation from mainstream&quot; society, but evidence for that is weak. Another interpretation is confusion introduced during the referendum.&lt;ref name=Musto/&gt; Some studies of the sociology of opposition to water fluoridation have been criticized for having an uncritical attitude toward scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=Martin1989/&gt;

Outside of North America, water fluoridation was adopted in European countries, but in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Denmark and Sweden banned fluoridation when government panels found insufficient evidence of safety, and the Netherlands banned water fluoridation when &quot;a group of medical practitioners presented evidence&quot; that it caused negative effects in a percentage of the population.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
[[File:Unholy three.png|right|thumb|200px|Flier issued in May 1955 by the Keep America Committee, alleging a [[conspiracy theory]] that water fluoridation is a communist plot.]]
Water fluoridation has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories. During the &quot;[[Red Scare]]&quot; in the United States during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, activists on the far right of American politics routinely asserted that fluoridation was part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime. They also opposed other public health programs, notably mass [[vaccination]] and [[mental health]] services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henig&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Henig | first = Robin Marantz | title = The People's Health | publisher = Joseph Henry Press| year = 1997 | isbn = 0-309-05492-3 | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the UN and its programs; the introduction of [[social welfare provision]]s, particularly the various programs established by the [[New Deal]]; and government efforts to reduce perceived inequalities in the [[social structure of the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rovere&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Rovere | first = Richard H. | title = Senator Joe McCarthy | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1959 | pages = 21–22| isbn = 0-520-20472-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some took the view that fluoridation was only the first stage of a plan to control the American people.  Fluoridation, it was claimed, was merely a stepping-stone on the way to implementing more ambitious programs. Others asserted the existence of a plot by communists and the United Nations to &quot;deplete the brainpower and sap the strength of a generation of American children&quot;. Dr. Charles Bett, a prominent anti-fluoridationist, charged that fluoridation was &quot;better THAN USING THE ATOM BOMB because the atom bomb has to be made, has to be transported to the place it is to be set off while POISONOUS FLUORINE has been placed right beside the water supplies by the Americans themselves ready to be dumped into the water mains whenever a Communist desires!&quot; Similarly, a right-wing newsletter, the ''American Capsule News'', claimed that &quot;the Soviet General Staff is very happy about it. Anytime they get ready to strike, and their [[fifth column|5th column]] takes over, there are tons and tons of this poison &quot;standing by&quot; municipal and military water systems ready to be poured in within 15 minutes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston&quot; /&gt;

This viewpoint led to major controversies over public health programs in the US, most notably in the case of the [[Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act]] controversy of 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | surname= Marmor | given= Judd | chapter=Psychodynamics of Group Opposition to Mental Health Programs | title=Psychiatry in Transition | publisher=Brunner/Mazel | year=1974 | isbn = 0-87630-070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of fluoridation, the controversy had a direct impact on local programs. During the 1950s and 1960s, referendums on introducing fluoridation were defeated in over a thousand Florida communities. Although the opposition was overcome in time, it was not until as late as the 1990s that fluoridated water was drunk by the majority of the population of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henig&quot; /&gt;

The communist conspiracy argument declined in influence by the mid-1960s, becoming associated in the public mind with irrational fear and paranoia. It was portrayed in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', in which the character General Jack D. Ripper initiates a nuclear war in the hope of thwarting a communist plot to &quot;sap and impurify&quot; the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of the American people with fluoridated water. Another satire appeared in the 1967 movie ''[[In Like Flint]]'', in which a character's fear of fluoridation is used to indicate that he is insane. Some anti-fluoridationists claimed that the conspiracy theories were damaging their goals; Dr. Frederick Exner, an anti-fluoridation campaigner in the early 1960s, told a conference: &quot;most people are not prepared to believe that fluoridation is a communist plot, and if you say it is, you are successfully ridiculed by the promoters. It is being done, effectively, every day ... some of the people on our side are the fluoridators' 'fifth column'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston&quot; /&gt;

In 2004 on the U.S. television program ''Democracy Now'', investigative journalist and author of the book ''The Fluoride Deception'', Christopher Bryson claimed that, “the post-war campaign to fluoridate drinking water was less a public health innovation than a public relations ploy sponsored by industrial users of fluoride–including the government’s nuclear weapons program.”&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Christopher. [http://www.democracynow.org/2004/6/17/the_fluoride_deception_how_a_nuclear &quot;The Fluoride Deception: How a Nuclear Waste Made its Way Into the Nation’s Drinking Water&quot;], ''Democracy Now'',  17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
===Europe===
Water was fluoridated in large parts of the Netherlands from 1960 to 1973, when the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] declared fluoridation of drinking water unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3UoZAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=fluoridering+nederland&amp;source=web&amp;ots=gBeB1umWcI&amp;sig=w-iamuX7EZ4PBcwWbRPObOnTQHM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA488,M1 |author=Bram van der Lek |title=De strijd tegen fluoridering |journal=De Gids |volume=139 |issue=2 |year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch authorities had no legal basis for adding chemicals to drinking water if they did not improve the safety as such. The simple reason is that consumers cannot choose a different tap water provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonardus Johannes Antonius Damen, Peter Nicolaï, J.L. Boxum, K.J. de Graaf, J.H. Jans, A.P. Klap, A.T. Marseille, A.R. Neerhof, B.K. Olivier, B.J. Schueler, F.R. Vermeer, R.L.

In ''Ryan v. Attorney General'' (1965), the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] held that water fluoridation did not infringe the plaintiff's right to bodily integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/1965/1.html |title=Ryan v. A.G. IESC 1; IR 294 (3 July, 1965) |publisher=Irish Supreme Court }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court found that such a right to bodily integrity did exist, despite the fact that it was not explicitly mentioned in the [[Constitution of Ireland]], thus establishing the doctrine of [[unenumerated rights]] in Irish constitutional law.

===United States===
{{See also|Water fluoridation in the United States}}
Fluoridation has been the subject of many [[Legal case|court cases]] wherein activists have sued municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical treatment and [[due process]] are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation.&lt;ref name=Cross2003/&gt; Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck&quot;&gt;Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) (&quot;Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question.&quot; (citations omitted)).&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Edwin, Raymond D. Rawson &amp; Mark Rubin, ''Fluoridation at Fifty: What Have We Learned'', 30 J.L. Med. &amp; Ethics 117, 119 (Fall 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
