      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4091">A '''power vacuum''' is, in its broadest sense, an expression for a condition that exists when someone has lost control of something and no one has replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/power-vacuum&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used to refer to a [[politics|political]] situation that can occur when a [[government]] has no identifiable central [[authority]]. The metaphor implies that, like a physical [[vacuum]], other forces will tend to &quot;rush in&quot; to fill the vacuum as soon as it is created, perhaps in the form of an armed [[militia]] or [[Iraqi insurgency|insurgents]], [[military]] [[Coup d'état|coup]], [[warlord]] or [[dictator]].

Historian [[Fernand Braudel]] compared the situation of [[History of Italy|Italy]] during the [[Renaissance]] as a &quot;[[cyclonic]] zone, an enormous vacuum&quot;, which would sweep in foreign armies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;The strength of the barriers in eastern and south-western Europe varied from century to century. The nomads' worlds rotated between these areas of negligence, weakness and sometimes ineffectual vigilance. A physical law drew them now westwards, now eastwards, according to whether their explosive life would ignite more easily in Europe, Islam, India or China. [[Historiography of Switzerland|Eduard Fueter]]'s classic work drew attention to a cyclonic zone, an enormous vacuum in 1494 over the fragmented Italy of princes and urban republics. All Europe was attracted towards this storm-creating area of low pressure. In the same way hurricanes persistently blew the people of the steppes eastwards or westwards according to the lines of least resistance.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], ''Capitalism and Material Life'', New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1967, vol. I, p.57 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During or following a [[civil war]] there is often a power vacuum of some sort. For example, the [[Somali Civil War|war-torn]] nation of [[Somalia]] is currently mired in a power vacuum, with no central [[Politics of Somalia|government]] or [[List of Presidents of Somalia|president]] exercising control over the supposed &quot;[[Republic]] of Somalia&quot;.

The start of civil war in Bosnia in 1992 was marked with a power vacuum following disintegration of Yugoslavia.

A power vacuum can also occur following a [[constitutional crisis]] in which large portions of the government resign or are removed, creating unclear issues regarding [[Order of succession|succession]] to positions of power.

After the [[World War II|Second World War]], there was a power vacuum in Europe. Along with the division of [[German Democratic Republic|East]] and [[West Germany]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Foreign relations of the Soviet Union|diplomacy]] and [[Stalinism|governance]], the [[History of nuclear weapons|development]] of the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]], [[Foreign policy|policies]] of [[containment]] of [[communism]], the expansionism of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and [[USA]] and a growing lack of trust (fear of a [[hegemony]]) were seen to be factors in the emergence of the [[Cold War]].

More recently, the tight control which [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'ath Party|Baath party]] exerted on [[Iraq]] could have been exploited during a transitional hand-over period following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Instead, the [[US Government]]'s policy of purging Baath party members from the Iraqi government after the invasion created a power vacuum which was quickly filled by [[Iraqi insurgency|insurgents]], who then began to attack American service personnel using [[improvised explosive devices]] and [[snipers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,2252730,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The general concept of a &quot;power vacuum&quot; is relevant to many personal and organizational situations. In the criminal world many drug lords are able to become untouchable because of fear of any backlash occurring in a power vacuum situation.
