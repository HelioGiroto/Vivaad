{{International relations theory}}
'''Neo-Gramscianism''' applies a [[critical theory]] approach to the study of [[International Relations]] (IR) and the [[Global Political Economy]] (GPE) that explores the interface of ideas, institutions and material capabilities as they shape the specific contours of the state formation. The theory is heavily influenced by the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=The Ideologies of Theory: Essays 1971-1986|first1= Fredric|last1= Jameson|first2=Neil |last2=Larsen|publisher=Routledge|year= 1988|ISBN=0-415-00658-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Gramscianism analyzes how the particular constellation of social forces, the state and the dominant ideational configuration define and sustain world orders. In this sense, the Neo-Gramscian approach breaks the decades-old stalemate between the so-called [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] schools of thought, and the [[liberalism|liberal]] theories by historicizing the very theoretical foundations of the two streams as part of a particular world order, and finding the interlocking relationship between [[structure and agency|agency and structure]].  Furthermore, [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Michel Foucault]] are cited as major sources within the [[Critical theory]] of International Relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=The Ideologies of Theory: Essays 1971-1986|first1= Fredric|last1= Jameson|first2=Neil |last2=Larsen|publisher=Routledge|year= 1988|ISBN=0-415-00658-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the Neo-Gramscian perspective==
The beginning of the Neo-Gramscian perspective can be traced to  [[York University]] professor emeritus, [[Robert W. Cox]]'s article &quot;Social Forces, States and World Orders: Beyond International Relations Theory&quot;, in ''Millennium'' 10 (1981) 2, and &quot;Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method&quot;, published in ''Millennium'' 12 (1983) 2. In his 1981 article, Cox demands a critical study of IR, as opposed to the usual &quot;problem-solving&quot; theories, which do not interrogate the origin, nature and development of historical structures, but accept for example that states and the (supposedly) &quot;anarchic&quot; relationships between them as [[Kant]]ian ''Dinge an sich''.

However Cox disavows the label Neo-Gramscian despite the fact that in a follow-up article, he showed how Gramsci's thought can be used to analyze power structures within the GPE. Particularly Gramsci's concept of [[hegemony]], vastly different from the [[Realism (international relations)|realists']] conception of hegemony, appears fruitful. Gramsci's state theory, his conception of &quot;''historic blocs''&quot; &amp;ndash; dominant configurations of material capabilities, ideologies and institutions as determining frames for individual and [[collective action]] &amp;ndash; and of élites acting as &quot;organic intellectuals&quot; forging ''historic blocs'', is also deemed useful.

The Neo-Gramscian approach has also been developed along somewhat different lines by Cox's colleague, [[Stephen Gill (academic)|Stephen Gill]], distinguished research professor of [[political science]] at [[York University]] in [[Toronto]]. Gill contributed to showing how the elite [[Trilateral Commission]] acted as an &quot;organic intellectual&quot;, forging the (currently hegemonic) ideology of [[neoliberalism]] and the so-called &quot;[[Washington Consensus]]&quot; and later in relation to the globalization of power and resistance in his book &quot;Power and Resistance in the New World Order&quot; (Palgrave 2003). Outside of North America, the so-called &quot;Amsterdam School&quot; around [[Kees Van Der Pijl]] and [[Henk Overbeek]] (at [[VU University Amsterdam]]) and individual researchers in [[Germany]], notably in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg]] as well as at the [http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cgpe/ Centre for Global Political Economy] at the [[University of Sussex]] in the UK, and other parts of the world, have adopted the neo-Gramscian critical method.

==Basics of the neo-Gramscian perspective==
===Theoretical Approach===

In the mainstream approaches to international or global political economy the ontological centrality of the state is not in question. In contrast, Neo-Gramscianism, using an approach which [[Henk Overbeek]] calls transnational [[historical materialism]], &quot;identifies state formation and interstate politics as moments of the transnational dynamics of capital accumulation and class formation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[Henk Overbeek, Transnational Historical Materialism in Global Political Economy: Contemporary Theories (ed. Ronan Palan), Routledge: 2000, pg. 168-9.]&lt;/ref&gt; It contrasts with the [[positivism]] and social [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivist]] approaches of mainstream perspectives through &quot;a rejection of the separation between [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]... and the adoption of a [[dialectic]] understanding of reality as a dynamic totality and as a unity of opposites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[Henk Overbeek, Transnational Historical Materialism in Global Political Economy: Contemporary Theories (ed. Ronan Palan), Routledge: 2000, pg. 168-9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegemony===
{{anchor|Hegemony}}
The neo-Gramscian view of [[hegemony]] is distinct from the realist view of hegemony. Realists view hegemony as the &quot;predominant power of a state (or a group of states)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[Theodore H. Cohn, Global Political Economy: Theory and Practice, Pearson: 2005, pg. 130-131.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gramscians look at hegemony in terms of [[Social class|class]] relations. A class is considered hegemonic if it has legitimized its dominance through [[institutions]] and concessions.&lt;ref&gt;[Theodore H. Cohn, Global Political Economy: Theory and Practice, Pearson: 2005, pg. 131.]&lt;/ref&gt; When a class has established dominance in this way, as well as in the formal political structural of a state, then it constitutes a ''historic bloc.'' Neo-Gramscians argue that, because of globalisation, a [[neoliberal]] ''transnational historic bloc'' exists or is coming into existence.

===Counterhegemony===

A [[counterhegemony]] refers to an alternate normative interpretation of the functioning of social, economic, and political institutions. If a counterhegemony grows large enough it is able to subsume and replace the ''historic bloc'' it was born in. Neo-Gramscians use the Machiavellian terms ''war of position'' and ''war of movement'' to explain how this is possible. In a war of position a counterhegemonic movement attempts, through persuasion or propaganda, to increase the number of people who share its view on the hegemonic order; in a war of movement the counterhegemonic tendencies which have grown large enough overthrow, violently or democratically, the current hegemony and establish themselves as a new ''historic bloc.''
