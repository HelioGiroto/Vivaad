'''Jeannette Marie Hoffman Schmidt''', (born November 29, 1951) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OH|2}}, serving since 2005. She is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district stretches from eastern [[Cincinnati]] to [[Portsmouth, Ohio|Portsmouth]]. 

Schmidt is the second female Ohio Republican to be elected to Congress without succeeding her husband and the first woman to represent the Cincinnati area in the House. She won the Ohio 2nd congressional district seat in a special election on August 2, 2005, by 3.5 percentage points over [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] and [[Iraq War of 2003|Iraq War]] [[veteran]] [[Paul Hackett (politician)|Paul Hackett]], amid national attention to the race because of Hackett's strong views on the war. The margin of her victory led many Democrats to claim a victory for their party, since the district had been reliably Republican for the past 30 years, and to forecast trouble for the Republicans in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006]]. Despite these forecasts, Schmidt defeated former representative [[Bob McEwen]] in a Republican [[primary election|primary]] in May 2006 and Democrat [[Victoria Wells Wulsin]], a [[medical doctor]], in 2006 with 50.4% of the vote. She was re-elected in 2008, winning with 45% of the vote, and in 2010, winning with 58.6%.  On March 6, 2012, Schmidt was defeated for re-election in the GOP primary by [[Brad Wenstrup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Kleefeld |url=http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/03/jean-schmidt-loses-house-seat-in-major-gop-primary-upset.php |title=Jean Schmidt Loses House Seat In Major GOP Primary Upset |publisher=Talking Points Memo |date=March 6, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life, education, and early political career ==
Schmidt, born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], is a lifelong resident of [[Clermont County, Ohio|Clermont County's]] [[Miami Township, Clermont County, Ohio|Miami Township]], along the eastern shore of [[Little Miami River]] near [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]] and [[Loveland, Ohio|Loveland]]. One of four children (two daughters, two sons) of Augustus (&quot;Gus&quot;) and Jeannette Hoffman, she has a twin sister, Jennifer Black. Her father made his money in the [[savings and loan]] industry, then ran an [[auto racing]] team that competed in the [[Indianapolis 500]]. 

She earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cong.bio&quot;&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S001164 SCHMIDT, Jean] Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. Retrieved October 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt worked in her father's bank, the Midwestern Savings Association, as a branch manager from 1971 to 1978. Schmidt was a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]] in 1984. She was a fitness instructor from 1984 to 1986, when she began a four-year career as a schoolteacher.

Schmidt was elected as a Miami Township [[Trustee#City Government|trustee]] in 1989,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cong.bio&quot;/&gt; finishing first of three candidates for two seats and winning 4,362 votes. When Clermont [[County Commissioner]] Jerry McBride resigned in 1991 to become a [[judge]], Schmidt was one of four candidates to replace him, but was not appointed by the Clermont County Republican Party. In her 1993 bid for reelection, she finished first in a field of four, taking 3,644 votes.

In 1995, she traveled to [[Russia]] to offer instruction about political campaigning in a country that had little experience of free elections. On her trip she ran in [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]]: &quot;Did I ever feel unsafe? No. And would I jog through [[Central Park]] in [[New York City|New York]]? No way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miami trustee visits Russia|last=Penix|first=Len|work=Cincinnati Post|date=28 Sep 1995|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major issue during her service on the Board of Trustees was one common in Ohio: a city, in this case [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]], was [[annexation|annexing]] parts of the township. She and other trustees lobbied the [[Ohio General Assembly]] for new laws to protect townships from such annexations. In 1993, a panel of Miami Township residents recommended the township incorporate to protect itself from annexations, to have greater control over its territory, and to obtain more money from the state. However, Schmidt as a trustee was not a participant in this effort, saying she had to be a &quot;cheerleader&quot; on the sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A 'City of Miami' in doubt Township drive runs out of steam|last=Penix|first=Len|work=Cincinnati Post |date=14 Oct 1993|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The incorporation effort failed.)

Schmidt was reelected to a third term in 1997, finishing first in a field of three with 5,110 votes. &quot;Jean has been an excellent trustee and has done so much for this community. It is going to be hard to find someone that's as committed to the township as she has been,&quot; said David Duckworth, Miami Township administrator, when she resigned her trustee seat to enter the Ohio House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Townships seek to fill trustee positions Departing leaders need replacements|work=Cincinnati Post |date=22 Nov 2000|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two trustees appointed Mary Makley Wolff to the remainder of the term.

== Ohio House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
[[File:Ohio Statehouse columbus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Ohio Statehouse]]In 2000 she ran for the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] seat being vacated by Sam Bateman, who was prevented by [[term limits]] from running again. She told ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'' that before Bateman had been appointed to the seat in the early 1980s, Clermont County Republican leaders &quot;offered me the job on a silver platter&quot; but she turned them down because her daughter was only four years old at the time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} But in 2000, her daughter was in college and she decided to run. Unopposed in the March primary, ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' [[Political endorsement|endorsed]] her in the [[general election#American usage|general election]], writing &quot;Seldom has a choice been more obvious than that between Republican Jean Schmidt and Democrat Sherrill Callahan.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Schmidt was easily elected to the 124th [[Ohio General Assembly]] from the 71st [[Ohio House of Representatives|House]] District by defeating Callahan, a retired [[high school]] [[principal (school)|principal]] from Pierce Township. Schmidt received 36,433 votes (70.4 percent) to Callahan's 15,327 (29.6 percent).

Her district was entirely within Clermont County, containing Miami Township as well as [[Batavia Township, Clermont County, Ohio|Batavia]], [[Goshen Township, Clermont County, Ohio|Goshen]], [[Pierce Township, Clermont County, Ohio|Pierce]], [[Stonelick Township, Clermont County, Ohio|Stonelick]] and [[Union Township, Clermont County, Ohio|Union]] Townships, plus the cities of [[Amelia, Ohio|Amelia]], [[Batavia, Ohio|Batavia]] and [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]], and the Clermont County part of the city of [[Loveland, Ohio|Loveland]]. After the redistricting necessitated by the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], her district became the 66th and contained the same territory minus Pierce and Stonelick Townships.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

=== Tenure ===
''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' wrote she introduced and passed bills &quot;remarkable in number and quality for a neophyte lawmaker.&quot; She sponsored legislation on the Clermont County courts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/06/30/loc_wwwloc3clermont30.html New Clermont clerk job on way] June 30, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; limiting the ability of public employees to collect both [[pension]] and [[salary]] simultaneously (&quot;[[double dipping]]&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;cincypost.com, ''&quot;Ohio moves to end double dipping&quot;'', February 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[urban township]]s, and protecting townships from annexations of their territory by cities, all of which were passed into law. She also pushed [[legislation]] on the [[Women's health|health of women]], [[suicide]] prevention, [[Sexual abstinence|abstinence]] education, and to &quot;lock killers away for good&quot; by making it easier for judges to sentence murderers to [[life term]]s. Schmidt also supported Ohio's [[concealed carry]] law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/01/08/loc_gunbillbox0.html Concealed carry rules] January 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Committee assignments ===
In the House she served on the Finance and Appropriations; Human Services and Aging; Banking, Pensions and Securities; and Public Utilities Committees. She was excited to be in the Statehouse: &quot;Oh my God, I'm really a state representative&quot; she was overheard telling a fellow freshman.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | author = Debra Jasper | title = Excited freshmen plan bills | work = Columbus Enquirer Bureau | date = November 12, 2000 | url = http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/11/12/loc_excited_freshmen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she was elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives membership, 125th General Assembly|125th General Assembly]] without opposition in both the primary and general elections.

==2004 Ohio state senatorial election==
In 2004, she ran for the 14th District seat in the [[Ohio Senate]] to replace Senate President [[Doug White]], who was retiring. The Senate seat included Clermont, [[Brown County, Ohio|Brown]], [[Adams County, Ohio|Adams]] and [[Scioto County, Ohio|Scioto]] counties and part of [[Lawrence County, Ohio|Lawrence County]]. Her opponent for the Republican nomination was [[Tom Niehaus]], a fellow member of the Ohio House from [[New Richmond, Ohio|New Richmond]] whose 88th District represented the half of Clermont County outside her district plus Brown and Adams Counties to the east. Schmidt told the ''Enquirer'' &quot;The fear from many of the people I meet is that because the next senator will come from Clermont County, they will be underrepresented. But if you know anything about me, I don't under-represent anybody.&quot; She also said she worried about the state budget: &quot;We do have a history of overspending in Ohio. But it's not just recent history. It's a 40-year-old habit.&quot; ''The Enquirer'' was dismayed by advertisements from the Ohio Taxpayers Association &quot;twisting the two candidates' voting records to Schmidt's advantage&quot; and endorsed Niehaus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/02/29/editorial_ed2b.html Endorsements in GOP legislative races] February 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/02/18/editorial_ed1a.html Candidate Q&amp;A: Ohio 14th District state Senate seat] February 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt had endorsements from key state leaders such as [[Ohio State Treasurer]] [[Joe Deters]] and [[List of Speakers of the Ohio House of Representatives|Speaker of the Ohio House]] [[Larry Householder]]. The campaign was marred by allegations that Householder's staff had improperly tried to obtain Niehaus's withdrawal from the race and that Householder had told Niehaus's supporters to donate money to Schmidt's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;cincypost.com, ''&quot;A cloud of smoke&quot;'', March 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the initial count of the Republican primary vote on March 2, 2004, she led by just 62 votes. A recount was automatically ordered, which reversed the outcome. Schmidt ultimately lost by just 22 votes: 17,076 (49.97%) to Niehaus's 17,098 (50.03%). She told ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' on election night &quot;This is the way my whole life has been â€” one tough race after another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/03/03/loc_Clermontstate03FINAL.html 62-vote difference means a recount in state Senate] March 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
;2005
{{Main|Ohio's 2nd congressional district special election, 2005}}
When President [[George W. Bush]] nominated [[Rob Portman]], who had just been elected to a sixth full term, to be [[U.S. Trade Representative]] on March 17, 2005, eleven Republicans entered the race for his seat.

Schmidt launched her campaign for Congress in [[Montgomery, Ohio|Montgomery]] on April 11, the first candidate from outside [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] to declare. She emphasized the need for all parts of the district to be represented: &quot;We must always balance the interests of Hamilton County, which is more urban, with those of the more rural part of our district.&quot; She said of her predecessor, &quot;While I know that I cannot fill Rob's shoes, I know that I am the right person to continue the tradition of leadership and character.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Early polling showed Hamilton County Commissioner [[Pat DeWine]] leading at 42%, with Schmidt tied for third at 7%.

In her campaign, Schmidt ran on a conservative platform. In one mailing to voters, she promised to &quot;reduce our taxes&quot;, &quot;keep our nation safe&quot;, advocated &quot;a responsible energy policy&quot;, and for &quot;promoting family values.&quot; The tag line on the mailer was &quot;continuing a tradition of character and leadership.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Schmidt's campaign literature noted her [[pro-life]] voting record, her opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], her high ratings from the [[National Rifle Association]], and that she &quot;opposes an activist court system that acts against our conservative values.&quot; The literature also featured her endorsement by Phil Fulton, a [[pastor]] who fought the court ordered removal of tablets containing the [[Ten Commandments]] from the grounds of [[Public school (government funded)|schools]] in Adams County.

A major factor in the primary campaign was DeWine's marriage. In 2004, DeWine's opponent ran ads calling attention to DeWine leaving his pregnant wife and their two children for a mistress working as a [[lobbyist]]. Schmidt made it a point in her stump speech to emphasize how long she had been married to her husband: &quot;I am a woman of character who has been married for twenty-nine years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050601/NEWS01/506010411/1056/NEWS DeWine's name helps - and hurts] June 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being far outspent by DeWine, on June 14, 2005, Schmidt finished first in the Republican primary, with 31 percent of the vote. McEwen finished second with 25 percent, Brinkman was third with 20 percent, and DeWine had 12 percent. Two days after the primary, an editorial cartoon in the ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', commenting on DeWine's marriage being such a factor in the primary, showed Schmidt asking [[Paul Hackett (politician)|Paul Hackett]], who had won the Democratic primary, &quot;You have a good marriage. I have a good marriage. What the heck are we going to campaign about?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://borgman.enquirer.com/weekly/daily_html/2005/06/061605borgman.html Jim Borgman cartoon] June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Many politicos blame Dewine's barrage of attacks on McEwen as the main reason for Schmidt's win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050603/NEWS01/506030407/1056/NEWS0102 Candidates toe the line on 'values'] June 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050605/NEWS01/506050388/1056 The mud's flying in 2nd Dist. campaign] June 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt faced Democratic nominee [[Paul Hackett (politician)|Paul Hackett]], described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as six foot four and &quot;garrulous, profane, and quick with a barked retort or a mischievous joke&quot; in the August 2, 2005, special election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq duty helps Democrat's election odds|last=Dao|first=James|work=International Herald Tribune |location=Paris|date=28 July 2005|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hackett had organized the recall of a councilman in [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]] in 1995 and was elected to the council in his place, serving three years. He had also just returned from a tour of duty in [[Iraq]] and referred to his combat experiences in the campaign.

The district was reliably Republican, the ''Cook Political Report'' calling the Second District the fifty-seventh most Republican in America. Among Ohio's congressional districts, only the [[Ohio's 4th congressional district|4th District]] is considered more Republican.  The district had been in Republican hands for all but nine years since 1879, and no Democrat had held the seat since [[Tom Luken|Thomas A. Luken's]] narrow loss to [[Bill Gradison|Willis D. Gradison]] in 1974.  The last Democrat to win a full term in the district was [[John J. Gilligan]], who held the seat for one term after being swept into office in the giant Democratic landslide of 1964.

John Green, a [[political science]] professor at the [[University of Akron]] told ''[[USA Today]]'' &quot;It's a real steep uphill climb for Hackett. It is such a Republican district.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Jane S. Anderson]], an [[adjunct professor]] of [[political science]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]] who has unsuccessfully run for the Cincinnati city council and the [[Ohio House]] as a Democrat, told the [[Associated Press]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's definitely worth it to the Democrats to put in the effort if only to keep the party energized. Even if Paul Hackett loses, it is very important for the party for him to do well. It could be seen as a sign of opportunities for Democrats in other GOP strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democrats see opportunity with Hackett|last=Cornwell|first=Lisa|work=Cincinnati Post |date=16 June 2005|page=20.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Martin Gottlieb of the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' wrote a Republican landslide in the district was &quot;a self-fulfilling prophecy&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is so overwhelmingly Republican that Democrats typically don't make a real effort as a party. A candidate puts himself up, but generally it's somebody who has no political strengths and gets no [[Campaign finance|financial contributions]] or volunteer help to speak of. The campaign gets little attention. And the prophecy gets fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hackett tests 2nd's Republicanism ; If the prophecies are right, it won't be because they're self- fulfilling|last=Gottlieb|first=Martin|work=Dayton Daily News |location=Dayton, Ohio|date=29 July 2005|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hackett criticized Schmidt as a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for [[Governor of Ohio|Governor]] [[Bob Taft]]'s &quot;failed policies&quot;, and claimed she would continue in that role for [[George W. Bush]] if elected. At their debate at Chatfield College, Hackett said &quot;If you think America is on the right track and we need more of the same, I'm not your candidate&quot; and asked &quot;Are you better off today than you were five years ago?&quot;, echoing [[Ronald Reagan]]'s question in his debate with [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debate shows sharp divide|last=Horstman|first=Barry M. |work=Cincinnati Post |date=8 July 2005|page=12.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Rubber stamp&quot; was Hackett's catchphrase throughout the campaign. Hackett even appeared in front of the Hathaway Rubber Stamp store in downtown Cincinnati on July 27 to emphasize the point. &quot;If you think America needs another career politician steeped in a culture of corruption who does as she's told and toes the line on failed policies, then I'm not your candidate,&quot; he wrote in a guest column for ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 2nd district candidates|last=Hackett|first=Paul|work=Cincinnati Post |date=23 July 2005|page=13.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schmidt said that she was proud to be associated with Bush, sending campaign mail with a photograph of them together in the [[Oval Office]].

A month before the election the [[inspector general]] of the [[Ohio General Assembly]] announced he was investigating three legislators for accepting gifts and failing to report them. Schmidt was implicated in this, but could not be investigated because she was no longer a member of the Ohio house. (The others were Representatives [[Jim Raussen]] of [[Springdale, Ohio|Springdale]], [[Michelle G. Schneider]] of [[Madeira, Ohio|Madeira]], and [[Diana M. Fessler]] of [[New Carlisle, Ohio|New Carlisle]].) On October 24, 2004, the legislators had accepted dinner at Nicola's Ristorante on Sycamore Street in [[Cincinnati]]'s [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood and [[Cincinnati Bengals]] tickets from a lobbyist for pharmaceutical company [[Chiron]]. Schmidt said she thought her $644 gift was from former Bengals player [[Boomer Esiason]], who was, like Chiron, interested in [[cystic fibrosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawmakers fail to report dinner, football tickets|work=Cincinnati Post |date=9 July 2005|page=7.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt repaid the lobbyist for the cost of the entertainment. Her spokesman told ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'' &quot;Jean specifically asked if this was a reportable gift. We immediately corrected it by paying the full price of the tickets.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Her former colleague Raussen blamed the lobbyist. &quot;Here we have a lobbyist who was extremely sloppy.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Hackett hammered on Schmidt's ethics. When she denied she knew or ever met [[Thomas Noe]], at the center of the [[Coingate scandal|Coingate investment scandal]] at the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation, Hackett produced minutes from a meeting of the [[Ohio Board of Regents]] that showed Schmidt had indeed met with Noe, once a regent. On July 29, the ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' reported on a 2001 e-mail from Taft's assistant Jon Allison complaining Schmidt was &quot;bugging&quot; him about setting up an Internet lottery for [[Cincinnati]] businessman Roger Ach, who gave her a $1,000 contribution the next year. Schmidt spokesman Fritz Wenzel said the candidate did not recall any conversations with the governor about Ach's business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/dispatch/contentbe/dispatch/2005/07/08/20050708-B1-00.html Four face ethics probe] July 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050708/NEWS01/507080390 Debate shows differences] July 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050722/NEWS01/507220384 Schmidt chips in another $20K for home stretch] July 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The candidates participated in only two debates. The first was held on July 7 at Chatfield College in [[St. Martin, Ohio|St. Martin]] in [[Brown County, Ohio|Brown County]], moderated by Jack Atherton of [[WXIX-TV]], the [[Fox Network]] affiliate in Cincinnati. Hackett told the audience his opponent was &quot;a rubber stamp for failed policies&quot; and &quot;if you think America is on the right track and we need more of the same, I'm not your candidate.&quot; The second debate was held July 26 at the [[Ohio Valley Career and Technical Center]] in [[West Union, Ohio|West Union]] in [[Adams County, Ohio|Adams County]]. Howard Wilkinson of ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' said Hackett in the second debate was &quot;trying to paint Schmidt as a Taft-Bush robot.&quot; The two also made joint appearances on [[WCET-TV]]'s ''Forum'' on July 28 and [[WKRC-TV]]'s ''Newsmakers'' on July 31.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050724/EDIT03/507240353/-1/all Schmidt has had lifelong drive to succeed] July 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050729/NEWS01/507290394 Anti-tax group, liberal PAC airing 'don't vote' message] July 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050728/NEWS01/507280350/-1/all FOP decries Hackett suit, endorses rival] July 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050729/NEWS01/507290393/-1/all Money pouring into race] July 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050730/NEWS01/507300376/1056 Schmidt can't recall Ach favor] July 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050731/EDIT03/507310314 Schmidt for Congress: Republican offers better experience, fit for 2nd District] July 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' ran a front page story on July 2 reporting on the candidates financial disclosure statements that revealed both were [[millionaire]]s. Schmidt was worth between $1,700,000 and $6,800,000; most of her wealth was her share of RTJJ, LLC, a [[real estate]] [[company]] owned with her three siblings. Hackett was worth between $650,000 and $1,600,000. (These figures did not include the value of either's home. The Clermont County Auditor valued Schmidt's home on {{convert|.667|acre|m2}} &lt;!-- two-thirds of an acre --&gt; at $138,510 and the Hamilton County Auditor valued Hackett's home on {{convert|5|acre|m2}} at $552,800.)

Schmidt used her own wealth in the campaign. She told ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'' the week before the election she put $200,000 of her money in the campaign that she had planned to use to buy a [[condominium]] in [[Florida]]. The paper noted the [[median]] [[Median household income|household income]] in the district was $46,813.

Hackett attracted national attention in newspapers, and expenditures by both parties at the national level. The [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] announced on July 28 it was spending $265,000 for television ads in the Cincinnati market, covering the western part of the district, and $250,000 for ads in the [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]], [[West Virginia]], market, covering the eastern half. The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) responded with commercials noting that Schmidt had voted to raise the [[sales tax]] by 20% and the [[excise tax]] on [[gasoline]] by 30 percent when she was in the legislature. A DCCC mailing to voters reiterated these charges under the headline &quot;Who Voted for the Taft Sales Tax Increase â€” the Largest in Ohio History?&quot; and asked &quot;can we trust Jean Schmidt to protect [[middle-class]] families in [[Washington, D. C.|Washington]]?&quot;

Schmidt defeated Hackett 52%-48%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=224440 |title=OH District 2 - Special Election Race - Aug 02, 2005 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a margin of three points, the worst showing of any Republican in the district since 1974, but which made her the second Republican woman elected to Congress from Ohio in her own right (behind [[Deborah Pryce]]) and the first woman to represent southwestern Ohio in Congress. Schmidt in her victory speech late on election night declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We began this race way back in late March, and no one had thought we'd be the focus of the national media or be the so-called first test of the Republican Party and the Bush mandate.

{{Main|Ohio 2nd congressional district election, 2006}}

Schmidt faced Democrat [[Victoria Wells Wulsin]], a doctor from [[Indian Hill, Ohio|Indian Hill]] in the November general election. 

During Schmidt's re-election bid there were [[Ohio 2nd congressional district election, 2006|several controversies]], which affected her campaign. One was a March 2006 report about Schmidt's past claims that she had a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[secondary education]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]], awarded in 1986. Schmidt's defenders pointed out that neither her current official or campaign website had the second degree posted, and said that Schmidt had completed the requirements for the degree but never filed the paperwork to be awarded a diploma. On April 27, five days before the May 2 primary, the Ohio Elections Commission voted 7-0 to issue Schmidt a public reprimand for &quot;false statements&quot; for her claiming to have that second degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio representative's photo altered, opponent says|work=The Charleston Gazette |location=Charleston, W.V|date=25 Aug 2006|page=3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also found that Schmidt had made false claims of being endorsed by several organizations, but that these did not warrant any reprimand.&lt;ref name=&quot;reprimand&quot;/&gt;

Schmidt won the Republican primary defeating former U.S. Congressman [[Bob McEwen]] 48%-43%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=273180 |title=OH District 2 - R Primary Race - May 02, 2006 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She defeated Wulsin 51%-49%, a difference of 2,865 votes, and a margin of 1.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/ElectionsVoter/results2006.aspx?Section=1849|title=2006 Election Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the closest a Republican had come to losing the seat in 42 years.

The Schmidt campaign sent out a fundraising letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/jean-schmidt/ The TPM DOCUMENT COLLECTION - Jean Schmidt Fundraising Letter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; accusing her Democratic opponent, [[Victoria Wulsin]] of harboring a &quot;contempt for the culture of life&quot; that led her to &quot;participate in grotesque medical experiments&quot; involving injections of &quot;[[malaria]] [[virus]]&quot; into [[AIDS]] patients in [[Africa]] and [[China]] without their consent.  The Wulsin campaign vigorously denied the charges. 

The &quot;grotesque medical experiments&quot; charge appears to be a reference to 2004 work that Wulsin did with the Heimlich Institute in Ohio. She examined data that was supplied to her as part of a [[literature review]], taken from ongoing studies, of experimental AIDS therapies that Wulsin concluded had potential. &quot;She never participated in any of the studies,&quot; said Wulsin communications director Kevin Franck. &quot;She was never in a position to stop any of them while they were in progress ...

===Tenure===
In Congress, Schmidt sponsored non-binding resolutions that states hit by [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]] should adopt a uniform statewide building code (H. Con. Res. 285); that the words &quot;under God&quot; in the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] were not an unconstitutional endorsement of religion (H. Res. 453); and supporting [[Gold Star Mothers]] (H. J. Res. 61). As of 2005, she was the original sponsor of one bill, H.R. 4180, a [[campaign finance reform]] measure &quot;to require communications that consist of prerecorded telephone calls to meet the disclosure and disclaimer requirements applicable to general public campaign communications transmitted through radio.&quot; She cosponsored bills to provide [[ultrasound]]s to pregnant mothers (H.R. 216); to require women having [[abortion]]s be &quot;fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child&quot; (H.R. 356); to allow free mail from families to servicemen in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] (H.R. 923); to require the [[Food and Drug Administration]]
withdraw its approval of the [[abortifacient]] drug [[RU-486]] because of safety concerns (H.R. 1079); the &quot;District of Columbia Personal Protection Act&quot;, which would repeal [[District of Columbia]] law forbidding residents from owning guns (H.R. 1288); to ban [[human cloning]] (H.R. 1357); to repeal the [[excise tax]] on [[telephone]]s (H.R. 1898); to forbid [[United States district court|federal courts]] from hearing cases on the constitutionality of the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] (H.R. 2389); and to limit the use of [[eminent domain]] by the states, a reaction to the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Kelo v. New London]]'' (H.R. 4128).

;Swearing In
Schmidt was sworn in on the evening of September 6, 2005. (Ordinarily, representatives chosen in [[special election]]s take office immediately, but the House was in its August recess at the time of the election.) In her maiden speech, Schmidt said:

:I stand here today in the same shoes, though with a slightly higher heel, as thousands of Members who have taken the same oath before me. I am mindful of what is expected of me both by this hallowed institution and the hundreds of thousands of Americans I am blessed to represent. I am the lowest-ranking Member of this body, the very bottom rung of the ladder; and I am privileged to hold that title. . .

:I pledge to walk in the shoes of my colleagues and refrain from name-calling or the questioning of character. It is easy to quickly sink to the lowest form of political debate. Harsh words often lead to headlines, but walking this path is not a victimless crime. This great House pays the price.

:So at this moment, I begin my tenure in this Chamber, uncertain of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green with only a desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&amp;page=H7658&amp;position=all Maiden Speech by the Honorable Jean Schmidt] September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Environment
Schmidt has called for reducing America's dependence on foreign [[oil]] by increasing use of [[ethanol]] and drilling in [[Alaska]]'s [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. Schmidt told ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'' &quot;What's really important is to adopt an [[environmental policy]] that advances the American economy and national security. I supported the energy bill recently passed by the U.S. House that will expand the use of alternative energy sources and additives like ethanol.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hackett calls for an Ohio River cleanup|last=Lyle|first=Troy|work=Cincinnati Post |date=01 July 2005: |page=10.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[League of Conservation Voters]], a [[political action committee]] advocating for environmental concerns, gave Jean Schmidt a lifetime average of 6 on a scale of 0 to 100. In 2005, she was rated at 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcv.org/images/client/pdfs/LCV_2006_Scorecard_final.pdf|title=National Environmental Scorecard|year=National Environmental Scorecard|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Taxes and spending
Schmidt supported the tax cuts championed by President [[George W. Bush]]. Schmidt called for additional changes to the [[Internal Revenue Code]], such as adopting a [[flat tax]] and repealing the [[estate tax|estate]] and [[capital gains tax]]es. Schmidt also professed to be a [[fiscal conservative]]. A mailing sent to voters listed four examples of &quot;wasteful spending in Washington,&quot; which included &quot;$45,000 to buy gold plated [[playing cards]] for [[Air Force Two]]!&quot; and &quot;$1.2 million to study the breeding habits of a [[woodchuck]]!&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

;Abortion
Schmidt is strongly [[pro-life]]. When she launched her candidacy, she was president of the [[Right-to-Life]] of Greater Cincinnati.&lt;ref name=CRTL/&gt; At the Chatfield College debate, Schmidt said ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' was &quot;a flawed law made by [[judicial activism|activist judges]]&quot; and would &quot;love to see&quot; it reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debate shows sharp divide|last=Horstman|first=Barry M.|work= Cincinnati Post |date=8 July 2005|page=12.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt mailed literature to voters with an endorsement from Paula Westwood, executive director of the Cincinnati right-to-life:
:Jean's legislative experience is invaluable to Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati's efforts and goals for the coming years. But more importantly, she has a tenacious devotion to the sanctity of human life from [[Conception (biology)|conception]] to natural death already demonstrated in her political and private life.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

;Iraq War
Schmidt made the [[Iraq War]] an issue in the race. She declared on [[WCET-TV]]'s ''Forum'' that &quot;[[9/11]] was a wakeup call. We lost our innocence&quot; and praised the [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush foreign policy]]. &quot;The foundation of democracy that has been planted in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]&quot;, she said, has inspired reforms in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} At the Chatfield College debate on July 7, she said of [[Iraq]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] &quot;We have toppled a [[terrorist]] regime, a terrorist madman who now sits in a prison cell.

Schmidt appeared in public with a button in her lapel containing a photograph of [[Matt Maupin]], who was at the time the only [[prisoner of war]] of the Iraq campaign who had not been freed and who was a native of Clermont County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marathon veteran captures House race|last=Sewell|first=Dan|work=Ocala Star - Banner|location=Ocala, Fla|date=08 Aug 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== &quot;Coward&quot; remarks ===
On November 18, 2005, the House debated a Republican-sponsored resolution, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.+Res.+572: H. Res. 572], calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq. It was prompted by the call of [[John Murtha|John P. Murtha, Jr.]], a Democrat from [[Pennsylvania]], who introduced H.J. Res. 73, which called for the redeployment of American forces as soon as possible. In response, [[U.S. House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]] chairman [[Duncan Hunter|Duncan L. Hunter]] of [[California]] introduced H. Res. 572, which the Republican leadership admitted was intended to demonstrate that calls for troop withdrawal were &quot;out of the mainstream.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Democrats in turn roundly criticized the Hunter resolution as a sham that misstated Murtha's position.

During debate on adopting the rule for debating the resolution, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.+Res.+563: H. Res. 563], Schmidt said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yesterday I stood at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] attending the funeral of a young [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine]] in my district. He believed in what we were doing is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Danny Bubp]], Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the [[Ohio House|House of Representatives]]. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body â€” that we will see this through.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=aAYV5H4rsqs|title=Jean Schmidt cuts and runs, John Murtha doesn't}} October 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schmidt's remarks threw the House into an uproar and earned her the sobriquet &quot;Mean Jean&quot;. Many Democrats saw it as an unwarranted attack against Murtha, a 38-year Marine Corps veteran. After she said &quot;cowards cut and run, Marines never do,&quot; angry Democrats nearly drowned out her words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress wages nasty war debate ; GOP forces House to vote on pullout; Democrats call it a ploy|last=Sidoti|first=Liz|work=Columbian |location=Vancouver, Wash|date=19 Nov 2005|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vic Snyder|Victor F. Snyder]], a former Marine, of [[Arkansas]] demanded that Schmidt's remarks be &quot;taken down.&quot; Under this disciplinary procedure, the House clerk would have re-read Schmidt's words and the presiding officer (at the time, [[Mike Simpson|Michael K. Simpson]] of [[Idaho]]) would have ruled whether they were [[unparliamentary language|parliamentary]].  Had they been ruled unparliamentary, Schmidt would not have been able to speak for the rest of the day without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/guide/congress/glossary/wordtake.htm|title=Words Taken Down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 10 minutes, Schmidt asked for and received permission to withdraw her remarks and apologized to Murtha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&amp;page=H10969&amp;position=all Congressional Record] November 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokeswoman for Bubp said that the state representative &quot;did not mention Congressman Murtha by name nor did he mean to disparage Congressman Murtha&quot; and that he felt &quot;the words that Congresswoman Schmidt chose did not represent their conversation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawmaker Returns Home, A Hawk Turned War Foe|last=Cloud|first=David S. |work=New York Times |date=22 Nov 2005|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' reported Bubp said &quot;he never mentioned. . . Murtha&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. by name when talking with Schmidt, and he would never call a fellow Marine a coward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schmidt regrets Murtha comment|last=Collins|first=Michael|work=Cincinnati Post |date=23 Nov 2005|page=1.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fake endorsements ===
On March 8, 2006, ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' reported Representatives [[Tom Tancredo]] of [[Colorado]] and [[Steve Chabot]] of Ohio stated they had not endorsed Schmidt even though Schmidt's campaign site claimed they had. Chabot later said he had endorsed both Schmidt and her primary opponent. Schmidt also claimed an endorsement from the [[Family Research Council]], which was repudiated by the organization. After a review, the Ohio Elections Commission found that the Tancredo and Family Research Council endorsement claims were false but did not warrant any reprimand.&lt;ref name=&quot;reprimand&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060428/NEWS01/604280402/1077 | title=Schmidt gets reprimand: 'False statements' cited | publisher=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]] | date=April 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}

=== Second bachelor's degree ===
[[WLW-AM]] reported on March 28, 2006, that Schmidt had, since 1989, claimed a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[secondary education]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]] awarded in 1986. Schmidt had previously listed two degrees on candidate guides, her official Ohio House bio, and past campaign websites.  But after her election to Congress, neither her current official or campaign website had the second degree posted. Schmidt's chief of staff, Barry Bennett, told ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' Schmidt had completed the requirements for the degree but never filed the paperwork to be awarded a diploma. &quot;I think it's fair to say that she earned it and never collected it,&quot; Bennett said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/weblogs/openers/?/mtlogs/cleve_openers/archives/2006_03.html Jean Schmidt's shifting bio (with update)] March 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, five days before the May 2 primary against McEwen, the [[Ohio Elections Commission]] voted 7-0 to issue Schmidt a public reprimand for &quot;false statements&quot; for her claiming to have a second undergraduate degree from the [[University of Cincinnati]] that she was not awarded. The Commission wrote in its [[letter of reprimand]] that Schmidt had &quot;reckless disregard for truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=reprimand/&gt;

Schmidt insisted the error regarding her degrees was a mistake by her staff. On May 1, the day before the election, Schmidt appeared on Bill Cunninham's show on [[WLW-AM]] in Cincinnati and was asked by a caller about the OEC reprimand. Schmidt repeated her insistence the error was caused by the designer of her website incorrectly listing her teaching certificate as a degree in secondary education and [[social studies]].{{cn|date=November 2012}}

At the Voice of America Tea Party on September 5, 2009, Schmidt, in response to a woman who said that Obama &quot;cannot be a president by our constitution,&quot; replied, &quot;I agree with you, but the courts don't.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YshG_Ok8idc YouTube video showing Rep. Jean Schmidt (R-OH) talking to a woman at the Voice of America Tea Party] September 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schmidt's statement to the woman appeared to contradict a statement Schmidt made in July 2009 to Loveland Magazine in which she said that &quot;The President is indeed a Citizen of this country&quot; and that she &quot;voted as a Member of the House to certify the vote of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] electing him as our President.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovelandmagazine.com/2009/07/jean-schmidt-not-a-birther.html Jean Schmidt Not a Birther] July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ssuchronicle.com/media/storage/paper1252/news/2009/10/14/Opinion/Jean-Schmidt.Must.Go-3804594.shtml |title=Jean Schmidt Must Go |publisher=The (Shawnee State) University Chronicle |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &quot;Obamacare&quot; ruling ===
On June 28, 2012, a video was captured of Schmidt believing reports from [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] that the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in the landmark [[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]] ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanforward.msnbc.com/_news/2012/06/28/12465373-matthews-pokes-fun-at-gopers-who-thought-mandate-was-overturned?lite Hardball Sideshow - Matthews pokes fun at GOPers who thought mandate was overturned] June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Armenian Genocide issue ===
In 2009 Armenian-American candidate [[David Krikorian]] targeted the congresswoman for her failure to publicly define what happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915â€“1916 as &quot;the [[Armenian Genocide]].&quot; His concern arose from a statement released by Schmidt's office noting that &quot;at this time she [Schmidt] does not have enough information to characterize these deaths as genocide especially since those responsible are long since dead.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A few days before the 2008 congressional election, Krikorian published a controversial letter alleging that &quot;Jean Schmidt has taken $30,000 in blood money from Turkish government sponsored political action committees to deny the slaughter of 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children by the Ottoman Turkish Government during World War I.&quot; Finally, the flier asserted that the claims it contained could be adequately verified by a visit to the Federal Election Commission's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=16146966396 |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated the claim to the Ohio Elections Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Candidate defends claims|last=Majors|first=Stephen|work=Journal - Gazette|location=Ft. Wayne, Ind|date=02 Oct 2009|page=C.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ohio Elections Commission issued a split decision on the case, failing to find that all of the preceding three remarks had been published in violation of ORC 3517.21(B)(10) by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;asbarez1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/71401/ohio-commission-issues-convoluted-split-decision-on-schmidt-v-krikorian-case/ |title=Ohio Commission Issues Convoluted Split-Decision on Schmidt v. Krikorian Case |publisher=Asbarez Armenian News |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of 4 panel votes, Commissioners affirmed that Turkish American funds are a primary source of support for Rep. Schmidtâ€™s political campaign, but chided Krikorian for statements related to Turkish Government funding of his opponent, because such a funding would be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taldf.com/ohio_100209.html |title=Turkish American Legal Defense Fund Declares Legislative Victory in Sacramento |publisher=Turkish American Legal Defense Fund |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The votes were taken after a panel decision to disregard testimony provided regarding the Armenian &quot;Genocide&quot; and its &quot;denial&quot; â€“ an integral component of the allegations and Krikorianâ€™s defense â€”decision which was criticized by David Krikorian's party and supporters. Schmidt also attempted, to no avail, to press criminal charges against Krikorian for his statements.&lt;ref name=&quot;asbarez1&quot;/&gt; Sibyl Edmonds, a former FBI translator, testified on behalf of Krikorian during the Ohio Elections Commission hearing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/10/panel-rules-against-challenger.html |title=Panel Rules Against Challenger in &quot;Blood Money&quot; Speech Dispute Against Lawmaker Backed By Turkish Interests - OpenSecrets Blog |publisher=OpenSecrets |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke about Turkey's connections to Jean Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyradar.com/beltwayblips/story/sibel_edmonds_deposition_video_and_transcript_released/ |title=Sibel Edmonds' Deposition: Video And Transcript Released - Jean Schmidt, Congress |publisher=Daily Radar |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, a federal court rejected David Krikorian's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20101021/NEWS0108/10220345/Krikorian-loses-election-suit |title=Krikorian loses election suit |publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Jean Schmidt filed a 6.8 million dollar lawsuit against David Krikorian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brunsman|first=Barrett J. |title=Schmidt creating trust fund for legal expenses |publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=2010-07-30 |url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20100721/NEWS0108/7220343/Schmidt-creating-lawsuit-fund |archivedate=2010-07-30 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rc3RP4PM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taldf.com/ohio_71210.html |title=Congresswoman Schmidt Sues Former Opponent for Defamation, Retains TALDF |publisher=Taldf.com |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[United States House Committee on Ethics|House Ethics Committee]] announced that it was investigating accusations that Schmidt had accepted roughly $500,000 in free legal services from a Turkish-American interest group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/us/02brfs-HOUSEETHICSP_BRF.html |title=House Ethics Panel Confirms Two Investigations |publisher=The New York Times |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0711/Meeks_Schmidt_under_investigation_by_ethics_investigators.html |title=Meeks, Schmidt under scrutiny by ethics investigators |publisher=POLITICO |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt said that she hadn't received a bill for the legal services in question, and that she had been waiting for more than a year for guidance from the ethics committee on the proper procedure to pay the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ethics committee investigating Jean Schmidt |work =The Cincinnati Enquirer |date= July 1, 2011|first=Malia |last=Rulon |url=http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/AB/20110701/NEWS0108/307010028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the Ethics Committee rendered its decision, holding that the interest group's payment for legal services in connection with her proceedings against Krikorian had been improper, and ordering Schmidt to repay the group $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lipton| first = Eric  | title = Ethics Panel Takes Action in 3 Cases| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = A12| date = August 6, 2011| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/06/us/politics/06ethics.html?_r=3| accessdate = 2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2011, the [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] added Schmidt to its &quot;most corrupt&quot; list for &quot;accept[ing] hundreds of thousands of dollars in free legal services from lawyers hired by an interest group that appreciated her legislative assistance&quot; as well as &quot;fail[ure] to report the free legal services as gifts in her disclosure forms.&quot;[http://www.citizensforethics.org/mostcorrupt/entry/Jean-Schmidt-report] In October 2011, CREW requested that the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] investigate whether Schmidt lied to the House Ethics Committee regarding inquiries into free legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_49/CREW-Requests-Schmidt-Investigation-209808-1.html?pos=hbtxt |title=CREW Requests Schmidt Investigation |publisher=[[Roll Call]] |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
