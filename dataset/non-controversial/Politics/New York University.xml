'''New York University''' ('''NYU''') is a [[private university|private]], [[nonsectarian]] American [[research university]] based in [[New York City]]. NYU's main campus is situated in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Lower Manhattan]]. Founded in 1831, NYU is one of the largest private [[nonprofit institution]]s of American [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schools&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/about.html | title= About NYU | publisher = New York University | accessdate = 2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU is organized into 18 schools, colleges, and institutes,&lt;ref name=&quot;schools&quot;/&gt; located in six centers throughout [[Manhattan]] and [[Downtown Brooklyn]], as well as more than a dozen other sites across the world, with plans for further expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;abu dhabi&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first = Jane | last = Timm | url=http://nyunews.com/news/2010/09/13/13abudhabi/|title=NYU Abu Dhabi: the story from concept to classroom | date = September 13, 2010 | publisher = nyunews.com | accessdate = 2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2011-01/21/c_13701018.htm | title= NYU to open 1st American campus in Shanghai | publisher = xinhuane news| accessdate = 2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://as.nyu.edu/page/NYUDC | title= NYU &gt; A&amp;S &gt; NYU-DC Center | publisher = New York University | accessdate = 2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Institute of International Education]], NYU sends more students to study abroad than any other US college or university, and the [[College Board]] reports more online searches by international students for &quot;NYU&quot; than for any other university.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU overseas&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = NYU Opens Academic Center In Washington, DC | year = 2012 | publisher = NYU | url = http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2012/09/24/nyu-opens-academic-center-in-washington-dc.html | accessdate = 2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of New York University}}
[[File:Albert Gallatin 3.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Albert Gallatin]]]]
[[Albert Gallatin]], Secretary of Treasury under [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], declared his intention to establish &quot;in this immense and fast-growing city ... a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously opened to all&quot;. A three-day long &quot;literary and scientific convention&quot; held in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] in 1830 and attended by over 100 delegates debated the terms of a plan for a new university. These New Yorkers believed the city needed a university designed for young men who would be admitted based on merit, not birthright, status or social class. On April 18, 1831, an institution was established, with the support of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city's landed class of [[merchant]]s, [[banker]]s, and [[trader (finance)|trader]]s. Albert Gallatin was elected as the institution's first president. On April 21, 1831, the new institution received its [[charter]] and was incorporated as the University of the City of New York by the [[New York State Legislature]]; older documents often refer to it by that name. The university has been popularly known as New York University since its beginning and was officially renamed New York University in 1896. In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms of four-story Clinton Hall, situated near [[New York City Hall|City Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;archives1&quot;/&gt; In 1835, the [[NYU School of Law|School of Law]], NYU's first professional school, was established. Although the impetus to found a new school was partly a reaction by [[evangelical]] [[Presbyterian]]s to what they perceived as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalianism]] of [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]],&lt;ref name=gotham&gt;{{cite gotham}} pp. 531-532&lt;/ref&gt; NYU was created [[non-denominational]], unlike many American colleges at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;archives1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Friss | first = Evan J. | title = Window into the Past: NYU in Retrospect | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/thenandnow/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nyuuniheights.jpg|thumb|left|The University Heights campus, now home to the [[Bronx Community College]]]]

Whereas NYU had its [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] campus since its founding, the university purchased a campus at [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] in [[the Bronx]] because of overcrowding on the old campus. NYU also had a desire to follow New York City's development further uptown. NYU's move to the Bronx occurred in 1894, spearheaded by the efforts of Chancellor [[Henry Mitchell MacCracken]].&lt;ref name=&quot;archives1&quot;/&gt; The University Heights campus was far more spacious than its predecessor was. As a result, most of the university's operations along with the undergraduate [[NYU College of Arts and Science|College of Arts and Science]] and School of Engineering were housed there. NYU's administrative operations were moved to the new campus, but the graduate schools of the university remained at Washington Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/heights.htm |title=175 Facts About NYU |publisher=NYU.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Washington Square College was founded as the downtown undergraduate college of NYU. In 1935, NYU opened the &quot;Nassau College-Hofstra Memorial of New York University at Hempstead, Long Island&quot;. This extension would later become a fully independent [[Hofstra University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hofstra.edu/alumni/support/devcc/devcc_growth.html | title = Capital Campaign | publisher = Hofstra University | accessdate = 2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, financial crisis gripped the New York City government and the troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = NYU and the Village: History | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url =http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/collections/exhibits/bobst/washsq/history/history.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU President [[James McNaughton Hester]] negotiated the sale of the University Heights campus to the [[City University of New York]], which occurred in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chronopoulos|first=Themis|title=&quot;Urban Decline and the Withdrawal of New York University from University Heights, The Bronx.&quot; The Bronx County Historical Society Journal XLVI (Spring/Fall 2009): 4-24.|url=http://themis.slass.org/university-heights.html|accessdate=6/12/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale of the Bronx campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President [[John Brademas]],&lt;ref&gt;Laura Turegano. &quot;Fundraising Beyond U.S. Borders - NYU: A Success Story&quot;. ''onPhilantrophy'', December 13, 2001. http://www.onphilanthropy.com/prof_inter/pi2001-12-13a.html&lt;/ref&gt; NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Kenneth R. | last = Weiss | title = NYU Earns Respect | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 22, 2000 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/financial.aid/latimes2000-03-22.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, but ended up being completed in 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DE1F3BF933A15750C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title= Buying Excellence: How N.Y.U.

===University logo===
The university logo, the upheld torch, is derived from the [[Statue of Liberty]], signifying NYU's service to the city of New York. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;facultyhandbook&quot;/&gt;

===Cultural setting===
[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and Greenwich Village have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], the first chair of Painting and Sculpture at NYU, and [[Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The University rented out studio space and residential apartments within the &quot;academic&quot; building.) Artists and [[intellectual]]s, including [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Herman Melville]], and [[Walt Whitman]], have contributed to the artistic scene encompassing NYU. As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;/&gt;

In the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;/&gt; Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;/&gt; In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the New York University art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html Grey Art Gallery art collection] Retrieved March 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/ The Grey Art Gallery] Retrieved March 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of New York University}}
Most of NYU's buildings are located across a roughly {{convert|229|acre|m2|sing=on}} area bounded by [[Houston Street]] to the south, [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] to the east, [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] to the north, and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas) to the west. The core of NYU consists of buildings that surround [[Washington Square Park]].

With approximately 12,500 residents, NYU has the seventh-largest university housing system in the U.S. as of 2007, and one of the largest among private schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;housingranking&quot;/&gt;

===Washington Square campus===
Since the late 1970s, the central part of NYU has been its Washington Square campus in the heart of [[Greenwich Village]]. The [[Washington Square Arch]] is an unofficial symbol of NYU. Until 2007, NYU had held its commencement ceremonies in Washington Square Park, but moved the ceremonies to [[Yankee Stadium]] in 2008 because of renovations to Washington Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commencement ceremony |publisher=NYU |url=http://www.nyu.edu/commencement/ceremony.html |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Main buildingNYU.JPG|thumb|The [[Silver Center]] c. 1900]]
In the 1990s, NYU became a &quot;two square&quot; university by building a second community around [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], in close proximity to Washington Square. NYU's Union Square community primarily consists of the priority residence halls of Carlyle Court, [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]] Residence Hall, Alumni Hall, Coral Tower, Thirteenth Street Hall, University Hall, Third North Residence Hall, and Founders Hall.

NYU operates theaters and performance facilities that are often used by the university's [[music conservatory]] and [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. External productions are also occasionally held in NYU's facilities. The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the [[Skirball Center for Performing Arts]] (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of Washington Square South, and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center. Recently, the Skirball Center hosted important speeches on foreign policy by [[John Kerry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Speech at New York University | publisher = GlobalSecurity.org | date = April 20, 2004 | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/09/iraq-040920-kerry01.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al Gore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Former Vice President Al Gore Remarks to MoveOn.org | publisher = MoveOn.org | date = August 7, 2003 | url = http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the recording of the [[The Apprentice (US season 3)|third season finale of The Apprentice]]. The Skirball Center is the largest performing arts facility south of [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Skirball Center for the Performing Arts | publisher = NYU Office for University Development and Alumni Relations | url = http://www.nyu.edu/kimmel/perf_arts.shtml | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for University Life, NYU | publisher = Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates LLC - Architects | url = http://www.krjda.com/text/projectDetail.cfm?id=100 | accessdate = 2007-07-15}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bobst Library====
{{Main|Elmer Holmes Bobst Library}}
[[File:NYU's Bobst library-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A view of the interior of Bobst]]
The Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, built between 1967 and 1972, is the largest library at NYU and one of the largest academic libraries in the United States. Designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]], the 12-story, {{convert|425000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} structure sits on the southern edge of Washington Square Park (at 70 Washington Square South) and is the flagship of an eight-library, 4.5 million-volume system. Bobst Library offers one Multidisciplinary Reference Center, a Research Commons, 28 miles of open-stacks shelving, and approximately 2,000 seats for student study. The library is visited by more than 6,800 users each day, and circulates more than one million books annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = About the NYU Libraries | work = | publisher = NYU Libraries | month = June | year = 2007 | url = http://library.nyu.edu/about/about.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobst's Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media is one of the world's largest academic media centers, where students and researchers use more than 95,000 audio and video recordings per year. The Digital Studio offers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty and student projects and promotes and supports access to digital resources for teaching, learning, research and arts events.

Bobst Library is also home to significant special collections. The Fales Collection houses one of the finest collections of English and American fiction in the United States, the unique Downtown Collection, documenting the New York literary avante-garde arts scene from the 1970s to the present, and the Food and Cookery Collection, which documents American food history with a focus on New York City. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, one of the finest collections in the world for scholarly research in labor history, socialism, anarchism, communism, and American radicalism.

Since the early 2000s (decade), NYU has developed new facilities on and around its Washington Square Campus. The Kimmel Center for University Life was built in 2003 to serve as the primary location for the university's student services offices. The center also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner &amp; Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb Student Center. The School of Law built Furman Hall in 2004, incorporating elements of two historic buildings into the new facade, one of which was occupied by poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Albert | last = Amateau | title = N.Y.U. opens new building for law school | newspaper = [[The Villager]] | volume = 73 | issue = 37 | date = January 14–20, 2004 | url = http://www.thevillager.com/villager_37/nyuopensnew.html | accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, NYU announced the development of a new life science facility on [[Waverly Place]]. The facility is the first NYU science building developed since the opening of Meyer Hall in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Lincoln | last = Anderson | title = N.Y.U. to use Waverly buildings for its new life sciences center | newspaper = [[The Villager]] | volume = 74 | issue = 28 | date = November 17–22, 2004 | url = http://www.thevillager.com/villager_81/nyutousewaverly.html | accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, NYU announced plans to build a 26-floor, {{convert|190000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} residence hall on 12th Street. The residence hall, named &quot;Founders Hall&quot;, accommodates approximately 700 undergraduates and contains a host of other student facilities. It is currently the tallest building in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Liz | last = Skalka | url = http://nyunews.com/2005/11/08/9/ | title = New dorm coming in 2009: 26-story residence hall to be built on 12th Street | newspaper = [[Washington Square News]] | date = November 8, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polytechnic Institute (Brooklyn)===

[[File:First Free Congregational Poly jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|NYU Poly]] is located in New York City's borough of [[Brooklyn]].]] The [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]], often referred to as Polytechnic Institute of NYU, NYU Polytechnic, NYU-Poly, or New York University School of Engineering and Technology,&lt;ref&gt;http://post.jagran.com/sam-pitroda-to-give-inaugural-address-at-nyu-engineering-school-1337055643&lt;/ref&gt; is located in [[Downtown Brooklyn]]. Founded in 1854, the institute adopted the [[History of European research universities|European polytechnic university model]], and its laboratory instruction at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to close cooperation with the industry. It is one of the oldest private technology institutes in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poly.edu/about/|title=About Poly|publisher=Polytechnic University of NYU|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has made contributions in the fields of electrical engineering, polymer chemistry, aerospace, and microwave engineering. It is located in the [[MetroTech Center]], the nation's largest urban university-industry [[science and technology park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State of the Planet 2002|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sop2002/bios/sopbio_bugliarello.html|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU-Poly operates several on-campus and off-campus business incubators and is known for its success in the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poly.edu/business/incubators&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com&quot;&gt;http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-04-24/news/31392907_1_applied-sciences-nyc-initiative-iit-mumbai-ibm-and-cisco&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[New York City Economic Development Corporation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com&quot;/&gt; NYU-Poly has state-of-the-art facilities including a brand new library and new facilities for its electrical engineering, computer science and computer engineering programs.

In [[Sterling Forest, New York|Sterling Forest]], near Tuxedo, New York, NYU has a research facility that contains institutes, in particular the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine. The Midtown Center at 11 West 42nd Street and the [[Woolworth Building]] in the financial district are home to NYU's continuing education programs.

NYU has two units located on the [[Upper East Side]]. The [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]], a discrete entity within New York University, independent of any other school or department of the university, is located on East 84th St, while the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]], a graduate school of art history and fine arts, is located at the James B. Duke Building at 1 East 78th St.

Tisch School of the Arts, Asia was NYU's first branch campus abroad. The result of a partnership between [[Tisch School of the Arts]] and the Singapore Government, it offered Master of Fine Arts degrees in animation and digital arts, dramatic writing, film and international media producing. The campus opened in fall 2007 with the intention to enroll approximately 250 students.&lt;ref&gt;

In the Fall of 2010, [[NYU Abu Dhabi]] (NYUAD) opened as the University's first overseas &quot;Portal Campus&quot; with an inaugural class of 150 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nyuad.nyu.edu/ | publisher = New York University Abu Dhabi | title=NYU Abu Dhabi University &amp; College in UAE, New York University | accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the University's other study abroad centers, NYUAD functions as a separate liberal arts college within a University, offering complete degree programs to students admitted directly to NYUAD. NYUAD recruits students from all over the world and describes itself as the &quot;World's Honor College&quot;. The main campus for NYUAD is under construction on Saadiyat Island and is scheduled to open in 2014. Until then the school operates from a campus located in downtown Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/education/21nyu.html | publisher = New York Times | date = June 20, 2010 | title=N.Y.U.

It was announced in 2011 that NYU planned to open another portal campus, [[New York University Shanghai]], for the fall semester of 2013. It was set to have about 3,000 undergraduate students, the majority of whom would be [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. It was approved by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = China's Education Ministry Approves NYU Portal Campus in Shanghai | publisher = NYU Local | date = January 21, 2011 | url = http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2011/01/21/chinas-education-ministry-approves-nyu-portal-campus-in-shanghai/ | accessdate = 2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU's local partner will be [[East China Normal University]]. ECNU's president Yu Lizhong will be the chancellor and play a major role in government relations while [[Jeffrey S. Lehman]], former president of [[Cornell]] amongst other positions, will serve as vice chancellor and have &quot;free rein in academic affairs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hennock, Mary, [http://chronicle.com/article/New-Leader-of-NYU-Shanghai-Has/131730/ &quot;New Leader of NYU Shanghai Has Built Other Bridges to China&quot;], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', April 29, 2012. Retrieved 2012-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU has a host of foreign facilities used for [[study abroad]] programs, referred to as Global Academic Centers. As of 2012, NYU operates 14 academic sites – both degree-granting research university campuses and study abroad sites – in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America, including undergraduate academic-year and summer study abroad programs in [[New York City|New York]], [[Florence]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Berlin]], [[Accra]], [[Madrid]], [[Shanghai]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Sydney]] and [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers1.html | publisher = New York University | title = Global Academic Centers | accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU overseas&quot; /&gt; One of the most noteworthy is the {{convert|57|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus of NYU Florence [[Villa LaPietra]] in Italy, bequeathed by the late Sir [[Harold Acton]] to NYU in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = NYU marks years of successful restoration at La Pietra| volume = 16 | issue = 1 | newspaper = NYU Today| date = September 5, 2002 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/16/01/Stories/LaPietra.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU also has international houses on campus, including the Deutsches Haus, [[La Maison Française]], [[Casa Italiana Zerilli Marimò]], the Glucksman Ireland House, the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, the Hagop Kevorkian Center, an Africa House and a China House.

NYU was the founding member of the [[League of World Universities]], an [[international]] organization consisting of [[Rector (academia)|rectors]] and [[University president|president]]s from [[urban area|urban]] [[universities]] across six continents. The league and its 47 representatives gather every two years to discuss global issues in [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = League of World Universities meets for forum | publisher = [[Minnesota Daily]] | date = October 2, 2002 | url = http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2002/10/02/33504 | accessdate = 2007-10-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.

===Sustainability===
New York University has made the greening of its campus a large priority. For example, NYU has been the largest university purchaser of wind energy in the U.S. since 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU&quot; &gt;Sustainability&gt;About Sustainability&gt;Fast Facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web

With this switch to renewable power, NYU is achieving benefits equivalent to removing 12,000 cars from the road or planting 72,000 trees. In May 2008, the NYU Sustainability Task Force awarded $150,000 in grants to 23 projects that would focus research and efforts toward energy, food, landscape, outreach, procurement, transportation and waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;At New York University, green is the new violet &quot;&gt;{{cite web

These projects include a student-led bike-sharing program modeled after Paris' Velib program with 30 bikes free to students, staff, and faculty. NYU received a grade of &quot;B&quot; on the College Sustainability Report Card 2010 from the Sustainable Endowments Institute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web

NYU purchased 118 million [[kilowatt-hours]] of [[wind power]] during the 2006–2007 academic year – the largest purchase of wind power by any university in the country and any institution in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreenBiz.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title = NYU, Ivy Leagues Top Schools for Green Power | publisher = GreenBiz.com| date = April 19, 2007 | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=34925 | accessdate = 2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2007, the university expanded its purchase of wind power to 132 million kilowatt-hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU buys more wind power credit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title = NYU buys more wind power credit | publisher = Washington Square News | date = November 15, 2007 | url = http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/11/15/UniversityNews/Nyu-Buys.More.Wind.Power.Credit-3103146.shtml | accessdate = 2008-07-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] ranked NYU as one of the greenest colleges in the country in its annual College &amp; University Green Power Challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU Office of Public Affairs&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = NYU to Purchase Wind-Generated Power As Part of New Sustainability Initiative | publisher = NYU Office of Public Affairs | date = October 5, 2006 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/1235 | accessdate = 2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence halls===
{{Main|New York University residence halls}}
[[File:Washington Square Village.jpg|thumb|left|[[Washington Square Village]], home to NYU faculty and graduate students]]

With approximately 12,500 residents, NYU has the seventh-largest university housing system in the U.S. as of 2007, and one of the largest among private schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;housingranking&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Top Ten Residence Hall Systems | publisher = [[University of Michigan]] Housing | url = http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070305034155/http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html |archivedate = March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU's undergraduate housing system consists of 21 buildings. Uniquely, many of NYU's residence halls are converted [[apartment]] complexes or old hotels. In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens, lavatories, living rooms and common areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Turley | first = Meredith | title = New York University: Off the Record | publisher = [[College Prowler]] | date = July 1, 2006 | isbn = 978-1-4274-0102-1 | page = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university operates its own transit system to transport its students by [[bus]] to its campus.

Undergraduate students are guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU. Most freshman residence halls are located near the Washington Square area. While nearly all of the residence halls that primarily house sophomores are located near the [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] area, two former residence halls were located in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and one is still in use in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]]. All of NYU's residence halls are governed by the [[Residence hall association|Inter-Residence Hall Council]] (IRHC), an umbrella student council organization.

In 2007, the [[National Association of College and University Residence Halls]] named NYU the National School of the Year for IRHC and [[NRHH]]'s strong efforts over the past year. In addition, NYU was named the National Program of the Year for UltraViolet Live, the annual inter-hall competition that raises funds for [[Relay For Life]].

===Admissions and enrollment===
NYU has a large, diverse student population representing all 50 states and more than 130 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU fast facts 2012&quot; /&gt; About 25–30% of NYU's incoming freshmen are from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, while the remaining 70–75% are from outside the [[Tri-State Region|Tri-State area]]. 10% of the students are from one of New York City's [[the five boroughs|five boroughs]]. NYU's main [[feeder schools]] reflect a heavy Northeastern U.S. presence, and particularly a strong New York City influence. Among NYU's top feeder schools are prestigious high schools including [[Stuyvesant High School]], [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], [[Bronx High School of Science]], and several top private schools in the northeast.

Out of the 42,242 applicants for the undergraduate class of 2015, around 30% were offered admission (when including admission statistics for the Liberal Studies Program). Out of the acceptances, 38% consisted of [[early decision]] applicants, who together form 23% of the undergraduate class. 4,650 freshmen joined NYU in Fall 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyu facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = NYU Facts| publisher = New York University| url = http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/fast-facts.html| accessdate = 2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, NYU achieved a record low admission rate of 24% of applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Admission rate drops to 24%, lowest in years| work=[[Washington Square News]]|date = April 2, 2008|url=http://www.nyunews.com/2008/04/02/11/|accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle 50% of [[SAT]] scores for the class of 2015 was 630–730 for critical reading, 650–750 for math, and 660–750 for writing. The middle 50% of [[ACT (test)|ACT]] scores for the class of 2015 was between 29 and 31. The average GPA corresponds with an A-range letter grade, and most incoming students were in the top 10% of their class.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyu facts&quot;/&gt;

On June 21, 2010, NYU announced the profile of the first freshman class of [[New York University Abu Dhabi|NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD)]], which calls itself the &quot;World's Honors College&quot;. The class includes 150 students, 36% of whom are from the United States. The average SAT score was 1470 and the acceptance rate was 2.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Redden |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-06-21-IHE-NYU-Abu-Dhabi21_ST_N.htm?csp=34news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+usatoday-NewsTopStories+(News+-+Top+Stories) |title=NYU admits first class for its new Abu Dhabi campus |work=USA Today|date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a quest to find talented individuals from around the world and become a truly global university, New York University signed an agreement to accept high-performing students from the [[University of the People]] who are eligible to apply to New York University's Abu Dhabi campus. The Abu Dhabi campus is able to grant generous financial aid, enabling those students who are eligible, albeit disadvantaged financially, to attend the highly selective NYU Abu Dhabi campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/education/09nyu.html?_r=3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=university%20of%20the%20people&amp;st=cse |title=Partnership to Further Global Quest by N.Y.U |work=NY Times |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the admissions process, some institutions at NYU are relatively more selective than others in certain categories, depending on the institution's educational goals. For example, NYU's Abu Dhabi program focuses more than other schools at NYU on students who have demonstrated a history of leadership, whereas NYU's Tisch School of the Arts focuses more on artistic and creative traits than do other schools at NYU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = N.Y.U.

New York University has successfully completed a seven-year, $2.5 billion campaign, surpassing expectations by raising more than $3 billion over the seven-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Masterson | first = Kathryn | year = 2008 | url = http://chronicle.com/news/article/5430/nyu-sets-record-with-31-billion-campaign | title = NYU Sets Record With $3.1-Billion Campaign| accessdate = 2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Started in 2001, this campaign was the university's largest in its history, in which they planned to &quot;raise $1 million per day for [[scholarships]] and [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]], faculty building, new academic initiatives, and enhancing NYU's physical facilities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;campaignnews&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckman | first = John | title = New York University Kick Off $2.5 Billion Fundraising Campaign | publisher = NYU Office Public Affairs | date = April 28, 2004 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/publicaffairs/newsreleases/b_nyu_campaign_09282004.shtml | accessdate = 2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign included a $50 million gift from the Tisch family (after which one building and the [[Tisch School of the Arts|art school]] are named) and a $60 million gift from six [[trustee]]s called &quot;The Partners Fund&quot;, aimed at hiring new faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;campaignnews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;campaign&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = The Campaign for NYU | publisher = NYU Office for University Development &amp; Alumni Relations | url = http://campaign.nyu.edu/ | accessdate = 2007-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070822075608/http://campaign.nyu.edu/ |archivedate = August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, 2007 the university announced that the Silver family donated $50 million to the [[NYU School of Social Work|School of Social Work]], which will be renamed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = NYU Alumni Constance &amp; Martin Silver Donate $50 Million to University's School of Social Work | publisher = NYU Office Public Affairs | date = October 15, 2007 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/1790 | accessdate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the largest donation ever to a school of social work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Scott | last = Jaschik | title = Quick Takes | publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = October 17, 2007 | url = http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/10/17/qt | accessdate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007–2008 academic year was the most successful fundraising year to date for NYU, with the school raising $698 million in only the first 11 months of the year, representing a 70% increase in donations from the prior year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Souccar | first = Miriam | year = 2008 | url = http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080801/FREE/659182051/1046/toc | title = Local universities report banner fundraising years | accessdate = 2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University also recently announced plans for NYU's Call to Action, a new initiative to ask alumni and donors to support financial aid for students at NYU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Platt | first = Eric | year = 2008 | url = http://nyunews.com/news/university/over_seven_years%252C_nyu_rakes_in_3_billion | title = Over seven years, NYU rakes in $3 billion| accessdate = 2008-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has announced a 25-year strategic development plan, scheduled to coincide with its [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] in 2031. Included in the &quot;NYU 200&quot; plans are increasing resident and academic space, hiring additional exemplary faculty, and involving the New York City community in a transparent planning process. Additionally, NYU hopes to make their buildings more environmentally friendly, which will be facilitated by an evaluation of all campus spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Portlock | first = Sarah | title = NYU unveils 25-year plan | newspaper = [[Washington Square News]] | date = April 24, 2007 | url = http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/04/24/News/Nyu-Unveils.25Year.Plan-2876454.shtml | accessdate = 2007-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070822173414/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/04/24/News/Nyu-Unveils.25Year.Plan-2876454.shtml |archivedate = August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of this plan, NYU purchased 118 million [[kilowatt-hours]] of [[wind power]] during the 2006–2007 academic year – the largest purchase of wind power by any university in the country and any institution in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreenBiz.com&quot;/&gt; For 2007, the university expanded its purchase of wind power to 132 million kilowatt-hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU buys more wind power credit&quot;/&gt; As a result, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] ranked NYU as one of the greenest college in the country in its annual College &amp; University Green Power Challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU Office of Public Affairs&quot;/&gt;

==Student life==

===Student government===
The [[Student Senators Council]] is the [[students' union|governing student body]] at NYU. The SSC has been involved in controversial debates on campus, including a campuswide ban on the sale of [[Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola products]] in 2005, and the [[Graduate Student Organizing Committee]] unionization in 2001 and subsequent strike in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Coca-Cola given ultimatum | first = Barbara | last = Leonard | url = http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2005/11/04/NewscampusNews/CocaCola.Given.Ultimatum-2387167.shtml | newspaper = [[Washington Square News]] | date = November 4, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-10-12 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_04/b3968078.htm | title = How NYU Chose Colombia over Coke | first = Elizabeth | last = Woyke | newspaper = [[Business Week]] | date = January 23, 2006| accessdate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = A Big Breakthrough for T.A.

===Student organizations===
[[File:NYU Program Board Logo.png|thumb|NYU Program Board logo]]
[[File:NYU Thomas SLF235 30620 on Shuttle Route A.jpg|thumb|A bus system transports students to and from the far ends of campus.]]
NYU has over 450 student clubs and organizations on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = New York University:Housing &amp; Campus Life | year = 2007 | publisher = [[College Board]] | url = http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=3186&amp;profileId=8 | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the sports teams, fraternities, sororities, and study clubs, there are many organizations on campus that focus on entertainment, arts, and culture. These organizations include various [[student newspaper|student media]] clubs: for instance, the daily [[student newspaper]] the ''[[Washington Square News]]'', the [[NYU Local]] daily blog, ''[[The Plague (magazine)|The Plague]]'' comedy magazine, and the literary journals ''Washington Square Review'' and ''The Minetta Review'', as well as student-run event producers such as the NYU Program Board and the Inter-Residence Hall Council. It also operates [[radio station]] [[WNYU-FM]] 89.1 with a diverse [[college radio]] format, transmitting to the entire [[New York metropolitan area]] from the original campus, and via booster station WNYU-FM1 which fills in the signal in [[lower Manhattan]] from atop one of the Silver Towers, next to the [[American football field|football field]] at the Washington Square campus.

During the University Heights era, an apparent rift evolved with some organizations distancing themselves from students from the downtown schools. The exclusive [[Philomathean Society at New York University|Philomathean Society]] operated from 1832 to 1888 (formally giving way in 1907 and reconstituted into the Andiron Club). Included among the Andiron's regulations was &quot;Rule No.11: Have no relations save the most casual and informal kind with the downtown schools&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Guide to the Andiron Club of New York City | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://dlib.nyu.edu/eadapp/transform?source=archives/andiron.xml&amp;style=archives/archives.xsl | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Eucleian Society]], rival to the Philomathean Society, was founded in 1832. The Knights of the Lamp was a social organization founded in 1914 at the School of Commerce. This organization met every full moon and had a glowworm as its mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = A Window Into the Past: NYU in Retrospect | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/thenandnow/leisure.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Dragon Society]], founded in 1898, is thought to be the most selective society at NYU. In addition, NYU's first [[yearbook]] was formed by fraternities and &quot;secret societies&quot; at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 175 Facts About NYU | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/test/175/pages/year.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York University has traditions which have persisted across campuses. Since the beginning of the 20th century initiation ceremonies have welcomed incoming NYU freshmen. At the Bronx University Heights Campus, seniors used to grab unsuspecting freshmen, take them to a horse-watering trough, and then dunk them head-first into what was known colloquially as &quot;the Fountain of Knowledge&quot;. This underground initiation took place until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Friss | first = Evan | title = Chronicles: A Look at NYU's Past | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | newspaper = NYU Today | date = September 13, 2004 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/18/01/Stories/chronicles-18-01.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today freshmen take part in university-sponsored activities during what is called &quot;Welcome Week&quot;. In addition, throughout the year the university traditionally holds Apple Fest (an apple-themed country fest that began at the University Heights campus), the Violet Ball (a dance in the atrium of Bobst Library), Strawberry Fest (featuring New York City's longest [[Shortcake|Strawberry Shortcake]]), and the semi-annual [[midnight breakfast]] where Student Affairs administrators serve free breakfast to students before [[final examination|finals]].

===Greek life===
Some of the first [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] in the country were formed at NYU.&lt;ref name=&quot;psiupsilon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alphaepsilonpi&quot;/&gt; [[Fraternities and Sororities|Greek life]] first formed on the NYU campus in 1837 when [[Psi Upsilon]] chartered its Delta Chapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;psiupsilon&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Psi Upsilon History | year = 2006 | publisher = Psi Upsilon Fraternity | url = http://www.psiu.org/fr/history.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070414185849/http://www.psiu.org/fr/history.html |archivedate = April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first fraternities at NYU were social ones. With their athletic, professional, intellectual, and service activities, later groups sought to attract students who also formed other groups. Since then, Greek letter organizations have proliferated to include 25 social fraternities and sororities. Approximately 7% of NYU students choose to join fraternities or sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = New York University: Campus Life | work = US News &amp; World Report | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2007-12-28 | url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_2785_brief.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four governing boards oversee Greek life at the university. The Interfraternity Council (IFC) has jurisdiction over all twelve recognized fraternities on campus. Eight sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Panhellenic Council (PhC), which features six national sororities (ΔΦΈ, ΑΈΦ, ΆΣΤ, ΠΒΦ, KKΓ and ZTA) and two local sororities (ΆΦΖ and ΘΦΒ). Five multicultural organizations maintain membership in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), including two fraternities and three sororities. All three of the aforementioned boards are managed under the auspices of the Inter-Greek Council.

Greek organizations have historical significance at NYU.

Delta Phi is also the oldest continuously active fraternity in the United States, being the only organization in the original Union Triad to remain active since its institute. The NYU Gamma chapter of [[Zeta Beta Tau]] is the oldest active ZBT chapter in the country.

[[File:NYU Hockey.jpg|thumb|An NYU Men's Hockey player]]
While NYU has had [[All-American]] football players, the school has not had a varsity [[American football|football]] team since 1952. Notable football players include Hall of Fame [[Ken Strong]] (1956) and [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]] (1934), the model for the [[Heisman Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Heisman Trophy | publisher = CSTV Networks, Inc. and Heisman.com. | year = 2007 | url = http://www.heisman.com/history/heisman-trophy.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940 season, before a football game between NYU and [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]], students protested against the &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot; to exclude [[African-American|black]] athletes (at [[University of Missouri|Missouri's]] request).

[[File:NYU volleyball.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Men's Volleyball in [[Coles Sports and Recreation Center|Coles Sports Center]]]]
NYU, within its brief history in NCAA Division III, has won two national team championships and many league championships. In 1997, the Women's Basketball team, led by head coach Janice Quinn, won a national championship over the [[University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire]] and in 2007 returned to the Final Four. NYU Men's Basketball and head coach [[Joe Nesci]] appeared in the Division III National Championship game in 1994. In 2006, the Men's Cross Country team finished 2nd at the NCAA Championship. The following year, behind the emotional support of Dan Schwartzman, the Men's Cross Country team won the 2007 NCAA National Cross Country Championship at St. Olaf College in Minnesota.&lt;!-- Cite results: http://www.raceberryjam.com/archives/ncmencc07.html --&gt;

NYU Men's and Women's Swimming teams captured consecutive (2004–2005) [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC) Division III Swimming and Diving Championships. Christian Majdick of the Men's Track and Field team captured the NCAA Division III championship for the triple jump in 2003. Lauren Henkel, a track and field athlete and the current assistant coach of the Women's Track and Field team, acquired [[All-American]] status three times for High Jump.
The Men's Soccer team won its league ECAC championship in the 2005–2006 season.

The Men's Ice Hockey team participates in the ACHA (DII) and is in the SECHL. During the 2003–2004 season, the Ice Hockey team finished second (2nd) in the nation, losing to [[Oakland University]] of Michigan.

NYU students also compete in club and intramural sports, including [[badminton]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[equestrianism]], [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[rugby football]], [[softball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[martial arts]], [[tennis]], [[triathlon]], and [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]]. The [[Coles Sports and Recreation Center]] serves as the home base of several of NYU's intercollegiate athletic teams. Many of NYU's varsity teams play their games at various facilities and fields throughout Manhattan because of the scarcity of space for playing fields near campus. In 2002, NYU opened the [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]] Athletic Facility as the second on-campus recreational facility. In the same year, NYU's intramural dance team won the National Championship title at the National Dance Alliance (NDA) Division III competition in Daytona, Florida.

Since 1885, the most spirited undergraduate class has been awarded &quot;The Bun&quot;. The award consisted of a bun enclosed in a long casket-like enclosure made of silver. The Bun was taken three times: in 1921, 1971, and 1981. The award was last returned in 2002 and currently resides in the [[Silver Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 175 Facts About NYU | work = | publisher = [[New York University Archives]] | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/bun.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film and literature==
NYU is often portrayed in a variety of television shows, motion pictures, literature, and other media. Fictional NYU students and faculty include [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer's]] intern Darren in ''[[Seinfeld]]'', who helps him run &quot;Kramerica Industries&quot;; a student reporter in a different episode of Seinfeld who interviews [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]]; Theo Huxtable ([[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]]) from ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', who graduates from NYU in the series finale; [[Ross Geller]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) from ''[[Friends]]'', who becomes an NYU professor in Season 6; Character Tom Collins from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', who taught there; Bud Fox ([[Charlie Sheen]]) in the movie ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987); Finch ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]) from the ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' films; Paul Tannek ([[Jason Biggs]]) in ''[[Loser (film)|Loser]]'' (2000); Alex Foreman ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) in ''[[In Good Company (2004 film)|In Good Company]]'' (2005); Jack Campbell ([[Nicolas Cage]]) in ''[[The Family Man]]'' (2000); Clark Kellogg ([[Matthew Broderick]]) in ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]'' (1990); Justin Cobb ([[Lou Taylor Pucci]]) in the film version of ''[[Thumbsucker (film)|Thumbsucker]]'' (2005), who secretly applies and is accepted to NYU; the songwriter Albert Peterson in the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' who promises his sweetheart Rosie to start studying at NYU and become an English teacher; and the characters [[Blair Waldorf]], [[Dan Humphrey]], [[Vanessa Abrams]] and [[Georgina Sparks]] in ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]''.

In addition, the [[Campus of New York University|campus of NYU]] has been the backdrop for various pieces of fiction: [[Grace Adler]]'s office in Will &amp; Grace is portrayed in the show as being in the [[Puck Building]], home to NYU's Wagner School; [[Henry James]]' novel ''[[Washington Square (novel)|Washington Square]]'' is set around the NYU area; and ''[[Rose of Washington Square]]'' (1939), ''[[13 Washington Square]]'' (1928), ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'' (1989), ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' (2007), ''[[August Rush]]'' (2007), ''[[Remember Me (2010 film)|Remember Me]]'' (2010), ''[[Step Up 3-D]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (2010) are centered around the NYU campus. In [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[Animated film|animated feature]] ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz The Cat]]'' (1972), the dormitory that Fritz burns down is clearly supposed to be NYU's Weinstein Hall, located at 5-11 University Place near the northeast corner of [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]]. The [[Warner Brothers]] show ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' was set at the &quot;University of New York&quot;, clearly modeled after NYU; and NYU's old University Heights Campus in the Bronx provided the scenery for ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1999), ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' (2001), ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]'' (2002), ''[[Mona Lisa Smile]]'' (2003), and ''[[Step Up 3D]]'' (2010). NYU is also featured in the TV show ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''.
