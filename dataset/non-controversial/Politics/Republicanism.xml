'''Republicanism''' is the [[ideology]] of governing a [[nation]] as a [[republic]], where the [[head of state]] is appointed by means other than [[heredity]], often through elections. The exact meaning of republicanism varies depending on the cultural and historical context. The term &quot;republic&quot; may indicate 'rule by many people and by law', as opposed to monarchy, or arbitrary rule by one person. By this definition, [[dictatorial]] states are not republics, whereas, according to some such as [[Kant]], [[constitutional monarchies]] may be. Kant preferred republicanism to pure [[democracy]], on the grounds that the latter may be the unrestricted rule of the majority, unrestrained by law.

==Historical development of republicanism==
===Antique antecedents===
{{Main|Classical republicanism}}

====Ancient Greece====
In [[Ancient Greece]], several [[philosophers]] and [[historians]] analysed and described [[classical republicanism]]. Some scholars have translated the Greek concept of &quot;[[politeia]]&quot; as &quot;republic,&quot; but most modern scholars reject this idea. There is no single written expression or definition from this era that exactly corresponds with a modern understanding of the term &quot;republic.&quot; However, most of the essential features of the modern definition are present in the works of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Polybius]]. These include theories of [[mixed government]] and of [[civic virtue]]. Plato's dialogue on the ideal state, [[Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], is misnamed by the standards of modern political theory. 

A number of Ancient Greek states such as [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] have been classified as [[classical republic]]s, though this uses a definition of republic that was not developed until much later. Plato considered [[Carthage]] to have been a republic as it had a political system similar to that of the Greek cities.

====Ancient Rome====
Both [[Livy]] (in Latin, living in [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]]' time) and [[Plutarch]] (in Greek, a century later), described how Rome had developed its legislation, notably the transition from a ''kingdom'' to a ''republic'', by following the example of the Greeks. Some of this history, composed more than 500 years after the events, with scant written sources to rely on, may be fictitious reconstruction - nonetheless the influence of Greek ideas on governance is evident in the organisation of the [[Roman Republic]].

The Greek historian [[Polybius]], writing more than a century before Livy, became one of the first to describe the emergence of the [[Roman Empire]]. Polybius exerted a great influence on [[Cicero]] as he wrote his politico-philosophical works in the 1st century BC. In one of these works, ''[[De re publica]]'', Cicero linked the Roman concept of ''res publica'' to the Greek ''politeia&quot;. 

However, the modern term &quot;republic&quot;, despite its derivation, is not synonymous with the Roman ''[[res publica]]''. Among the several meanings of the term ''res publica'', it is most often translated &quot;republic&quot; where the Latin expression refers to the Roman state, and its form of government, between the era of the Kings and the era of the Emperors. This Roman Republic would, by a modern understanding of the word, still be defined as a true republic, even if not coinciding entirely. Thus, although [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers saw the Roman Republic as an ideal system, it included no systematic [[separation of powers]], and depended on [[slave labor]].

Romans still called their state &quot;Res Publica&quot; in the era of the early emperors. Because, on the surface, the organization of the state had been preserved by the first emperors without significant alteration. Several offices from the republican era, held by individuals, were combined under the control of a single person. These changes became permanent, and gradually conferred sovereignty on the Emperor.

Cicero's description of the ideal state, in ''De re publica'', does not equate to a modern day &quot;republic&quot;; it is more like [[enlightened absolutism]]. His philosophical works were influential when Enlightenment philosophers such as [[Voltaire]] developed their political concepts. 

In its classical meaning, a republic was any established governed political community. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw three types of government: [[democracy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[monarchy]]. However, [[mixed government]] was considered ideal. First Plato and Aristotle, and then Polybius and Cicero, developed the notion that the ideal republic is a mixture of these three forms of government. The writers of the Renaissance embraced this notion.

Cicero expressed reservations concerning the republican form of government. In his ''theoretical'' works he defended monarchy, or at least a mixed monarchy/oligarchy and, in his own political life, he generally opposed men trying to realise such ideals, like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Mark Antony]] and [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Eventually, that opposition led to his death and Cicero can be seen as a victim of his own republican ideals.

[[Tacitus]], a contemporary of Plutarch, was not concerned with whether a form of government could be analysed as a &quot;republic&quot; or a &quot;monarchy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;see for example ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann]]''. IV, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; He analyzed how the powers accumulated by the early [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] were all given by a State that was still notionally a republic. Nor was the Roman Republic &quot;forced&quot; to give away these powers: it did so freely and reasonably, certainly in [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]]' case, because of his many services to the state, freeing it from [[civil war]]s and disorder.

Tacitus was one of the first to ask whether such powers were given to the head of state, because the citizens wanted to give them, or whether they were given for other reasons (for example, because one had a [[imperial cult|deified ancestor]]). The latter case led more easily to abuses of power. In Tacitus' opinion, the trend away from a true republic was ''irreversible'' only when [[Tiberius]] established power, shortly after Augustus' death in AD 14 (much later than most historians place the start of the Imperial form of government in Rome). By this time, too many principles defining some powers as &quot;untouchable&quot; had been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann]]''. I-VI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance republicanism===
In Europe, republicanism was revived in the late [[Middle Ages]] when a number of small states embraced a republican system of government. These were generally small, but wealthy, trading states in which the merchant class had risen to prominence. Haakonssen notes that by the Renaissance Europe was divided, such that those states controlled by a landed elite were monarchies, and those controlled by a commercial elite were republics. These included the Italian city states of [[Florence]] and [[Venice]] and members of the [[Hanseatic League]].

Building upon concepts of medieval [[feudalism]], [[Renaissance]] scholars used the ideas of the ancient world to advance their view of an ideal government. Thus the republicanism developed during the Renaissance is known as 'classical republicanism' because it relied on classical models. This terminology was developed by [[Zera Fink]] in the 1960s but some modern scholars, such as Brugger, consider it confuses the &quot;classical republic&quot; with the system of government used in the ancient world. 'Early modern republicanism' has been proposed as an alternative term. It is also sometimes called [[civic humanism]]. 

Beyond simply a non-monarchy, early modern thinkers conceived of an ''ideal'' republic, in which [[mixed government]] was an important element, and the notion that [[virtue]] and the [[common good]] were central to good government. Republicanism also developed its own distinct view of [[liberty]].

Renaissance authors that spoke highly of republics were rarely critical of monarchies. While [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' is the period's key work on republics, he also wrote ''[[The Prince]]'' on how best to run a monarchy. The early modern writers did not see the republican model as universally applicable; most thought that it could be successful only in very small and highly urbanized city-states. [[Jean Bodin]] in ''[[Six Books of the Commonwealth]]'' identified monarchy with republic.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

Classical writers like [[Tacitus]], and Renaissance writers like Machiavelli, tried to avoid an outspoken preference for one government system or another. Enlightenment philosophers, on the other hand, expressed a clear opinion. [[Thomas More]], writing before the Age of Enlightenment, was too outspoken for the reigning king's taste, even though he coded his political preferences in a [[Utopia]]n allegory.

In England a type of republicanism evolved that was not wholly opposed to monarchy; thinkers such as Thomas More and [[Sir Thomas Smith]] saw a monarchy, firmly constrained by law, as compatible with republicanism.

====Dutch Republic====
Anti-monarchism became more strident in the [[Dutch Republic]] during and after the [[Eighty Years' War]], which began in 1568. This anti-monarchism was more propaganda than a political philosophy; most of the anti-monarchist works appeared in the form of widely distributed [[pamphlet]]s. This evolved into a systematic critique of monarchy, written by men such as [[Johan Uytenhage de Mist]], [[Radboud Herman Scheel]], [[Lieven de Beaufort]] and the brothers [[Johan de la Court|Johan]] and [[Peter de la Court]]. These writers saw all monarchies as illegitimate tyrannies that were inherently corrupt. These authors were more concerned with preventing the position of [[Stadholder]] from evolving into a monarchy, than with attacking their former rulers. Dutch republicanism also influenced on French [[Huguenots]] during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. In the other states of early modern Europe republicanism was more moderate.

====Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth====
In the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] republicanism was an influential ideology. After the establishment of the Commonwealth of Two Nations, republicans supported the status quo, of having a very weak monarch, and opposed those who thought a stronger monarchy was needed. These mostly Polish republicans, such as [[Łukasz Górnicki]], [[Andrzej Wolan]], and [[Stanisław Konarski]], were well read in classical and Renaissance texts and firmly believed that their state was a republic on the Roman model, and started to call their state the [[Rzeczpospolita]]. Atypically, Polish-Lithuanian republicanism was not the ideology of the commercial class, but rather of the landed aristocracy, which would lose power if the monarchy were expanded. This resulted in an oligarchy of the great [[magnates]].

===Enlightenment republicanism===
{{Main|Classical republicanism}}

====England====
[[Oliver Cromwell]] set up a republic called the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649–1660) and ruled as a near dictator after the overthrow of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] was then a leading philosopher of republicanism. The collapse of the [[Commonwealth of England]] in 1660 and the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] discredited republicanism among England's ruling circles. However they welcomed the [[liberalism]], and emphasis on rights, of [[John Locke]], which played a major role in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. Even so, republicanism flourished in the &quot;country&quot; party of the early 18th century, which denounced the corruption of the &quot;court&quot; party, producing a political theory that heavily influenced the American colonists. In general the English ruling classes of the 18th century vehemently opposed republicanism, typified by the attacks on [[John Wilkes]], and especially on the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pocock 1975&quot;&gt;Pocock, J.G.A. ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition'' (1975; new ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

====French and Swiss thought====
French and Swiss Enlightenment thinkers, such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] and later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], expanded upon and altered the ideas of what an ideal republic should be: some of their new ideas were scarcely traceable to antiquity or the Renaissance thinkers. Concepts they contributed, or heavily elaborated, were [[social contract]], [[positive law]], and [[mixed government]]. They also borrowed from, and distinguished republicanism from, the ideas of [[liberalism]] that were developing at the same time.

Liberalism and republicanism  were frequently conflated during this period, because they were both opposed to absolute monarchy. Modern scholars see them as two distinct streams that both contributed to the democratic ideals of the modern world. An important distinction is that, while republicanism continued to stress the importance of [[civic virtue]] and the [[common good]], liberalism was based on economics and [[individualism]]. It is clearest in the matter of private property which, according to some, may be maintained only under protection of established [[positive law]].

[[Jules Ferry]], Prime Minister of France from 1880 to 1885, followed both these schools of thought and eventually enacted the [[Ferry Laws]] which were intended to overturn the [[Falloux Laws]], by embracing the anti-clerical thinking of the ''Philosophs''. These laws ended the Catholic Church's involvement with many government institutions in late 19th-century France, including schools.

===Republicanism in the United States ===
{{Main|Republicanism in the United States}}

In recent years a debate has developed over the role of republicanism in the [[American Revolution]] and in the British radicalism of the 18th century. For many decades the consensus was that liberalism, especially that of [[John Locke]], was paramount and that republicanism had a distinctly secondary role.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Vernon L. Parrington, ''Main Currents in American Thought'' (1927) online at [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/Parrington/vol1/bk03_01_ch02.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new interpretations were pioneered by [[J.G.A. Pocock]] who argued in ''[[The Machiavellian Moment]]'' (1975) that, at least in the early 18th century, republican ideas were just as important as liberal ones.  Pocock's view is now widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Shalhope (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bernard Bailyn]] and [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] pioneered the argument that the American founding fathers were more influenced by republicanism than they were by liberalism. Cornell University professor Isaac Kramnick, on the other hand, argues that Americans have always been highly individualistic and therefore Lockean.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Kramnick, ''Ideological Background,&quot; in Jack. P. Greene and J. R. Pole, ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of the American Revolution'' (1994) ch 9; Robert E. Shallhope, &quot;Republicanism&quot; ibid ch 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades before the American Revolution (1776), the intellectual and political leaders of the colonies studied history intently, looking for models of good government. They especially followed the development of republican ideas in England.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Colbourn, ''The Lamp of Experience: Whig History and the Intellectual Origins of the American Revolution'' (1965) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/Home3/Book.php?recordID=0009 online version]&lt;/ref&gt; Pocock explained the intellectual sources in America:&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, ''The Machiavellian Moment'' p 507&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Whig canon and the neo-Harringtonians, [[John Milton]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] and [[Algernon Sydney|Sidney]], [[John Trenchard (writer)|Trenchard]], [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Gordon]] and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], together with the Greek, Roman, and Renaissance masters of the tradition as far as [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], formed the authoritative literature of this culture; and its values and concepts were those with which we have grown familiar: a civic and patriot ideal in which the personality was founded in property, perfected in citizenship but perpetually threatened by corruption; government figuring paradoxically as the principal source of corruption and operating through such means as patronage, faction, standing armies (opposed to the ideal of the militia), established churches (opposed to the Puritan and deist modes of American religion) and the promotion of a monied interest — though the formulation of this last concept was somewhat hindered by the keen desire for readily available paper credit common in colonies of settlement. A neoclassical politics provided both the ethos of the elites and the rhetoric of the upwardly mobile, and accounts for the singular cultural and intellectual homogeneity of the Founding Fathers and their generation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The commitment of most Americans to these republican values made the [[American Revolution]] inevitable. Britain was increasingly seen as corrupt and hostile to republicanism, and as a threat to the established liberties the Americans enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, Bernard.'' The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leopold von Ranke]] in 1848 claimed that American republicanism played a crucial role in the development of European liberalism:&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Becker 2002, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By abandoning English constitutionalism and creating a new republic based on the rights of the individual, the North Americans introduced a new force in the world. Ideas spread most rapidly when they have found adequate concrete expression. Thus republicanism entered our Romanic/Germanic world.... Up to this point, the conviction had prevailed in Europe that monarchy best served the interests of the nation. Now the idea spread that the nation should govern itself. But only after a state had actually been formed on the basis of the theory of representation did the full significance of this idea become clear. All later revolutionary movements have this same goal…. This was the complete reversal of a principle. Until then, a king who ruled by the grace of God had been the center around which everything turned. Now the idea emerged that power should come from below.... These two principles are like two opposite poles, and it is the conflict between them that determines the course of the modern world. In Europe the conflict between them had not yet taken on concrete form; with the French Revolution it did.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Républicanisme''===
Republicanism, especially that of Rousseau, played a central role in the [[French Revolution]] and foreshadowed modern republicanism. The revolutionaries, after overthrowing the French monarchy in the 1790s, began by setting up a republic; Napoleon converted it into an Empire with a new aristocracy. In the 1830s [[Belgium]] adopted some of the innovations of the progressive political philosophers of the Enlightenment.

''Républicanisme'' is a [[France|French]] version of modern republicanism. It is a form of [[social contract]], deduced from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s idea of a [[general will]]. Ideally, each [[citizen]] is engaged in a direct relationship with the [[State (polity)|state]], removing the need for [[identity politics]] based on local, religious, or racial identification.

''Républicanisme'', in theory, makes anti-discrimination laws unnecessary, but some critics argue that [[Color blindness (race)|colour-blind law]]s serve to perpetuate discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;lnl&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Modern republicanism==
During the Enlightenment, anti-monarchism extended beyond the civic humanism of the Renaissance. Classical republicanism, still supported by philosophers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Montesquieu]], was only one of several theories seeking to limit the power of monarchies rather than directly opposing them. New forms of anti-monarchism, such as [[liberalism]] and later [[socialism]], quickly overtook [[classical republicanism]] as the leading republican ideologies. Republicanism gained support and monarchies were challenged throughout Europe.

===Radicalism===
{{Main|Radicalism (historical)}}

Radicalism arose in European states in the 19th century. All 19th century ''radicals'' supported a [[constitutional republic]] and [[universal suffrage]], while European ''liberals'' were at the time in favor of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[census suffrage]]. Most radical parties later favored [[economic liberalism]]  and [[capitalism]]. This distinction between radicalism and liberalism had not totally disappeared in the 20th century, although many radicals simply joined liberal parties. For example, the [[Radical Party of the Left]] in France or the (originally Italian) [[Transnational Radical Party]], which exist today, are more focussed on republicanism than on simple liberalism.

Liberalism, was represented in France by the [[Orleanist]]s who rallied to the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] only in the late 19th century, after the [[comte de Chambord]]'s 1883 death and the 1891 papal encyclical ''[[Rerum Novarum]]''. 

But the early [[Radical Party (France)|Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party]] in France, and [[Chartism]] in Britain, were closer to republicanism, and the [[left-wing]]. Radicalism remained close to republicanism in the 20th century, at least in France, where they governed several times with other left-wing parties (participating in both the [[Cartel des gauches]] coalitions as well as the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]).

Discredited after the [[Second World War]], French radicals split into a left-wing party &amp;ndash; the [[Radical Party of the Left]], an associate of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] &amp;ndash; and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party &quot;valoisien&quot;]], an associate party of the conservative [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) and its [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] predecessors. Italian radicals also maintained close links with republicanism, as well as with [[socialism]], with the [[Radical Party (Italy)|''Partito radicale'']] founded in 1955, which became the [[Transnational Radical Party]] in 1989.

===United States===
{{Main|Republicanism in the United States}}

Republicanism became the dominant political value of Americans during and after the [[American Revolution]]. The &quot;[[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]&quot; were strong advocates of republican values, especially [[Samuel Adams]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Shalhope, &quot;Toward a Republican Synthesis,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 29 (Jan. 1972), pp 49-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 20th century, the term republicanism is more likely to refer to the policies of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the nation's [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political party, than to republican values generally. 

===British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations===
In some countries of the [[British Empire]], later the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], republicanism taken a variety of forms.

In [[South Africa]], republicanism in the 1960s was identified with the supporters of [[apartheid]], who resented British interference in their treatment of the country's black population.

In [[Australia]], [[Republicanism in Australia|the debate]] between republicans and monarchists is still active and Julia Gillard, the current Australian Prime Minister, has expressed her wish for Australia to begin the transition phase to a republic on the death of Elizabeth II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10995425|publisher=[[BBC World]]|title=Australia's Gillard backs republic after Queen's death|date=17 August|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican groups are also active in [[Republicanism in Britain|Great Britain]], [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand]], and [[Republicanism in Canada|Canada]].

In [[Jamaica]], Prime Minister [[Portia Simpson-Miller]] announced during her inaugural address, that Jamaica would [[Republicanism in Jamaica|begin the process]] of becoming a republic.

In [[Barbados]] the government gave the promise of a referendum on becoming a republic in August 2008, but it was postponed due to the change of government in the 2008 election.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, a major promoter of republicanism is the [[Swedish Republican Association]], which advocates the abolition of the [[Monarchy of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repf.se/in-english The Swedish Republican Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
There is a renewed interest in republicanism in [[Spain]] after two earlier attempts: the [[First Spanish Republic]] (1873-1874) and the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931-1939). Movements such as [[Ciudadanos Por la República]] have emerged, and parties like [[United Left (Spain)]] and the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] increasingly refer to republicanism. In a survey conducted in 2007 reported that 69% of the population prefer the monarchy to continue, compared with 22% opting for a Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/reportajes/Rey/bien/gracias/elpepusocdmg/20071230elpdmgrep_10/Tes ''¿El Rey? Muy bien, gracias'' en www.elpais.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 survey, 57.9% of Spanish citizens were indifferent, 16.2% favored a Republic, 15.7% were monarchists, and 7% claimed to be ''Juancarlistas'' (supporters of continued monarchy under King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], without a common position for the fate of the monarchy after his death).&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-pesimo.blogspot.com/2008/08/encuesta-sigma-dos-el-mundo-que-hemos_15.html ''‘Indiferentes’ ante la Corona o la República'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-republicanism===
Prominent theorists in this movement are [[Philip Pettit]] and [[Cass Sunstein]], who have each written several works defining republicanism and how it differs from liberalism. [[Michael Sandel]] is a late convert to republicanism from [[communitarianism]]. He advocates replacing or supplementing liberalism with republicanism, as outlined in his ''Democracy's Discontent: America in Search of a Public Philosophy.'' However, these theorists have had little impact on government. John W. Maynor, argues that [[Bill Clinton]] was interested in these notions and that he integrated some of them into his 1995 &quot;new social compact&quot; [[State of the Union Address]].{{fact|date=July 2012}}

This revival also has its critics. David Wootton, for instance, argues that throughout history the meanings of the term ''republicanism'' have been so diverse, and at times contradictory, that the term is all but meaningless and any attempt to build a cogent ideology based on it will fail.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

==Democracy==

[[Brunkeberg]] this evening.&quot; The writer's identity is unknown.]]

In the late 20th century there was convergence of democracy and republicanism. Republicanism is a system that replaces or accompanies inherited rule. There is an emphasis on liberty, and a rejection of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/ Republicanism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It strongly influenced [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] in the 1770s and 1790s, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pocock 1975&quot;/&gt;  Republicans, in these two examples, tended to reject inherited elites and aristocracies, but two questions were left open: whether a republic, in order to restrain unchecked majority rule, should have an unelected [[upper chamber]], with members perhaps being appointed meritorious experts, and whether it should have a [[constitutional monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood,  ''The Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conceptually separate from democracy, republicanism included the key principles of rule by the [[consent of the governed]] and sovereignty of the people. In effect republicanism held that kings and aristocracies were not the real rulers, but rather the whole people were. Exactly ''how'' the people were to rule was an issue of democracy &amp;ndash; republicanism itself did not specify how.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. R. Palmer]], ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: Political History of Europe and America, 1760-1800'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the solution was the creation of [[First Party System|political parties]] that reflected the votes of the people, and which controlled the government (see [[Republicanism in the United States]]). Many exponents of republicanism, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Paine]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]] were strong promoters of representative democracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} However, other supporters of republicanism, such as [[John Adams]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]], were more distrustful of majority rule and sought a government with more power for elites.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} There were similar debates in many other [[Democratization|democratizing]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Shalhope, &quot;Republicanism and Early American Historiography,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 39 (Apr. 1982), 334-356&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy and republic===
In contemporary usage, the term ''democracy'' refers to a government chosen by the people, whether it is direct or representative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/democracy democracy - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the term ''[[republic]]'' usually refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[president]], who serves for a limited term; in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies, with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic republic - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticized democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean [[direct democracy]]; [[James Madison]] argued,&lt;ref&gt;especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]]&lt;/ref&gt; that what distinguished a ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure. What was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,&lt;ref&gt;Novanglus, no. 7, 6 Mar. 1775&lt;/ref&gt; was that the government should be &quot;bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.&quot;

===Constitutional monarchs and upper chambers===
Some countries (such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Scandinavian countries, and Japan) turned powerful monarchs into constitutional ones with limited, or eventually merely symbolic, powers. Often the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system, whether or not they were replaced with democratic institutions (such as in the US, France, China, Iran, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Turkey and Egypt). In Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and some other countries the monarch, or its representative, is given supreme executive power, but by convention acts only on the advice of his or her ministers. Many nations had elite upper houses of legislatures, the members of which often had lifetime tenure, but eventually these houses lost power (as in Britain's [[House of Lords]]), or else became elective and remained powerful (as in the [[United States Senate]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mark McKenna, ''The Traditions of Australian Republicanism'' (1996) [http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/Pubs/rp/1995-96/96rp31.htm online version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; John W. Maynor, ''Republicanism in the Modern World.'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Summary of Pocock's influential ideas that traces the Machiavellian belief in and emphasis upon Greco-Roman ideals of unspecialized civic virtue and liberty from 15th century Florence through 17th century England and Scotland to 18th century America. Pocock argues that thinkers who shared these ideals tended to believe that the function of property was to maintain an individual's independence as a precondition of his virtue. Therefore they were disposed to attack the new commercial and financial regime that was beginning to develop.
