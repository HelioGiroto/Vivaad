[[Image:Exclave.svg|right|frame|(Fig. 2) C is an exclave of B, but not an enclave of A since it also shares a border with D]]

An '''enclave''' is a territory entirely surrounded by another territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exclave''' is a territory legally or politically attached to a territory with which it is not physically contiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exclave
|title=4 results for: exclave
|publisher=Dictionary.com
|accessdate=2007-01-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are two distinct concepts, although many entities fit both definitions.
In Fig. 1 at right, suppose that the darker shaded area (marked B and C) is part of the same political or territorial entity, for example a sovereign state, and that the lighter-shaded area marked A is another such entity. Then C is an exclave of B, and is also an enclave within A.  If C were independent it would be an enclave but not an exclave.
In Fig. 2 at right, C is again an exclave of B, but is not an enclave, because it has boundaries with more than one entity.

==Origin and usage==
The word ''enclave'' entered the [[English language|English]] [[jargon]] of [[diplomacy]] in 1868{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. It derives from [[French language|French]], which was then the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of lingua francas#French|List of lingua francas]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word enclave and a number of related words exist in French, Spanish and Portuguese with the meaning of &quot;surrounded, included, embedded, fixed&quot; and they all ultimately derive from the Latin &quot;clavus&quot; which had two related meanings.  One was &quot;nail&quot; (which is embedded and surrounded) and another was a knot in the wood (which is also embedded and surrounded).

The word exclave is a logical extension created three decades later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
Although the meanings of both words are close, an exclave may not necessarily be an enclave or vice versa. For example, [[Kaliningrad]], an exclave of [[Russia]], is not an enclave because it is surrounded not by one state, but by two: [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]]; it also borders the [[Baltic Sea]]. Conversely, [[Lesotho]] is an enclave in [[South Africa]], but it is not politically attached to anything else, meaning that it is not an exclave.

In [[United Kingdom|British]] administrative history, subnational enclaves were usually called '''detachments''' or '''detached parts'''. In [[England|English]] [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastic]] [[history]], subnational enclaves were known as '''peculiars''' (see also [[Royal Peculiar]]).

A country surrounded by another but having access to the sea is not considered to be an enclave, regardless of size. For this reason [[Portugal]] is not an enclave of [[Spain]], and [[The Gambia|Gambia]] is not an enclave of [[Senegal]].

===Usage in other fields===
In medicine, an ''exclave'' is a detached part of an organ, as of the pancreas, thyroid, or other gland.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Cooch-behar-enclaves-schematisch.png|thumb|right|[[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] created by the 1947 [[Partition of India]]]]

Enclaves may be created for a variety of [[historical]], [[political]] or [[geographical]] reasons. Some areas have been left as enclaves by changes in the course of a river.

Since living in an enclave can be very inconvenient and many agreements have to be found by both countries over mail addresses, power supply or passage rights, enclaves tend to be eliminated and many cases that existed before have now been removed. The governments of India and Bangladesh have been pressed to resolve the [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|complex system of enclaves along their border]] - persons in these enclaves have complained of being effectively stateless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/hope-for-indo-bangladesh-enclaves-132956 |title=Hope for Indo-Bangladesh enclaves |publisher=NDTV |date=12 September 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, India and Bangladesh signed a leasehold agreement regarding the [[Tin Bigha Corridor]].

Many exclaves today have an [[independence]] movement, especially if the exclave is far away from the mainland.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==True enclaves==
:''See [[List of enclaves and exclaves]].''
This refers to those territories where a country is sovereign, but which cannot be reached without entering one particular other country. One example was [[West Berlin]], before the reunification of [[Germany]], which was ''de facto'' a [[West Germany|West German]] exclave within [[East Germany]], and thus an East German enclave (many small West Berlin land areas, such as [[Steinst√ºcken]], were in turn separated from the main one, some by only a few meters). ''De jure'' all of Berlin was ruled by the four Allied powers; this meant that West Berlin could not send voting members to the German Parliament, and that its citizens were exempt from [[conscription]]; however, this was not accepted by the East German government or the [[Soviet Union]], which treated East Berlin as an integral part of East Germany.

Most of the enclaves now existing are to be found in Asia, with a handful in Africa and Europe.  While administrative enclaves are found frequently elsewhere, there are no nation-level enclaves in Australia or the Americas.

===Enclaved countries===
[[Image:LocationLesotho.png|frame|Position of Lesotho within South Africa]] Some enclaves are countries in their own right, completely surrounded by another one, and therefore not exclaves. Three such sovereign countries exist:
* The republic of [[San Marino]], an enclave in [[Italy]], though it historically claimed land to the [[Adriatic Sea]].
* [[Vatican City]], an enclave in the city of [[Rome]], Italy.
* The Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], an enclave in [[South Africa]].
The principality of [[Monaco]] is not an enclave, although it only borders on [[France]], because it also possesses a coastline and thus it is not completely surrounded by another country.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2011}}
Historically, the [[Black Homelands]] or [[Bantustans]] of South Africa existed under the Nationalist government from 1948 to 1994.  Most of these had their origins in the &quot;native reserves&quot; created under earlier British colonial administration.
In federal law of the [[USA]], the [[Indian Reservation]] system seems to act like &quot;Enclaved countries&quot; in most cases.
The same would apply for [[Indian Reserve]]s in Canada and [[Aboriginal Reserve]] in Australia{{Dubious|date=March 2012}}.
See also [[List of countries that border only one other country]].

===Temporary enclaves===

The [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]], at Camp Zeist near [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], was temporarily declared as sovereign territory of the [[United Kingdom]] under [[Scots law|Scottish law]] for the duration of the trial of those accused in the [[Lockerbie bombing]], and was therefore an exclave of the United Kingdom, and of [[Scotland]], and an enclave within the Netherlands.  It was also so during the appeal of the man convicted. The court was first convened in 1999, and the land returned to the Netherlands in 2002.

==Related constructs and terms==

===&quot;Practical&quot; enclaves and exclaves and inaccessible districts===
Some territories, attached to the motherland by a thin slice of land or territorial water, are more easily accessible by traveling through a foreign country. These territories may be called &quot;practical exclaves&quot; or &quot;pene-exclaves&quot; (example: the [[Northwest Angle]] between the United States and Canada, or the [[Spain|Spanish]] village of [[Os de Civ√≠s]], which can only be accessed through the independent [[Principality of Andorra|Andorra]] as it is virtually isolated from the rest of Spain by mountains.) American Lane ({{coord|41.09782|-73.722553|type:landmark_scale:10000|name=American Lane}}), in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], can be accessed only from [[New York State]], because it is separated by [[Interstate 684]] from the remainder of [[Connecticut]].

Conversely, a territory that is an exclave but does not function as one (instead functioning as a contiguous part of the main nation) is deemed a &quot;quasi-exclave&quot;.{{harv|Robinson|1959}}

===Subnational enclaves and exclaves===
Sometimes, administrative divisions of a country, for historical or practical reasons, caused some areas to belong to a division while being attached to another one.

* [[Jervis Bay Territory]] in Australia is a separate territory but is governed in some but not all administrative respects as an exclave of the [[Australian Capital Territory]].
* A strip around the southern edge of the [[Beecroft Peninsula]] in Australia is an exclave of the [[Australian Capital Territory]].  This area is on the northern side of [[Jervis Bay]], opposite the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] mentioned above. However, unlike the Jervis Bay Territory, the Beecroft Peninsula exclave forms part of the Australian Capital Territory for all purposes.  Within the exclave, the [[Point Perpendicular]] lighthouse and its grounds are an exclave of the State of [[New South Wales]].

* [[Dadra DNH|Dadra]], enclaved within the state of [[Gujarat]], part of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] in [[India]]
* [[Pondicherry]] District, of the Union Territory of Pondicherry (Puducherry), is made of 12 non-contiguous parts, many of them true enclaves entirely surrounded by the state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Before Pondicherry, along with the other territories of [[French India]], was absorbed into India in 1954, they were enclaved within the Union of India, and before that the [[British Raj]]. Also a legacy of the French colonial period, the [[Mahe district]] is made of 3 non-contiguous parts enclaved within the state of [[Kerala]].
* A portion of [[Ellis Island]] is an exclave of [[New York City]] within the boundaries of [[Jersey City]], and therefore of [[New York]] State within the boundaries of [[New Jersey]].
* The southern part of the [[Province of Venice]], Veneto, can be reached directly from the rest of the province only by boat. By land it can be reached only travelling through the [[Province of Padua]] because territorial continuity with the main part of the province exists only through some unconnected islands and islets.

* The city of [[Carter Lake, Iowa]] is separated from the rest of the state of [[Iowa]] by the [[Missouri river]] which changed course during a flood in 1877, cutting the city off from the rest of the state and leaving an [[oxbow lake]]. It is now only accessible through [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].
* The [[Counties of scotland#Counties until 1890|counties of Scotland]] before reorganisation in 1889 included dozens of exclaves.  This was especially notable in the case of [[Cromartyshire]], which was split into at least nine parts spread across [[Ross-shire]].

* There are several portions of land on the [[New Jersey]] side of the [[Delaware River]] belonging to [[Delaware]]. This is because within the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]], Delaware's border runs to the low-water mark across the river. This condition runs from approximately [[Claymont, Delaware]] and [[Logan Township, New Jersey]] to [[Augustine Beach, Delaware]] Otherwise, the state border with New Jersey is in the middle of the river and bay.
* [[San Colombano al Lambro]] is an exclave of the province of [[Milan]] at the junction beteween the [[Pavia]] and [[Lodi]] provinces. The exclave arose when the province of Lodi was carved out of the province of Milan, but a [[referendum]] in San Colombano indicated the locals' wish to stay in Milan. As a result, the commune is the only wine-producing area in the mostly urbanized province of Milan.

===Enclaves within enclaves===

It is possible for an enclave to be completely surrounded not by the main body of another country, but by an exclave of it.
*The Dutch municipality of [[Baarle-Nassau]] has seven exclaves in two exclaves of the Belgian municipality of [[Baarle-Hertog]].
*The [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|complex of enclaves]] at [[Cooch Behar district]] includes 24 second-order enclaves and one small '''third-order enclave''' called ''[[Dahala Khagrabari]]'': a piece of India within Bangladesh, within India, within Bangladesh.
* [[Nahwa]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]] is surrounded by [[Madha|an exclave of Oman]] within the U.A.E.
*The Portuguese town of [[Estremoz]] is made up of two civil parishes (''freguesias''):  the small ''Santo Andr√©'' and the big ''Santa Maria''. Santo Andr√© corresponds to the old town (located inside the medieval walls), but excluding the citadel, which is an enclave inside the old town; the citadel belongs to Santa Maria, which also includes the entire new town (outside the walls) and the vast rural area around it. Thus, Santa Maria has an enclave (Santo Andr√©, the old town) with a second-order enclave inside it (the citadel).&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Geogr√°fico do Ex√©rcito: [http://www.igeoe.pt/igeoearcweb/igeoesig/ExecCmd.asp?cmd=SelArea&amp;distrito=%C9VORA&amp;concelho=ESTREMOZ&amp;freguesia=ESTREMOZ%20%28SANTA%20MARIA%29 Territory of Santa Maria (Estremoz)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic enclaves===
An [[ethnic enclave]] is a community of an ethnic group inside an area in which another ethnic group predominates. [[Ghetto]]s, [[Little Italy]]s, [[barrio]]s and [[Chinatown]]s are examples. These areas may have a separate language, culture and economic system. [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] is arguably an ethnic enclave. It is a predominantly ethnic [[Armenia]]n area inside [[Azerbaijan]]. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] which lasted from 1988 to 1994 resulted in the area self-proclaiming its independence, but this has never been recognized by the international community, which tends to describe the current situation as a [[frozen conflict]].  The 2008 film ''[[Silent Light]]'' concerns a [[Mennonite]] Flemish sect living within the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]],   who speak a dialect called [[Plautdietsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Exclaves===
{{main|List of enclaves and exclaves}}
[[Image:Nakhichevan03.png|thumb|Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]]
[[Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]], which borders Turkey, Armenia and Iran, is an exclave of [[Azerbaijan]]. Additionally, Azerbaijan has three more small exclaves: [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]], [[Barkhudarli]] and [[Yukhari Askipara]] (together with [[A≈üaƒüƒ± ∆èskipara]]) which are all inside the territory of [[Armenia]].

[[Kaliningrad Oblast]] is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) situated on the Baltic coast.

[[B√ºsingen]] is a German exclave in Switzerland.

[[Campione d'Italia]] is an Italian exclave within Switzerland.

[[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] are Spanish exclaves within [[Morocco]].

===Extraterritoriality===
[[Embassies]] and military bases are usually exempted from the jurisdiction of the host country, i.e., the laws of the host nation in which an embassy is located do not typically apply to the land of the embassy or base itself. This exemption from the jurisdiction of the host country is defined as [[extraterritoriality]]. Areas of extraterritoriality are not true enclaves as they are still part of the host country. In addition to embassies, some other areas have extraterritoriality.

Examples of this include:
* [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] in [[France]], used by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]].
* [[United Nations headquarters]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], used by the [[United Nations]].
* [[INTERPOL]] headquarters in [[Lyon]], [[France]], used by [[INTERPOL]]
* [[NATO]] (political) headquarters near [[Evere]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], a part of the [[City of Brussels]], [[Belgium]].
* Headquarters [[Allied Command Operations]] ([[NATO]]) at the area designated as [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), North of [[Mons]], [[Belgium]]
* [[Palazzo Malta]], the headquarters of [[Knights Hospitaller#The modern Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta]] in Rome.
* [[Properties of the Holy See]].
* [[Moldauhafen]], a lot in the harbour of [[Hamburg]] leased for a period of 99 years to the [[Czech Republic]]
* [[Saimaa Canal]]: the part in Russia is leased by Finland. Russian law is in principle valid, but in reality Finland maintains the area.

===Land owned by a foreign country===
Some areas of land in a country are owned by another country and in some cases it has special privileges, such as being exempt from taxes. These lands are not enclaves and do not have extraterritoriality since, in all cases, there is no transfer of sovereignty.

Examples of this include:
* [[Napoleon]]'s original grave in [[Longwood, Saint Helena]], owned by [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domfrance.helanta.sh/ |title=domaines fran√ßais de Sainte-H√©l√®ne |publisher=Domfrance.helanta.sh |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National railway passing through foreign territory===

Changes in borders can make a railway that was previously located solely within a country traverse the new borders.  Since railways are much more expensive than roads to rebuild to avoid this problem, the criss-cross arrangement tends to last a long time.  With passenger trains this may mean that doors on carriages are locked and guarded to prevent illicit entry and exit while the train is temporarily in another country.

Borders can also be in the &quot;wrong&quot; place, forcing railways into difficult terrain.

====Border changes====

Examples include:
* [[Salzburg]] to [[Innsbruck]] ([[Austria]]) (passes [[Rosenheim]], [[Germany]]). A railway line within Austria exists as well, but trains take about 1.5 hours longer than across German territory.
* Trains from [[Neugersdorf]], [[Saxony]] to [[Zittau]] pass Czech territory at [[Varnsdorf]], while Czech trains from Varnsdorf to [[Chrastava]] pass through German territory at Zittau, and then a small part of [[Poland|Polish]] territory near the village of [[Poraj√≥w]].
* Trains from [[G√∂rlitz]] to [[Zittau]], [[Germany]], pass the border river [[Neisse]] several times (see [[Oder-Neisse line]]); the train station for [[Ostritz]], [[Germany]], lies in Krzewina Zgorzelecka, [[Poland]].
* [[Belgrade - Bar railway]] crosses into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for {{convert|9|km}}, between stations Zlatibor and Priboj (both in [[Serbia]]). There is one station, [[≈†trpci]], but there are no border crossing facilities and trains do not call at the station.
* The local trains on the [[Burgenlandbahn]] in Austria cross the area of Hungary at [[Sopron]]. During the era of the Iron Curtain, the trains had their doors locked as they traversed Hungarian territory.
* The line from [[Ventimiglia]] to [[Limone Piemonte]], [[Italy]], via [[Breil-sur-Roya]], [[France]].
* The [[Hochrheinbahn]] ([[Upper Rhine Railway]]) from [[Basel]] via [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]] to [[Schaffhausen]] is part of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] network, and is mostly in Germany, but the two ends are in Switzerland and it is only connected with the rest of the German railway network via Switzerland. At both Basel and Schaffhausen the railway has [[extraterritorial]] status, it is possible to travel by train to and from the rest of Germany without going through Swiss customs. See [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]].
* Similarly, during the [[Cold War]], underground lines in [[West Berlin]] ran under parts of [[East Berlin]].  [[Ghost station]]s ({{lang-de|Geisterbahnh√∂fe}}) were stations on [[Berlin]]'s [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] and [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] metro networks that were closed during this period of Berlin's division.
* The Belgian [[Vennbahn]] (now closed) lies on a narrow strip of Belgian territory running through Germany, creating five German exclaves.
* The railway between [[France]] and [[Monaco]] briefly leaves France to enter Monaco before entering France once more. This takes place underground for around 150 metres.
* The former Soviet Central Asian Republics have numerous examples.
* [[Semikhody]] - [[Chernihiv]] line of [[Ukraine]] passes through [[Belarus]] territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;RailwayGazette&quot;&gt;[[Railway Gazette International]] April 2008 p 240&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Druzhba (city)|Druzhba]] - [[Vorozhba]] line of [[Ukraine]] passes through [[Russia]]n territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;RailwayGazette&quot; /&gt;
* In 2009, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to transfer ownership of a crossborder section of line.
* [[Luƒçenec]] - [[Veƒæk√Ω Krt√≠≈°]] line in [[Slovakia]] passes through [[Hungary]] from [[Ipolytarn√≥c]] to [[N√≥gr√°dszak√°l]].

====Inconvenient borders====

[[File:Map Mauritania Railway.png|thumb|right|200py|map of the line]]

* One of the causes of [[World War II]] was the [[Polish Corridor]], which separated [[East Prussia]] from the rest of Germany.

* [[Bolivia]] is landlocked, and has no access to the sea, though a rail route could be devised via [[Peru]] or [[Chile]].

* Due to inability to agree on a shorter route through easy terrain in 1963, the iron ore railway in [[Railway stations in Mauritania|Mauritania]] originally had to use a longer route through a tunnel near [[Choum]] to avoid the territory of [[Spanish Sahara]].

* A similar problem may be occurring in [[Guinea]], where a 20&amp;nbsp;km long tunnel(s) through a hillspur at [[Naigaya]] {{convert|411.0|m}}, [[Sicourou]], [[Bokariadi]] and [[Feraya]] might be avoided by crossing the border into [[Sierra Leone]] at [[Yana, Sierra Leone|Yana]] {{convert|87.07|m}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude.nu/ |title=Find the elevation of any place |publisher=Altitude.nu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Senegal]] is practically divided in two by the sovereign territory of [[Gambia]] which is inconvenient. The easiest way to get from northern Senegal to the southern [[Casamance]] region is through Gambia via the [[Trans-Gambia Highway]], with a connecting ferry being the only way to cross the [[Gambia River]]. The fare for the ferry crossing is a source of contention between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4267846.stm | work=BBC News | title=Senegal may tunnel under Gambia | date=2005-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The shortest and straightest route for a proposed east-west high speed railway in Austria would pass under some mountains belonging to Germany.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

* In 2012, a [[Transport in Angola#Caminho de Ferro do Congo|railway route]] from Angola proper to the enclave of [[Cabinda]] has to cross not only the [[Congo River]] but territory of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

====Border shifts====

Also, borders have occasionally been shifted for the purpose of avoiding this sort of arrangement. The best-known example is the [[Gadsden Purchase]], in which the [[United States]] bought land from [[Mexico]] on which it was planned to build a southern route for the [[transcontinental railroad]]. Owing to the topography of the area, acquisition of the land was the only feasible way to construct such a railroad through the southern [[New Mexico Territory]].

===Highway of one state passing through another state's territory===
This arrangement is less common as highways are more easily re-aligned as noted above. Examples include:
* Various roads crossing the border back and forth between [[Irish republic|Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  The N54 in [[County Monaghan|County Monaghan, Ireland]] twice becomes the A3 in [[County Fermanagh|County Fermanagh, NI]], before continuing as the N54.  Similarly, The N53 in Monaghan passes through [[County Armagh|County Armagh, NI]] as the A37, before resuming as the N53 at the border between Monaghan and [[County Louth|County Louth, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;2006 Road Atlas Ireland, AA, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;  No national or county border signs are present.
*[[Congo Pedicle road]]: built to provide access for [[Zambia]]'s [[Luapula Province]] to the [[Copperbelt]] through {{convert|70|km}} of territory of the [[DR Congo]], requiring a change in [[driving on the left]] to driving on the right.
* Between 1963 and 2002 the N274 road from [[Roermond]] to [[Heerlen]], part of Dutch territory, passed through the German [[Selfkant]], which had been annexed by the [[Netherlands]] after the Second World War but returned to Germany in 1963.
* Road 402 between [[Podsabotin]] and [[Solkan]] in [[Slovenia]], built when Slovenia was a state of [[Yugoslavia]], passes through part of [[Italy]].  The road is confined by high concrete walls topped by fences; as Slovenia and Italy are now both signatories to the [[Schengen agreement]], the barriers are little more than historical curiosities.
* [[Interstate 684]], connecting various points in [[New York State]], passes through [[Connecticut]] near [[Kensico Reservoir]] and [[Westchester County Airport]], but is maintained entirely by New York State.  Motor vehicles cannot enter or exit to Connecticut roads, even though a portion of the highway is owned by Connecticut.  A portion of [[New York State Route 17]] passes through [[Pennsylvania]] but is maintained entirely by New York State.
* [[Minnesota State Highway 23]] passes through about {{convert|0.57|mi}} of [[Wisconsin]] just west of [[Duluth, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WI Hwys 20-29&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys20-29.html#MN-023 |title=Highways 20-29 |author=Bessert, Christopher J |work=Wisconsin Highways |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MN Hwys 1-25&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.steve-riner.com/mnhighways/r1-25.htm#23 |title=Details of Routes 1-25 |author=Riner, Steve |work=The Unofficial Minnesota Highways Page |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maintained by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]], it intersects only a few dead-end local roads while in Wisconsin.  No state line signs are present.&lt;ref name=&quot;WI Hwys 20-29&quot; /&gt;
* Hopkins Road north of [[Newark, Delaware]] briefly enters [[Pennsylvania]] where the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] meets the [[Mason-Dixon Line]]. The road is maintained by [[Delaware]] and it appears at one point Arc Point Road in Pennsylvania may have intersected here. Further east, Beaver Dam Road enters [[Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania]] at the intersection of Beaver Valley Road and re-enters Delaware about 0.5 miles later. The section of road in Pennsylvania is in rough shape and it is unclear who is supposed to maintain this stretch of road.
[[India]], a quasi-federal republic, has numerous such examples:
* The highway connecting [[Guwahati]] (capital of [[Assam]] state) to [[Silchar]] (a city in [[Barak valley]] of Assam) passes through [[Meghalaya]] state.
* One has to travel through part of [[West Bengal]] while travelling from [[Jamshedpur]] (Tatanagar), [[Jharkhand]] to few other cities of Jharkahand like [[Ranchi]] or [[Dhanbad]].
* [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], a city in [[Rajasthan]] surrounded by territory of [[Madhya Pradesh]], is connected to other parts of Rajasthan by roads passing through Madhya Pradesh.
* [[Gwalior]] (Madhya Pradesh) is connected to few other cities of Madhya Pradesh by highways passing through [[Uttar Pradesh]], covering the city of [[Jhansi]].

===Border infrastructure===
Several bridges cross the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Neisse]] between Germany and Poland.  To avoid needing to coordinate their efforts on a single bridge, the two [[riparian]] states assign each bridge to one or the other; thus Poland is responsible for ''all'' maintenance on some of the bridges, including the German side, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/ur_single/article/2008/03/8286/border_bridges_rebuilt.html Railway Gazette: Border bridges rebuilt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hallein Salt Mine]] crosses from [[Austria]] into [[Germany]].  Under an 1829 treaty Austria can dig under the then-Kingdom of [[Bavaria]].  In return some salt has to be given to Bavaria, and up to 99 of its citizens can be hired to work in the Austrian mine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rVwBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=hallein%2Btreaty%2B1829&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0TGqi_CRLH&amp;sig=frjYjGM2bZDIAsnMICsAEl_n1Qg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qtMyS_-SBoH7nAeM2KD8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hallein%2Btreaty%2B1829&amp;f=false The log of the Water Lily, p. 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighbourly cooperation==

* The new [[Tijuana International Airport]] south of San Diego airport is a cooperative affair between [[California]], USA, and [[Baja California Norte]], Mexico. The runway, control tower, emergency services, etc. are shared; however, passengers and freight are handled at separate facilities north and south of the runways.
