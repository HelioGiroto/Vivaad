      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15975">'''Red-baiting''' is the act of accusing, denouncing, attacking or persecuting an individual or group as [[communism|communist]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam-Webster 2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/red-baiting &quot;red-baiting.&quot; Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[socialism|socialist]], or [[anarchism|anarchist]], or sympathetic toward communism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/redbaiting&lt;/ref&gt; socialism, or anarchism. The word &quot;[[Red (political adjective)|red]]&quot; in &quot;red-baiting&quot; is derived from the [[red flag]] signifying [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing politics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolutionary&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://revcom.us/a/045/story-red-flag.html Story of the Red Flag]&quot;, ''[[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA|Revolution]]'', 05-19-2006. Retrieved 1-08-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the term &quot;red-baiting&quot; dates from at least 1927.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New York Times&quot; 23 August 1927 'City Crowds Silent On News Of Deaths'&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, black-listing by the Daughters of the American Revolution was charterized as a 'red-baiting relic'.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New York Times&quot; 3 April 1928 'D.A.R. Head Defends Order's Blacklist'&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term commonly used in the [[United States]], and in [[History of the United States|United States history]], red-baiting is most often associated with [[McCarthyism]], which originated in the two historic [[Red Scare]] periods of the 1920s ([[First Red Scare]]) and 1950s ([[Second Red Scare]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Free Dictionary 2010&quot;&gt;[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/redbaiting &quot;red-baiting.&quot; The Free Dictionary by Farlex. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, red-baiting does not have quite the same effect it previously did due to the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Soviet-style Communism]],&lt;ref name=Boo&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/weekinreview/01leibovich.html?_r=1 retrieved 2/8/2010&lt;/ref&gt; but some pundits have argued that notable events in current American politics indicates a resurgence of red-baiting consistent with the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;counterpunch&quot;&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/wise08112009.html Socialism as the New Black Bogeyman: Red-Baiting and Racism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges2010/&gt;

==History==
===20th century===
Red-baiting was employed in opposition to [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchists in the United States]] as early as the late 1870s when businessmen, religious leaders and editorial writers tried to rally middle class workers to oppose dissident railroad workers and again during the [[Haymarket affair]] in the mid-1880s. Red-baiting was well established in the U.S. during the decade before [[World War I]]. In the post-war period of 1919-1921 the [[U.S. government]] employed it as a central tactic in dealing with labor radicals, anarchists, communists, and foreign agents. These actions in reaction to the [[First Red Scare]] and the concurrent [[Red terror]], served as part of the organizing principle shaping [[counter-revolutionary]] policies and serving to institutionalize [[anti-communism]] as a force in American politics.&lt;ref name=Hedges2010&gt;Chris Hedges, ''[[Death of the Liberal Class]]'' (ISBN 9781568586441). Nation Books, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCAPCIMA&gt;Ronald Edsforth and Larry Bennett (1991), ''Popular culture and political change in modern America'' , SUNY PRESS, ISBN 978-0-7914-0765-3&lt;/ref&gt; 

The period between the first and second Red Scares was relatively calm owing to the success of government anti-communism, the suppressive effects of [[New Deal]] policies on radical [[organized labor]], and the [[patriotism]] associated with [[war effort|total mobilization]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=PCAPCIMA/&gt; Red-baiting reemerged in the late 1940s and early 1950s during the period known as the [[Second Red Scare]] due to mounting [[Cold War]] tensions and the spread of communism abroad. U.S. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s controversial red-baiting of suspected communists and communist sympathizers in the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], and the creation of an [[Hollywood blacklist|entertaintment industry blacklist]], led to the term “[[McCarthyism]]” being coined to signify any type of reckless [[political persecution]] or [[witch-hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/redbaiting&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of anti-communist red-baiting in general, and McCarthyism in particular, continues to be hotly debated, and political divisions this controversy created continue to make themselves felt. [[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] critics contend that revelations such as the [[Venona project]] decryptions and the [[FBI Silvermaster File]] at least mute if not outright refute the charge that red-baiting in general was unjustified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[John Earl Haynes|Haynes, John Earl]], and [[Harvey Klehr]] | title = In Denial: Historians, Communism, and Espionage | publisher = Encounter | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-893554-72-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Radosh, Ronald| title = The Persistence Of Anti-Anti-Communism| publisher = FrontPageMagazine.com| date = July 11, 2001| url = http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1491| accessdate = 2009-02-27| authorlink = Ronald Radosh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nicholas von Hoffman]] wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that evidence revealed in the Venona project forced him to admit that McCarthy was &quot;closer to the truth than those who ridiculed him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas E. Woods]], The politically incorrect guide to American history, pg.170 ISBN 978-0-89526-047-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] critics contend that, even if someone could prove that the U.S. government was infiltrated by Soviet spies, McCarthy was censured by the U.S. Senate because he was in fact reckless and politically opportunistic, and his red-baiting ruined the lives of countless innocent people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Theoharis, Athan | title = Chasing Spies: How the FBI Failed in Counter-Intelligence But Promoted the Politics of McCarthyism in the Cold War Years | publisher = Ivan R.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, red-baiting does not have quite the same effect it previously did due to the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Soviet-style Communism]],&lt;ref name=Boo/&gt; but some pundits have argued that notable events in current American politics indicates a resurgence of red-baiting consistent with the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;counterpunch&quot;/&gt; The [[federal government of the United States|United States government]]'s measures in 2008 to address the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], such as [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]], were not only criticized as “[[corporate welfare]]” but red-baited as a “gateway to socialism”.&lt;ref name=&quot;TARP Is The Gateway To Socialism Doesn’t Add Up&quot;&gt;[http://newledger.com/2009/04/morriss-claim-that-tarp-is-the-gateway-to-socialism-doesnt-add-up/ &quot;TARP Is The Gateway To Socialism Doesn’t Add Up.&quot; New Ledger. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The President's Permanent TARP Bailout SocialismBill&quot;&gt;[http://www.ipi.org/ipi/ipipressreleases.nsf/97704cbd573c70d88625763a007cd241/efa77015ce4881af862577130055121d?OpenDocument&quot;The President's Permanent TARP Bailout Socialism Bill&quot; ipi.org. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Socialism - TARP, Stimulus fraud&quot;&gt;[http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/26159/&quot;Socialism - TARP, Stimulus fraud&quot; glennbeck.com. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A[n] 'S' for Socialism&quot;&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200904290001&quot;A&amp;#91;n&amp;#93; 'S' for Socialism&quot; glennbeck.com. 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Political activist and author [[Tim Wise]], however, argues that the emergence of red-baiting may be motivated by [[Racism in the United States|racism]] towards U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and fear that the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] policies of his administration will erode [[white privilege]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;counterpunch&quot;/&gt; 

Some commentators argue that red-baiting was used by [[John McCain]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[presidential nominee]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States election]], when he argued that [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee Barack Obama's improvised comments on [[redistribution (economics)|wealth redistribution]] to “[[Joe the Plumber]]” was a promotion of “[[socialism]]”.&lt;ref name=Hedges2010/&gt; Journalist [[David Remnick]], who wrote the biography ''The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Remnick 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Remnick, David | title = The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama | publisher = Knopf | year = 2010 | isbn = 1-4000-4360-3 | authorlink = David Remnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; countered that it should now be obvious that after one year in office Obama is a [[centre-left]] president and the majority of his policies are in line with the center-left Democratic tradition;&lt;ref name=AC360&gt;http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1004/09/acd.02.html retrieved 12/4/2010&lt;/ref&gt; while, in July 2011, ''[[The Fiscal Times]]'' columnist Bruce Barlett argues that an honest examination of the Obama presidency must conclude that he has in fact been a moderately [[conservative Democrat]] and that it may take 20 years before Obama’s basic conservatism is widely accepted,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlett 2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2011/07/22/Barack-Obama-The-Democrats-Richard-Nixon.aspx#page1 &quot;Barack Obama: The Democrats’ Richard Nixon?&quot; thefiscaltimes.com. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and author and columnist [[Chris Hedges]] argues that the Obama administration's policies are mostly [[right-wing]].&lt;ref name=Hedges2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Hedges]], ''[http://www.truthdig.com/worldasitis/ The World as It Is: Dispatches on the Myth of Human Progress]'' (ISBN 9781568586403), a collection of original [[Truthdig]] columns, [[Nation Books]], November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Spencer Bachus]] claimed that 17 of his Congressional colleagues were socialists, but would only name one, [[Bernie Sanders]], who has been openly describing himself as a [[democratic socialist]] for years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2009/04/spencer_bachuss_past_with_soci.html?hpid=sec-politics Spencer Bachus's Past With Socialists]&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders countered that [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] blur the differences between socialism and [[communism]], between [[democracy]] and [[totalitarianism]]. He argued that the United States would benefit from a serious debate about comparing the [[quality of life]] for the [[middle class]] in the U.S. and in [[Nordic countries]] with a long [[social democracy|social-democratic]] tradition like [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/04/22/and_socialism/ ...and socialism]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, a number of conservative members of the [[Republican National Committee]] were pressing the committee and by extension, RNC chairman [[Michael Steele]], to officially adopt the position that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is socialist. Over a dozen members of the conservative wing of the RNC submitted a new resolution, to be eventually voted on by the entire RNC, that would call on the Democratic party to rename itself the “Democrat Socialist Party.” If the RNC adopted this resolution, the RNC’s official view would become that Democrats are socialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/23/steele-urged-to-label-obama-a-socialist/ Ralph Z. Hallow: Steele urged to label Obama a socialist]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the resolution:

{{cquote|RESOLVED, that we the members of the Republican National Committee call on the Democratic Party to be truthful and honest with the American people by acknowledging that they have evolved from a party of tax and spend to a party of tax and nationalize and, therefore, should agree to rename themselves the Democrat Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repconcaucus.com/content/proposed_rnc_resolution_recognizing_democrats_march_towards_socialism Proposed RNC Resolution Recognizing the Democrats' March Towards Socialism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On Wednesday 20 May 2009, supporters of the resolution instead agreed to accept language urging Democrats to &quot;stop pushing our country towards socialism and government control&quot;, thus ending a fight within the ranks of the Republican Party that reflected the divide between those who want a more [[Centrism|centrist]] message and those seeking a more aggressive, conservative voice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/20/gop-votes-to-condemn-demo_n_206052.html Ben Havens: GOP Votes To Condemn Democrats' &quot;March To Socialism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the one expressed by the [[Tea Party movement]]. Frank Llewellyn, national director of [[Democratic Socialists of America]], argued that Republicans never really define what they mean by “socialism” and are simply engaging in the [[culture of fear|politics of fear]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/22/opinion/main5180886.shtml?tag=cbsnewsLeadStoriesAreaMain;cbsnewsLeadStoriesHeadlines Frank Llewellyn: Socialism And The Politics Of Fear]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, talk show host [[Glenn Beck]] began to devote what would become many episodes on his TV and radio shows, focusing on President Obama's Director of [[White House Council on Environmental Quality]], [[Van Jones]]. Beck was especially critical of Jones' previous involvement in radical protest movements, and referred to him as a &quot;[[anarchist communism|communist-anarchist]] radical&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 2009-09-06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/us/politics/07vanjones.html?_r=1|title=White House Official Resigns After G.O.P.
