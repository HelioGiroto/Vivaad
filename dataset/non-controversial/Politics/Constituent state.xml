      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12121">A '''constituent state''', '''constituent entity''', or '''constituent part''', is a territorial and [[constitution]]al entity forming part of a [[sovereign state]]. A constituent state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and is a form of [[regional government]].

==Federated entities==
{{Main|Federated state}}

Constituent entities united in a [[federation|federal union]] under a [[federal government]] are more specifically known as federated states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumfed.org/en/products/magazine/vol8_num2/overview-dependency.php Constituent Units Risk Lengthy Dependency on Federal Aid]. Bird, Richard M (2009). [[Forum of Federations]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89503/California California]. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within a federacy==
{{Main|Autonomous area|Associated state}}

[[Administrative division|Administrative units]] that are not federated but enjoy a greater degree of [[autonomy]] or self-government than others within the same country can be considered constituent states of a larger sovereign state. This relationship is called a [[federacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stepan |first=Alfred |author-link=Alfred Stepan |title=[https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/fesnic/fspub/6_7_Stepan_1999_Federalism_J_of_Dem.pdf Federalism and Democracy: Beyond the U.S. Model] |journal=Journal of Democracy |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=19–34 |year=1999 |doi=10.1353/jod.1999.0072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomous republics]] like [[Karakalpakstan]] in [[Uzbekistan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/8be9009ac37f2d75c1256f17004b6e68/$FILE/G0443118.doc International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights], p 5. [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Crimea]] in [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.gov.ua/en/content/chapter10.html Website of the President of Ukraine]. [[Constitution of Ukraine]], Chapter X: Article 134. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; are examples.

States existing in [[Associated state|free association]] with another can be considered constituent states of a sovereign entity. For example, the [[Cook Islands]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Niue]] constitute the three constituent entities of the [[Realm of New Zealand]], united under a single [[head of state]], which is the [[Queen of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.govt.nz/ Website of the Governor-General of New Zealand]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakaway states==
The term can also be applied as an alternative to formal recognition of a [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|secessionist state]] that has unilaterally declared [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence|independence]], and whose ''[[de jure]]'' [[sovereignty]] remains [[List of states with limited recognition|in dispute]].

===The Caucasus===
The [[South Caucasus]] region consists of a number of breakaway and [[autonomous republic]]s in addition to the states of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] recognised by the [[United Nations]].

The breakaway republics of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], which have effectively maintained independence since declaration, are considered constituent republics of Georgia by the majority of world governments. The republic of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]], which is also independent in effect, is considered by the United Nations to be a constituent entity of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Aghayev |first=Nasimi |title=Caucasian Review of International Affairs |pages=13 |year=2008| accessdate=2009-11-01 |url=http://se2.isn.ch/serviceengine/Files/RESSpecNet/104432/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/1FB98779-D2B2-4F7C-A2DF-342E28FE5E3F/en/Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
The country of Cyprus is divided between two independent political entities: the internationally-recognised [[Republic of Cyprus]] in the south, and the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], which is recognised as a sovereign state only by [[Turkey]]. Both entities are given the title of constituent state of Cyprus by the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] for [[Cypriot reunification|reuniting Cyprus]] consistently used the term constituent state to refer to each entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unficyp.org/media/Other%20official%20documents/annanplan.pdf Annan Plan - Final Revision]. [[UNFICYP]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine===
The term constituent state can also be applied in describing the region of [[Palestine]] at present, which is divided between the governments of [[Israel]] and the [[State of Palestine]]. It has also been used to label both states in proposals for [[One-state solution|federal]] [[Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|solutions]] to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles/fedconfed-sol.htm Federal/Confederal Solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian Conflict] Elazar, Daniel J. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somalia===
Because of the [[Somali Civil War|ongoing war]] in [[Somalia]], the [[Somali people|Somali]] country is now divided into a number of constituent [[States and regions of Somalia|states]] with varying degrees of independence from the [[Transitional Federal Government]].

The breakaway republic of [[Somaliland]] in the north, which maintains ''de facto'' independence over its territory, is still regarded by member states of the United Nations as a constituent state of [[Somalia]] despite its [[declaration of independence]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7365002.stm Somaliland's 'Path to Recognition']. Reynolds, Paul (2008). [[BBC]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/world/africa/05somaliland.html?_r=1 The Signs Say Somaliland, but the World Says Somalia]. Lacey, Mark (2006). [[New York Times]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The states of [[Puntland]] and [[Galmudug]] in central Somalia retain control over their own territories with little oversight from the TFG, which is based in [[Mogadishu]] in the south. The administrations in these states have stated that, unlike Somaliland, they do not seek outright [[independence]] from Somalia, and are merely maintaining stability until such a time when the transitional government can effectively implement its constitution within the states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/gecr_29Nov07_RangeResources_mainnote.pdf Political Background] Stylianou, Stelios. [[Range Resources]], p 7. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south and in opposition to the central government are [[regions of Somalia|regions]] administered by various [[Islamic extremism|Islamic]] [[insurgency|insurgent groups]], most notably [[Hizbul Islam]] and [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|al-Shabaab]], both of which seek to establish [[Sharia law]] within the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1220864/Whipped-wearing-deceptive-bra-Hardline-Islamists-Somalia-publicly-flog-women-sharia-crackdown.html Hardline Islamists in Somalia] Mail Foreign Service (2009). Mail Online. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo/Serbia===
[[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]] has unilaterally declared independence from the [[Serbia|Republic of Serbia]] in early 2008.

==Administrative entities==
=== Palau ===
[[Palau]] is divided into sixteen [[administrative division]]s termed &quot;[[States of Palau|states]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia200910&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = Field Listing: Administrative Divisions
  | work = The World Factbook

  | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were before 1984 called [[municipalities]]. The change in terminology reflects the fact that these divisions are afforded a larger degree of autonomy than before, with each state having its own constitution. As a [[unitary republic]], however, the [[government of Palau]] is [[central government|centralised]] and these divisions exist solely to establish regional government; they are not united in a federal union.

===Burma===
Like Palau, the government of [[Myanmar]], or Burma, presently operates as a unitary state, with sovereignty confined within the central [[government of Myanmar|government]]. Burma comprises a number of &quot;states&quot;, which exist alongside the country's regional [[Administrative divisions of Burma|divisions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia200910&quot;/&gt; Both &quot;states&quot; and &quot;divisions&quot; can be described as ethnically-defined; while the [[Bamar]] remain predominant within divisions, the states are mostly dominated by [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|minority groups]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sbswg2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

In terms of politics, the use of the term &quot;state&quot; in this context is largely historical, with a number of these states having been united in various federal unions during the [[British Empire|British]] colonial period. At present, most states are afforded a greater degree of autonomy than other divisions. Political [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|separatism]] in many states is rampant, and territory controlled by the central government in these cases is limited. In these cases, jurisdiction within a state is mostly confined to its respective regional government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15456 Wa Army to Celebrate 20th Anniversary]. Wai Moe (2009). [[The Irrawaddy]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, various proposals have been made for instituting [[federalism]] in Burma, which would allow these states to implement individual constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmalibrary.org/show.php?cat=2117 Federal and State Constitutions] Online Burma Library. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs4/KIO_proposal.pdf The KIO Proposal]. [[Kachin Independence Organization]]. Letter to the National Convention Commission, and National leaders of the [[Union of Myanmar|Union]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituent country==
{{Main|Constituent country}}

Another form of constituent entity is a [[country]] over which a [[devolution|devolved]] government has been granted regional jurisdiction by and under a larger sovereign government. For example, [[Greenland]] is a constituent country of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], with its own government in place and little oversight from the [[Danish government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambottawa.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/FactsheetDenmark/Greenland/pdf/Greenland_2004.pdf Factsheet Denmark: Greenland]. Overview of Greenland, by the [[Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmp.gl/administration/periodical_shelf/EC2_30aa_ba10_mining-journal-suppl.pdf Greenland Overview]. Mining Journal Research Services (2002). The Mining Journal Ltd. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term &quot;constituent state&quot; is sometimes also used to refer to member states of an [[international organisation]]. It is used within the [[European Union]] to refer to member states. It is also used to refer to sovereign states in [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] negotiations or agreements between two or more states.

The term was also applied to former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]]s within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].
