The '''Kingdom of Sardinia''' ({{lang-it|Regno di Sardegna}}, {{lang-sc|Rennu de Sardigna}}, {{lang-pms|Regn ëd Sardëgna}}; also known as '''Piedmont-Sardinia''' or '''Sardinia-Piedmont''') consisted of the possessions of the [[House of Savoy]] from 1720 or 1723 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://numismatica-italiana.lamoneta.it/moneta/W-VA3SA/2] A 2 penny ''(2 denari)'' coin minted in 1722, still using the title of King of Sicily for Victor Amadeus II.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=col&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Columbia Encyclopedia|The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]|chapter=Sardinia, kingdom of|edition=6|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2007|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0843673.html#axzz0yhEdFv00}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/524132/Sardinia|title=Sardinia (historical kingdom, Italy)|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benigni|first=Umberto|chapter=Sardinia|title=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]|volume=13|place=New York|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|year=1912|accessdate=6 September 2010|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13473b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the award of the crown of Sardinia to [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|King Victor Amadeus II of Savoy]] under the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)]]. This compensated him for the loss of the crown of Sicily to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and allowed him to retain the title of king, as the title &quot;King of Sardinia&quot; had existed since the 14th century. Besides Sardinia, the Savoyard state at that time included [[Savoy]], [[Piedmont]], and [[Nice]]; [[Liguria]], including [[Genoa]], was added by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. During most of the 18th and 19th centuries, the political and economic capital of the kingdom was [[Turin]] in Piedmont on the Italian mainland. In 1860, Nice and Savoy were ceded to France in return for French consent and assistance in [[risorgimento|Italian unification]]. In 1861, the Kingdom of Sardinia became the founding state of the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], [[annexation|annexing]] all other Italian states. The Kingdom thus continued in legal continuity with the new Italian state, to which it transferred all its institutions.

==Early history of Piedmont==
{{Main|Duchy of Savoy}}
[[File:Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|125px|Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy (1553–80), called ''Ironhead''.]]
Piedmont was inhabited in early historic times by Celtic-[[Ligurian language|Ligurian]] tribes such as the [[Taurini]] and the [[Salassi]]. They later submitted to the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] (c. 220 BC), who founded several colonies there including ''Augusta Taurinorum ''(Turin) and ''Eporedia'' ([[Ivrea]]). After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the region was repeatedly invaded by the [[Burgundians]], the [[Goths]] (5th century), [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Lombards]] (6th century), [[Franks]] (773). In the 9th–10th centuries there were further incursions by the [[Magyars]] and [[Saracens]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. At the time Piedmont, as part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was subdivided into several marks and counties.

In 1046, [[Oddo of Savoy]] added Piedmont to their main segment of [[Savoy]], with a capital at [[Chambéry]] (now in [[France]]). Other areas remained independent, such as the powerful communes of [[Asti]] and [[Alessandria]] and the marquisates of [[Marquisate of Saluzzo|Saluzzo]] and [[Marquisate of Montferrat|Montferrat]]. The County of Savoy was elevated to a duke in 1416, and Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert|Emanuele Filiberto]] moved the seat to [[Turin]] in 1563.

==Early history of Kingdom of Sardinia==
{{Main|History of Sardinia|Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica}}
[[File:Imperi de la Corona d'Aragó.png|thumb|left|Aragon in the 15th century]]
In 1297, [[Pope Boniface VIII]], intervening between the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Houses of Anjou]] and [[House of Barcelona|Aragon]], established on paper a ''Regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae'' that would be a [[fief]] of the Papacy. Then the Pope offered his newly-invented fief to [[James II of Aragon|James II]] of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], promising him papal support should he wish to conquer Pisan Sardinia in exchange for Sicily.
In 1323 James II formed an alliance with [[Hugh II of Arborea]] and, following a military campaign which lasted a year or so, occupied the Pisan territories of [[Cagliari]] and [[Gallura]] along with the city of [[Sassari]], claiming the territory as the ''Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica''. In 1353 Aragon made war on [[Giudicato of Arborea|Arborea]], then fought with its leader [[Marianus IV of Arborea]],of the [[Cappai de Bas]] family, but did not reduce the last of the ''[[giudicati]]'' (indigenous kingdoms of Sardinia) until 1420.
The Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica retained its separate character as part of the Crown of Aragon and was not merely incorporated into the Kingdom of Aragon. At the time of his struggles with Arborea, [[Peter IV of Aragon]] granted an autonomous legislature to the Kingdom and its legal traditions. The Kingdom was governed in the king's name by a [[Viceroy]].
In 1420, [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], king of Sicily and heir to Aragon, bought the remaining territories for 100,000 gold florins of the Giudicato of Arborea in the 1420 from the last ''giudice'' [[William III of Narbonne]] and the &quot;Kingdom of Sardinia&quot; extended throughout the island, excepet for the city of [[Castelsardo]] (at that time called ''Casteldoria'' or ''Castelgenovese'') that was stolen from the [[Doria]] in 1448, and renamed ''Castillo Aragonés'' (''Aragonese Caste''). 

Corsica, which had never been conquered, was dropped from the formal title and Sardinia passed with the Crown of Aragon to a united Spain. The defeat of the local kingdoms, [[Medieval commune|communes]] and [[Signoria|signorie]], the firm Aragonese (later Spanish) rule, with the introduction of a sterile [[feudalism]], as well as the discovery of the [[Americas]], provoked an unstoppable decline of Kingdom of Sardinia. A short period of uprisings occurred under the local noble [[Leonardo de Alagon]], marquess of [[Oristano]], defended his territories against the ''Viceroy'' Nicolò Carroz, and who managed to defeat the viceroy's army in the 1470s but was later crushed at the [[Battle of Macomer]] in 1478, ending any further revolts in the island. The unceasing attacks from [[Berber people|North African pirates]] and a series of plagues (from 1582, 1652 and 1655) further worsened the situation.

==Exchange of Sardinia for Sicily==
[[File:SardiniePiemont.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the Kingdom of Sardinia]]
The Spanish domination of Sardinia ended at the beginning of the 18th century, as a result of [[War of the Spanish succession]]. By the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713, [[Spain]]'s European empire was divided: [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] received [[Sicily]] and parts of the [[Duchy of Milan]], while [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] (the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Archduke of Austria]]), received the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], [[Sardinia]], and the bulk of the [[Duchy of Milan]]. During the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]], [[Victor Amadeus II]], duke of Savoy and sovereign of Piedmont, had to agree to yield Sicily to the Austrian Habsburgs and receive Sardinia in exchange. The exchange was formally ratified in the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)|Treaty of The Hague]] of February 17, 1720. Because a [[Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica|kingdom of Sardinia]] had existed since the 14th century, the exchange allowed Victor Amadeus to retain the title of king in spite of the loss of Sicily.&lt;ref name=&quot;col&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;/&gt;

Victor Amadeus initially resisted the exchange, and until 1723 continued to style himself King of Sicily rather than King of Sardinia. The state took the official title of ''Kingdom of Sardinia, Cyprus and Jerusalem'', as the house of [[Savoy]] still claimed the thrones of [[Cyprus]] and [[Jerusalem]], although both had long been under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.

In 1767–1769, [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|Charles Emmanuel III]] conquered the [[Maddalena archipelago]] in the [[Strait of Bonifacio]] from the [[Republic of Genoa]], who ruled it with the island of [[Corsica]], and since then the archipelago is still part of the [[Sardinia|Sardinian region]].

==Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna==
[[File:CarloAlberto.jpg|thumb|left|150px|King Charles Albert]]
In 1792, Piedmont-Sardinia joined the [[First Coalition]] against the [[French First Republic]], but was beaten in 1796 by Napoleon and forced to conclude the disadvantageous [[Treaty of Paris (1796)]], giving the French army free passage through Piedmont. On December 6, 1798 [[Barthélemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] occupied Turin and forced [[Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia|Charles Emmanuel IV]] to abdicate and leave for the island of Sardinia. The provisionary government voted to unite Piedmont with France. In 1799 the Austro-Russians briefly occupied the city, but with the [[Battle of Marengo]] (1800), the French regained control. The island of Sardinia stayed out of the reach of the French for the rest of the war.

In 1814, the kingdom was restored and enlarged with the addition of the former [[Republic of Genoa]], now a duchy, and it served as a [[buffer state]] against [[France]]. This was confirmed by the [[Congress of Vienna]].
In the reaction after Napoleon, the country was ruled by conservative monarchs: [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel I]] (1802–21), [[Charles Felix of Sardinia|Charles Felix]] (1821–31) and [[Charles Albert]] (1831–49), who fought at the head of a contingent of his own troops at the [[Battle of Trocadero]], which set the reactionary [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] on the Spanish throne. Victor Emanuel I disbanded the entire Code Napoléon and returned the lands and power to the nobility and the Church. This reactionary policy went as far as discouraging the use of roads built by the French. These changes typified Piedmont.
The Kingdom of Sardinia industrialized from 1830 onward. A constitution, the ''[[Statuto Albertino]]'', was enacted in [[Revolutions of 1848|the year of revolutions, 1848]], under liberal pressure, and under the same pressure Charles Albert declared war on Austria. After initial success the war took a turn for the worse and Charles Albert was defeated by [[Marshal Radetzky]] at [[Battle of Custozza (1848)|Custozza]].

==Italian unification==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 041.jpg|thumb|150px|Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]]
[[File:With Victor Emmanuel.jpg|thumb|150px|King Victor Emmanuel II meets Garibaldi in Teano (October 26, 1860)]]
{{Main|Italian unification}}
Like all of Italy, the Kingdom of Sardinia was troubled with political instability, under alternating governments. After a very short and disastrous renewal of the war with Austria in 1849, Charles Albert abdicated on March 23, 1849, in favour of his son [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].

In 1852, a liberal ministry under [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]] was installed, and the Kingdom of Sardinia became the engine driving the [[Italian Unification]]. The Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) took part in the [[Crimean War]], allied with the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and [[France]], and fighting against [[Russia]].

In 1859, France sided with the Kingdom of Sardinia in a war against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], the [[Austro-Sardinian War]]. [[Napoleon III]] didn't keep his promises to Cavour to fight until all of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] had been conquered. Following the bloody battles of [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]] and [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]], both French victories, Napoleon thought the war too costly to continue and made a separate peace behind Cavour's back in which only Lombardy would be ceded. Due to the Austrian government's refusal to cede any lands to the Kingdom of Sardinia, they agreed to cede [[Lombardy]] to Napoleon who in turn then ceded the territory to the Kingdom of Sardinia to avoid 'embarrassing' the defeated Austrians.  Cavour angrily resigned from office when it became clear that Victor Emmanuel would accept the deal.

===Garibaldi and the Thousand===
On March 5, 1860, [[Parma]], [[Tuscany]], [[Modena]], and [[Romagna]] voted in [[referendum]]s to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. This alarmed Napoleon who feared a strong Savoyard state on his southeastern border and he insisted that if the Kingdom of Sardinia were to keep the new acquisitions they would have to cede Savoy and Nice to France. This was done after dubious referendums showed over 99.5% majorities in both areas in favour of joining France. &lt;!-- not sure how to fix this, but I don't understand why the referenda in Savoy and Nice were &quot;dubious&quot; but the ones in central Italy were not. --&gt;

In 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] started his campaign to conquer southern Italy in the name of the Kingdom of Sardinia. He quickly toppled the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] and marched to [[Gaeta]]. Cavour was actually the most satisfied with the unification while Garibaldi wanted to conquer Rome. Garibaldi was too revolutionary for the king and his prime minister.

===Towards Kingdom of Italy===
On March 17, 1861, the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was proclaimed by the Parliament, so ratifying the [[annexation]]s of all other Italian states to Piedmont. The institutions and laws of the Kingdom were quickly extended to all Italy, brutally abolishing the administrations of the other regions. Piedmont would become the most dominant and wealthiest region in Italy and the capital of Piedmont, Turin, would remain the Italian capital until 1865 when the capital was moved to [[Florence]]; but in contrast, many revolts exploded through the peninsula, [[Brigandage in the Two Sicilies|especially in Southern Italy]]. The [[House of Savoy]] would rule Italy until 1946 when Italy was declared a [[Italy|republic]] by [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|referendum]].

==Flags==
When the [[Duchy of Savoy]] changed its name into Kingdom of Sicily in 1713 and Kingdom of Sardinia in 1723, it maintained its traditional flag depicting a white cross on a red field. But a problem arose: if the Duchy owned the small harbour of [[Nice]] only, the union with Sicily and then Sardinia gave to the Kingdom a quite big fleet, which had the same flag of [[Malta]]. To disambiguate the ships of the two different States, the House of Savoy added a blue border to its flag, and then it reduced the cross in a single quarter.

The flag had following minor changes until 1848, when a revolution happened: to follow the liberal revolutions which were exploding in all Europe, King [[Charles Albert]] adopted the Napoleonic Italian tricolour, surmonted by the Savoyard shield,  as national flag. This flag became the flag of Italy until 1946.

==Constituent countries==
Until the [[perfect fusion]] of 1848, the Savoyard State was formed by different constituent countries:
* The [[Duchy of Savoy]]
* The [[Principality of Piedmont]]
* The [[County of Nice]]
* The [[Duchy of Genoa]]
* The [[Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica|Viceroyalty of Sardinia]]
