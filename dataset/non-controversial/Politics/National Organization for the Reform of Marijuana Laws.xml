The '''National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws''' ('''NORML''' {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|n|ɔr|m|əl}}) is an American non-profit organization based in Washington, DC whose aim is to move public opinion sufficiently to achieve the [[Marijuana legalization|legalization of non-medical marijuana in the United States]] so that the responsible use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by adults is no longer subject to penalty. According to their website, NORML &quot;supports the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and responsible use of marijuana by adults, including the cultivation for personal use, and the casual nonprofit transfers of small amounts,&quot; and &quot;supports the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5059|title=NORML Policy on Personal Use|accessdate=2008-08-26 |publisher=NORML|date=2004-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NORML and the '''NORML Foundation''' support both those fighting prosecution under marijuana laws and those working to legalize marijuana. Similar affiliated organizations operate under the NORML banner in other countries, among them [[NORML New Zealand]].

In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 United States midterm elections]], NORML promoted several successful local initiatives that declared marijuana enforcement to be the lowest priority for local law enforcement.  NORML claims that this frees up police resources to combat violent and serious crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=3418#question5 | title = NORML: Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NORML plans to support efforts now underway in states such as California, Washington, and Oregon to legalize and tax marijuana, which it claims is a means of coping with growing federal and state deficits without having to raise other taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hemp.org/news/california-assemblyman-introduces-legislation-to-tax-and-regulate-marijuana &quot;NORML: California Assemblyman Introduces Legislation To Tax And Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol&quot;] Hemp.org, 24 February 2009. Retrieved 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==NORML Foundation==
The NORML Foundation, the organization's tax-exempt unit, conducts educational and research activities. Examples of the NORML Foundation's advocacy work is a detailed 2006 report, ''Emerging Clinical Applications For Cannabis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.norml.org//index.cfm?Group_ID=7002 | title = Recent Research on Medical Marijuana | publisher = National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws | date = 2007-02-03 | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive report with county-by-county marijuana arrest data, ''Crimes of Indiscretion: Marijuana Arrest in America'', was published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=6411 | title = Crimes of Indiscretion | publisher = National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws  | date = 2005-03-07 | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1998, NORML Foundation published the ''NORML Report on U.S. Domestic Marijuana Production'' that was widely cited in the mainstream media. The report methodically estimated the value and number of cannabis plants grown in 1997, finding that [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], state and local law enforcement agencies seized 32% of domestic cannabis plants planted that year. According to the report, &quot;Marijuana remains the fourth largest cash crop in America despite law enforcement spending an estimated $10 billion annually to pursue efforts to outlaw the plant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=4444 | title = NORML Report on U.S. Domestic Marijuana Production | publisher = National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws | date = 2005-03-07 | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies show that marijuana is larger than all other cash crops combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-pot18dec18,0,1249845,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines | title = Pot is called biggest cash crop | first = Eric | last = Bailey | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2006-12-18 | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, the organization used ads containing New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] quotes on his past use of pot, saying &quot;You bet I did. And I enjoyed it.&quot; The mayor said &quot;I’m not thrilled they’re using my name. I suppose there’s that First Amendment that gets in the way of me stopping it,&quot; but maintained that the [[NYPD]] will continue to vigorously enforce the laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugwar.com/pnormlnycad.shtm NYC Mayor Bloomberg's Pot Use is NORML: Drugwar.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NORML was founded in 1970 by [[Keith Stroup]], funded by $5,000 from the [[Playboy Foundation]]. Since then, the organization has played a central role in the cannabis decriminalization movement. The organization has a large grassroots network with 135 chapters and over 550 lawyers. NORML holds annual conferences and [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE)-accredited seminars. Its board of directors has, at times, included such prominent political figures as Senators [[Philip Hart]], [[Jacob K. Javits]], and [[Ross Mirkarimi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Media and activism==
As an advocacy group, NORML has been active in spreading its message to the public.

In early 2009, a petition to President [[Barack Obama]] was written asking that he appoint a &quot;[[Drug Czar]]&quot; who will treat drug abuse as a health issue rather than a criminal issue and will move away from a &quot;[[War on Drugs]]&quot; paradigm. NORML's goal for this petition is 100,000 signatures.

Also in early 2009, when the [[Kellogg Company]] dropped its contract with Olympic swimmer [[Michael Phelps]] after pictures of him using a bong surfaced in the media, head members of NORML began [[boycott]]ing Kellogg products and urging all members and supporters of NORML to boycott Kellogg, until the company reversed the decision.  NORML also suggested that supporters of the cause send emails or letters to Kellogg explaining the boycott and the reasons behind it, even providing a template for emails and letters.

Although Kellogg's profits did not suffer in the first quarter of 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Scott Eden |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10494368/kellogg-beats-targets-despite-weaker-sales.html |title=Kellogg Beats Targets Despite Weaker Sales |publisher=TheStreet |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; consumer ratings polls at Vanno&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanno.com/company/kellogg ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been cited as indicating that Kellogg's reputation has suffered.  Specifically, a small poll of Kellogg's brand reputation at Vanno showed a drop from its previous rank of 9 to 83 after Kellogg decided not to renew its contract with Michael Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/dumping-phelps-over-bong-rip-damages-kelloggs-brand-reputation-2009-2|title=Dumping Phelps Over Bong Rip Damages Kellogg's Brand Reputation|accessdate=2009-04-20 |publisher=The Business Insider|date=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/24/kelloggs-brand-damaged-by_n_169694.html|title=Kellogg's Brand Damaged By Dumping Michael Phelps|accessdate=2009-04-20 |publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear whether or not NORML's boycott played a significant role in this decline.

On April 20, 2009, NORML released the first national pro-marijuana television advertisement. The [[Public service announcement|PSA]], which overtly promotes the legalization of marijuana use, was created by Philadelphia filmmaker Jason Druss as an entry into NORML's annual video contest.

The television commercial was discussed in the April 20, 2009 edition of The New York Times, CBS News, as well as hundreds of blogging and news websites.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

On February 15, 2010, a 15 second Flash animation from NORML discussing the potential economic and financial benefit of legalized marijuana was deemed by CBS to be &quot;too political&quot; to display on billboards in New York City's Times Square. This drew criticism in the blogosphere and accusations of hypocrisy on Twitter, since CBS had recently aired an anti-abortion television spot during the 2010 Super Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.norml.org/2010/02/15/cbs-rejects-norml-legalization-billboard-but-accepts-black-children-are-an-endangered-species-anti-abortion-billboard/#comments |title=CBS rejects NORML legalization billboard, but accepts “Black Children are an Endangered Species” anti-abortion billboard &amp;#124; NORML Blog, Marijuana Law Reform |publisher=Blog.norml.org |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CBS has since reversed its decision and the ad was debuted on the CBS Times Square Superscreen on Tuesday April 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=8163 |title=Foundation To Launch Second NYC Times Square Billboard Campaign New Ad Debuts On April 20 On The CBS Super Screen |publisher=NORML |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
