'''One Peoples Project''' (OPP) is an organization founded in 2000 to monitor and publish information about alleged [[Racism|racist]] and [[far right]] groups and individuals, mostly in the United States. Its most prominent members are Daryle Lamont Jenkins, its founder, and Joshua Hoyt, who joined the group in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hate Crimes: Causes, Controls, and Controversies|author= Phyllis B.

OPP originated from a July 4, 2000 protest against a [[Nationalist Movement]] rally in [[Morristown, New Jersey]] that was billed as ''Independence from Affirmative-Action Day''. The counter-demonstration was called the ''One People's Rally''. Three hundred anti-racist protesters turned out to face nine supporters of the Nationalist Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/barrett.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=barrett Richard Barrett]&lt;/ref&gt;  
At the time, Jenkins was a member of the [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]-based group New Jersey Freedom Organization (NJFO). Originally named One People's Coalition, with Jenkins as its spokesperson, the group researched and published information about the Nationalist Movement's awards ceremony at the [[Manville, New Jersey|Manville]] [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall. This led to the cancellation of the event.

Over the next year, the renamed One People's Project broadened their focus, to publish information on their website about [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]], ranging from the mainstream to [[far right]]. In November 2001, OPP began focusing heavily on white supremacist groups that were attempting to take advantage of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The most notable of these groups was the [[Hillsboro, West Virginia]]-based [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]].

OPP has published phone numbers, home addresses and workplace addresses of individuals they have identified as being far right and/or racist. While this practice has invited criticism by those who say that it can incite others to violence, the group has defended this practice as using the same free speech rights that anti-abortion activists use when they do the same to abortion providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with One People's Project|publisher=Infoshop News |date= December 27, 2005|url= http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=20051227135937304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2007, when a rally was organized to support a plan by the mayor of Morristown, New Jersey, to deputize law enforcement officials to enforce [[immigration]] laws via the Immigration and Nationality Act, OPP posted a notice on their website calling the event an &quot;anti-immigrant rally&quot;, although the organizer described it as a rally against [[illegal immigration]]. After the rally, the OPP website included the following statement: &quot;[w]e don't think anyone is going to lose any sleep over people chanting during the anti-immigrant side's salute to the flag, Nazis getting slapped around a bit or the pain Robb Pearson &amp; Co. feel over being called racist all the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1211&amp;Itemid=2 One Peoples Project - Nazis, Nationalists, Know Nothings &amp; Neo-Cons: It'S An Anti-Immigration Rally In New Jersey!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2012}} According to the OPP website, all charges were dropped when one of those supporters was also charged for his role in the fight, and an agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1453&amp;Itemid=2 One People's Project - All Dharges Dismissed from '07 Morristown Anti-Immigration Rally]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2012}}

In 2011, David Yeagley filed a lawsuit against Jenkins and OPP for participating in actions that allegedly led to the cancellation of an [[American Renaissance]] conference in 2010, where he was supposed to speak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/GetCaseInformation.asp?number=CJ-2011-5510&amp;db=Oklahoma&amp;submitted=true OCIS Case Summary for Case No. CJ-2011-5510]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yeagley’s lawsuit, OPP and others contacted hotels hosting the conference, “threatening, murder, violence and other forms of retribution” should the event take place. The hotels have never confirmed that this happened, and no charges have been laid. 

OPP has played a role in reforming several neo-Nazis, most notably a member of the Vinlander Social Club who left his beliefs behind with the help of Jenkins and, with further help from the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], was able to get a massive amount of tattoos removed from his face and hands. This was the subject of the [[MSNBC]] documentary ''[[Erasing Hate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/erasing-hate-reformed-skinhead-endures-agony-to-remove-hateful-tattoos/ ‘ERASING HATE’: REFORMED SKINHEAD ENDURES AGONY TO REMOVE HATEFUL TATTOOS]&lt;/ref&gt; OPP has also been featured on other television programs, such as the ''[[Montel Williams Show]]'', ''[[A Current Affair]]'', and in newspaper articles. It has also been mentioned in [[Gwen Ifill|Gwen Ifill's]] book, ''The Breakthrough''.
