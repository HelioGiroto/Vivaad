A '''safe seat''' is a seat in a [[legislature|legislative body]] (e.g., Congress, Parliament, City Council) which is regarded as fully secured, either by a certain [[political party]], the [[incumbent]] representative personally or a combination of both.  In such seats, there is very little chance of a seat changing hands because of the political leanings of the [[constituency|electorate]] in the [[constituency]] concerned and/or the popularity of the incumbent member.  The opposite (i.e. more competitive) type of seat is a [[marginal seat]].

In countries with parliamentary government, parties often try to ensure that their most talented politicians are selected to contest these seats.  This is done in part to ensure that these politicians can stay in parliament, regardless of the specific election result, and that they can concentrate on [[minister (government)|ministerial]] roles without needing to spend too much effort on managing electorate-specific issues.

Unsurprisingly, candidate selection for a party's safe seats is usually keenly contested, although many parties restrict or forbid challenges to the nomination of sitting members.  Other parties will often be compelled to nominate much less well-known individuals (such as [[backroom]] workers or youth activists in the party), who will sometimes do little more than serve as [[paper candidate]]s who do little or no campaigning, or will be trying to use the contest to gain experience so that they become more likely to be selected for a more winnable seat.

Safe seats can become marginal seats (and vice versa) gradually as voter allegiances shift over time.  However, this shift can happen more rapidly for a variety of reasons.  The retirement or death of a popular sitting member may make a seat more competitive, as the accrued personal vote of a long-serving parliamentarian sometimes will have resisted countervailing demographic trends which come back in force upon retirement.  An independent or third party candidate with an ideology close to that of the incumbent party may also be able to make a more credible challenge than more established parties.  Also, traditionally safe seats can be more vulnerable in [[by-election]]s, especially for governing parties.

The fact that voters in safe seats usually have little chance to affect election outcomes - and thus, those voters' concerns can theoretically be ignored by political parties with no effect on election outcome - is often regarded as undemocratic, and is a major argument of supporters of various multi-member [[proportional representation]] election methods. These supporters also argue that safe seats receive far less political funding than marginal seats, as the parties will attempt to &quot;buy&quot; marginal seats with funding (a process known in America and Australia as &quot;[[Pork barrel|Pork Barrelling]]&quot;) while ignoring safe seats which can reliably fall to the same party every time.

==Australia==
The [[Australian Electoral Commission]] defines seat margins as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/FAQs/Elections.htm|title=Elections – Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/australian_electoral_system/files/jscem/1998_election/sub88.pdf|title=Submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters: The Conduct of the 1998 Federal Election|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|date=12 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his election analysis, [[Psephology|psephologist]] [[Antony Green]] puts the cutoff between &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;very safe&quot; at 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2010/guide/qa.htm|title=Election Q&amp;A|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia's federal system, most rural seats are safe seats for either the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].  Conversely, inner-city and poorer suburban seats are typically safe [[Australian Labor Party]] seats, and a few of the most affluent inner-middle urban seats are held by the Liberal Party.  Marginals are generally concentrated in the middle-class outer-suburban areas of Australia's larger state capitals, which therefore decide most Australian federal elections.

At the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], the governing [[Australian Labor Party]]'s safest seat was the seat of [[Division of Batman]] in [[Melbourne]]'s inner-northern suburbs, with a two-party-preferred margin of 26.0%. The safest seat for the opposition [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] was the rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] electorate of [[Division of Murray|Murray]], with a margin of 18.3%. The Liberal Party's junior coalition partner, the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]]'s safest seat was the division of [[Division of Mallee|Mallee]], also located in rural Victoria, with a margin of 21.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/2007/pendulum2007.txt |author=Adam Carr |accessdate=2008-10-18 |title=2007 Australian federal election electoral pendulum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
Examples include:

*[[Beauséjour (electoral district)|Beauséjour]], a riding in southeastern [[New Brunswick]], which is considered a safe seat for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tower|first=Katie|title=Economy, environment will be key factors in next week's election|url=http://www.sackvilletribunepost.com/index.cfm?sid=178866&amp;sc=129|publisher=Sackville Tribune Post|date=2008-10-14|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, when [[Jean Chrétien]] needed an open seat to become Leader of the Opposition, he chose Beauséjour in a by-election and won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Votes 2008: Beauséjour|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/riding/024/|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=2008-11-07|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Central Nova]], located in east-central [[Nova Scotia]], which has been called a safe seat for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] and its predecessor, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]], having been held by either [[Elmer MacKay]] or his son [[Peter MacKay|Peter]] all but five of the last forty years. The only time the riding was not in Conservative control was from [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993]] to [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997]] when the Conservatives were reduced to just two seats and a socially-conservative candidate ran for the Liberals. In 1983, when [[Brian Mulroney]] needed a seat in the House of Commons, he chose to run in Central Nova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Jeff|title=Swing voters could make anything happen next time in Central Nova|url=http://www.thehilltimes.ca/html/index.php?display=story&amp;full_path=2008/july/7/swing_voters/&amp;c=2|publisher=[[The Hill Times]]|date=2008-07-07|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Crowfoot (electoral district)|Crowfoot]], a Conservative stronghold located in southern [[Alberta]], which has been called the safest seat in the entire country. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]], Conservative candidate [[Kevin Sorenson]] won 82.04% of the vote, and in a ranking measuring the electoral competitiveness of ridings by ''[[National Post]]'' reporter Dan Arnold, the district came in last in all of Canada, having an average margin of victory of 74%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=Dan|title=Canada's most competitive ridings|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/07/21/dan-arnold-canada-s-most-competitive-ridings.aspx|publisher=[[National Post]]|date=2009-07-21|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]], a Liberal stronghold in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], held by a succession of Liberal MPs since 1940. Liberal [[Irwin Cotler]] won over 75% of the vote in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Votes 2006: Mount Royal|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2006/riding/079/|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ottawa—Vanier]], a Liberal stronghold in the eastern part of [[Ottawa]]. It has elected a Liberal Member of Parliament each federal election since its creation in [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935]], often in landslide victories.  In fact, the previous electoral district which comprises most of the constituency, [[Russell (Ontario electoral district)|Russell]], had been solidly Liberal since 1887.
*[[Portage—Lisgar]],  one of many rural, southern safe seats in the Prairies for the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].
*[[Saint-Laurent—Cartierville]], another Liberal safe seat in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryden|first=Joan|title=Grits and Greens make a deal|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/202565|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2007-04-12|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been held by the Liberals since its creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Federal Ridings since 1867: Saint-Laurent--Cartierville|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Det&amp;rid=955&amp;Include=|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], incumbent [[Stéphane Dion]] won with over 65% of the vote, and over 21,000 votes more than his closest rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Votes 2004: Saint-Laurent-Cartierville|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2004/riding/098/|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=2004-06-29|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wild Rose (electoral district)|Wild Rose]], a Conservative stronghold, also in southern [[Alberta]]. The incumbent, [[Blake Richards]], won 72.9% of the vote in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]] in what ranked as the largest majority win in the history of the constituency. Richards' predecessor, [[Myron Thompson]], won 72% compared to 10% for his closest rival in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]].
*[[York Centre]], a safe seat for the Liberals in [[Toronto]]. Since the district's re-establishment in 1952, it has been out of Liberal hands only twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=York Centre|url=http://www.thestar.com/federalelection/candidates/ridingprofile/495335|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The City of Toronto, which holds [[List of Canadian federal electoral districts#Ontario|23 ridings]] is often considered a Liberal stronghold, having shut out the Conservative Party from the city in the six elections between 1993 and 2008, and having lost at most two ridings in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections to the [[New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tories struggle in Toronto's Liberal strongholds|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060116/elxn_toronto_060116/20060116?s_name=election2006|publisher=[[CTV News]]|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Canadian Federal Election]] ended the Liberal fortress of Toronto when both Conservatives and New Democrats elected many new MPs in the 416.

==Fiji==
:''see also'': [[House_of_Representatives_(Fiji)#Open_Electorates|Constituencies of Fiji]]
In Fiji, prior to the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|December 2006 military coup]], elections were held under the [[Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]], which allotted 46 of the  [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]]' 71 seats on an ethnic basis. 23 were reserved for the indigenous majority, 19 for [[Indo-Fijian]]s, 1 for [[Rotuma]]ns, and 3 for members of all other ethnic minorities. There was a strong tendency towards voting on ethnic lines. Thus, in the [[Fijian general election, 1999|1999 general election]], although the indigenous seats were split between several parties, all 19 Indo-Fijian seats were won by the [[Fiji Labour Party]] - which won none of the indigenous seats. In the [[Fijian general election, 2001|2001 general election]], the conservative indigenous nationalist [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] party won 18 of the indigenous seats, with the other 5 going to the ultra-nationalist [[Conservative Alliance (Fiji)|Conservative Alliance]] - which later merged into the SDL. All 19 &quot;Indian&quot; seats were retained by the Labour Party. In the [[Fijian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], all Indo-Fijian seats remained safely Labour, while the SDL won all 23 indigenous seats. Among other minorities, only the communal seat of [[West Central (General Electors Communal Constituency, Fiji)|West Central]] was a safe seat for the ethnic [[United Peoples Party (Fiji)|United Peoples Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.fj/results1999/sum_open_comm.html &quot;Elections 1999 Results Summary&quot;], Fiji Elections Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.fj/results2001/summaries/03_open_comm.html &quot;2001 election: summary by open seats and type of communal seats&quot;], iji Elections Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.fj/img/fijian-parties.gif &quot;2006 election: Fijian communal constituencies&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.fj/img/indian-parties.gif &quot;2006 election: Indian communal constituencies&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, many rural electorates, and those based in wealthy suburban areas, notably the North Shore and eastern suburbs of [[Auckland]], are considered safe seats for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. An example of a safe National seat is [[Taranaki-King Country]], currently held by [[Shane Ardern]], who gained 66% of votes in [[New Zealand general election, 2005|the 2005 election]], with only 24.5% of votes going to his [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] rival.

By contrast, inner-city and poorer suburban electorates are safe Labour seats. For example, in 2005, the seat of [[Māngere (New Zealand electorate)|Mangere]] was won by incumbent Labour MP [[Taito Phillip Field]] with 67.7% of the vote, his National rival getting only 12.5% of the vote. (Ironically, from the resignation of Field from the Labour Party early in 2007 to the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|general election in 2008]], this safest of Labour seats was represented by an independent MP.)

Historically, some seats thought to be safe have witnessed surprise upsets. Perhaps the most dramatic recent case was the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 election]], in which the [[Maori seats]], safe Labour seats for the previous 60 years, were all won by the [[New Zealand First Party]].

The adoption of [[proportional representation]] by New Zealand, beginning in 1996, has decreased the importance of winning votes in geographical electorates. It remains to be seen what long-term effect proportional representation will have on the safety of individual electorate seats.

== United Kingdom ==
On 6 April 2010, the [[Electoral Reform Society]] estimated that of the 650 [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituencies]], 382 (59%) were safe seats:&lt;ref name=ERS-2010-04&gt;{{cite web|title=Election already over in nearly 400 seats|url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/safe-seats/|publisher=Electoral Reform Society|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of safe seats are in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] heartlands of North West ([[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]]) and North East [[England]] (South and West [[Yorkshire]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Durham]]), central [[Scotland]] ([[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]) and also the urban seats of [[Birmingham]] and the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. Those of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] are in the [[Non-metropolitan county|shires]] and affluent areas of [[London]], for example [[Kensington (UK Parliament constituency)|Kensington]].
An example of a safe Labour seat is [[Bootle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bootle]], where in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] Labour received 66% of the vote, giving them a 51% majority over the second-placed [[Liberal Democrats]] (at 15%).
[[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]] is a safe Conservative seat; in 2010 the party gathered 61% of the vote there, giving it a 41.5% majority.  There are few seats that are very safe for the Liberal Democrats, as even ones that are perceived to be safe can be lost unexpectedly: [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney &amp; Shetland]] is one of the most reliable Lib Dem seats, and gave the party 62% of the vote in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/851.stm | work=BBC News | title=BBC NEWS | Election 2010 | Orkney &amp; Shetland | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Electoral Reform Society identifies what it calls &quot;super safe seats&quot;, which have been held continuously by one party since the 19th century. In so doing, it equates seats with their rough equivalents under previous boundaries. For example, following the 2010 general election, it identifies the seat of [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] as having been held by the Conservative Party since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1837|1837 general election]], although the seat's current boundaries were only set in 1997. Similarly, it considers that [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]] (and a few others)  have been held by the Conservative Party since 1885, [[Devon East (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon East]], [[Fylde (UK Parliament constituency)|Fylde]] and [[Arundel and South Downs (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel and South Downs]] since 1868, [[Hampshire North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampshire North East]] since 1857, [[Rutland and Melton (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland and Melton]], [[Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Bognor Regis and Littlehampton]] and [[East Worthing and Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency)|East Worthing and Shoreham]] since 1841, and [[Shropshire North (UK Parliament constituency)|Shropshire North]] since 1835, making it historically the safest seat of all, having been held without interruption by the Conservatives since the time of the [[Tamworth Manifesto]], and since before [[Queen Victoria]]'s accession to the throne. (For historical reasons, the Conservative Party being older that the other current main parties, it holds all the &quot;oldest&quot; safe seats.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/safe-seats/ &quot;Safe seats&quot;], Electoral Reform Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the safest of seats can be - and sometimes are - upset. Whilst it is rare for the opposition to take such seats, outside candidates may be able to. Recent examples include the election of [[Peter Law]] and [[George Galloway]] to very safe Labour seats in 2005, and [[Martin Bell]] to the safe Conservative seat of [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] in 1997.
The loss of safe seats can go down in history. The loss by [[Michael Portillo]] of his safe Conservative seat in 1997 has gone down in history and created the &quot;Portillo moment&quot;. This moment has subsequently been used to describe huge voting swings that generally usher in a new government, as occurred in 1997.

==United States==
Many [[United States|American]] commentators have decried the tendency of most [[US House of Representatives|House]] seats to become safe seats, decreasing the number of contested seats in every cycle. This is due in part to the fact that most congressional districts are drawn by state legislatures to be all but unwinnable for the district's minority party.  Specific [[U.S. State]]s, [[congressional district]]s, and [[United States Senate|senate seats]] since the 1990s are sometimes referred to as &quot;solid blue&quot; ([[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]]) or &quot;solid red&quot; ([[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]]) after the use of these colors in television maps on election night.

The [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rates [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]] on how strongly they lean towards either major party. Currently New York's [[New York's 15th congressional district|15th]] ([[Upper Manhattan]], northwestern [[Queens]]) and [[New York's 16th congressional district|16th]] ([[South Bronx]]) districts are the most Democratic at D+41 while, [[Alabama's 6th congressional district|Alabama's 6th]] (suburbs of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]) and [[Texas's 13th congressional district|Texas's 13th]] (far northern Texas including the [[Texas Panhandle]]) are the most Republican at R+29.

Other examples of a safe seat for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] is  [[California's 8th congressional district]] in [[San Francisco]].  This district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands without interruption since 1949.  Its current representative, [[Nancy Pelosi]], was most recently reelected with 80 percent of the vote.

[[United States Republican Party|Republican]] safe seat examples include [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district]] and [[Tennessee's 2nd congressional district]], which combined have been held by Republicans or their predecessors (except for two terms in the 1st) since 1859 (despite the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|switch between the Republican and Democratic parties in the U.S. south]]).
