[[Image:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|250px|thumb|[[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (left) and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], former leaders of the [[Cold War]]'s two rival superpowers, meeting in [[Geneva]] in 1985. The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 left the [[United States]] as the sole superpower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nossal&quot; /&gt;]] 

A '''superpower''' is a [[Sovereign state|state]] with a dominant position in the [[international relations|international system]] which has the ability to [[Sphere of influence|influence]] events and its own interests and project [[Power in international relations|power on a worldwide scale]] to protect those interests. A superpower is traditionally considered to be a step higher than a [[great power]].

Alice Lyman Miller (Professor of National Security Affairs at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]), defines a superpower as &quot;a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world, and sometimes, in more than one region of the globe at a time, and so may plausibly attain the status of global [[hegemony]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Lyman |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/sjir/6.1.03_miller.html |title=www.stanford.edu |publisher=www.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a term first applied in 1944 to the [[British Empire]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States of America]]. Following [[World War II]], as the British Empire transformed itself into the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and its territories became independent, the Soviet Union and the United States generally came to be regarded as the only two superpowers, and confronted each other in the [[Cold War]].

After the Cold War, only the United States appeared to fulfill the criteria to be considered a world superpower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nossal&quot;&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/papers/hyperpower.htm|title=Lonely Superpower or Unapologetic Hyperpower?

==Terminology==
The term ''superpower'' was used to describe nations with greater than [[great power]] status as early as 1944, but only gained its specific meaning with regard to the [[United States]], the [[British Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War II]].  This was because the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance.

There have been attempts to apply the term superpower retrospectively, and sometimes very loosely, to a variety of past entities such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece]], [[China]],&lt;ref name=&quot;oecdbookshop.org&quot;&gt;[[Angus Maddison]] (2003). [http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?K=5LMQCR2K1TG3&amp;lang=EN&amp;sort=sort_date%2Fd&amp;sf1=kwords&amp;st1=maddison&amp;sf3=SubjectCode&amp;st4=not+E4+or+E5+or+P5&amp;sf4=SubVersionCode&amp;ds=maddison%3B+All+Subjects%3B+&amp;m=8&amp;dc=27&amp;plang=en ''The World Economy: Historical Statistics''], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]],&lt;ref name=&quot;oecdbookshop.org&quot;/&gt; the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schaefer |first=Brett |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/hl917.cfm |title=www.heritage.org |publisher=www.heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9780631226444 |title=www.blackwellpublishing.com |publisher=www.blackwellpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mongol Empire]], [[Portuguese Empire]], the [[Spanish Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;KAMEN, H., ''Spain's Road To Empire: The Making Of A World Power, 1492–1763'', 2003, [[Penguin Books|Penguin]], 640p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Isabella: Catholic Queen and Madam of Spain&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Edwards | first=John | year=2005 | title=Isabella: Catholic Queen and Madam of Spain | publisher=Tempus Publishing | isbn=0-7524-3331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Mark Greengrass, ''The Ancien Régime'' 1998 Wiley-Blackwell, page 512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Englund, ''Napoleon: A Political Life'', 2005, Harvard University Press, page 254&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Empire]].

Recognition by historians of these older states as superpowers may focus on various superlative traits exhibited by them. For example, at its peak the British Empire was the [[List of largest empires|largest in history]] with 1 in every 4 people in the world living under its flag.

===Origin===
[[File:Superpower map 1945.png|240px|thumb|A world map of 1945. According to William T.R. Fox, the [[United States]] (blue), the [[Soviet Union]] (red), and the [[British Empire]] (teal) were superpowers.]]
The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch-American geostrategist [[Nicholas Spykman]] in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order. This formed the foundation for the book ''The Geography of the Peace'', which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the United Kingdom and United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world.

A year later, [[William Thornton Rickert Fox|William T.R. Fox]], an American foreign policy professor, elaborated on the concept in the book ''The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union — Their Responsibility for Peace'' (1944), which spoke of the global reach of a super-empowered nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casaasia.es/pdf/9200595422AM1127202862621.pdf |title=China Superpower |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox used the word Superpower to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status in a world in which, as the war then raging demonstrated, states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale.

According to him, there were (at that moment) three states that were superpowers: [[British Empire|Britain]], the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. The British Empire was the most [[World's largest empires|extensive empire]] in world history and considered the foremost great power, holding sway over 25% of the world's population&lt;ref&gt;Angus Maddison. ''The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective'' (p. 98, 242). [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Paris, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and controlling about 25% of the Earth's total land area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hostkingdom.net/earthrul.html ''To Rule the Earth...''], hostkingdom.net, [http://www.hostkingdom.net/Bibliography.html Bibliography]. Retrieved March 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while the United States and the Soviet Union grew in power in [[World War II]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:NYSE127.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor. Economic power such as a large [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|nominal GDP]] and a world [[reserve currency]] are important factors in projection of [[hard power]].]]
[[Image:USS Nimitz in Victoria Canada 036.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Military assets such as [[United States Navy|U.S.]] [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class aircraft carrier]]s combined with a [[blue water navy]] are a means of [[power projection]] – one hallmark of a superpower.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;/&gt;  Ten different countries control one or more [[aircraft carrier]]s.  The US Navy currently has eleven.]]

The criteria of a superpower are not clearly defined&lt;ref name=&quot;Nossal&quot;/&gt; and as a consequence they may differ between sources.

According to Lyman Miller, &quot;The basic components of superpower stature may be measured along four axes of power: military, economic, political, and cultural (or what political scientist [[Joseph Nye]] has termed “[[soft power]]”).&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;/&gt;

In the opinion of Kim Richard Nossal of [[Queen's University]], &quot;generally this term was used to signify a political community that occupied a continental-sized landmass, had a sizable population (relative at least to other major powers); a superordinate economic capacity, including ample indigenous supplies of food and natural resources; enjoyed a high degree of non-dependence on international intercourse; and, most importantly, had a well-developed nuclear capacity (eventually normally defined as second-strike capability).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nossal&quot; /&gt;

In the opinion of Professor Paul Dukes, &quot;a superpower must be able to conduct a global strategy including the possibility of destroying the world; to command vast economic potential and influence; and to present a universal ideology&quot;. Although, &quot;many modifications may be made to this basic definition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abe.etailer.dpsl.net/Home/html/moreinfo.asp?bookid=536885601 abe.etailer.dpsl.net]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor June Teufel Dreyer, &quot;A superpower must be able to project its power, soft and hard, globally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/125.200702.dreyer.chineseforeignpolicy.html |title=www.fpri.org |publisher=www.fpri.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold War==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2009}}
[[Image:Cold War Map 1980.svg|thumb|250px|This map shows two essentially global spheres during the [[Cold War]] in 1980. Consult the legend on the map for more details.]]

The 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] suggested that [[British Empire|Britain]], financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue its [[foreign policy]] objectives on an equal footing with the new superpowers without sacrificing [[convertibility]] of its [[reserve currency]] as a central goal of policy.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Klug and Gregor W. Smith, 'Suez and Sterling', ''Explorations in Economic History'', Vol. 36, No. 3 (July 1999), pp. 181–203.&lt;/ref&gt; As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in [[Europe]] or [[Asia]].

The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term creditor nation&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Getting Serious About the Twin Deficits
&quot; by Author: Menzie D. Chinn - September 2005 by Council on Foreign Relations Press [http://www.cfr.org/economics/getting-serious-twin-deficits/p8933]&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal supplier of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.oldenburger.us/gary/docs/TheColdWar.htm The Cold War: The Geography of Containment] Gary E. Oldenburger by Oldenburger Independent Studies; December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the [[United Nations]]), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to [[Greece]] in 1947 the United States took the lead in [[Containment|containing]] Soviet expansion in the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Frazier, 'Did Britain Start the Cold War? Bevin and the Truman Doctrine', ''Historical Journal'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Sep., 1984), pp. 715–727.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two countries opposed each other ideologically, politically, militarily, and economically. The Soviet Union promoted the ideology of [[communism]]: [[planned economy]] and a one-party state, whilst the United States promoted the ideologies of [[liberal democracy]] and the [[free market]]. This was reflected in the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[NATO]] military alliances, respectively, as most of Europe became aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. These alliances implied that these two nations were part of an emerging bipolar world, in contrast with a previously multipolar world. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The idea that the Cold War period revolved around only two blocs, or even only two nations, has been challenged by some scholars in the post–Cold War era, who have noted that the bipolar world only exists if one ignores all of the various movements and conflicts that occurred without influence from either of the two superpowers.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.signalalpha.com/Cold_War.html Conflicts of Superpower] by Signal Alpha News Achieve Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, much of the conflict between the superpowers was fought in &quot;[[proxy war]]s&quot;, which more often than not involved issues more complex than the standard Cold War oppositions.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/fordham.htm Economic Interests, Party, and Ideology in Early Cold War Era U.S. Foreign Policy] Benjamin O. Fordham by World Peace Foundation; Massachusetts Institute of Technology April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s, the term [[hyperpower]] began to be applied to the United States, as the sole remaining superpower of the Cold War era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nossal&quot;/&gt; This term, coined by French foreign minister [[Hubert Védrine]] in the 1990s, is controversial and the validity of classifying the United States in this way is disputed. One notable opponent to this theory, [[Samuel P. Huntington]], rejects this theory in favor of a multipolar [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].

Other International Relations theorists, such as [[Henry Kissinger]], theorize that because the threat of the Soviet Union no longer exists to formerly American-dominated regions such as Japan and Western Europe, American influence is only declining since the end of the Cold War, because such regions no longer need protection or have necessarily similar foreign policies as the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger, ''Diplomacy'', p. 24,26&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 that ended the [[Cold War]], the post–Cold War world was sometimes considered as a [[Unipolarity|unipolar]] world,&lt;ref name=&quot;Krauthammer1&quot;&gt;Charles Krauthammer, [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19910201faessay6067/charles-krauthammer/the-unipolar-moment.html The Unipolar Moment], ''Foreign Policy Magazine'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaikoforum.com/P03_19_122.pdf |title=www.gaikoforum.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States]] as the world's sole remaining superpower&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1217752.stm Country profile: United States of America], BBC News.

Huntington]], &quot;The United States, of course, is the sole state with preeminence in every domain of power – economic, military, diplomatic, ideological, technological, and cultural – with the reach and capabilities to promote its interests in virtually every part of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;affairs&quot;&gt;[http://www-stage.foreignaffairs.org/19990301faessay966/samuel-p-huntington/the-lonely-superpower.html www-stage.foreignaffairs.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts argue that this older assessment of [[global politics]] was too simplified, in part because of the difficulty in classifying the [[European Union]] at its current stage of development. Others argue that the notion of a superpower is outdated, considering complex global economic interdependencies, and propose that the world is [[Polarity in international relations#Multipolarity today|multipolar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Global list (No superpower)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/printStoryId.aspx?StoryId=3553|title=The Global list (No superpower)|accessdate=2006-06-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060613215234/http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/printStoryId.aspx?StoryId=3553 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post (No superpower)&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/03/AR2006030302055.html|title=Washington Post (No superpower)|accessdate=2006-06-10 | work=The Washington Post | date=5 March 2006 | first=David | last=Von Drehle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Globalpolicy.org (No superpower)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/challenges/competitors/2005/0315chinapower.htm|title=Globalpolicy.org (No superpower)|accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Times (No superpower)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/ED05Ak01.html|title=A Times (No superpower)|accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Samuel P. Huntington, &quot;There is now only one superpower. But that does not mean that the world is unipolar. A unipolar system would have one superpower, no significant major powers, and many minor powers.&quot; Huntington thinks, &quot;Contemporary international politics&quot; ... &quot;is instead a strange hybrid, a uni-multipolar system with one superpower and several major powers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;affairs&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, there has been some recent speculation that the United States is declining in relative power as the rest of the world rises to match its levels of economic and technological development. Citing economic hardships, Cold War allies becoming less dependent on the United States, a declining [[US Dollar|dollar]], and the rise of other great powers around the world, some experts have suggested the possibility of the United States losing its superpower status in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;uiuc-superpower&quot;&gt;Unger J (2008), [http://news.illinois.edu/news/08/0508superpower.html U.S. no longer superpower, now a besieged global power, scholars say] ''University of Illinois''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Almond |first=Steve |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/08/22/american_decline |title=Seizing American supremacy |publisher=Salon.com |date=2007-08-22 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts03012005.html |title=The Coming End of the American Superpower |publisher=Counterpunch.org |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=April 28, 2007 – |url=http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/0428us_economics_martinez-diaz.aspx |title=U.S.: A Losing Superpower? |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=2007-04-28 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics, institutions and other qualified commentators sometimes identify potential superpowers thought to have a strong likelihood of being recognized as superpowers in the 21st century. The record of such predictions has not been perfect. For example in the 1980s some commentators thought [[Japan]] would become a superpower, due to its large GDP and high economic growth at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967823,00.html?promoid=googlep time.com] 1988 article &quot;Japan From Superrich To Superpower&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's economy would also crash in 1991, creating of a long period of economic slump in the country known the ''[[Lost Decade (Japan)|The Lost Years]].''  As of August 2012, Japan has not fully recovered from the 1991 crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan eyes end to decades long deflation|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/17/japan-economy-estimate-idUSL4E8JH1TC20120817|author=Leika Kihara|publisher=Reuters|date=August 17, 2012|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
