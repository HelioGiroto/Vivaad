'''Colby College''' is a [[private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located on Mayflower Hill in [[Waterville, Maine]].  Founded in 1813, it is the 12th-oldest independent liberal arts college in the United States.  Colby was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students, the first of whom was [[Mary Caffrey Low]]-- valedictorian of the Class of 1875.&lt;ref name=&quot;colby.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.colby.edu/about_cs/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 1,800 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually.  The college offers 54 major fields of study and 30 minors.  More than two thirds of Colby students participate in study abroad programs.  Colby College competes in the [[NESCAC]] conference and is one of the &quot;[[Little Ivies]]&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:The formative period in Colby's history.djvu|page=4|thumb|200px|The Charter of Colby College, granted in 1813 by the Massachusetts Legislature.]]

On February 27, 1813, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a petition to establish the '''Maine Literary and Theological Institution,''' the 33rd chartered college in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Mayflower Hill, A History of Colby College, Earl Smith, University Press of New England, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was led by [[Baptists]] who had come to the region for missionary work, and who wanted to train their own ministers, to end the reliance on England for providing men of learning. From 1816-1818, the new institution found a home in Waterville on 179 acres of land donated by citizens.  In 1818, trustees assigned the institution to Rev. [[Jeremiah Chaplin]], a Baptist theologian.  Chaplin arrived in Waterville in the summer of 1818 with his family and seven students, including [[George Dana Boardman]], the institution's first graduate.  They were put up in a vacant Waterville home, and in that home the first classes were held.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;  

After Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820, the first Maine legislature affirmed the Massachusetts charter for the institution, but made significant changes.  Students could no longer be denied admission based on religion, the institution was prohibited from applying a religious test when selecting board members, and the trustees now had the authority to grant degrees.  A turning point, the Maine Literary and Theological Institution was renamed '''Waterville College''' on February 5, 1821.  In 1822, [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]], who would become a celebrated martyr to emancipation and to freedom of the press, graduates as [[valedictorian]].  In 1825, the theological department was discontinued.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAGDE&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Maine League of Historical Societies and Museums |editor=Doris A. Isaacson |title=Maine: A Guide 'Down East' |year=1970 |publisher=Courier-Gazette, Inc. |location=Rockland, Me | pages = 226–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1833, Rev. [[Rufus Babcock]] became Colby's second president, and students form the nation’s first college-based anti-slavery society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/education/activism/stories/antislavery.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many young men were called away from school to join the fight; from Waterville College, [[Richard C. Shannon]], [[Henry C. Merriam]], and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]].  Twenty-seven Waterville College students perished in the war, and more than 100 men from the town.  In the years following the war, as was the case at many American colleges, Waterville College was left with few students remaining to pay the bills and a depleted endowment.  Waterville College was on the verge of closing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

===Colby University===
[[File:Colby University Logo.png|thumb|left|320px|alt=Colby University Logo|The emblem of Colby University, c. 1895]]  On August 9th, 1865, a Boston merchant, prominent Baptist philanthropist, and Maine native [[Gardner Colby]], attended Waterville College's commencement dinner, and unbeknownst to anyone in attendance except college president [[James Tift Champlin]], announced a matching $50,000 donation that would allow the college to remain open.  On January 23, 1867, the college was renamed '''Colby University''' in gratitude. &lt;ref&gt;Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, p 93, accessed at http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/colbiana_books/4/#b.mon.tag&lt;/ref&gt;

Now on solid financial footing and just 16 months after [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|The Battle of Appomattox Court House]], trustees of the college voted to construct a library and chapel to honor the Colby men who died in the war, making Memorial Hall the first Civil War memorial erected on a college campus.  The building began construction in the summer of 1867, and dedicated at commencement in 1869.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;  At commencement in 1871, The Lion of Lucerne, a sculpture by [[Martin Milmore]], was added as the centerpiece of the building.  The lion was brought to Miller Library from Memorial Hall in January 1962.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Lion of Lucerne&quot;, Colby College Libraries, accessed: http://libguides.colby.edu/content.php?pid=240829&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of, 1871 Colby University was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students.&lt;ref name = &quot;MAGDE&quot; /&gt;  The national [[Sigma Kappa]] sorority was founded at Colby in 1874 by the college's first five female students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sigmakappa.org/about/default.asp?page=history&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the buildings is named after the first woman to attend, [[Mary Caffrey Low]], who was the valedictorian of the Class of 1875.&lt;ref name=&quot;colby.edu&quot;/&gt;

===Colby College===

On January 25th, 1889, Colby president Nathaniel Butler, Jr. '73, having come from the [[University of Chicago]], renamed the &quot;university&quot; '''Colby College'''.&lt;ref&gt;Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, p 129, accessed at http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/colbiana_books/4/#b.mon.tag&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, Colby celebrated its centennial, marking not the date of the original charter, but the date of its charter from the new State of Maine in 1820.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Mayflower Hill===
[[Franklin W. Johnson]] was appointed president of the college in June 1929.  Citing a recently released Maine Higher Education Survey Report, a cramped location between the river and the railroad tracks, an aging physical plant, and lack of dining facilities for men, amongst others, Johnson began a campaign to move the college to a more adequate location.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;  Franklin's campaign to raise funds for the move were complicated by the [[Great Depression]], but ended up including a gift from the City of Waterville - in an effort to keep Colby from relocating to Augusta, Waterville deeded {{convert|600|acre|km2}} on Mayflower Hill, near the outskirts of the city, to the college.&lt;ref&gt;The Man of Mayflower Hill: A Biography of Franklin W. Johnson, by Ernest C. Marriner, Colby College Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, construction broke ground on Lorimer Chapel, the first building on the new campus Mayflower Hill campus.  In 1951, the last class took place on the old campus in Coburn Hall.

In 1984, following an investigation of campus life commissioned by the Board of Trustees, a decision was made to withdraw recognition from Colby’s Greek system as it was seen to be &quot;exclusionary by nature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E4D6163BF931A15756C0A962948260&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=%22colby%20college%22%20Fraternities&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=AROUND THE NATION; Justice Upholds Ban On Colby Fraternities | date=1984-05-22 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day that fraternity and sorority decision was announced happened to fall on a Sunday and was known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; by many on the campus at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/colby.mag/issues/current/features.php?issueid=34&amp;articleid=479&amp;contentpageno=1&amp;PHPSESSID=2ee6481849d45e341a3760feb8d8c983&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, William D. Adams, a demonstrated advocate of liberal arts education, became the President of Colby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/administration_cs/president/&lt;/ref&gt;  Adams initiated strategic plan that detailed aspirations and directions for the institution,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/administration_cs/president/upload/ColbyStratPlan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a fundraising effort for which raised $376 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/colby.mag/issues/55/article/1183/reaching-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

Students choose from courses in 54 major fields and have wide flexibility in designing independent study programs, electing special majors, and participating in internships and study-abroad programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  Colby's most popular majors are Government, Economics, and Biology. Consequently, the three majors are also some of Colby's strongest. The Economics Department is the 6th most published of any liberal arts school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/lobby/?code=EC&lt;/ref&gt;  The Government Department's faculty are cited in media outlets including the [[New York Times]] and [[Washington Post]], and are called to testify on Capitol Hill on a regular basis.  Colby emphasizes project-based learning,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/about_cs/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; while volunteer programs and service learning take many students into the surrounding community.    

===4–1–4 Calendar===
The academic year follows a 4–1–4 with two four-course semesters plus a Winter Term session in January. The Winter Term, often called &quot;Jan-plan&quot;, allows students to enroll in one intensive course, pursue independent research, or complete an off-campus internship.

===The Goldfarb Center===
The Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement organizes Colby's engagement in the local community, the national stage, and throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/goldfarb&lt;/ref&gt;  The Goldfarb Center organizes and awards the [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award]] annually;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/goldfarb/lovejoy/&lt;/ref&gt; it also organizes the The [[Morton A. Brody]] Distinguished Judicial Service Award,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/goldfarb/brody/&lt;/ref&gt; the William R. and Linda K. Cotter Debate Series, the Senator George J. Mitchell Distinguished International Lecture Series, and Colby's Visiting Fellows Program.  The Oak Institute for International Human Rights at Colby is a Goldfarb Center program.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.colby.edu/oak/&lt;/ref&gt;  The center also organizes Colby's civic engagement programs: the Colby Volunteer Center&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/goldfarb/cvc/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; and Colby Cares about Kids.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.colby.edu/ccak/&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Year Experience===
In 1975 Colby instituted its first outdoor orientation trip. The program, which has been expanded to include on-campus orientation and is called COOT&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, now offers 52 trips in the fall semester and an ICED COOT program for those students who spend the first semester of their freshman year abroad. Destinations for fall trips include hiking trips at [[Acadia National Park]], [[Mount Katahdin]], and other locations around Maine; canoe trips on the [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] and Moose Rivers, along with other trips around the state. The various trips are designed to appeal to incoming students with  a variety of interests and fitness levels and more &quot;front country&quot; trips have been added in recent years including service- and arts-oriented options.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;http://www.colby.edu/administration_cs/dos/coot/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goals of COOT are to ease new students' transition into college and to introduce them to the Maine's cultural and natural resources. COOT leaders are chosen from upperclass students who apply for these positions and are expected to help the students both during and after the trip with the adjustment to campus life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

===Ranking===
Together with [[Bates College]] and [[Bowdoin College]], Colby is one of three highly selective liberal arts colleges in Maine.

Colby's [[Alma Mater (College song)|alma mater]] is &quot;Hail, Colby, Hail&quot;. The lyrics to the song were written by Karl R. Kennison from the class of 1906 and it is sung to the tune of &quot;[[O Canada]]&quot;.  In 1979, the second line was changed from &quot;thy sons from far and near&quot; to &quot;thy people far and near.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colby.edu/alumni_parents_cs/alumni/keeping_up/ootb/2001/sep.cfm Alma Mater Matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Hail, Colby, Hail!
:Thy people far and near
:Stand at thy call,
:Our Alma Mater dear.
:Thy shaded paths recall our steps
:To gather at thy shrine.
:Thy memoried halls reclaim our hearts
:Till all our thoughts are thine.

:Hail, Colby, Hail!
:Hail, Colby, Hail!
:To thee we lift our hearts and homage pay;
:Our Alma Mater, Hail the Blue and Gray!
