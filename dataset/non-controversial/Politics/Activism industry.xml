The '''activism industry''' consists of organizations and individuals engaged in [[activism]], defined as involvement in action for the purposes of bringing about change on a funded or contract basis. Activism is often undertaken in a &quot;[[full-time]]&quot; capacity, whereby organizations and individuals formally classify the activity as &quot;[[core business]]&quot;.  The number of organizations who employ people to perform this work is sufficiently large, hence why &quot;[[activism]]&quot; is now a job classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Careers in Activism|url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3car/pdf/CareersinActivism2005.pdf|publisher=UTM Career Centre|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=January 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movements across the political spectrum can be described as activist in nature.

Many organizations whose primary activity is activism may be defined as being [[nonprofit]] organizations or [[non-governmental organization]]s.  Most activist organizations do no [[manufacturing]] of goods.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The term &quot;activism industry&quot; has often been used to refer to the practice of outsourcing [[canvassing]] fundraising operations. However, activist organizations engage in other activities as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=11993 The Activism Industry: The problem with the left's model of outsourced grassroots canvassing], by Dana R. Fisher. The American Prospect. Sept. 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lobbying]], or the influencing of decisions made by government, is another activist tactic.  Many groups have designated staff assigned specifically for lobbying purposes. In the United States, lobbying is regulated by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gklaw.com/publication.cfm?publication_id=724 New Federal Lobbying Law Reporting Periods Begin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism in capitalist societies==
In [[capitalism|capitalist]] societies, when [[civil liberties]] are present, full-time activists can be employed on [[wages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Most governments encourage public support of non-profit organizations by granting some form of [[income tax|tax]] relief for donations to [[charitable organization]]s, sometimes including donations of time and money.  Governments may attempt to deny these benefits to activists by restricting the political activity of tax-exempt organizations.  This can be controversial because the line between political activity, and educational or religious activity, is not always clear.

Free societies rarely have explicit restrictions on political activism; however, many forms of activism involve committing other crimes, such as [[trespass|aggravated trespassing]]. 

==Forced activism==
Reports have emerged regarding powerful organizations, such as government bureaucracies and large corporations, as well as reports regarding the history of organized activism for the promotion of their own interests. In addition to these claims, is a belief that on occasion, employees of the organizations and others have been coerced participants.{{cn|date=May 2012}} 

===Techniques===
A number of alleged techniques for coercion are:{{cn|date=May 2012}}

* Paid or obligatory attendance, on work time, at [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], where the size of the crowd is often used as a gauge for the level of support behind a [[policy]] or set of policies. 
* Promotion or continued employment dependent upon voluntary attendance at certain functions or demonstrations. 
* Requests by [[Official|government officials]] or [[Management#Levels_of_management|corporate managers]] that a body of people support a public letter of support for a particular cause. 
* Calling public meetings for the sole purpose of criticizing an individual (who may also be present at the meeting) who is believed to hold views that are unacceptable to the organization that he/she is an employee or member of (this technique was commonly used in the [[People's Republic of China]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]]).{{cn|date=May 2012}} 
* Compulsory, or strongly encouraged, financial or time contributions to causes or organizations (&quot;[[peace loans]]&quot; in  [[Warsaw Pact]] countries during the 1950s operated on this basis).{{cn|date=May 2012}}
