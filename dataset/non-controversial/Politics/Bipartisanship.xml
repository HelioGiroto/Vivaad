'''Bipartisanship''' is a political situation, usually in the context of a [[two-party system]], in which opposing political parties find [[common ground]] through compromise.

==Usage==
The adjective ''bipartisan'' can refer to any [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], [[Act of Congress|act]], [[Resolution (law)|resolution]], or other [[political]] act in which both of the two major [[political parties]] agree about all or many parts of a political choice. Bipartisanship involves trying to find common ground, but there is debate whether the issues needing common ground are peripheral or central ones.&lt;ref name=twsNovA23&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[compromise]]s are called bipartisan if they reconcile the desires of both parties from an original version of [[legislation]] or other proposal. Failure to attain bipartisan support in such a system can easily lead to [[gridlock (politics)|gridlock]], often angering each other and their [[constituencies]]. An analysis in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in March 2010 suggested that the present state of American politics is marked by ''oppositional politics'' which has left voters cynical about the process.&lt;ref name=twsNovA16&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bipartisanship requires &quot;hard work&quot;, is &quot;sometimes dull&quot;, and entails trying to find &quot;common ground&quot; but enables &quot;serious problem solving&quot;, according to editorial writers at the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref name=twsNovA12&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feature of two-party system==
According to political analyst [[James Fallows]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', bipartisanship is a phenomenon belonging to a [[two-party system]] such as the political system of the [[United States]] and does not apply to a [[parliamentary system]] such as [[Great Britain]], since the minority party is not involved in helping write legislation or voting for it.&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallows argues that in a two-party system, the minority party can be obstructionist and thwart the actions of the majority party.&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa/&gt; However, analyst Anne Applebaum in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' suggested that partisanship had been rampant in the [[United Kingdom]] and described it as &quot;a country in which the government and the opposition glower at each other from opposite sides of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], in which [[backbencher]]s jeer when their opponents speak.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsNovA21&gt;{{cite news

 |title= Can the Brits learn bipartisanship?

 |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/31/AR2010053103112.html
 |accessdate= 2010-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applebaum suggested there was ''bipartisanship'' in Britain, meaning a coalition in 2010 between the opposing major parties, but that it remained to be seen whether the coalition can stay together to solve serious problems such as tackling Britain's financial crisis.&lt;ref name=twsNovA21/&gt;

Bipartisanship (in the context of a two-party system) is the opposite of [[partisanship]] which is characterized by a lack of cooperation between rival political parties.&lt;ref name=twsNovA13/&gt; [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framer]] [[James Madison]] argued in the [[Federalist Papers]] that a danger to democracies were factions, which he defined as a group that pushed its interests to the detriment of the national interest. While the framers of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not think that political parties would play a role in American politics, political parties have long been a major force in American politics, and the nation has alternated between periods of intense party rivalry and partisanship, as well as periods of bipartisanship. According to Robert Siegel of ''[[National Public Radio]]'', there has been virtually no cooperation between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. during the few years before 2010.&lt;ref name=twsNovA13&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bipartisanship can also be between two or more opposite groups (e.g. liberal and conservative) to agree and determine a plan of action on an urgent matter that is of great importance to voters. This interpretation brings bipartisanship closer to the more applied notion of [[postpartisan]] decision-making; a solution-focused approach that creates a governance model with third-party arbiters used to detect [[bias]].

==In U.S. politics==
There have been periods of bipartisanship in American politics, such as when the [[United States Senate|Senate]] Republicans supported legislation by Democratic President [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] in the early 1960s, and when Democrats worked with Republican President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=twsNovA24&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]] in 2010, however, there was wide disagreement between the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]] because the minority party has been voting as a block against major legislation, according to James Fallows in ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;twsNovA11aa&quot;/&gt; In 2010, the minority party has the ability to &quot;discipline its ranks&quot; so that none join the majority, and this situation in the [[United States Congress|Congress]] is unprecedented, according to Fallows.&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa/&gt; He sees this inability to have bipartisanship as evidence of a &quot;structural failure of American government.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsNovA11aa/&gt; Adviser to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama|Obama]], [[Rahm Emanuel]], said the period from 2008&amp;ndash;2010 was marked by extreme partisanship.&lt;ref name=twsNovA14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the U.S. election of 2010, with sizeable gains by Republicans in the House and Senate, analyst Charles Babington of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' suggested that both parties remained far apart on major issues such as immigration and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] while there may be chances for agreement about lesser issues such as [[electric car]]s, [[nuclear power]], and tax breaks for businesses; Babington was not optimistic about chances for bipartisanship on major issues in the next few years.&lt;ref name=twsNovJx42&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While analyst Benedict Carey writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' agrees political analysts tend to agree that government will continue to be divided and marked by paralysis and feuding, there was research suggesting that humans have a &quot;profound capacity through which vicious adversaries can form alliances,&quot; according to [[University of California|Berkeley]] professor Dacher Keltner.&lt;ref name=twsNovX445&gt;{{cite news

==Criticisms==
Bipartisanship has been criticized because it can obscure the differences between parties, making voting for candidates based on policies difficult in a democracy.&lt;ref name=test&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-11-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the concept of bipartisanship has been criticized as discouraging agreements between more than two parties, thus exercising a tyranny of the majority by forcing voters to side with one of the two largest parties.
