{{Feminism sidebar}}

'''Women's suffrage''' or '''woman suffrage'''&lt;ref&gt;''Women's suffrage'' is more common in [[British English|UK English]], and ''woman suffrage'' is more common in [[American English|US English]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[women's rights|right of women]] to vote and to run for office. Limited voting rights were gained by women in [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Finland]] and some [[western United States|western U.S.]]&amp;nbsp;states in the late&amp;nbsp;19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen Carol DuBois|title=Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YVfiWHH6kbkC&amp;pg=PT174|year=1998|publisher=NYU Press|pages=174–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; International organizations were formed to coordinate efforts, especially the International Council of Women (1888) and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Allison Sneider,  &quot;The New Suffrage History: Voting Rights in International Perspective&quot;, ''History Compass,'' (July 2010) 8#7 pp 692–703,&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, [[New Zealand]] became the first nation to extend the right to vote to all adult women. The women in [[South Australia]] achieved the same right in 1894 but became the first to obtain the right to stand (run) for Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 |title=Foundingdocs.gov.au |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elections.org.nz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=EC |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html |title=Elections.org.nz |publisher=Elections.org.nz |date=2005-04-13 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first European country to introduce women's suffrage was the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]—then a part of the [[Russian Empire]] with autonomous powers—which also produced the world's first female members of parliament as a result of the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1907|1907 parliamentary elections]].

In most Western nations, women's suffrage came at the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], with some important late adopters such as [[France]] in 1944 and [[Switzerland]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie G. Smith, ed.|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA3-PA171|year= 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=171 vol 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's suffrage has generally been recognized after political campaigns to obtain it were waged. In many countries it was granted before [[universal suffrage]]. Women's suffrage is explicitly stated as a right under the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1979.

==History==
[[File:AnnaIIStolQued.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Anna II, Abbess of Quedlinburg]]. By virtue of their rank within the Catholic and Protestant churches, [[abbess]]es were permitted to sit and vote in various European national assemblies in the pre-modern era.]]

In ancient [[Athenian Democracy]], often cited as the birthplace of democracy, only men were permitted to vote. Through subsequent centuries, Europe was generally ruled by monarchs, though various forms of Parliament arose at different times. The high rank ascribed to [[abbess]]es within the [[Catholic Church]] permitted some women the right to sit and vote at national assemblies - as with various high ranking abbesses in Medieval Germany, who were ranked among the independent princes of the empire and could therefore sit and vote in the Diet. Their protestant successors enjoyed the same privilege almost into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Abbess&lt;/ref&gt; In recent centuries. Generally speaking however, the emergence of modern democracy generally began with male citizens obtaining the right to vote in advance of female citizens. 

[[File:Catherine Helen Spence.jpg|thumb|upright|[[South Australia]]n suffragette [[Catherine Helen Spence]] stood for office in 1897. In a first for the modern world, South Australia granted women the right to stand for Parliament in 1895.]]
[[File:Woman suffrage headquarters Cleveland.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman Suffrage Headquarters, Cleveland, 1913]]

A movement for women's suffrage originated in France in the 1780s and 1790s, where [[Marquis de Condorcet|Antoine Condorcet]] and [[Olympe de Gouges]] advocated women's suffrage in national elections.{{CN|date=November 2012}} Various countries, colonies and states granted restricted women's suffrage in the latter half of the 19th century.

In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was in effect during the [[Age of Liberty]] (1718–1771).&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson-Sjögren 1866&quot; /&gt; Other possible contenders for first &quot;country&quot; to grant female suffrage include the [[Corsican Republic]] (1755), the [[Pitcairn Islands]] (1838), the [[Isle of Man]] (1881), and [[Franceville, New Hebrides|Franceville]] (1889), but some of these had brief existences as independent states and others were not clearly independent.

In 1756, [[Lydia Taft]] became the first legal woman voter in colonial America. This occurred under [[British North America|British rule]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Colony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;address&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapin |first=Judge Henry |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Address Delivered at the Unitarian Church in Uxbridge; 1864 |publisher=Charles Hamilton Press (Harvard Library; from Google Books)|page=172 |year=2081 |location=Worcester, Mass. |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in a [[New England]] [[town meeting]] and she voted on at least three occasions in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blacks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Uxbridge Breaks Tradition and Makes History: [[Lydia Taft]] by Carol Masiello|publisher=The Blackstone Daily|url=http://blackstonedaily.com/Journeys/cm-lt.htm|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried women who owned property could vote in [[New Jersey]] from 1776 to 1807.

[[Image:First female MPs of the Turkish Parliament (1935).jpg|thumb|upright| Eighteen female MPs joined the Turkish Parliament in 1935]]

In the 1792 elections in [[Sierra Leone]], all heads of household—one-third of whom were African women—could vote.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama ''Rough Crossings'' (2006), p. 374,&lt;/ref&gt;

The female descendants of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|''Bounty'' mutineers]] who lived on [[Pitcairn Islands]] could vote from 1838, and this right transferred with their resettlement to [[Norfolk Island]] (now an Australian external territory) in 1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;elections.org.nz&quot;/&gt;

The seed for the first Woman's Rights Convention{{where|date=November 2012}} was planted in 1840, when [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] met [[Lucretia Mott]] at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, the conference that refused to seat Mott and other women delegates from America because of their sex. In 1851, Stanton met temperance worker [[Susan B. Anthony]], and shortly the two would be joined in the long struggle to secure the vote for women. In 1868 Anthony encouraged working women from the printing and sewing trades in New York, who were excluded from men's trade unions, to form Workingwomen's Associations. As a delegate to the National Labor Congress in 1868 Anthony persuaded the committee on female labor to call for votes for women and equal pay for equal work, although the men at the conference deleted the reference to the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Web Wizardry - http://www.web-wizardry.com |url=http://susanbanthonyhouse.org/her-story/biography.php |title=Biography of Susan B. Anthony at |publisher=Susanbanthonyhouse.org |date=1906-03-13 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the [[Wyoming Territory]] voted as of 1869.

The 1871 [[Paris Commune]] recognized women's right to vote, but with its fall women were again deprived of the right, which would only be recognized again in July 1944 by [[Charles de Gaulle]] (at that time most of France—including Paris—was under Nazi occupation; Paris was liberated the following month).

In 1881 the [[Isle of Man]], an internally self-governing dependent territory of the British Crown, enfranchised women property owners and delivered the first installment of women's right to vote in parliamentary elections within the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;elections.org.nz&quot;/&gt;

[[Pacific Ocean|The Pacific]] colony of [[Franceville, New Hebrides|Franceville]], declaring independence in 1889, became the first [[Self-governance|self-governing]] nation to adopt universal suffrage without distinction of sex or color;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wee, Small Republics: A Few Examples of Popular Government,&quot; ''Hawaiian Gazette'', November 1, 1895, p1&lt;/ref&gt; however, it soon came back under [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial rule]].

Of currently existing independent countries, [[New Zealand]] was the first to acknowledge women's right to vote in 1893 when it was a [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852|self-governing British colony]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Campbell Aikman, 'History, Constitutional' in McLintock, A.H. (ed),''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'', 3 vols, Wellington, NZ:R.E. Owen, Government Printer, 1966, vol 2, pp.67–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Unrestricted women's suffrage in terms of voting rights (women were not initially permitted to stand for election) was adopted in New Zealand in 1893. Following a successful movement led by [[Kate Sheppard]], the [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|women's suffrage bill]] was adopted mere weeks before the [[New Zealand general election, 1893|general election of that year]]. The women of the British protectorate of [[Cook Islands]] obtained the same right soon after and beat New Zealand's women to the polls in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EC |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html#1 |title=Elections.org.nz |publisher=Elections.org.nz |date=2005-04-13 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-governing British colony of [[South Australia]] enacted universal suffrage and, furthermore, enabled women to stand for the colonial parliament in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution (Female Suffrage) Act 1895 (SA) |publisher=National Archives of Australia|url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8|accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth of [[Australia]] federated in 1901, with women voting and standing for office in some states. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Federal Parliament]] extended voting rights to all adult women for Federal elections from 1902 (with the exception of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] women in some states).&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/milestone.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European country to introduce women's suffrage was the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. Amidst administrative reforms following the 1905 uprising, Finnish women's demand for both the right to vote (universal and equal suffrage) and the right to stand for election were met in 1906. The world's first female members of parliament were also Finnish, when on 1907, 19&amp;nbsp;women took up their places in the [[Parliament of Finland]] as a result of the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1907|1907 parliamentary elections]].

[[Image:Poster23.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Soviet poster celebrates women's right to vote and to be elected. Political candidates in the Soviet Union were highly vetted by the one-party government.]]

In the years before [[World War I]], women in Norway&amp;nbsp;(1913) and Denmark&amp;nbsp;(1915) also won the right to vote, as did women in the remaining Australian states. Near the end of the war, Canada, Soviet Russia, Germany, and Poland also recognized women's right to participate in the elective franchise. British women over 30 had the vote in 1918, Dutch women in 1919, and American women won the vote August 26, 1920 with the passage of the 19th Amendment. Women in Turkey won voting rights in 1926. In 1928, British women won suffrage on the same terms as men, that is, for persons 21&amp;nbsp;years&amp;nbsp;old and older. One of the most recent jurisdictions to acknowledge women's full right to vote was [[Bhutan]] in [[Bhutanese general election, 2008|2008]] (its first national elections).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mian Ridge |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2008/0325/p04s01-wosc.html |title=&quot;Bhutan makes it official: it's a democracy.&quot; '&amp;#39;Christian Science Monitor,'&amp;#39; March 25, 2008 |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voting rights for women were introduced into [[international law]] by the United Nations' Human Rights Commission, whose elected chair was [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In&amp;nbsp;1948 the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; Article&amp;nbsp;21 stated: &quot;(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.&quot;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Convention on the Political Rights of Women]], which went into force in&amp;nbsp;1954, enshrining the equal rights of women to vote, hold office, and access public services as set out by national laws.

==Suffrage movements==
[[Image:Emmeline Pankhurst adresses crowd.jpg|thumb|right|180px|After selling her home, British activist [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] travelled constantly, giving speeches throughout Britain and the United States. One of her most famous speeches, ''[[wikisource:Freedom or death|Freedom or death]]'', was delivered in Connecticut in 1913.]]
The suffrage movement was a very broad one which encompassed women and men with a very broad range of views. One major division, especially in Britain, was between [[Suffragette|suffragist]]s, who sought to create change constitutionally, and [[suffragette]]s, led by iconic English political activist [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], who in 1903 formed the more militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2008/07/emmeline-pankhurst-women-cause |title=Newstatesman.com |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2008-07-14 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pankhurst would not be satisfied with anything but action on the question of women's enfranchisement, with &quot;deeds, not words&quot; the organisation's motto.&lt;ref&gt;Maroula Joannou, June Purvis (1998) [http://books.google.com/books?id=8dHBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=women's+social+and+political+union+emmeline+pankhurst&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H9CHTsvJCoPEtAbCyMTgAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=women's%20social%20and%20political%20union%20emmeline%20pankhurst&amp;f=false The women's suffrage movement: new feminist perspectives] p.157. Manchester University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a diversity of views on a &quot;woman's place&quot;. Some who campaigned for women's suffrage felt that women were naturally kinder, gentler, and more concerned about weaker members of society, especially children. It was often assumed that women voters would have a civilizing effect on politics and would tend to support controls on alcohol, for example. Societies believed that although a woman's place was in the home, she should be able to influence laws which impacted upon that home. Other campaigners felt that men and women should be equal in every way and that there was no such thing as a woman's &quot;natural role&quot;. There were also differences in opinion about other voters. Some campaigners felt that all adults were entitled to a vote, whether rich or poor, male or female, and regardless of race. Others saw women's suffrage as a way of canceling out the votes of lower class or non-white men.

==Details by country==
[[File:Women suffrage cartoon.png|thumb|upright|Australian women's rights were lampooned in this 1887 ''Melbourne Punch'' cartoon: A hypothetical female member foists her baby's care on the House Speaker. [[South Australian]] women had achieved the vote in 1894.]]

===Asia===

====India====
Basu shows that the Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1917. It sought votes for women and the right to hold legislative office on the same basis as men. These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[All-India Muslim League]].&lt;ref name = Basu&gt;Aparna Basu, &quot;Women's Struggle for the Vote: 1917-1937,&quot; ''Indian Historical Review,'' (Jan 2008) 35#1 pp 128-143&lt;/ref&gt;  British and [[Feminism in India|Indian feminists]] combined in 1918 to publish a magazine ''Stri Dharma'' that featured international news from a feminist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Elizabeth Tusan, &quot;Writing Stri Dharma: international feminism, nationalist politics, and women's press advocacy in late colonial India,&quot; ''Women's History Review,'' (Dec 2003) 12#4 pp p623-649&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919 in the [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms]], the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either).&lt;ref name = Basu/&gt; In [[Bengal]] province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. The original idea came from British suffragettes. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite that favoured European fashions and ideas. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Southard, &quot;Colonial Politics and Women's Rights: Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Bengal, British India in the 1920s,&quot; ''[[Modern Asian Studies]],'' (March 1993) 27#2 pp 397-439&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Government of India Act 1935]] the [[British Raj]] set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women's leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Basu (Jan 2008), 140-43&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
[[Pakistan]] was part of India until 1947, when it became independent. Women received full suffrage in 1947.  Ali points out that [[Women in Pakistan|Muslim women]] leaders from all classes actively supported the Pakistan movement in the mid-1940s. Their movement was led by wives and other relatives of leading politicians. Women were sometimes organized into large-scale public demonstrations. Before 1947 there was a tendency for the Muslim women in Punjab to vote for the [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] while their menfolk supported the [[Unionist Party (Punjab)|Unionist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Azra Asghar Ali, &quot;Indian Muslim Women's Suffrage Campaign: Personal Dilemma and Communal Identity 1919-47,&quot; ''Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society,'' (April 1999) 47#2 pp 33-46&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bangladesh====
[[Bangladesh]] was (mostly) the province of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971.  Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Dilara Choudhury,  and Al Masud Hasanuzzaman,  &quot;Political Decision-Making in Bangladesh and the Role of Women,&quot; ''Asian Profile,'' (Feb 1997) 25#1 pp 53-69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
In the first half of the 20th century, [[Indonesia]] (pre-independence era as [[Dutch East Indies]]) was one of the slowest moving countries to gain women's suffrage. They began their fight in 1905 by introducing municipal councils that included some members elected by a restricted district. Voting rights only went to males that could read and write, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the [[Literacy|literacy rate]] for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group who pressured the Indonesian government for women's suffrage was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association) which was founded in the [[Netherlands]] in 1894. They tried to attract Indonesian membership, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of the Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and thus ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the colony gained its first national representative body called the [[Volksraad]], which still excluded women in voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, the administration introduced the right of women to be elected to urban representative institution, which resulted in some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, the law became that only European women and municipal councils could vote,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}&lt;!-- how can a municipal council be a voter? --&gt; which excluded all other women and [[Local government|local councils]]. September 1941 was when this law was amended and the law extended to women of all races by the Volksraad. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (with property and educational qualifications).&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Blackburn, Susan, 'Winning the Vote for Women in Indonesia' ''Australian Feminist Studies'', Volume 14, Number 29, 1 April 1999, pp. 207–218&lt;/ref&gt; There are a lot of women that supports the rights for women. The famous one is [[Kartini|Raden Ajeng Kartini]]. She is also famous for her quote, &quot;Habis Gelap, Terbitlah Terang&quot; or in English, &quot;After Dark, Comes the Light&quot;. It means that after bad days or dark days, there will always be hope everything including the success of the Women's Suffrage. Raden Ajeng Kartini did succeed. The other women that also fights for women's right also succeed. Raden Ajeng Kartini is so famous, Indonesians made a special date just for her, Hari Kartini, or Kartini's Day on 21 April, which is Kartini's birthday.

====Iran====
In 1963, a referendum overwhelmingly approved by voters gave women the right to vote, a right previously denied to them under the Iranian Constitution of 1906 pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 3.

====Japan====
{{Main|Women's suffrage in Japan}}
[[File:Woman's Rights Meeting Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Women's Rights meeting in [[Tokyo]], to push for women's suffrage.]]
Although women were allowed to vote in some counties in 1880,
women's suffrage was enacted at a national level in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |title=The Fusae Ichikawa Memorial Association |publisher=Ichikawa-fusae.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-01-08}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kuwait====
{{Main|Women's suffrage in Kuwait}}
Women's suffrage in Kuwait was recognized in an amendment to electoral law on May 17, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4552749.stm |title=Kuwaiti women win right to vote |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-05-17 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saudi Arabia====
In late September 2011, [[king of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud]] declared that women would be able to vote and run for office [[Saudi Arabian municipal elections, 2015|starting in 2015]]. The franchise will apply to the only (semi-)elected bodies in the kingdom, the municipal councils. Half of the seats on municipal councils are elective, and the councils have few powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/10/in-saudi-arabia-a-quiet-step-forward-for-women/247351/ &quot;In Saudi Arabia, a Quiet Step Forward for Women&quot;]. The Atlantic. Oct 26 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The council elections have been held since 2005 (the first time they were held before that was the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/saudi-king-women-given-right-to-vote-for-first-time-in-2015-nationwide-local-elections/2011/09/25/gIQAt4wwvK_story.html | title=Saudi monarch grants kingdom’s women right to vote, but driving ban remains in force |work = The Washington Post | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reu01&gt;Alsharif, Asma, [http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/25/saudi-king-women-idUSL5E7KP0IB20110925 &quot;UPDATE 2-Saudi king gives women right to vote&quot;], ''Reuters'', September 25, 2011. Retrieved 2011-09-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The King also declared that women would be eligible to be appointed to the [[Shura Council]], an unelected body that issues advisory opinions on national policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15052030 &quot;Women in Saudi Arabia to vote and run in elections&quot;], BBC, 25 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; '&quot;This is great news,&quot; said Saudi writer and women's rights activist [[Wajeha al-Huwaider]]. &quot;Women's voices will finally be heard. Now it is time to remove other barriers like not allowing women to drive cars and not being able to function, to live a normal life without male guardians.&quot;' [[Robert Lacey]], author of two books about the kingdom, said, &quot;This is the first positive, progressive speech out of the government since the [[Arab Spring]].... First the warnings, then the payments, now the beginnings of solid reform.&quot; The king made the announcement in a five-minute speech to the Shura Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reu01&quot;/&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
[[Sri Lanka]] (at that time Ceylon) was one of the first Asian countries to allow voting rights to women over the age of 21 without any restrictions. Since then, women have enjoyed a significant presence in the [[Sri Lanka]]n political arena. The zenith of this favourable condition to women has been the 1960 July General Elections, in which Ceylon elected the world's first woman Prime Minister, Mrs. [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]. Her daughter, Mrs. [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] also became the Prime Minister later in 1994, and the same year she was elected as the [[Executive president|Executive President]] of Sri Lanka, making her the fourth woman in the world to hold the portfolio.

===Africa===

====South Africa====
The franchise was extended to [[white South African|white]] women 21 years or older by the [[Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930]]. The first general election at which women could vote was the [[South African general election, 1933|1933&amp;nbsp;election]]. At that election Leila Reitz (wife of [[Deneys Reitz]]) was elected as the first female&amp;nbsp;MP, representing [[Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]]. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the [[Cape Province]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to non-[[Afrikaner]] ''uitlanders'' when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.

The right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]], was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult [[coloured]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1981. In 1984 the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was established, and the right to vote for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] and [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.

In 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] was granted to all adult citizens.

====Southern Rhodesia====
Southern Rhodesian women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie&amp;nbsp;(1875–1950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920-1928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outwith Westminster. The influx of women settlers from the United Kingdom and the British Dominions proved a decisive factor in the 1922&amp;nbsp;referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner Nationalists]] in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or &quot;responsible government&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See Lowry, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Only 51&amp;nbsp;black Rhodesians qualified for the vote in 1923 (based upon property, assets, income, and literacy). It is unclear when the first black woman qualified for the vote.

===Europe===

====Austria====
After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848&amp;nbsp;revolutions]], the right to vote was bound to the ownership of property and thus paying of taxes. While it was also bound to being male, a small number of privileged women who owned property were actually allowed to vote as a result. In&amp;nbsp;1889 this &quot;loophole&quot; was closed in [[Lower Austria]], which led some to mobilise for the struggle for political rights and the right to vote for women.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

It was only after the breakdown of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], that the new [[Austria]] would grant the general, equal, direct and secret right to vote to all citizens, regardless of sex, in 1919.

====Belgium====
[[File:C1910 Jane Brigode Belgian suffragist.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jane Brigode]], Belgian suffragist, around 1910.]]
After a revision of the constitution in 1921 the general right to vote was introduced according to the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle. Women obtained voting rights at the municipal level. As an exception, widows of World War&amp;nbsp;I were allowed to vote at the national level as well. The introduction of women's suffrage was already put onto the agenda at the time, by means of including an article in the constitution that allowed approval of women's suffrage by special law. This happened no sooner than after World War&amp;nbsp;II, in 1948. In Belgium, voting is compulsory but not enforced.

====Czech Republic====
In the former [[Bohemia]], taxpaying women and women in &quot;learned profession&quot; were allowed to vote by proxy and made eligible to the legislative body in 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1946097 P. Orman Ray: Woman Suffrage in Foreign Countries. The American Political Science Review. Vol. 12, No. 3 (Aug., 1918), pp. 469-474 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The general public obtained the right to vote and be elected, based on age but regardless of sex, when [[Czechoslovakia]] was established in 1918.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Denmark====
In Denmark, women were given the right to vote in municipal elections on April&amp;nbsp;20,&amp;nbsp;1909. However it was not until June&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;1915 that they were allowed to vote in [[Rigsdagen|Rigsdag]] elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Denmark.htm Report from Denmark] in European Database Women in Decision-making.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
[[File:Women in Finnish Parliament (1907).jpg|thumb|right|13 of the total of 19 female MPs, who were the first female MPs in the world, elected in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1907|Finland's parliamentary elections in 1907]].]]

Finland was a Swedish province until 1809, signifying that also women in Finland were allowed to vote during the Swedish [[Age of Liberty]] (1718–1771), when suffrage was granted to tax-paying female members of [[guild]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson-Sjögren 1866&quot;&gt;* Åsa Karlsson-Sjögren: ''Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten : medborgarskap och representation 1723–1866'' (&quot;Men, women and the vote: citizenship and representation 1723–1866&quot;) (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor state of modern [[Finland]], the Grand Principality of Finland was part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917 and enjoyed a high degree of [[autonomy]]. In 1863 taxpaying women were granted municipal suffrage in the country side, and in 1872, the same reform was given to the cities&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;/&gt;
The Parliament Act in 1906 established the unicameral [[parliament of Finland]] and both women and men were given the right to vote and stand for election. Thus Finnish women became the first in the world to have unrestricted rights both to vote and to stand for parliament. In elections the next year, 19 female MPs, first ones in the world, were elected and women have continued to play a central role in the nation's politics ever since. [[Miina Sillanpää]], a key figure in the worker's movement, became the first female minister in 1926.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Finland's first female President [[Tarja Halonen]] was voted into office in 2000 and for a second term in 2006. Since the 2011 parliamentary election, women's representation stands at 42,5%. In 2003&amp;nbsp;[[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]] became the first female Prime Minister of Finland, and in 2007 [[Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet]] made history as for the first time there were more women than men in the cabinet of Finland (12 vs. 8).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Germany====
In Germany, women's suffrage was granted by decree by the revolutionary [[Council of People's Deputies]] (''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'') on November&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;1918. Women were subsequently eligible to participate in elections in January&amp;nbsp;1919 for the National Assembly that drafted what became the constitution of the [[Weimar Republic]], ratified in August&amp;nbsp;1919. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Italy====
In [[Italy]], women's suffrage was not introduced following the [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], but upheld by [[Socialism|Socialist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]] activists and partly introduced by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Passmore ''Women, Gender and Fascism'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, in the [[Italian general election, 1946|1946 election]], all Italians simultaneously voted for the Constituent Assembly and for a referendum about keeping Italy a [[Kingdom of Italy|monarchy]] or creating a [[History of the Italian Republic|republic]] instead. Elections were not held in the [[Julian March]] and [[South Tyrol]] because they were under UN&amp;nbsp;occupation.

In [[Liechtenstein]], women's suffrage was granted via [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|referendum in 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AP |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/02/world/around-the-world-liechtenstein-women-win-right-to-vote.html |title=AROUND THE WORLD - Liechtenstein Women Win Right to Vote |location=Liechtenstein |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1984-07-02 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, referendums on the issue of women's suffrage had been held in [[Liechtenstein referendums, 1968|1968]], [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1971|1971]] and 1973.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Netherlands====
[[File:Wilhelmina Drucker 1917.jpg|thumb|Dutch [[Wilhelmina Drucker]], pioneer for women's rights, is portrayed by [[Truus Claes]] in 1917 on the occasion of her seventieth birthday.]]

The group working for women's suffrage in the [[Netherlands]] was the Dutch ''Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht'' (Women's Suffrage Association), founded in 1894. In 1917 Dutch women became electable in national elections, which led to the election of Suze Groeneweg of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|SDAP]] party in the general elections of 1918. On 15&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1919 a new law was drafted to allow women's suffrage without any limitations. The law was passed and the right to vote could be exercised for the first time in the general elections of 1922. Voting was made mandatory from 1918, which was not lifted until 1970.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Norway====
[[File:57041 Første kvinne legger stemmeseddelen i urnen ved valget i 1910.jpg|thumb|The first Norwegian woman casts her vote in the 1910 municipal election]]
[[Middle class]] women could vote for the first time in 1907 (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;women coming from families with a certain level of prosperity). Women in general were allowed to vote in local elections from 1910 on, and in 1913 a motion on general suffrage for women was carried unanimously in the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian parliament]] (Stortinget).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Poland====
Poland in its first days after regaining independence (1918) following the 123 year period of the Partition of Poland (before 1795 tax-paying females were allowed to take part in political life), allowed voting rights to women, as well as rights to be elected, without any restrictions.
The first women elected to the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] in 1919 were: Gabriela Balicka, Jadwiga Dziubińska, Irena Kosmowska, Maria Moczydłowska, Zofia Moraczewska, Anna Piasecka, Zofia Sokolnicka, Franciszka Wilczkowiakowa.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bs.sejm.gov.pl/F/6YEKEYLQ269HCBVE1RBBJUQ3FEP6MSL3F6AN2VGAA9AQA5BDPL-47712?func=find-b-0&amp;clear_level=2|title=Biblioteka Sejmowa /Parlamentarzyści polscy (&quot;The Sejm Library / Polish deputies&quot;): bs.gov.pl|accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rownetraktowanie.gov.pl/aktualnosci/otwarcie-wystawy-kobiety-w-parlamencie|publisher=The Government Plenipotentiary for Equal Treatment, Otwarcie wystawy &quot;Kobiety w Parlamencie&quot;: www.rownetraktowanie.gov.pl |title=Opening of the exhibition &quot;Women in Parliament&quot; |language=Polish date=24 April 2009|accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====
Carolina Beatriz Ângelo was the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] woman to vote, in 1911, for the [[First Portuguese Republic|Republican Constitutional Parliament]]. She argued that she was entitled to do so as she was the head of a household. The law was changed some time later, stating that only male heads of households could vote. In 1931 during the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, women were allowed to vote for the first time, but only if they had a high school or [[Academic degree|university degree]], while men had only to be able to read and write. In 1946 a new electoral law enlarged the possibility of female vote, but still with some differences regarding men. A law from 1968 claimed to establish &quot;equality of [[Rights|political rights]] for men and women&quot;, but a few electoral rights were reserved for men. After the [[Carnation Revolution]], in 1974, women were granted full and equal electoral rights.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Spain====
[[File:01 eibar.jpg|thumb|Women exercising the right to vote during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], 5th of November 1933.]]
In the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] provinces of [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]] women who paid a special election tax were allowed to vote and get elected to office till the abolition of the Basque [[fuero]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Nonetheless the possibility of being elected without the right to vote persisted, hence María Isabel de Ayala was elected mayor in Ikastegieta in 1865. Women's suffrage was officially adopted in 1931 not without the opposition of [[Margarita Nelken]] and [[Victoria Kent]], two female MPs (both members of the Republican Radical-Socialist Party), who argued that women in Spain and at that time, were far too immature and ignorant to vote responsibly, thus putting at risk the existence of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]]. During the [[Francoist Spain|Franco]] regime only women who were considered heads of household were allowed to vote; in the &quot;organic democracy&quot; type of elections called &quot;referendums&quot; (Franco's regime was dictatorial) women were allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sufragiomujer.blogspot.com/ |title=Blogspot.com |publisher=Sufragiomujer.blogspot.com |date=2004-02-23 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1976, during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] women fully exercised the right to vote and be elected to office.

====Sweden====
[[File:C1910 Signe Bergman Swedish suffragist.jpg|thumb|Swedish suffragist [[Signe Bergman]], around 1910.]]
During the [[Age of Liberty]] (1718–1771), tax-paying female members of [[guild]]s (most often widows), had been allowed to vote. Furthermore, new tax regulations made the participation of women in the elections even more extensive from 1743&amp;nbsp;onward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson-Sjögren 1866&quot; /&gt;

The vote was sometimes given through a male representative, which was one of the most prominent reasons cited by those in opposition to female suffrage. In 1758 women were excluded from mayoral and local elections, but continued to vote in national elections. In 1771 women's suffrage was abolished through the new constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson-Sjögren 1866&quot; /&gt;

In 1862 tax-paying women of legal majority (unmarried women and widows) were again allowed to vote in municipal elections, making Sweden the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;/&gt; The right to vote in municipal elections applied only to people of legal majority, which excluded married women, as they were juridically under the guardianship of their husbands. In 1884 the suggestion to grant women the right to vote in national elections was initially voted down in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Christer Palmquist &amp; Hans Kristian Widberg| title = Millenium. Samhällskunska| publisher = Bonniers| isbn = 91-622-599-54| year = 2004| page = 317| language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 the [[Country Association for Women's Suffrage|Swedish Society for Woman Suffrage]] was founded. In 1906 the suggestion of women's suffrage was voted down in parliament again.&lt;ref name=&quot;runeberg.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbo/0225.html |title=Runeberg.org |publisher=Runeberg.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same year, also married women were granted municipal suffrage. In 1909 women were granted eligibility to municipal councils, and in the following 1910–11 municipal elections, forty women were elected to different municipal councils,&lt;ref name=&quot;runeberg.org&quot;/&gt; [[Gertrud Månsson]] being the first. In 1914 [[Emilia Broomé]] became the first woman in the legislative assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.gu.se/kvinn/portaler/fred/biografier/broome.xml Article] about [[Emilia Broomé]] on the webpage of [[Gothenburg University Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to vote in national elections was not returned to women until 1919, and was practised again in the election of 1921, for the first time in 150 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson-Sjögren 1866&quot;/&gt; In the election of 1921 more women than men had the right to vote because women got the right just by turning 21 years old while men had to undergo military service for the right to vote. In a decision 1921 men received the same right as women and this was practised in the election of 1924.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

After the 1921 election, the first women were elected to Swedish Parliament after the suffrage: [[Kerstin Hesselgren]] in the Upper chamber and [[Nelly Thüring]] (Social Democrat), [[Agda Östlund]] (Social Democrat) [[Elisabeth Tamm]] (liberal) and [[Bertha Wellin]] (Conservative) in the Lower chamber. [[Karin Kock-Lindberg]] became the first female government minister, and in 1958, [[Ulla Lindström]] became the first acting Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;(Swedish) Mikael Sjögren, Statsrådet och genusordningen – Ulla Lindström 1954–1966 (Minister and Gender - Ulla Lindström 1954–1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey women were given the right to vote in municipal elections on March&amp;nbsp;20,&amp;nbsp;1930. Women's suffrage was achieved for parliament elections on December&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;1934 by the constitutional amendment. Turkish women who participated for the parliament elections as a first time on February&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;1935 obtained 18&amp;nbsp;seats.

{{Main|Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom}}
The campaign for women's suffrage gained momentum throughout the early part of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century as women became increasingly politically active, particularly during [[Chartism|the campaigns to reform suffrage in the United Kingdom]]. [[John Stuart Mill]], elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1865 and an open advocate of female suffrage (about to publish ''[[The Subjection of Women]]''), campaigned for an amendment to the [[Reform Act]] to include female suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Christensen Nelson (2004). &quot;Literature of the women's suffrage campaign in England&quot; p.3. Broardview Press. Retrieved 29 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Roundly defeated in an all male parliament under a Conservative government, the issue of women's suffrage came to the fore.

During the later half of the 19th century, a number of campaign groups were formed in an attempt to lobby [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] and gain support. In 1897, seventeen of these groups came together to form the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS), who held public meetings, wrote letters to politicians and published various texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cook&quot;&gt;Chris Cook (2005). &quot;The Routledge companion to Britain in the nineteenth century, 1815-1914&quot; p.124. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 the NUWSS organized its first large procession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cook&quot;/&gt; This march became known as the [[Mud March (Suffragists)|Mud March]] as over 3,000 women trudged through the streets of [[London]] from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to [[Exeter Hall]] to advocate for women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L Smith (2007). &quot;The British women's suffrage campaign, 1866-1928&quot; p.23. Pearson/Longman, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 a number of members of the NUWSS broke away and, led by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], formed the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU).&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Kime Scott (2007). &quot;Gender in modernism: new geographies, complex intersections&quot; p.693. University of Illinois Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As the national media lost interest in the suffrage campaign, the WSPU decided it would use other methods to create publicity. This began in 1905 at a meeting where [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], a member of the newly elected Liberal government, was speaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purvis&quot;&gt;June Purvis, Sandra Stanley Holton (2000). &quot;Votes for women&quot; p.112. Routledge, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; As he was talking, two members of the WSPU constantly shouted out, 'Will the Liberal Government give votes to women?'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purvis&quot;/&gt; When they refused to cease calling out, police were called to evict them and the two suffragettes (as members of the WSPU became known after this incident) were involved in a struggle which ended with them being arrested and charged for assault. When they refused to pay their fine, they were sent to prison for one week, and three days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purvis&quot;/&gt; The British public were shocked and took notice at this use of violence to win the vote for women.

After this media success, the WSPU's tactics became increasingly violent. This included an attempt in 1908 to storm the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the arson of [[David Lloyd George]]'s country home (despite his support for women's suffrage). In 1909 Lady [[Constance Lytton]] was imprisoned, but immediately released when her identity was discovered, so in 1910 she disguised herself as a [[working class]] seamstress called [[Constance Lytton|Jane Warton]] and endured inhumane treatment which included [[force-feeding]]. In 1913, suffragette [[Emily Davison]] protested by interfering with a horse owned by King [[George V]] during the running of the [[Epsom Derby]]; she was trampled and died four days later. The WSPU ceased their militant activities during [[World War I]] and agreed to assist with the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Leventhal (2002). &quot;Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia&quot; p.432.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, which had always employed 'constitutional' methods, continued to lobby during the war years, and compromises were worked out between the NUWSS and the coalition government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cawood&quot;&gt;Ian Cawood, David McKinnon-Bell (2001). &quot;The First World War&quot;. p.71.

The first Brazilian women enrolled as a voter was Celina Guimarães Viana, who was able to vote based on a state electoral law, after being authorized by a local judge in 1927. After this precedent, women from at least nine Brazilians states could be enrolled via judicial decisions. The female lawyer Mietta Santiago filed a [[writ of security]] alleging that the prohibition of women's suffrage was unconstitutional. She also managed a judicial decision to vote in 1928.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

All restrictions to women's suffrage in Brazil were removed on February&amp;nbsp;24,&amp;nbsp;1932, when President [[Getúlio Vargas]] issued the Brazilian Electoral Code (Decrete&amp;nbsp;21076), whose Article&amp;nbsp;2 stated that the right to vote was granted to all Brazilian citizens with at least 21 years old, without distinction of sex. The first occasion on which all Brazilian women could finally vote was the 1934&amp;nbsp;election for the National Constituent Assembly.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

====Canada====
In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, female property holders could demand municipal voting rights on the principle of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;. Propertied women in Québec voted unchallenged between 1809 and 1849, when the word &quot;male&quot; was inserted into Québec's franchise act. What women in Québec lost, women in Ontario soon gained; from 1850, women with property, married or single, could vote for school trustees. By the 1900s municipal voting privileges for propertied women were general throughout Canada. Bills to enfranchise women in provincial elections failed to pass in any province until [[Manitoba]] finally succeeded in 1916. At the federal level it was a two step process. On September&amp;nbsp;20,&amp;nbsp;1917, women gained a limited right to vote:  According to the [[Parliament of Canada]] website, the ''[[Military Voters Act]]'' established that &quot;women who are British subjects and have close relatives in the [[armed forces]] can vote on behalf of their male relatives, in federal elections.&quot; In 1919, the right to vote was extended to all women in the ''Act to confer the Electoral Franchise upon Women''. The remaining provinces quickly followed suit, except for [[Quebec]], which did not do so until 1940. [[Agnes Macphail]] became the first woman elected to Parliament in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Jackel |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/womens-suffrage |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Women's suffrage in the United States}}
[[Lydia Taft]] was an early forerunner in [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial America]] who was allowed to vote in three [[New England]] town meetings, beginning in 1756, at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]]. Following the [[American Revolution]], women were allowed to vote in [[New Jersey]], but no other state, from 1790 until 1807, provided they met property requirements then in place. In 1807 all women were taken off the voters' roll as universal male suffrage was instated.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In June&amp;nbsp;1848, [[Gerrit Smith]] made women's suffrage a [[Party platform|plank]] in the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]] [[Party platform|platform]]. In&amp;nbsp;July, at the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in [[upstate New York]], activists including [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucretia Mott]] began a seventy-year struggle by women to secure the right to vote. Attendees signed a document known as the [[Declaration of Sentiments|Declaration of Rights and Sentiments]], of which Stanton was the primary author. Equal rights became the rallying cry of the early movement for women's rights, and equal rights meant claiming access to all the prevailing definitions of freedom. In&amp;nbsp;1850 [[Lucy Stone]] organized a larger assembly with a wider focus, the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. [[Susan&amp;nbsp;B. Anthony]], a native of [[Rochester, New York]], joined the cause in&amp;nbsp;1852 after reading Stone's 1850&amp;nbsp;speech. Women's suffrage activists pointed out that blacks had been granted the franchise and had not been included in the language of the [[United States Constitution|United States Constitution's]] Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments (which gave people equal protection under the law and the right to vote regardless of their race, respectively). This, they contended, had been unjust. Early victories were won in the territories of [[Wyoming Territory|Wyoming]] (1869)&lt;ref&gt;see fac-simile at {{Cite journal

[[John Allen Campbell]], the first Governor of the Wyoming Territory, approved the first law in United States history explicitly granting women the right to vote. The law was approved on December 10, 1869. This day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/dec10.html|title= Today in History|publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Meaning what, specifically?  Women were allowed to vote in all elections in those places?  If so, it should say so.  And who decided that?  The territorial legislature?  Congress?  A referendum?  Was it part of the Constitution of the Territory (if such a thing existed)?  Or just a statute that could be changed by the legislature? --&gt;

Utah women were disenfranchised by provisions of the federal [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] enacted by the [[United States Congress|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Congress]] in 1887.

[[File:Suffragette banner. One of the banners, the women who picketed the White House . . . - NARA - 533769.tif|thumb|left|&quot;Kaiser Wilson&quot; banner held by a woman who picketed the White House]]
The push to grant Utah women's suffrage was at least partially fueled by the belief that, given the right to vote, [[Utah]] women would dispose of [[polygamy]]. It was only after Utah women exercised their suffrage rights in favor of polygamy that the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Congress disenfranchised Utah women.&lt;ref&gt;Van Wagenen, Lola: &quot;Sister-Wives and Suffragists: Polygamy and the Politics of Woman Suffrage 1870–1896,&quot; BYU Studies, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Idaho]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]] had enfranchised women after effort by the suffrage associations at the state level.

During the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, as women's suffrage faced several important federal votes, a portion of the suffrage movement known as the National Women's Party led by suffragist [[Alice Paul]] became the first &quot;cause&quot; to picket outside the White House. Paul and [[Lucy Burns]] led a series of protests against the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]] in Washington. Wilson ignored the protests for six months, but on June&amp;nbsp;20,&amp;nbsp;1917, as a Russian delegation drove up to the White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: &quot;We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twenty&amp;nbsp;million women are denied the right to vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clement&quot;/&gt; Another banner on August&amp;nbsp;14,&amp;nbsp;1917, referred to &quot;[[Kaiser]] Wilson&quot; and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens et al., Jailed for Freedom: American Women Win the Vote, NewSage Press (March 21, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; On October&amp;nbsp;17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October&amp;nbsp;30 began a [[hunger strike]], but after a few days prison authorities began to force feed her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clement&quot;&gt;James Ciment, Thaddeus Russell (2007). &quot;The home front encyclopedia: United States, Britain, and Canada in World Wars I and II, Volume 1&quot;. p.163. ABC-CLIO, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women's suffrage as a war measure.&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, J. Stanley (1973). &quot;The woman citizen: social feminism in the 1920s&quot; p.13. University of Virginia Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The key vote came on June&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;1919, when the Senate approved the amendment by 56 to 25 after four hours of debate, during which Democratic Senators opposed to the amendment [[filibuster]]ed to prevent a roll call until their absent Senators could be protected by pairs. The Ayes included 36 (82%) Republicans and 20 (54%) Democrats. The Nays comprised 8 (18%) Republicans and 17 (46%) Democrats. It was ratified by sufficient states in 1920, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth&amp;nbsp;Amendment]], which prohibited state or federal sex-based restrictions on voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1920womensvote.html|title=Suffrage Wins in Senate; Now Goes to States|date=5 June 1919|accessdate=2011-11-17|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
{{main|Women's suffrage in Australia}}
The female descendants of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|''Bounty'' mutineers]] who lived on [[Pitcairn Islands]] could vote from 1838, and this right transferred with their resettlement to [[Norfolk Island]] (now an [[States and territories of Australia|Australian external territory]]) in 1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;elections.org.nz&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Edith Cowan.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edith Cowan]]  (1861-1932)  was elected to the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]] in 1921 and was the first woman elected to any Australian Parliament (though women in Australia had already had the vote for two decades).]]

Propertied women in the colony of South Australia were granted the vote in local elections (but not parliamentary elections) in 1861. [[Henrietta Dugdale]] formed the first Australian women's suffrage society in [[Melbourne]], Victoria in 1884. Women became eligible to vote for the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1894 and in 1897, [[Catherine Helen Spence]] became the first female political candidate for political office, unsuccessfully standing for election as a delegate to Federal Convention on Australian Federation. [[Western Australia]] granted voting rights to women in 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

The first election for the Parliament of the newly formed [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901 was based on the electoral provisions of the six pre-existing colonies, so that women who had the vote and the right to stand for Parliament at state level had the same rights for the 1901 Australian Federal election. In 1902, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Commonwealth Franchise Act, which enabled all women to vote and stand for election for the Federal Parliament. Four women stood for election in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;/&gt; The Act did, however, specifically exclude 'natives' from Commonwealth franchise unless already enrolled in a state. In 1949, The right to vote in federal elections was extended to all Indigenous people who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections (Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory still excluded indigenous women from voting rights). Remaining restrictions were abolished in 1962 by the Commonwealth Electoral Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edith Cowan]] was elected to the West Australian Legislative Assembly in 1921, the first woman elected to any Australian Parliament. Dame [[Enid Lyons]], in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|Australian House of Representatives]] and Senator [[Dorothy Tangney]] became the first women in the Federal Parliament in 1943. Lyons went on to be the first woman to hold a [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] post in the 1949 ministry of [[Robert Menzies]]. [[Rosemary Follett]] was elected [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory]] in 1989, becoming the first woman elected to lead a state or territory. By 2010, the people of Australia's oldest city, [[Sydney]] had female leaders occupying every major political office above them, with [[Clover Moore]] as Lord Mayor, [[Kristina Keneally]] as Premier of New South Wales, [[Marie Bashir]] as Governor of New South Wales, [[Julia Gillard]] as Prime Minister, [[Quentin Bryce]] as [[Governor-General of Australia]]  and [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]].

====Cook Islands====
Women in [[Rarotonga]] were given the right to vote in 1893, shortly after [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name= Markoff &gt;Markoff, John, 'Margins, Centers, and Democracy: The Paradigmatic History of Women's Suffrage' ''Signs the Journal of Women in Culture and Society'', 2003; 29 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
{{Main|Women's suffrage in New Zealand}}
New Zealand's Electoral Act of 19&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;1893 made this country of the [[British Empire]] the first in the world to grant women the right to vote in parliamentary elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;elections.org.nz&quot;/&gt;

Women who owned property and paid rates—usually widows or &quot;spinsters&quot;—had been allowed to vote in local elections in [[Otago Region|Otago]] and Nelson since 1867; women in other provinces were granted suffrage in 1876. Women in [[New Zealand]] were inspired to fight for universal voting rights by the [[Women's rights|equal-rights]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] and the British [[Feminism|feminists]]' aggression. In addition, the missionary efforts of the American-based [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] gave them the motivation to fight—and their efforts were supported by a number of important male politicians including [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]], [[Robert Stout]], [[Julius Vogel]], and [[William Johnson Fox|William Fox]]. In 1878, 1879, and 1887 amendments extending the vote to women failed by a hair each time. In 1893 the reformers at last succeeded in extending the franchise to women.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Although the [[First Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] which passed the bill generally advocated social and political reform, the electoral bill was only passed because of a combination of personality issues and political accident. The bill granted the vote to women of all races. New Zealand women were not given the right to stand for parliament, however, until 1919. In 2005 almost a third of the [[Parliament of New Zealand|Members of Parliament]] elected were female. Women recently have also occupied powerful and symbolic offices such as those of [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], and between 2005, and 2006, all three of these posts were held by women. New Zealand's first chief justice, [[Sian Elias]] is also a woman.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Women's suffrage in religions==

===Catholicism===

The [[Pope]] is only elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp |title=How is the Pope elected? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=2005-04-06 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are not appointed as cardinals, so women cannot vote for the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |title=Women and the Priesthood |publisher=Catholic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female offices of [[Abbess]] or Mother Superior are elective,  the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Islam===
Although Women were included in the process of electing the Caliph during the [[Rashidun]] Caliphate (632-661), Women's rights vary in Islamic countries in the modern era. The question of [[Women as imams|women's right to become imams]] (a religious leader) is  disputed by many, see [[Women in Islam#Women in religious life|Women in Islam]].

===Judaism===
Women are denied the vote and the ability to be elected to positions of authority in many Orthodox Jewish synagogues and religious organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vosizneias.com/63964/2010/09/12/manhattan-ny-rabbi-holds-on-to-keep-women-off-from-board-of-orthodox-synagogue/ |title=Manhattan, NY - Rabbi Keeps Off Women from Board of LES Orthodox Synagogue |publisher=VosIzNeias.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-synagogue/14/ |title=JUDGE DISMISSES LAWSUIT AGAINST SYNAGOGUE |work=[[The New York Sun]] |date=2004-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crownheights.info/index.php?itemid=33955 |title=The Key to Marital Harmony: One Vote Per Couple? |publisher=CrownHeights.info |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not true of the non-Orthodox branches of Judaism, especially in the United States,
