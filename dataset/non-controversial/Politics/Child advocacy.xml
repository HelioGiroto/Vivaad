      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6236">'''Child advocacy''' refers to a range of individuals, professionals and advocacy organizations who promote the optimal development of children. An individual or organization engaging in [[advocacy]] typically seeks to protect [[children's rights]] which may be abridged or [[child abuse|abused]] in a number of areas. 
== Rights ==
{{Main|Children's rights movement}}
(Also see [[Children's rights]])

[[Rights]] can be divided into two categories: negative (rights to be free from) and positive (rights to). Children's negative rights are violated when some dangerous or harmful action is taken directly against them.

== What child advocates do ==

One type of children's advocate typically represents or gives voice to an individual or group whose concerns and interests are not being heard. A child advocate will try to prevent children from being harmed and may try to obtain [[justice]] for those who have already been injured in some way. A child advocate may also seek to ensure that children have access to positive influences or services which will benefit their lives such as [[education]], [[childcare]] and proper [[parenting]]. Malnutrition is another form of harm-there are many children who go to bed without eating and it is looked over by child welfare or the police.

Another form of child advocacy happens at the policy level and aims at changing the policies of governments or even transnational policies.  These advocates do lobbying, policy research, file lawsuits and engage in other types of policy change techniques.&lt;ref&gt;DeVita, C.J. &amp; Mosher-Williams, R. (Eds.) (2001). Who speaks for Americaâ€™s children?. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Many use Internet based techniques to influence decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt, J.G.  (2007).

Chicago, IL: Lyceum Books&lt;/ref&gt;

== Where child advocates can be found ==

Several countries have established [[Children's Ombudsman]] agencies, at national, sub-national or local levels, as independent public bodies promoting and protecting the rights of children. Other child advocates exist in school, [[community]], and home environments, and work on an [[individual]], [[Group (sociology)|group]] or [[government]]al level(s) to protect and nurture children. In most circumstances, mothers, fathers, family and teachers all advocate on behalf of children, although it is well recognized that we all have the ability and responsibility to advocate on behalf of children. In [[Wales]] the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] has set up the National Advocacy [http://www.meiccymru.org/ Meic] helpline which allows children to talk directly to advocates. These independent advocates support and represent the concerns of children.

Eight [[Canadian]] provinces, including [[Ontario]], have an official child advocate whose job it is to protect the interests and welfare of all the children in the province.  Within the [[criminal justice]] system, child advocates are concerned with the developmental needs of children and young people, and can play an important role in ensuring [[due process]] rights for young people in conflict with the [[law]].  They can help provide a voice for children and young people, ensure just and humane conditions of custody, and guard the [[privacy rights]] surrounding record provisions.  They can also work to ensure that the special legal protections assigned to young people are provided with dignity and fairness.

=== Child Advocacy Centers ===
{{Primary sources|date=January 2008}}
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}
'''Child Advocacy Centers''' are neutral, safe locations where multidisciplinary teams investigate disclosures of child sexual or severe [[physical abuse]]. These multidisciplinary teams are made up of law enforcement officers, child protective service personnel, prosecutors, and advocates. Children who have disclosed abuse are interviewed by a forensic interviewer at such centers. Referrals for medical or [[mental health]] treatment are also made for the child and their family members.

[[Voices for America's Children]] is a national advocacy organization with more than 60 members committed to speaking up for the well-being of children.

The [http://childadvocate.net/ Child Advocate] is a national not for profit organization with connections to hundreds of other organizations and resources to address sexual abuse but also many other advocacy needs for children and families.  Their goals are to serve the needs of children, families and professionals while addressing mental health, medical, educational, legal and legislative issues.  

The [[multidisciplinary approach]] to [[child abuse]] investigations is designed with the intention of reducing the secondary trauma associated with the disclosure and subsequent investigation of abuse.

Child Advocacy Centers are accredited by the [http://nca-online.org/ National Children's Alliance].

Child Advocacy organizations at the policy level exist at state and national levels and as transnational NGOs. The organizations that they work in vary from smaller organizations at the local level to multinational voluntary organizations concerned about international child rights.

== The United Nations ==

On the international stage, the [[United Nations]] has long advocated on behalf of children through [[UNICEF]], whose position on children was formulated and publicly formalized in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. The convention sets out a summary of collective ideals and a covenant of commitments to all children on the planet.

== Philosophy ==

One thing that all child advocates have in common is healthy [[respect]] for young children.                      There is also recognition that in most countries, children are not seen as having the full citizenship status which confers certain rights and responsibilities as adults.
