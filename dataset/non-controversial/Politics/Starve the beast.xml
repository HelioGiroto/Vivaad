&quot;'''Starving the beast'''&quot; is a political strategy employed by [[American conservatism|American conservatives]] in order to limit government spending&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pralmeida.tripod.com/academia/05materiais/08TaxingPoorEcon.html |title=Europe's Welfare States |work=The Economist |publisher=Pralmeida.tripod.com |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/the_lighthouse/detail.asp?id=188 |author=Bartlett, Bruce |title=Origins and Development of a Budget Metaphor |work=The Independent Review |publisher=Independent.org |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg, Mark&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110107143129/http://www.mcf.org/mcf/forum/2005/foundationshavestake.htm |author=Lindberg, Mark |title=Foundations Have a Stake |work=Minnesota Council on Foundations |publisher=Mcf.org |date=Spring, 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-25 (Wayback)}}&lt;/ref&gt;by cutting taxes in order to deprive the government of revenue in a deliberate effort to force the federal government to reduce spending.  The short and medium term effect of the strategy has increased [[United States public debt]] rather than reduced spending. 

The term &quot;the beast&quot; in this context refers to [[U.S. government|the American government]] and the programs it funds, particularly social programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pralmeida.tripod.com/academia/05materiais/08TaxingPoorEcon.html |title=Europe's Welfare States |work=The Economist |publisher=Pralmeida.tripod.com |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg, Mark&quot;/&gt;; and does not usually refer to spending on military, law enforcement or prisons.

==History==
[[File:U.S.-Tax-Revenues-As-GDP-Percentage-(75-05).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Total tax revenues as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. in comparison to the [[OECD]] and the [[EU 15]].]]

On July 14, 1978, economist Alan Greenspan gave testimony to the U.S. Finance Committee: &quot;Let us remember that the basic purpose of any tax cut program in today's environment is to reduce the momentum of expenditure growth by restraining the amount of revenue available and trust that there is a political limit to deficit spending.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/05/06/tax-cuts-republicans-starve-the-beast-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html | work=Forbes | first=Bruce | last=Bartlett | title=Tax Cuts And 'Starving The Beast' | date=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to being elected as the President, then-candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] foreshadowed the strategy during the 1980 US Presidential debates, saying &quot;[[John Bayard Anderson|John Anderson]] tells us that first we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/07/AR2006050700924.html |title=Mallaby, Sebastian. Don't Feed the Beast: Bush Should End This Tax-cut Myth |work=The Washington Post |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=May 8, 2006 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphor was too simplistic to account for the spending of a kid who could borrow without near-term or medium-term limits.

The earliest use of the actual term &quot;starving the beast&quot; to refer to the political-fiscal strategy (as opposed to its conceptual premise) was in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article in 1985 where the reporter quoted an unnamed Reagan staffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=50&amp;articleID=641 |title=Starve the Beast: Origins and Development of a Budgetary Metaphor |work=The Independent Review |agency=The Independent Institute |publisher=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 2000===

The [[Economic policy of the George W. Bush administration#Tax cuts|tax cuts]] and deficit spending of former US President [[George W. Bush]]'s administration were attempts to &quot;starve the beast.&quot; Bush said in 2001 &quot;so we have the tax relief plan [...] that now provides a new kind—a fiscal straightjacket for Congress. And that's good for the taxpayers, and it's incredibly positive news if you're worried about a federal government that has been growing at a dramatic pace over the past eight years and it has been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010824.html |title=President Announces Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2001-08-24 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican presidential candidate [[Fred Thompson]]'s tax-cut plan, incorporating a [[flat tax]], also defers paying for the larger deficits it would create. [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&amp;sid=a2RXZVqBd5C0&amp;refer=home] It &quot;would most likely be funded by lower government spending on Social Security and Medicare benefits&quot; according to the [[Wall Street Journal]].[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119603890284403477.html?mod=googlenews_wsj]

Political activist [[Grover Norquist]] authored an oath, the so-called &quot;[[Americans for Tax Reform#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Taxpayer Protection Pledge]],&quot; that 279 Senators and Congressman have signed. The oath states the signatories will never vote to raise taxes on anyone under any circumstances. It is viewed by some of the unsigned as a stumbling block to mutual fiscal negotiations to benefit the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57327816/the-pledge-grover-norquists-hold-on-the-gop/ | work=CBS News | title=The Pledge: Grover Norquist's hold on the GOP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic analysis==
[[James M. Buchanan]], a Nobel Prize-winning economist, helped develop the [[Fiscal Illusion]] hypothesis. It's obvious, he said, &quot;borrowing allows spending to be made that will yield immediate political payoffs without the incurring of any immediate political cost.&quot;&lt;ref name=buchanan184&gt;
{{cite book |last=Buchanan|first=James M. |title=Dehe Deficit and American Democracy |year=1984 |publisher=P. K. Steidman Foundation |location=Memphis |isbn=0-86597-227-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book Democracy in Deficit (1977), Buchanan and Richard E. Wagner suggest that the complicated nature of the U.S. tax system causes fiscal illusion and results in greater public expenditure than would be the case in an idealized system in which everyone is aware in detail of what their share of the costs of government is.&lt;ref name=buchanan1977&gt;

Empirical evidence shows that Starve the Beast may be counterproductive, with lower taxes actually corresponding to higher spending. An October 2007 study by [[Christina Romer|Christina D. Romer]] and David H. Romer of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] found: &quot;[...] no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed, [the findings] suggest that tax cuts may actually increase spending. The results also indicate that the main effect of tax cuts on the government budget is to induce subsequent legislated tax increases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/draft509.pdf |coauthors=Christina D. Romer, David H. Romer |title=Do Tax Cuts Starve the Beast: The Effect of Tax Changes on Government Spending National Bureau of Economic Research. Working Paper No. 13548 |format=PDF |date=October 2007 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Niskanen]], chairman emeritus of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]], criticized “starve the beast.” If deficits finance 20% of government spending, then citizens perceive government services as discounted. Services that are popular at 20% off the listed price would be less popular at full price. He hypothesized that higher revenues could constrain spending, and found strong statistical support for that conjecture based on data from 1981 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj26n3/cj26n3-8.pdf |author=William Niskanen |work=Cato Journal |title=26(3):553–558, Fall 2006 Limiting Government: The Failure of &quot;Starve the Beast&quot; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/18/AR2010091802861.html |title=The true test of the tea parties' mettle |author=Ezra Klein |work=Washington Post |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-09-18 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Cato researcher, Michael New, tested Niskanen’s model in different time periods and using a more restrictive definition of spending (non-defense discretionary spending) and arrived at a similar conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;New, Michael J. “Starve the Beast: A Further Examination”, ''Cato Journal'', 29(3): 487–495, Fall 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Leonard E. Berman of Syracuse University testified to a U.S. Senate committee in July 2010 that: &quot;My guess is that if President Bush had announced a new war surtax to pay for Iraq or an increase in the Medicare payroll tax rate to pay for the prescription drug benefit, both initiatives would have been less popular. Given that the prescription drug benefit only passed Congress by one vote after an extraordinary amount of arm-twisting, it seems unlikely that it would have passed at all if accompanied by a tax increase. Starve the beast doesn’t work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/uploadedFiles/burman%20testimony%20071410.pdf |title=Senate Testimony of Professor Leonard E. Berman |format=PDF |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] summarized as: &quot;Rather than proposing unpopular spending cuts, Republicans would push through popular tax cuts, with the deliberate intention of worsening the government’s fiscal position. Spending cuts could then be sold as a necessity rather than a choice, the only way to eliminate an unsustainable budget deficit.&quot; He wrote that the &quot;...beast is starving, as planned...&quot; and that &quot;Republicans insist that the deficit must be eliminated, but they’re not willing either to raise taxes or to support cuts in any major government programs. And they’re not willing to participate in serious bipartisan discussions, either, because that might force them to explain their plan—and there isn’t any plan, except to regain power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/opinion/22krugman.html NYT-Paul Krugman-The Bankruptcy Boys-February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Bruce Bartlett]], former domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan, has called Starve the Beast &quot;the most pernicious fiscal doctrine in history&quot;, and blames it for the increase in [[United States public debt|US government debt]] since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=bartlett&gt;[[Bruce Bartlett|Bartlett, Bruce]].

==Political advocacy==

Former U.S. vice-presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] expressly advocates the policy: &quot;please [Congress], starve the beast, don't perpetuate the problem, don't fund the largesse, we need to cut taxes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/04/palin_in_boston_please_starve.html |title=Sarah Palin Boston speech (video, at 13:45)-April 14, 2010 |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Senator [[Jon Kyl]] (R-AZ), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, states &quot;you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on Americans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/tv/w/002748/ |title=Sen. Kyl Fox News Sunday appearance (video) – July 11, 2010 |publisher=Dailykos.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, &quot;My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788|archivedate=2004-11-20 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &amp;#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=2005-03-15 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Feed the Beast&quot;===
[[File:Employment_growth_by_top_tax_rate.jpg|thumb|right|Average annual growth in U.S. employment, by top income tax bracket rate, 1940-2011]]

A related idea known as &quot;Feed the Beast&quot;, refers to increasing taxes for the purported purpose of balancing the budget only to make the government spend those inflows.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Schultz (June 4, 2012) [http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/schultz-state-must-feed-the-beast-not-starve-it-1/nPMgK/ &quot;State must feed the 'beast,' not starve it&quot;] ''Palm Beach Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Economists [[Stephen Moore (economist)|Stephen Moore]] and [[Richard Vedder]] have written in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that every new dollar of new taxes leads to more than one dollar of new spending according to their research. Their conclusions have been disputed by economist and writer [[Bruce Bartlett]] in ''[[The Fiscal Times]]'', who stated that tax increases in the early 1990s helped contribute to more austere budgets in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2010/11/26/Bartlett-Starve-The-Beast.aspx Starve the Beast: Just Bull, not Good Economics], ''[[The Fiscal Times]]'', November 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704648604575620502560925156.html|author1=Stephen Moore|author2=[[Richard Vedder]]|publisher=''Wall Street Journal''|date=November 21, 2010|title=Higher Taxes Won't Reduce the Deficit|accessdate=March 24, 2011|authorlink1=Stephen Moore (economist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
