'''Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher'''&lt;!-- ''not'' &quot;Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven&quot; --&gt;, {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Garter|LG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]}}, née '''Roberts''' (born 13 October 1925) is a British politician, the longest-serving  (1979–1990) [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] of the 20th century, and the only woman ever to have held the post. A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] journalist nicknamed her the &quot;[[Iron Lady]]&quot;, which became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented Conservative policies that have come to be known as [[Thatcherism]].

Originally a research [[chemistry|chemist]] before becoming a [[barrister]], Thatcher was elected [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament (MP)]] for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]]. [[Edward Heath]] appointed her [[Secretary of State for Education|Secretary of State for Education and Science]] in his 1970 government. In 1975 Thatcher defeated Heath in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|Conservative Party leadership election]] and became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], as well as the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].

After entering {{nowrap|[[10 Downing Street]]}}, Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives to reverse what she perceived to be Britain's precipitous national decline.{{#tag:ref|In her foreword to the 1979 Conservative manifesto, Thatcher wrote of &quot;a feeling of helplessness, that a once great nation has somehow fallen behind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Foreword|title=Conservative Party Manifesto 1979|url=http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml|last=Thatcher|first=Margaret|publisher=conservativemanifesto.com|year=1979|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised [[deregulation]] (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned companies]], and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment, until economic recovery and the 1982 [[Falklands War]] brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|re-election in 1983]]. 

Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987, but her [[Community Charge]] (popularly referred to as &quot;poll tax&quot;) was widely unpopular and her views on the [[European Union|European Community]] were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after [[Michael Heseltine]] launched a challenge to her leadership.  Thatcher holds a [[life peerage]] as Baroness Thatcher, of [[Kesteven]] in the County of Lincolnshire, which entitles her to sit in the [[House of Lords]].

[[File:Plaque, maison natale de Margaret Thatcher.JPG|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque on the building in which Margaret Thatcher was born]]
Margaret Thatcher was born Margaret Roberts in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], on 13 October 1925. Her father was [[Alfred Roberts]], originally from Northamptonshire, and her mother was Beatrice Ethel (née Stephenson) from Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned two grocery shops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her older sister Muriel were raised in the flat above the larger of the two, located near the railway line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p3&quot;/&gt; Her father was active in local politics and the [[Methodist]] church, serving as an [[alderman]] and a [[Methodist local preacher|local preacher]],&lt;ref name=BeckettP8/&gt; and brought up his daughter as a strict Methodist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Maureen|last=Johnson|title=Bible-Quoting Thatcher Stirs Furious Debate|agency=Associated Press|date=28 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] family but stood—as was then customary in local government—as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945–46 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.&lt;ref name=BeckettP8&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Roberts attended Huntingtower Road Primary School and won a scholarship to [[Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School]].&lt;ref name=BeckettP5&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; her extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking.&lt;ref name=BeckettP6&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[head girl]] in 1942–43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kestevengrantham.lincs.sch.uk/|title=Kesteven &amp; Grantham Girls' School|publisher=Kestevengrantham.lincs.sch.uk|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her [[sixth form|upper sixth year]] she applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], but was initially rejected, and was offered a place only after another candidate withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived at Oxford in 1943 and graduated in 1947 with [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class Honours]] in the four-year Chemistry Bachelor of Science degree; in her final year she specialised in [[X-ray crystallography]] under the supervision of [[Dorothy Hodgkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts became President of the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was influenced at university by political works such as [[Friedrich von Hayek]]'s ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which condemned economic intervention by government as a precursor to an authoritarian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Roberts moved to [[Colchester]] in Essex to work as a research chemist for [[BX Plastics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the local Conservative Association and attended the party conference at [[Llandudno]] in 1948, as a representative of the University Graduate Conservative Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p22&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her Oxford friends was also a friend of the Chair of the [[Dartford]] Conservative Association in [[Kent]], who were looking for candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p22&quot;/&gt; Officials of the association were so impressed by her that they asked her to apply, even though she was not on the Conservative party's approved list: she was selected in January 1951 and added to the approved list ''post ante''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blundell-p36&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a dinner following her formal adoption as Conservative candidate for Dartford in February 1951 she met [[Denis Thatcher]], a successful and wealthy divorced businessman, who drove her to her Essex train.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blundell-p36&quot;/&gt; In preparation for the election Roberts moved to Dartford, where she supported herself by working as a research chemist for [[J. Lyons and Co.]] in Hammersmith, part of a team developing [[emulsifier]]s for [[ice cream]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ns-rs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cream of the crop at Royal Society|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XRpdT3gc9KYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Margaret+Thatcher+ice#v=onepage&amp;q=Margaret+Thatcher+ice&amp;f=false|journal=New Scientist|date=7 July 1983|page=5|accessdate=25 January 2011|volume=99|issue=1365|publisher=New Science Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general elections]] she was the Conservative candidate for the safe Labour seat of [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]], where she attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p23&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lost both times to [[Norman Dodds]], but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p23&quot;/&gt;  (By an odd coincidence, [[Edward Heath]] was elected for the first time in the neighbouring constituency in 1950.)  During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951.&lt;ref name=Beckett-p23/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Denis Thatcher&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/1434154/Sir-Denis-Thatcher-Bt.html|accessdate=6 January 2012 |date=27 June 2003 |title=Sir Denis Thatcher, Bt |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denis funded his wife's studies for the [[bar association|bar]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year her twins, [[Carol Thatcher|Carol]] and [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]], were born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p26&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member of Parliament (1959–1970)===
Thatcher was not a candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]] as it came fairly soon after the birth of her children. Later that year, she was narrowly defeated when she sought selection as the candidate for the [[Orpington by-election, 1955]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett-p26&quot;/&gt;  Afterwards, she began looking for a Conservative [[safe seat]], and was selected as the candidate for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in April 1958 (narrowly beating [[Ian Montagu Fraser]]). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=27}} See also: {{London Gazette |issue=41842 |startpage=6433 |date=13 October 1959 |accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[maiden speech]] was in support of her [[private member's bill]] ([[Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960]]), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of [[birching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|2000|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regarded Finchley's Jewish residents as &quot;her people&quot; and became a founding member of the Anglo-Israel Friendship League of Finchley as well as a member of the Conservative Friends of Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tab 28Dec2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/87027/thatcher-and-the-jews/|title=Thatcher and the Jews|author=Charles C. Johnson|date=28 December 2011|journal=[[Tablet Magazine|Tablet]]|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But she nevertheless believed that Israel had to trade land for peace, and condemned Israel's bombing of [[Operation Opera|Osirak]] as &quot;a grave breach of international law&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tab 28Dec2011&quot;/&gt;

In October 1961 Thatcher was promoted to the front bench as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions|Parliamentary Undersecretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance]] in [[Harold Macmillan]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Conservatives lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]] she became spokeswoman on Housing and Land, in which position she advocated her party's policy of allowing tenants to buy their [[council house]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapshott-p64&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wapshott|2007|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to the Shadow [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] team in 1966, and as Treasury spokeswoman opposed Labour's mandatory price and income controls, arguing that they would produce effects contrary to those intended and distort the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapshott-p64&quot;/&gt;

At the Conservative Party Conference of 1966 she criticised the high-tax policies of the Labour Government as being steps &quot;not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapshott-p64&quot;/&gt; She argued that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapshott-p64&quot;/&gt; Thatcher was one of the few Conservative MPs to support [[Leo Abse]]'s Bill to decriminalise male homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jul/05/sexual-offences-no-2|title=Sexual Offences (No. 2)|date=5 July 1966|journal=Hansard|volume=731|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She voted in favour of [[David Steel]]'s bill to legalise abortion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thatcher-p150&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jul/22/medical-termination-of-pregnancy-bill|title=Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill|date=22 July 1966|journal=Hansard|volume=732|page=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a ban on [[hare coursing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/may/14/hare-coursing-bill|title=Hare Coursing Bill|date=14 May 1970|journal=Hansard|volume=801|pages=1599–1603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hare coursing attack; League Against Cruel Sports|newspaper=The Times|date=28 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; She supported the retention of capital punishment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1969/jun/24/capital-punishment|title=Capital Punishment|date=24 June 1969|journal=Hansard|volume=785|page=1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1968/feb/09/divorce-reform-bill|title=Divorce Reform Bill|date=9 February 1968|journal=Hansard|volume=758|pages=904–907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thatcher|1995|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 she was selected by the [[U.S. Embassy, London|United States Embassy in London]] to take part in the [[International Visitor Leadership Program]] (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a professional exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott-Smith |first=Giles|title=&quot;Her Rather Ambitious Washington Program&quot;: Margaret Thatcher's International Visitor Program Visit to the United States in 1967|url=http://mountainrunner.us/library/publicdiplomacy/Scott-Smith%20(2003)-%20%E2%80%98Her%20Rather%20Ambitious%20Washington%20Program%E2%80%99%20Margaret%20Thatcher%E2%80%99s%20International%20Visitor%20Program%20Visit%20to%20the%20US%20in%201967.pdf|year= 2003 |journal=Contemporary British History|month= Winter|volume=17|issue=4|pages=65–86|publisher=Routledge&amp;nbsp;– Taylor and Francis|issn=1743–7997|format = PDF}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher joined the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] later that year as Fuel spokesman. Shortly before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wapshott|2007|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education Secretary (1970–1974)===

The Conservative party under Edward Heath won the 1970 general election, and Thatcher was subsequently appointed [[Secretary of State for Education|Secretary of State for Education and Science]]. During her first months in office she attracted public attention as a result of the administration's attempts to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p14&quot;/&gt; and imposed public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapshott-p76&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wapshott|2007|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk, but she agreed to provide younger children with a third of a pint daily, for nutritional purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapshott-p76&quot;/&gt; Her decision provoked a storm of protest from the Labour party and the press,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the moniker &quot;Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapshott-p76&quot;/&gt; Thatcher wrote in her autobiography: &quot;I learned a valuable lesson [from the experience].

Thatcher's term of office was marked by proposals for more local education authorities to close [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]] and to adopt [[comprehensive school|comprehensive secondary education]]. Although she was committed to a tiered [[secondary modern]]-grammar school system of education, and determined to preserve grammar schools,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p14&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612&amp;nbsp;proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent to 62&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|pp=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leader of the Opposition (1975–1979)===

The Heath government continued to experience difficulties with [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargoes]] and union demands for wage increases in 1973, and lost the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p15&quot;/&gt;  Labour formed a minority government, and went on to win a narrow majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]].  Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt.  Thatcher was not initially the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her main support came from the Conservative [[1922 Committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p16&quot;/&gt; She [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|defeated Heath]] on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article545321.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2|title=Thatcher leads tributes to Sir Edward Heath|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=14 October 2008|work=The Times|first=Philippe|last=Naughton|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second ballot she defeated Heath's preferred successor, [[William Whitelaw]], and became party leader on 11 February 1975;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102452|title=Press Conference after winning Conservative leadership (Grand Committee Room)|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; she appointed Whitelaw as her deputy. Heath remained disenchanted with Thatcher to the end of his life, for what he and many of his supporters perceived as her disloyalty in standing against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For British Tories, a Private Feud Goes Public|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DC173CF936A15754C0A96E948260|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=14 October 2008|date=25 July 1988|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher began to attend lunches regularly at the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] (IEA), a think tank founded by the poultry magnate [[Antony Fisher]], a disciple of [[Friedrich von Hayek]]; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s.  There she was influenced by the ideas of [[Ralph Harris, Baron Harris of High Cross|Ralph Harris]] and [[Arthur Seldon]], and she became the face of the ideological movement opposing the [[welfare state]] [[Keynesian]] economics they believed was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2010|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2011}}

The television critic [[Clive James]], writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' during the voting for the leadership, compared her voice of 1973 to a cat sliding down a blackboard.{{#tag:ref|&quot;The hang-up has always been the voice. Not the timbre so much as, well, the ''tone''—the condescending explanatory whine which treats the squirming interlocutor as an eight-year-old child with personality deficiencies. It has been fascinating, recently, to watch her striving to eliminate this.  BBC2 ''News Extra'' on Tuesday night rolled a clip from May 1973 demonstrating the Thatcher sneer at full pitch. (She was saying that she wouldn't ''dream'' of seeking the leadership.) She sounded like a cat sliding down a blackboard.&quot; {{cite news|work=The Observer |location=London|last=James|first=Clive|authorlink=Clive James|date=9 February 1975}} Anthologised in {{Harvnb|James|1977|pp=119–120}}.|group=nb}}  Thatcher had already begun to work on her presentation on the advice of [[Gordon Reece]], a former television producer.

On 19 January 1976 Thatcher made a speech in Kensington Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the Soviet Union: 
{{quote|The Russians are bent on world dominance, and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen. The men in the Soviet ''Politburo'' do not have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion. They put guns before butter, while we put just about everything before guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ironlady&quot;/&gt;}}
In response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' (''Red Star'') called her the &quot;[[Iron Lady]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ironlady&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102939|title=Britain Awake|accessdate=2 November 2008|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sobriquet she gladly adopted.

In mid-1978, the economy began to improve and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility.  Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] surprised many by announcing on 7 September that there would be no general election that year and he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government as &quot;chickens&quot;, and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[David Steel]] joined in, criticising Labour for &quot;running scared&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm|title=7 September 1978: Callaghan accused of running scared|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 January 2012|year=2008|work=On this day 1950–2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour government then faced fresh public unease about the direction of the country and a damaging series of strikes during the winter of 1978–79, dubbed the &quot;[[Winter of Discontent]]&quot;.  The Conservatives attacked the Labour government's unemployment record, using advertising with the slogan ''Labour Isn't Working''.  A [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election]] was called after [[James Callaghan]]'s government lost a [[1979 vote of no confidence against the government of James Callaghan|motion of no confidence]] in early 1979. The Conservatives won a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons, and Margaret Thatcher became the UK's first female Prime Minister.

Thatcher became Prime Minister on 4 May 1979. Arriving at 10 Downing Street, she said, in a paraphrase of the &quot;[[Prayer of Saint Francis]]&quot;:

{{quote|Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.}}

===Domestic affairs===
Thatcher was Leader of the Opposition and Prime Minister at a time of increased racial tension in Britain. Commenting on the [[United Kingdom local elections, 1977|local elections of May 1977]], ''[[The Economist]]'' noted &quot;The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties.  That specifically includes the National Front, which suffered a clear decline from last year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Economist|title=Votes go to Tories, and nobody else|date=14 May 1977|volume=263|issue=6976|pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/93030FB632E147999D4BEB655587A134.pdf ''Conservative Party Campaign Guide Supplement 1978'']. Published by the Conservative and Unionist Central Office.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her standing in the polls rose by 11&amp;nbsp;percent after a January 1978 interview for ''[[World in Action]]'' in which she said &quot;the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in.&quot;; and &quot;in many ways [minorities] add to the richness and variety of this country.

As Prime Minister, Thatcher met weekly with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to discuss government business, and their relationship came under close scrutiny.{{sfn|Reitan|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Seward|2001|p=154}} In July 1986 the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reported claims attributed to the Queen's advisers of a &quot;rift&quot; between [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Downing Street]] &quot;over a wide range of domestic and international issues&quot;.&lt;ref name=dismayed&gt;{{cite news |title=Queen dismayed by 'uncaring' Thatcher |newspaper=Sunday Times |date=20 July 1986 |first1=Simon |last1=Freeman |first2=Michael |last2=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rift&gt;{{cite news |title=The Queen And Thatcher: The story they couldn't kill; Alleged rift between Premier and British Monarch |newspaper=Sunday Times |date=27 July 1986 |first=Michael |last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace issued an official denial, heading off speculation about a possible constitutional crisis.&lt;ref name=rift/&gt; After Thatcher's retirement a senior Palace source again dismissed as &quot;nonsense&quot; the &quot;stereotyped idea&quot; that she had not got along with the Queen, or that they had fallen out over Thatcherite policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Queen to toast Thatcher|newspaper=The Times|date=16 October 1995|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher later wrote: &quot;I always found the Queen's attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct&amp;nbsp;... stories of clashes between 'two powerful women' were just too good not to make up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thatcher|1993|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1989, Thatcher queried her government’s response to the [[Taylor Report]], writing a hand-written comment on a Downing Street briefing note: ''“The broad thrust is devastating criticism of the police. Is that for us to welcome? Surely we welcome the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations?

During her time in office Thatcher practised great frugality in her official residence, including insisting on paying for her own ironing-board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holt|first1=Gerry|last2=Williams|first2=Nathan|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16319101|title=Files reveal Margaret Thatcher's frugal side|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy and taxation====
Thatcher's economic policy was influenced by [[monetarism|monetarist]] thinking and economists such as [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Childs-p185&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Childs|2006|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Geoffrey Howe]], she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p30&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She increased interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply and thereby lower inflation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Childs-p185&quot;/&gt; introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitan-p30&quot;/&gt; Her cuts in higher education spending resulted in her being the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister not to be awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford, after a 738 to 319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/29/newsid_2506000/2506019.stm |title=29 January 1985: Thatcher snubbed by Oxford dons |accessdate=9 April 2007 |work=On this day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her new centrally funded [[City Technology College]]s did not enjoy much success, and the Funding Agency for Schools was set up to control expenditure by opening and closing schools; the [[Social Market Foundation]], a right-wing think tank, described it as having &quot;an extraordinary range of dictatorial powers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Heathite Conservatives in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], the so-called &quot;[[wets and dries|wets]]&quot;, expressed doubt over Thatcher's policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;nft&quot;/&gt; The [[1981 England riots|1981 riots in England]] resulted in the British media discussing the need for a policy U-turn.

By 1987, unemployment was falling, the economy was stable and strong, and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge87.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=BBC |date=11 June 1987 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher reformed local government taxes by replacing [[Rates (tax)|domestic rates]]—a tax based on the nominal rental value of a home—with the [[Community Charge]] (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident.&lt;ref name=&quot;polltax&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DD1030F930A15757C0A966958260|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=30 October 2008|date=23 April 1990|last=Passell|first=Peter|title=Furor Over British Poll Tax Imperils Thatcher Ideology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proved to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership.&lt;ref name=&quot;polltax&quot;/&gt; Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000-strong demonstration in London on 31&amp;nbsp;March 1990; the demonstration around [[Trafalgar Square]] deteriorated into the [[Poll Tax Riots]], leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;otd pt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm|title=31 March 1990: Violence flares in poll tax demonstration|accessdate=30 October 2008|work=On this day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Community Charge was abolished by her successor, [[John Major]].&lt;ref name=&quot;otd pt&quot;/&gt;

In March 1984 the [[National Coal Board]] (NCB) proposed to close 20 of the 174&amp;nbsp;state-owned mines and cut 20,000&amp;nbsp;jobs out of 187,000.&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Glass|title=The Uncivilized Side of Britain Rears its Ugly Head|newspaper=The Record|date=16 December 1984|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Black&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Dave|title=Still unbowed, ex-miners to mark 25&amp;nbsp;years since the start of the strike|newspaper=The Journal|date=21 February 2009|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pits-closed&quot;/&gt; Two-thirds of the country's miners, led by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) under [[Arthur Scargill]], downed tools in protest.&lt;ref name=Glass/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thatcher-num&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3537463.stm|title=Iron Lady versus union baron|accessdate=20 November 2008|date=6 March 2004|last=Hannan|first=Patrick|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Jones|title=A History of the Miners' Strike|work=Press Association National Newswire|date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher refused to meet the union's demands and compared the miners' dispute to the Falklands conflict two years earlier, declaring in a speech in 1984: &quot;We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands.

The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £1.5&amp;nbsp;billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar.&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Timothy|title=Miners return to work today.

The number of stoppages across the UK peaked at 4583 in 1979, when more than 29&amp;nbsp;million working days were lost.

====Privatisation====
[[File:Margaret Thatcher visiting Salford.jpg|thumb|right|Thatcher on a visit to the [[University of Salford]], 1982]]
The policy of [[privatisation]] has been called &quot;a crucial ingredient of Thatcherism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seldon|Collings|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1983 election the sale of state utilities accelerated;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feigenbaum|Henig|Hamnett|1998|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than £29&amp;nbsp;billion was raised from the sale of nationalised industries, and another £18&amp;nbsp;billion from the sale of council houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of privatisation, especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation, was associated with marked improvements in performance, particularly in terms of [[workforce productivity|labour productivity]].&lt;ref name=ParkerMartin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=David|last2=Martin|first2=Stephen|title=The impact of UK privatisation on labour and total factor productivity|journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy|volume=42|issue=2|date=May 1995|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the privatised industries, including gas, water, and electricity, were [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement often did so while still under state ownership. [[British Steel]], for instance, made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed chairmanship of Ian MacGregor, who faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and reduce the workforce by half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirby|first=M. W.|year=2006|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69687|contribution=MacGregor, Sir Ian Kinloch (1912–1998)|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=online|accessdate=24 November 2009}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation was also significantly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies like [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets|Ofgas]], [[Oftel]] and the [[National Rivers Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Veljanovski|1990|pp=291–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries;&lt;ref name=ParkerMartin/&gt; in most cases privatisation benefitted consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but the results overall were &quot;mixed&quot;.&lt;ref name=McAleese&gt;{{Harvnb|McAleese|2004|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher always resisted rail privatisation, and was said to have told Transport Secretary [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]] &quot;Railway privatisation will be the Waterloo of this government. Please never mention the railways to me again.&quot; Shortly before her resignation, she accepted the arguments for privatising [[British Rail]], which her successor John Major implemented in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=495}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' later considered the move to have been &quot;a disaster&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAleese&quot;/&gt;

The privatisation of public assets was combined with financial deregulation in an attempt to fuel economic growth. Geoffrey Howe abolished Britain's exchange controls in 1979, allowing more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] of 1986 removed many restrictions on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. The Thatcher government encouraged growth in the finance and service sectors to compensate for Britain's ailing manufacturing industry.

====Northern Ireland====
In 1980 and 1981, [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) prisoners in Northern Ireland's [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze Prison]] carried out [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger strikes]] in an effort to regain the status of political prisoners that had been removed in 1976 under the preceding Labour government.&lt;ref name=&quot;strike&quot;/&gt; [[Bobby Sands]] began the 1981 strike, saying that he would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over their living conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/3/newsid_2451000/2451503.stm|title=3 October 1981: IRA Maze hunger strikes at an end|publisher=BBC|work=On this day 1950–2005|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for the prisoners, declaring &quot;Crime is crime is crime; it is not political&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;strike&quot;/&gt; but nevertheless the UK government privately contacted republican leaders in a bid to bring the hunger strikes to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6036723.ece|title=Was Gerry Adams complicit over hunger strikers?|accessdate=20 April 2009|date=5 April 2009|newspaper=Sunday Times|last=Clarke|first=Liam|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of Sands and nine others, some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but not official recognition of their political status.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN-hs&quot;/&gt; Violence in Northern Ireland escalated significantly during the hunger strikes; in 1982 [[Sinn Féin]] politician [[Danny Morrison (writer)|Danny Morrison]] described Thatcher as &quot;the biggest bastard we have ever known&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|English|2005|pp=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher narrowly escaped injury in an IRA [[Brighton hotel bombing|assassination attempt]] at a Brighton hotel early in the morning on 12&amp;nbsp;October 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-bomb&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/12/newsid_2531000/2531583.stm|accessdate=29 October 2008|title=12 October 1984: Tory Cabinet in Brighton bomb blast|work=On this day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five people were killed, including the wife of Cabinet Minister [[John Wakeham]].

On 6 November 1981 Thatcher and Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] had established the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, a forum for meetings between the two governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN-hs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/chronology.htm|title=The Hunger Strike of 1981&amp;nbsp;– A Chronology of Main Events|publisher=[[CAIN]], University of Ulster|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], the first time a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland.

Thatcher took office in the penultimate decade of the [[Cold War]] and became closely aligned with the policies of United States President [[Ronald Reagan]], based on their shared distrust of Communism,&lt;ref name=&quot;thatcher-cw&quot;/&gt; although she strongly opposed Reagan's October 1983 [[invasion of Grenada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gilbert|2002|p=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her first year as Prime Minister she supported [[NATO]]'s decision to deploy US nuclear [[BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile|cruise]] and [[MGM-31 Pershing|Pershing missile]]s in Western Europe,&lt;ref name=&quot;thatcher-cw&quot;/&gt; and permitted the US to station more than 160&amp;nbsp;cruise missiles at [[RAF Greenham Common]], starting on 14&amp;nbsp;November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thatcher-cw&quot;/&gt; She bought the [[UK Trident programme|Trident]] nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922079,00.html|title=Trident is go|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=28 July 1980|magazine=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an eventual cost of more than £12&amp;nbsp;billion (at 1996–97 prices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/uk/slbm/vanguard.htm|title=Vanguard Class Ballistic Missile Submarine|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=5 November 1999|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the [[Westland affair]] of January 1986, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer [[Westland Helicopters|Westland]] to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm [[Agusta]] in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]]. The UK Defence Secretary, [[Michael Heseltine]], who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 1982 the ruling military junta in Argentina ordered the invasion of the British-controlled [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia]], triggering the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent crisis was &quot;a defining moment of her [Thatcher's] premiership&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackling 2005 230&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackling|2005|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the suggestion of [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Robert Armstrong]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackling 2005 230&quot;/&gt; she set up and chaired a small War Cabinet (formally called ODSA, Overseas and Defence committee, South Atlantic) to take charge of the conduct of the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by 5–6&amp;nbsp;April had authorised and dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina surrendered on 14&amp;nbsp;June and the operation was hailed a success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255&amp;nbsp;British servicemen and 3&amp;nbsp;Falkland Islanders. Argentinian deaths totalled 649, half of them after the nuclear-powered submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} torpedoed and sank the cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']] on 2&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=liberation&gt;{{cite news|title=The Falklands: 25 years since the Iron Lady won her war; Liberation Day|newspaper=The Times|date=15 June 2007|page=32|first=Michael|last=Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher was criticised for the neglect of the Falklands' defence that led to the war, and notably by [[Tam Dalyell]] in parliament for the decision to sink the ''General Belgrano'', but overall she was considered a highly capable and committed war leader.{{sfn|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|pp=335–336}} The &quot;Falklands factor&quot;, an economic recovery beginning early in 1982, and a bitterly divided Labour opposition contributed to Thatcher's second election victory in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanders |first1=David |last2=Ward |first2=Hugh |last3=Marsh |first3=David |title=Government Popularity and the Falklands War: A Reassessment |journal=British Journal of Political Science |volume=17 |date=July 1987 |page=28 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher often referred after the war to the &quot;Falklands Spirit&quot;; Hastings and Jenkins (1983) suggested that this reflected her preference for the streamlined decision-making of her [[War Cabinet#Falklands War, 1982|War Cabinet]] over the painstaking deal-making of peace-time [[cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet government]].{{sfn|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|p=329}}

Although saying that she was against [[apartheid]], Thatcher stood against the sanctions imposed on South Africa by the [[Commonwealth]] and the [[European Community|EC]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Margaret Thatcher Volume Two: The Iron Lady, Random House, 2011, p.322.&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the regime there to abandon apartheid. This included &quot;[c]asting herself as President [[P.W. Botha|Botha's]] candid friend&quot;, and inviting him to visit the UK in June 1984, in spite of the &quot;inevitable demonstrations&quot; against his regime.{{sfn|Campbell|2011|p=325}} Thatcher, on the other hand, was no friend of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), which Geoffrey Howe recalls her dismissing as late as October 1987 as &quot;a typical terrorist organisation&quot;.{{sfn|Howe|1994|pp=477–78}}

The Thatcher government supported the [[Khmer Rouge]] keeping their seat in the UN after they were ousted from power in Cambodia by the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]].

Thatcher's antipathy towards [[European integration]] became more pronounced during her premiership, particularly after her third election victory in 1987. During a 1988 speech in [[Bruges]] she outlined her opposition to proposals from the European Community (EC), forerunner of the [[European Union]], for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107332|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=31 October 2008|date=20 September 1988|title=Speech to the College of Europe (&quot;The Bruges Speech&quot;)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher and her party had supported British membership of the EC in the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 national referendum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;upi19750604&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M7QsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lQoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2825%2C608551 |title=Conservatives favor remaining in market |work=Wilmington Morning Star |date=4 June 1975 |agency=UPI |accessdate=26 December 2011 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC's approach was at odds with her views on smaller government and deregulation;&lt;ref name=&quot;Senden-p9&quot;/&gt; in 1988, she remarked, &quot;We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Senden-p9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Senden|2004|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher was firmly opposed to the UK's membership of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a precursor to European monetary union, believing that it would constrain the British economy,&lt;ref name=&quot;ecc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Thatcher stands firm against full EMS role|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106969|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=8 October 2008|last=Riddell|first=Peter|date=23 November 1987|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the urging of her Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Nigel Lawson]] and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe,{{sfn|Thatcher|1993|p=712}} but she was persuaded by John Major to join in October 1990, at what proved to be too high a rate.{{sfn|Marr|2007|p=484}}

Following Reagan–Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, she declared in November 1988 that &quot;We're not in a Cold War now&quot;, but rather in a &quot;new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;reforms1988&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC1738F93BA25752C1A96E948260|title= Gorbachev Policy Has Ended The Cold War, Thatcher Says|date=18 November 1988|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984, and met with Gorbachev and [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Zemtsov|first1=Ilya|last2=Farrar|first2=John|title=Gorbachev: The Man and the System|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4128-0717-3|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher was initially opposed to [[German reunification]], telling Gorbachev that it &quot;would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security&quot;. She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Görtemaker|2006|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast she was an advocate of [[Croatia]]n and [[Slovenia]]n independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/111358|title=TV Interview for HRT (Croatian radiotelevision) [urges international recognition of Croatia &amp; Slovenia]|date=22 December 1991|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1991 interview for [[Croatian Radiotelevision]],  Thatcher commented on the [[Yugoslav Wars]]; she was critical of Western governments for not recognising the breakaway republics of Croatia and Slovenia as independent states and supplying them with arms after the Serbian-led [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5D7123DF937A15752C1A967958260|title=Thatcher Close to Break With Her Replacement|last=Whitney|first=Craig R.|date=24 November 1991|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges to leadership and resignation===
{{See also|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990}}
Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by the little-known backbench MP Sir [[Anthony Meyer]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1989|1989 leadership election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;89election&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm|accessdate=1 November 2008|title=5 December 1989: Thatcher beats off leadership rival|publisher=BBC|work=On this day 1950–2005|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 374&amp;nbsp;Conservative MPs eligible to vote 314 voted for Thatcher and 33 for Meyer.&lt;ref name=&quot;89election&quot;/&gt; Her supporters in the party viewed the result as a success, and rejected suggestions that there was discontent within the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;89election&quot;/&gt;

During her premiership Thatcher had the second-lowest average approval rating, at 40&amp;nbsp;percent, of any post-war Prime Minister. Polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridley&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ridley|first=Matt|title=Et Tu, Heseltine?; Unpopularity Was a Grievous Fault, and Thatcher Hath Answered for It|periodical=Washington Post|date=25 November 1990|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted that she did not care about her poll ratings, pointing instead to her unbeaten election record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The poll tax incubus|newspaper=The Times|date=24 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThatcherProfile.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photograph|Thatcher in 1990]]
Opinion polls in September 1990 reported that Labour had established a 14% lead over the Conservatives,&lt;ref name=&quot;howe&quot;/&gt; and by November the Conservatives had been trailing Labour for 18&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridley&quot;/&gt; These ratings, together with Thatcher's combative personality and willingness to override colleagues' opinions, contributed to discontent within the Conservative party.&lt;ref name=&quot;resign-nyt&quot;/&gt;

On 1&amp;nbsp;November 1990 [[Geoffrey Howe]], the last remaining member of Thatcher's original 1979 cabinet, resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister over her refusal to agree to a timetable for Britain to join the European single currency.&lt;ref name=&quot;howe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/1/newsid_2513000/2513953.stm|accessdate=1 November 2008|title=1 November 1990: Howe resigns over Europe policy|work=On this day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Millership|first=Peter|title=Thatcher's Deputy Quits in Row over Europe|newspaper=Reuters News|date=1 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his resignation speech on 13&amp;nbsp;November, Howe commented on Thatcher's European stance: &quot;It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find the moment that the first balls are bowled that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Geoffrey Howe savages Prime Minister over European stance in Resignation speech |newspaper=The Times |date=14 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; His resignation was fatal to Thatcher's premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walters |first1=Alan |title=Sir Geoffrey Howe's resignation was fatal blow in Mrs Thatcher's political assassination |newspaper=The Times |date=5 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, [[Michael Heseltine]] mounted a challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion polls had indicated that he would give the Conservatives a national lead over Labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Lipsey |title=Poll swing followed downturn by Tories; Conservative Party leadership |newspaper=The Times |date=21 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Thatcher won the first ballot, Heseltine attracted sufficient support (152 votes) to force a second ballot.&lt;ref name=&quot;number-10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/past-prime-ministers/margaret-thatcher/ |title=Margaret Thatcher |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher initially stated that she intended to &quot;fight on and fight to win&quot; the second ballot, but consultation with her Cabinet persuaded her to withdraw.&lt;ref name=&quot;resign-nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DB1438F930A15752C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Change in Britain; Thatcher Says She'll Quit; 11½ Years as Prime Minister Ended by Party Challenge |accessdate=1 November 2008 |date=23 November 1990 |newspaper=New York Times |last=Whitney |first=Craig R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;resign-bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/22/newsid_2549000/2549189.stm |title=22 November 1990: Thatcher quits as prime minister |accessdate=1 November 2008 |work=On this day 1950–2005 |publisher=BBC |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the Queen, calling other world leaders, and making one final Commons speech, she left Downing Street in tears. She regarded her ousting as a betrayal.{{sfn|Marr|2007|p=474}}

Thatcher was replaced as Prime Minister and party leader by her Chancellor [[John Major]], who oversaw an upturn in Conservative support in the 17&amp;nbsp;months leading up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] and led the Conservatives to their fourth successive victory on 9&amp;nbsp;April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/apr/04/electionspast.past3|title=Pollsters taxed|work=The Guardian |date=4 April 2005|accessdate=23 January 2011|last=Kettle|first=Martin|publisher=Guardian News and Media|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher favoured Major over Heseltine in the leadership contest, but her support for him weakened in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/463873.stm|title=Major attacks 'warrior' Thatcher|accessdate=1 November 2008|date=3 October 1999|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Thatcher returned to the backbenches as MP for Finchley for two years after leaving the premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired from the House at the 1992 election, aged 66, saying that leaving the Commons would allow her more freedom to speak her mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;lords&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/30/newsid_2523000/2523395.stm|title=30 June 1992: Thatcher takes her place in Lords|accessdate=1 November 2008|work=On this day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Commons===
After leaving the House of Commons, Thatcher became the first former Prime Minister to set up a foundation; it closed down in 2005 because of financial difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyandpolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-101.html|title=What next for Gordon Brown?|last=Theakston|first=Kevin|date=May 2010|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote two volumes of memoirs, ''The Downing Street Years'' (1993) and ''The Path to Power'' (1995).

In July 1992, Thatcher was hired by the tobacco company [[Altria|Philip Morris]] as a &quot;geopolitical consultant&quot; for $250,000 per year and an annual contribution of $250,000 to her foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-19/news/mn-4763_1_margaret-thatcher|title=Tobacco Company Hires Margaret Thatcher as Consultant|date=19 July 1992|newspaper=LA Times|accessdate=16 January 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also earned $50,000 for each speech she delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/feb/03/past.conservatives?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Into the void|date=3 February 2007|accessdate=16 January 2011|last=Harris|first=John|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1992, Thatcher called for NATO to stop the Serbian assault on [[Goražde]] and [[Sarajevo]] to end [[ethnic cleansing]] during the [[Bosnian War]]. She compared the situation in Bosnia to &quot;the worst excesses of the Nazis&quot;, and warned that there could be a &quot;holocaust&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 August 1992 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DE1731F935A3575BC0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Stop the Excuses.

Thatcher was honorary [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[College of William and Mary]] in Virginia (1993–2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chancellor's Robe |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/robe/index.php|publisher=College of William and Mary |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also of the [[University of Buckingham]] (1992–1999), the UK's first private university, which she had opened in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thatcher installed as chancellor of private university |date=1 October 1992 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/thatcher-installed-as-chancellor-of-private-university-charles-oulton-reports-on-a-day-of-mixed-emotions-for-the-former-prime-minister-1554652.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=12 January 2010 |first=Charles |last=Oulton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|election as Labour Party leader]] in 1994, Thatcher praised Blair in an interview as &quot;probably the most formidable Labour leader since [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. I see a lot of socialism behind their front bench, but not in Mr Blair. I think he genuinely has moved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Castle |first=Stephen |title=Thatcher praises 'formidable' Blair |newspaper=The Independent |date=28 May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Thatcher called for the release of former Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] when Spain had him [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|arrested]] and sought to try him for human rights violations, citing the help he gave Britain during the Falklands War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pinochet&amp;nbsp;– Thatcher's ally |date=22 October 1998 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/198604.stm|accessdate=15 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she visited him while he was under house arrest near London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thatcher stands by Pinochet|date=26 March 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/304516.stm |accessdate=15 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinochet was released in March 2000 on medical grounds by the Home Secretary [[Jack Straw]], without facing trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pinochet set free |date=2 March 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/663170.stm |accessdate=15 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] Thatcher supported the Conservative general election campaign, but did not endorse [[Iain Duncan Smith]] as she had done for John Major and William Hague. In the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001|Conservative leadership election]] shortly after, she supported Smith over Kenneth Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter supporting Iain Duncan Smith for the Conservative leadership published in the ''Daily Telegraph''|date=21 August 2001|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108390|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, Thatcher's book ''[[Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World]]'', dedicated to Ronald Reagan, was released. In it, she claimed there would be no peace in the Middle East until [[Saddam Hussein]] was toppled, that Israel must trade land for peace, and that the European Union (EU) was &quot;fundamentally unreformable&quot;, &quot;a classic utopian project, a monument to the vanity of intellectuals, a programme whose inevitable destiny is failure&quot;. She argued that Britain should renegotiate its terms of membership or else leave the EU and join the [[North American Free Trade Area]]. The book was serialised in ''The Times'' on 18 March.

Thatcher suffered several small strokes in 2002 and was advised by her doctors not to engage in any more public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement from the office of the Rt Hon Baroness Thatcher LG OM FRS|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=22 March 2002|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109305 |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 March she announced that on the advice of her doctors she would cancel all planned speaking engagements and accept no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|2003|pp=796–798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thatcher attended the official Washington, D.C. memorial service to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States.

==Legacy==
{{Thatcherism}}
Thatcher defined her own political philosophy, in a major and controversial break with One Nation Conservatives like her predecessor Edward Heath,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=John|title=Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-09-951677-2|pages= 530–532}}&lt;/ref&gt; in her statement to Douglas Keay, published in ''[[Woman's Own]]'' magazine in September 1987:

{{quote|I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand &quot;I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!&quot; or &quot;I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!&quot; &quot;I am homeless, the Government must house me!&quot; and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview for Woman's Own (&quot;no such thing as society&quot;) with journalist Douglas Keay |date=23&amp;nbsp;September 1987 |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106689 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=10&amp;nbsp;April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To her supporters, Margaret Thatcher remains a figure who revitalised Britain's economy, curbed the trade unions, and re-established the nation as a world power.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy-bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Evaluating Thatcher's legacy|date=4 May 2004|accessdate=1 November 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3681973.stm|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She oversaw an increase from 7% to 25% of adults owning shares, and more than a million families bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55% to 67% in owner-occupiers. Total personal wealth rose by 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher's premiership was also marked by high unemployment and social unrest,&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy-bbc&quot;/&gt; and many critics fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by high unemployment as a result of her [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies have still not fully recovered and are blighted by social problems such as drug abuse and family breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richards|2004|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Scotland in April 2009, before the 30th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister, Thatcher insisted she had no regrets and was right to introduce the poll tax, and to withdraw subsidies from &quot;outdated industries, whose markets were in terminal decline&quot;, subsidies that created &quot;the culture of dependency, which had done such damage to Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thatcher: I did right by Scots; Thatcher: I regret nothing|newspaper=Sunday Times |date=26 April 2009 |page=1|first=Jason|last=Allardyce  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political economist [[Susan Strange]] called the new financial growth model &quot;casino capitalism&quot;, reflecting her view that speculation and financial trading were becoming more important to the economy than industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gamble|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have regretted Thatcher's influence in the abandonment of [[full employment]], poverty reduction and a consensual civility as bedrock policy objectives. She has been criticised as being divisive&lt;ref name=&quot;greatestpm&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm|work=BBC News|title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM?| date=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for promoting greed and selfishness.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy-bbc&quot;/&gt; Many recent biographers have been critical of aspects of the Thatcher years and [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]], writing in ''[[New Statesman]]'' in February 2009, challenged the view that her reforms had brought a net benefit.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Who was it who first removed the seat belts and airbags from the safe-but-boring Volvo that the West built after 1945? 'Her freer, more promiscuous version of capitalism' in [[Hugo Young]]'s phrase is reaping a darker harvest.&quot; Michael White &quot;The Making of Maggie&quot; ''New Statesman'' 26 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being Britain's first woman Prime Minister, some critics contend Thatcher did &quot;little to advance the political cause of women&quot;,&lt;ref name=EvansP25&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2004|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; either within her party or the government, and some British feminists regarded her as &quot;an enemy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burns|2009|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stance on immigration was perceived as part of a rising racist public discourse, which Professor Martin Barker has called &quot;[[new racism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chin09&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chin|2009|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced at the outset by [[Keith Joseph]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;[[Thatcherism]]&quot; came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including [[moral absolutism]], [[British nationalism|nationalism]], interest in the individual, and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.{{#tag:ref|[[Nigel Lawson]] listed the Thatcherite ideals as: &quot;Free markets, financial discipline, firm control over public expenditure, tax cuts, nationalism, 'Victorian values' (of the [[Samuel Smiles]] self-help variety), privatisation and a dash of populism.&quot; {{Harvnb|Lawson|1992|p=64}}|group=nb}} The nickname &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, originally given to her by the Soviets, became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/international_politics/clips/2029/|title=Margaret Thatcher: Britain's Iron Lady&amp;nbsp;– CBC Archives|publisher=Archives.cbc.ca|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/world/thatcher-quits-public-life-citing-health.html|title=Thatcher Quits Public Life, Citing Health|work=The New York Times|date=23 March 2002|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=14 June 2009 2:30&amp;nbsp;am|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/world/margaret-thatcher-rushed-to-hospital/story-e6frg1p3-1225734493486|title=Margaret Thatcher rushed to hospital|publisher=Perth Now|date=14 June 2009|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] praised some of Thatcher's key policies, stating: &quot;Some of what happened in the 1980s was right. It was right to let people buy their council houses. It was right to cut tax rates of 60, 70, 80 per cent. And it was right to change the rules on the closed shop, on strikes before ballots.

Thatcher's tenure of 11 years and 209 days as Prime Minister was the longest since [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] (13 years and 252 days in three spells starting in 1885), and the longest continuous period in office since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] (14 years and 305 days starting in 1812).&lt;ref name=&quot;number-10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=HM Government |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/past-prime-ministers/robert-banks-jenkinson-earl-of-liverpool/ |title=Robert Banks Jenkinson Earl of Liverpool |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media depictions===
{{main|Cultural depictions of Margaret Thatcher}}
Margaret Thatcher has been depicted in many television programmes, documentaries, films and plays.  She was played by [[Patricia Hodge]] in [[Ian Curteis]]'s long unproduced ''[[The Falklands Play]]'' (2002) and by [[Andrea Riseborough]] in the TV film ''[[The Long Walk to Finchley]]'' (2008).  She is the titular character in two films, portrayed by [[Lindsay Duncan]] in ''[[Margaret (2009 film)|Margaret]]'' (2009) and by [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12393674|title=Image of Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher unveiled|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=8 February 2011|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she is depicted as having [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinberg|first=Julie|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/12/22/the-iron-lady-draws-fire-for-depicting-thatcher-with-alzheimers/|title='The Iron Lady' Draws Fire For Depicting Margaret Thatcher With Alzheimer's&amp;nbsp;— Speakeasy&amp;nbsp;— WSJ|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher was lampooned by satirist [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] in several media. Wells collaborated with [[Richard Ingrams]] on the spoof &quot;[[Dear Bill]]&quot; letters which ran as a column in ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine, were published in book form, and were then adapted into a West End stage revue as ''Anyone for Denis?'', starring Wells as Denis Thatcher. The stage show was followed by a [[Anyone for Denis? (TV version)|1982 TV special]] directed by [[Dick Clement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anyone for Denis?|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/4789|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Wells was commissioned by comedy producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] to write and perform on a comedy record album titled ''Iron Lady: The Coming Of The Leader'' on which Thatcher was portrayed by comedienne and noted Thatcher impersonator [[Janet Brown]]. The album consisted of skits and songs satirising Thatcher's rise to power.

''[[Spitting Image#Politicians|Spitting Image]]'', a satirical British TV show, once portrayed Thatcher as a bullying tyrant, wearing trousers, and ridiculing her own ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest songs===
Thatcher was the subject or the inspiration for several [[protest song]]s. The [[Red Wedge]] collective, founded by [[Billy Bragg]], [[Paul Weller]] and other musicians, unsuccessfully sought to oust Thatcher with the help of music. In 1987, they organised a comedy tour with British comedians [[Lenny Henry]], [[Ben Elton]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Harry Enfield]] and others.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Songs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3682281.stm|title=Rocking against Thatcher|work=BBC News|date=4 May 2004|last=Heard|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;
