'''South America''' &lt;!-- Only put in English phonetics, do not list &quot;South America&quot; in other languages --&gt; is a [[continent]] located in the [[Western Hemisphere]], mostly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with a relatively small portion in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The continent is also considered a [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/st/SthAmer.html South America]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}. The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed. 2001–6. New York, [[Columbia University Press]]&quot;: &quot;fourth largest continent ..., the southern of the two continents of the Western Hemisphere.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/subject/countries/ |title=LANIC country page |publisher=Lanic.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the northwest. It includes twelve independent countries - [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]] - as well as [[French Guiana]], which is an overseas region of [[France]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. In addition to this, the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] of the [[Netherlands]] may also be considered part of South America, as well as [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The South American countries that border the Caribbean Sea - Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana - are also known as [[Caribbean South America]].

South America has an [[area]] of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its [[population]] as of 2005 has been estimated at more than 371,090,000. South America [[List of continents by population|ranks fourth]] in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[North America]]) and fifth in population (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]]).
[[America (terminology)|The word ''America'']] was coined in 1507 by [[cartographer]]s [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was the first European to suggest that the lands newly discovered by Europeans were not [[India]], but a [[New World]] unknown to Europeans.&lt;!--does this sentence really belong here?--&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of South America}}

[[File:South America - Blue Marble orthographic.jpg|thumb|250px|A composite relief image of South America.]]
South America occupies the southern portion of the [[Americas|American]] [[landmass]]. The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the [[Darién Gap|Darién watershed]] along the [[Colombia]]–[[Panama]] border. Some sources {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} instead suggest the [[Panama Canal]]. [[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]] and geographically&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Saul Bernard. 2003.

South America's triangular shape gives it the shortest coastline, for its size, of any of the continents.

Traditionally, South America also includes some of the nearby islands. [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]], [[Trinidad]], [[Tobago]], and the [[federal dependencies of Venezuela]]  sit on the northerly South American [[continental shelf]] and are often considered part of the continent. Geo-politically, the island states and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part or subregion of North America, since they are more distant on the [[Caribbean Plate]], even though [[San Andres]] and [[Providencia Island|Providencia]] are politically part of [[Colombia]] and [[Aves Island]] is controlled by [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=&quot;North America Atlas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=sameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w South America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas |title=United Nations Statistics Division- Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49) |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other islands that are included with South America are the [[Galápagos Islands]] that belong to [[Ecuador]] and [[Easter Island]] (in [[Oceania]] but belongs to [[Chile]]), [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] are also Chilean islands, while [[Tierra del Fuego]] is split between that country and [[Argentina]]. In the Atlantic, [[Brazil]] owns [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], and the [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], while the [[Falkland Islands]] are governed by the [[United Kingdom]], whose sovereignty over the islands is [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed by Argentina]]. [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] may be associated with either South America or [[Antarctica]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

South America is home to the world's highest [[waterfall]], [[Angel Falls]] in Venezuela; the largest river (by volume), the [[Amazon River]]; the longest mountain range, the [[Andes]] (whose highest mountain is [[Aconcagua]] at 6,962 m [22,841&amp;nbsp;ft]); the driest place on earth, the [[Atacama Desert]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0308/feature3/ |title=Atacama Desert @ National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremescience.com/DriestPlace.htm |title=Driest Place &amp;#124; Driest Desert Atacama Desert|publisher=Extremescience.com |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://quest.nasa.gov/challenges/marsanalog/egypt/AtacamaAdAstra.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the largest rainforest, the [[Amazon Rainforest]]; the highest capital city, [[La Paz, Bolivia]]; the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, [[Lake Titicaca]]; and, excluding research stations in [[Antarctica]], the world's southernmost permanently inhabited community, [[Puerto Toro, Chile]].

South America's major mineral resources are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], and [[petroleum]]. These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.

South America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicuña]], and [[tapir]]. The Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion of the Earth's [[species]].

Brazil is the largest country in South America, encompassing around half of the continent's land area and population. The remaining countries and territories are divided among three regions: The [[Andean States]], [[the Guianas]] and the [[Southern Cone]].

==History==
{{Main|History of South America}}

===Prehistory===
[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|250px|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or ''Cave of the Hands'', in Argentina.]]
South America was joined with Africa from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.

South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day [[Russia]]. They migrated south through [[North America]], and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Some archaeological finds do not fit this theory and have led to an alternative [[theory]] of pre-Siberian American aborigines.

The first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[squashes]], [[chillies]] and [[beans]] began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas&quot;/&gt;

South American cultures began domesticating [[llamas]], [[vicuñas]], [[guanacos]], and [[alpacas]] in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas&quot;/&gt;

===Pre-Columbian civilizations===

{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}
[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.jpg|thumb|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], Peru]]

The rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.

One of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chavín]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chavín de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.

In the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the [[1st millennium]] AD, [[Moche]] (100 BC – 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC – 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC – 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.

Around 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600–1200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and tiahuanaco religious iconography.

The [[Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now modern Colombia. They established a confederation of many clans, or cacicazgos, that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.

Other important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Cañari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chimu]] Empire (1300–1470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000–1450, Bolivia and southern Peru).

Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and &quot;the land of the four regions,&quot; in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.

The [[Mapuche]] in Central Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.

===European colonization===
{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Mestizo.jpg|thumb|250px|A representation of a '''[[Mestizo]]''', in a &quot;Pintura de [[Castas]]&quot; in the Colonial era. &quot;From Spaniard and Amerindian woman, begets Mestizo&quot;.]]

In 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.

The Treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|league]]s west of [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

Beginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies.

European infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) - to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance - and systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mita]], decimated the native population under Spanish control. After this, African [[Slavery|slave]]s, who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.

The Spaniards were committed to convert their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with traditional idolatry and their [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.

Eventually, the [[native Americans (Americas)|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, the mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and white or mestizo mothers.

Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of [[Latin America]]n.

[[Guyana]] was a Portuguese, Dutch, and eventually a [[British Empire|British colony]]. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.

===Independence from Spain and Portugal (Early 19th century)===
{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Independence of Brazil}}
[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|The [[Guayaquil conference]], between [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar]].]]
The European [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.

Many cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]], who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.

The independence of South America was secured by [[Simón Bolívar]] (Venezuela) and [[José de San Martín]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bolívar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Martín led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.

In the Portuguese kingdom of Brazil and Algarve, [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the independent Kingdom of Brazil in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]] and [[Pará]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil.

The newly independent nations began a process of [[Balkanization]], with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern day (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre Ríos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).

===Recent history===
[[File:E Minas Geraes C.jpeg|right|thumb|The Brazilian [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|''Minas Geraes'' class]] kindled an [[South American dreadnought race|Argentine–Brazilian–Chilean naval arms race]]]]
Early in the 20th century, the [[ABC Powers|three wealthiest South American countries]] engaged in [[South American dreadnought race|a vastly expensive naval arms race]] which was catalyzed by the introduction of a new warship type, the &quot;[[dreadnought]]&quot;. At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hough, ''The Big Battleship'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1966), 19. {{oclc|8898108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Scheina, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810–1987'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987), 86. ISBN 0-87021-295-8. {{oclc|15696006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The continent became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the U.S. Cold War doctrine of &quot;National Security&quot; against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]].

Argentina and Britain fought the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.

Colombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced FARC. These leftist groups smuggle narcotics out of Colombia to fund their operations, while also using kidnapping, bombings, land mines and assassinations as weapons against both elected and non-elected citizens.

Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after [[World War II]], but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Cambridge History of Latin America&quot;, edited by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press (1995) ISBN 0-521-39525-9&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, in most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued this far.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] turned into a severe problem in late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without recurring to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|default]] in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6tNWbywFXhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=latin+american+history |title=The Cambridge History of Latin ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24|isbn=978-0-521-39525-0|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards [[Integration of Latin America|regional integration]], with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the [[Andean Community]], [[Mercosur]] and [[Unasur]]. Notably, starting with the election of [[Hugo Chavez]] in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a [[pink tide]] - the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas, Peru and Colombia.

==Politics==
[[File:SACN member states.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Union of South American Nations]] member states.]]

During the first decade of the 21st century, South American governments have drifted to the political left, with [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders being elected in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Despite the move to the left, South America for the most part still embraces [[free market]] policies, and it is taking an active path toward greater continental integration.

Recently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: [[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]], thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/sovereign/integrate/2008/1029newconsensus.htm |title=Globalpolicy.org |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new political organization known as [[Union of South American Nations]] seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of [[tariff]]s.

==Ethnic demographics==

Descendants of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Quechuas|Quechua]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]], or the [[Urarina]]&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida ISBN 978-0-8130-3378-5 [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]&lt;/ref&gt; of Amazonia make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] (56%) and, per some sources, in [[Peru]] (44%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ecuador, Amerindians are a large minority that comprises two-fifths of the population. The white/European population is also a significant element in most other former Portuguese colonies.

The demographics of Colombia include approximately 20% white and European descendants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LcabJ98-t1wC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=chile+60%25+blancos+Esteva-Fabregat#PPA110,M1 |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXIII|publisher=Books.google.cl |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24|isbn=978-970-757-052-8|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Peru, European descendants are the third group in importance (15%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fppmedia.com/pdfs/html/moperu.html |title=LA Road Show |publisher=Fppmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other South American countries, the people of [[White people|European descent]] are more of a majority in [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/ar.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demographics of Chile|Chile]],&lt;ref name=blanca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geografia.fflch.usp.br/publicacoes/Geousp/Geousp13/Geousp13_Intercambio_Maurel.htm |title=Argentina, como Chile y Uruguay, su población está formada casi exclusivamente por una población blanca e blanca mestiza procedente del sur de Europa, más del 90% E.

In Venezuela the majority claimed to be multiracial and white, 49.9% and 42.2%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ine.gov.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/ResultadosBasicosCenso2011.pdf Resultado Básico del XIV Censo Nacional de Población y Vivienda 2011], (p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; 

South America is also home to one of the largest populations of [[African]]s.  This group is also significantly present in [[Guyana]], Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, [[Suriname]], French Guiana, and Ecuador. [[Mestizos]] (mixed white and Amerindian) are the largest ethnic group in [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] and the second group in [[Peru]]. East Indians form the largest ethnic group in Guyana. Brazil followed by Peru also have the biggest Japanese, Korean and [[China|Chinese communities]] in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080115i1.html=search.japantimes.co.jp |title=Japan Times |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is the most diverse country in South America and arguably the world, with large population of [[White people|Whites]], [[Mulatto]]s, [[Mestizos]], a significant population of [[Black People|Black]]s, as well as a sizeable community of [[Asian people|Asian]]s (from [[Asian people|East Asian]]s to West Asians who are also known as [[West Asian people|Middle Easterner]]s).

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of South America}}

[[File:Banco del Sur.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Rafael Correa]], [[Evo Morales]], [[Néstor Kirchner]], [[Cristina Fernández]], [[Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva]], [[Nicanor Duarte]], and [[Hugo Chávez]] at the signing of the founding charter of the [[Bank of the South]].]]

During the last two decades, South American countries have experienced significant economic growth, which can be seen in many of these countries with the construction of new [[skyscrapers]] like the [[Torre Gran Costanera|Gran Costanera]] tower in [[Chile]], and also transportations systems like the [[Bogota Metro]]. However, because of histories of high [[inflation]] in nearly all South American countries, [[interest rate]]s remain high and investment remains low. Interest rates are usually twice that of the United States. For example, interest-rates are about 22% in Venezuela and 23% in Suriname. The exception is Chile, which has been implementing free market economic policies since establishing military dictatorship in 1973 and has been increasing its social spending since the return of democratic rule in the early 1990s. This has led to economic stability and interest rates in the low single digits.

South America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=wfex/&gt; Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.&lt;ref name=wfex/&gt;

The [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than in most other continents. The richest 10% receive over 40% of the nation's income in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay,&lt;ref name=share&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.10TH.10|title=Income share held by highest 10%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the poorest 20% receive 3% or less in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.FRST.20/countries|title=Income share held by lowest 20%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie in the vicinity of skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments; nearly one in nine in South America live on less than $2 per day (on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis).&lt;ref name=wb2/&gt;

South Americans are culturally influenced by its indigenous peoples, the historic connection with Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and the impact of [[mass culture]] from the [[United States of America]], alongside waves of immigrants from around the globe.

South American nations have a rich variety of [[Latin American music|music]]. Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[samba]] and [[bossa nova]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre [[Nueva Canción]] movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America. People on the Peruvian coast created the fine [[guitar]] and [[cajon]] duos or trios in the most [[mestizo]] (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the [[Tondero]] (from Piura), the 19th century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early 20th century Paraguayan [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]]. In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Español|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.

The [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]] in novels, and [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in other genres. The Brazilian [[Machado de Assis]], a 19th century realist writer, is widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writer. His admirers include José Saramago, Carlos Fuentes, Susan Sontag and Harold Bloom.

Nowadays [[Paulo Coelho]] is one of the most read and translated authors. His bestseller [[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]] has been translated into 73 languages and is one of the most read books in the world.

Because of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[Latin American cuisine|South American cuisine]] has African, American Indian, Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African–influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and people in southern Chile and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], a herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, African, Andean, and Amazonic food.

===Language===
[[File:Languages of South America.svg|thumb|Languages in South America.]]

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (196,342,592 speakers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/disseminacao/online/popclock/popclock.php|title=Estimativas da População}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most spoken language in South America, followed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (193,243,411),&lt;ref name=SouthAmSpa&gt;Based on recent estimates, as of 2010.

Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of [[Suriname]]; [[English language|English]] is the official language of [[Guyana]], although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in the country such as [[Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. English is also spoken in the [[Falkland Islands]]. [[French language|French]] is the official language of [[French Guiana]] and the second language in Amapa ([[Brazil]]).

[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous languages]] of South America include [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and Bolivia; [[Wayuunaiki]] in northern Colombia ([[La Guajira]]); [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] in Paraguay and, to a much lesser extent, in Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and [[Mapudungun]] is spoken in certain pockets of southern Chile and, more rarely, Argentina. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.

Other languages found in South America include, Hindi and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in Suriname; [[Italian language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela, Peru and Chile; and [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Paraguay. German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]] is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] remains spoken and written in the historic towns of [[Trelew]] and [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]] in the Argentine [[Patagonia]]. There are also small clusters of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-speakers in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. [[Arabic]] speakers, often of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]], or [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent, can be found in Arab communities in Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and less frequently in Paraguay.

In most of the continent's countries, the upper classes and well-educated people regularly study English, French, German, or Italian, and are typically well-traveled. In those areas where tourism is a significant industry, English and some other European languages are often spoken. There are small Portuguese speaking areas in northernmost Uruguay because of the proximity of Brazil, as well a small Spanish speaking minority in the other side in southernmost Brazil. The cross exposure has led to the creation of the [[Portuñol]] creole language.
