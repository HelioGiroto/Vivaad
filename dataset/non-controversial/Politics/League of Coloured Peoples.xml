      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4315">'''The League of Coloured Peoples''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[civil rights|civil-rights]] organization that was founded in 1931 in [[London]] with the goal of racial equality around the world. Altthe League's primary focus was black rights in [[UK|Britain]], it also was involved in other civil-rights issues, such as the persecution of the [[Jews]] in [[Germany]]. In 1933, the League of Coloured Peoples began publication of the civil-rights journal ''[[The Keys (Journal)|The Keys]]'', and was a powerful civil-rights force until its dissolution in 1951.

==The beginning==
[[Harold Moody]], a [[physician]] and devout [[Christian]], was frustrated with the prejudice he experienced in Britain, from finding employment to simply obtaining a residence. Through his involvement with [[London Christian Endeavour Federation]], Moody began to confront employers who were refusing jobs to black Britons. On 13 March 1931, in a [[London]] [[YMCA]] in [[Tottenham Court Road]], Moody called a meeting with the contacts he had made over the years. On this night, they formed The League of Coloured Peoples. 

The inaugural executive committee of The League of Coloured Peoples included:
*[[Belfield Clark|Dr. C. Belfield Clark]] of [[Barbados]]
*[[George Roberts (Trinidad)|George Roberts]] of [[Trinidad]]
*[[Samson Morris]] of [[Grenada]]
*[[Robert Adams (actor)|Robert Adams]] of [[British Guiana]]
*[[Desmond Buckle]] of [[Gold Coast (British colony)|The Gold Coast]]
Also present at the inaugural meeting was [[Stella Thomas]], who would go on to become the first woman magistrate in West Africa.

Other prominent members included [[C. L. R. James]], [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and [[Una Marson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/harold-moody &quot;Harold Moody&quot;, Making Britain, The Open University.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
At the inaugural meeting, the '''The League of Coloured Peoples''' established four main aims:
*1. To protect the social, educational, economic and political interests of its members&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*2. To interest members in the welfare of coloured peoples in all parts of the world&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*3. To improve relations between the races &lt;/blockquote&gt;
*4. To cooperate and affiliate with organisations sympathetic to coloured people&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1937, a fifth aim was added:
*5. To render such financial assistance to coloured people in distress as lies within our capacity&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accomplishments==
===The Colour Bar in the Workplace===
From its inception in 1931 until the outbreak of [[World War II]], the League's primary focus was eliminating the [[colour bar]] (the restrictions placed on a group of people due to their race or colour) in the British workplace, in social life, and in housing. Throughout Britain in the 1930s, black people were refused service in many restaurants, hotels, and lodging houses. They also found it extremely difficult to find employment in many industries; the medical profession in particular drew the attention of the league, most likely due to founder and president [[Harold Moody|Harold Moody's]] personal struggles in that area. By 1935, a branch of the league focusing on equality in the shipping industry had grown to over 80 members. During the 1930s, The League of Coloured Peoples struck many blows for blacks in the workplace.

=== The Colour Bar in the Military ===
=== The Charter of Coloured People ===
== During the second world war ==

During the Second world war the LCP continued to highlight discrimination. Authorities organizing the evacuation of children from the big towns found it very difficult to find families who would accept to take in coloured children, and the LCP lobbied against this sort of discrimination.
