In a [[two-party system|two-party]] [[parliamentary system]] of government, a ''' hung parliament''' occurs when neither major [[political party]] (or bloc of allied parties) has an [[absolute majority]] of seats in the [[parliament]] ([[legislature]]). It is also less commonly known as a '''balanced parliament'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/may/05/minority-government-electoral-reform-editorial | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Balanced parliament: No need to rush | date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/scotland/8630998.stm | work=BBC News | title=SNP puts case for hung parliament | date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a legislature under '''no overall control'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48305720100507 | work=Reuters | title=Q+A - What happens if no party gets a majority in UK election? | date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/04/hung-parliament-minority-coalition-government | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Hung up on 'no overall control' | first=Akash | last=Paun | date=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-brown-campaign-cameron&lt;/ref&gt; If the legislature is [[bicameralism|bicameral]], and the government is [[Responsible government|responsible]] only to the [[lower house]], then &quot;hung parliament&quot; is used only with respect to that chamber. Most [[general election]]s in a two-party system will result in one party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government; a &quot;hung parliament&quot; is an exception to this pattern, and may be considered anomalous or undesirable. One or both main parties may seek to form a [[coalition government]] with smaller [[Third party (politics)|third parties]], or a [[minority government]] relying on [[confidence and supply]] support from third parties or [[independent (politician)|independent]]s. If these efforts fail, a [[dissolution of parliament]] and a fresh election may be the last resort.

In a [[multi-party system]] with legislatures elected by [[proportional representation]], it is rare for a party to win an outright majority of seats, so a &quot;hung parliament&quot; is the norm and the term is rarely used. However, the term may be used to describe an election in which no established alliance among the parties wins an outright majority, such as the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 German election]], in which the incumbent left-wing coalition and the right-wing opposition both failed to win a majority.

==History==
===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed for generations; traditionally, only the [[Tories]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], or from the mid-19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Parties, managed to deliver Members of Parliament in significant numbers. Hung parliaments were thus rare, especially during the 19th century. The possibility of change arose when, in the aftermath of the [[Act of Union, 1800]], a number of Irish MPs took seats in the House, though initially [[History of Ireland 1801–1923#Home Rule movement (1870–1914)|these]] followed the traditional alignments. However, two Reform Acts ([[Reform Act 1867|in 1867]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1884|in 1884]]) significantly extended the franchise and redrew the constituencies, and coincided with [[Catholic Emancipation|a change in Irish politics]]. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 General Election]], neither party had an overall majority.  The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power and made [[Irish Home Rule]] a condition of their support.  However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule, leading to [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|another general election in 1886]], in which the Conservatives won the most seats and governed with the support of the fragment of Liberalism opposed to Home Rule, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]].

Both the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|election of January 1910]], and that of [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] produced a hung parliament with an almost identical number of seats won by the governing Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This was due both to the constitutional crisis and to the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|elections of 1929]] resulted in the last hung parliament for many years; in the meantime Labour had replaced the Liberals as one of the two dominating parties.

Since the elections of 1929, there have been two general elections that resulted in hung parliaments in the UK.  The first was the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|election in February 1974]], and the ensuing parliament lasted only until [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|that October]]. The second was the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 election]], the result of which was a hung parliament with the Conservative party as the largest single party. The results for the 3 main parties were: Conservatives - 307, Labour - 258, Liberal Democrats - 57.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament &quot;General election 2010 results of a hung parliament&quot;], PoliticsRAW. May 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since the formation of this coalition, an Act of Parliament was passed creating Fixed Five-Term Parliaments, so that the next election will not take place until 2015. This was the idea of the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the Leader of the Liberal Democrats Party, who said that this would stop the Prime Minister, who is the Conservative Leader David Cameron, from calling a snap election as many Conservatives have requested. 

Hung parliaments can also arise when slim government majorities are eroded by [[by-election]] defeats and [[crossing the floor|defection]] of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to opposition parties, as well as resignations of MPs from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. This happened in December 1996 to the Conservative government of [[John Major]] (1990–97) and in mid 1978 to the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]] (1976–79); this latter period covers the era known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]. The minority government of Jim Callaghan came when Labour ended their 15-month [[Lib-Lab pact|pact]] with the Liberals having lost their majority in early 1977.

According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart Wilks-Heeg, the phrase &quot;hung parliament&quot; did not enter into common usage in the UK until the mid-1970s, and was first used in the press by journalist [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |title=Governing without majorities: Coming to terms with balanced Parliaments in UK politics |first=Andrew |last=Blick |coauthors= Stuart Wilks-Heeg|month=April |year=2010|publisher=Democratic Audit |location=Liverpool |page=2|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic treatments of hung parliaments include [[David Butler (academic)|David Butler]]'s ''Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain'' (Sheridan House, 1986) and [[Vernon Bogdanor]]'s 'Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).

===Canada===
{{See|Federal minority governments in Canada}}
 
Three recent Canadian Parliaments ([[38th Canadian Parliament|the 38th]], [[39th Canadian Parliament|the 39th]], and [[40th Canadian Parliament|the 40th]] Parliaments) were hung parliaments. However, the term is not used in Canada. Instead, the term &quot;minority government&quot; or &quot;[[minority parliament]]&quot; is used. Although minority governments have tended to be short-lived, the minority under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] managed to hold onto power from February 2006 until a [[no confidence vote]] in March 2011 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament and elections held on May 2, 2011. The subsequent election saw a majority parliament elected with Harper's [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] obtaining a 14-seat majority.

===Australia===
Australian parliaments are modelled on the [[Westminster system]], with a hung parliament typically defined as a lack of a lower house parliamentary majority from either the [[Australian Labor Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].

Hung parliaments are rare at the federal level in Australia, as a virtual [[two-party system]], in which the [[Australian Labor Party]] competes against an alliance of the [[conservatism|conservative]] parties, has existed with only brief interruptions since the early 20th century. Prior to 1910, no party had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As a result, there were frequent changes of government, several of which took place during parliamentary terms. Since 1910, when the two-party system was cemented, there have only been two hung parliaments, the first in 1940, the second in 2010. At the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]], incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] secured the support of the two [[crossbencher]]s and continued to govern, but in 1941 the independents switched their support to Labor, bringing [[John Curtin]] to power. At the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], which resulted in an exact 72-72 seat tie between Labor and The Liberal-National Coalition, incumbent Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] secured the support of four out of six Independent and Green Party crossbenchers and continued to govern. 

Having hung Parliaments in both Australia and the United Kingdom at the same time, and also briefly including Canada as well, is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth of Nations.

Hung parliaments are rather more common at a state level. The [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] and the [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory]] are both elected by [[Hare-Clark]] proportional representation, thus, elections commonly return hung parliaments. In other states and territories, candidates contest single-member seats. With far fewer seats than federal parliament, hung parliaments are more likely to be elected. Recent examples include [[New South Wales state election, 1991|New South Wales in 1991]], [[Queensland state election, 1995|Queensland in 1995]], [[Victorian state election, 1999|Victoria in 1999]], [[South Australian state election, 2002|South Australia in 2002]], [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australia in 2008]], the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|Australian Capital Territory in 2008]], and [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|Tasmania in 2010]].

==Consequences==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

In countries used to decisive election outcomes, a hung parliament is often viewed as an unfavourable outcome, leading to relatively weak and unstable government. A period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders negotiate with independents and minor parties to establish a working majority.

An aspiring [[head of government]] may seek to build a [[coalition government]]; in [[Westminster system]]s, this typically involves agreement on a joint legislative programme and a number of [[minister (government)|ministerial]] posts going to the minor coalition partners, in return for a stable majority. Alternatively, a [[minority government]] may be formed, establishing [[confidence and supply]] agreements in return for policy concessions agreed in advance, or relying on case by case support.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]], sitting [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Heath]] refused at first to resign, attempting to build a coalition government despite winning fewer seats (though gaining more votes) than the then [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. He was unable to do this, and so the Labour Party led by [[Harold Wilson]] took over, in a [[minority government]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK General Election]], another hung parliament occurred, and discussions followed to help create a stable government. This resulted in agreement on a [[coalition government]], which was also a [[majority government]], between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most votes and seats in the election, and the [[Liberal Democrats]].

===Australia===
In the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australian state election of 2008]] the [[Australian Labor Party]] won more seats than the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] at 28 to 24. The [[National Party of Western Australia|National Party]] along with three independents had the seats needed to give either party a majority. To help the Liberal Party form government, the Nationals supported the party on the condition that the [[Royalties for Regions policy]] was implemented.

In the [[Victorian state election, 1999|1999 Victorian state election]], the Labor Party won 42 seats, while the incumbent Liberal National Coalition retained 43, with 3 seats falling to independents. The Labor Party formed a minority government with the 3 independents.

The [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 Tasmanian state election]] resulted in a hung parliament.  After a period of negotiation, the incumbent Labor government led by [[David Bartlett]] was recommissioned, but containing the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens, [[Nick McKim]], as a minister, and the Greens' [[Cassy O'Connor]] as Cabinet Secretary.

In the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 Federal election]], neither Labor nor the Liberal coalition secured the majority of seats required to form a Government in their own right. Ultimately, a government was formed by [[Julia Gillard]] with the help of three independent members and a [[Australian Greens|Greens]] member for the [[Australian House of Representatives]].

==Greece==
The [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|2012 elections in Greece]] were overshadowed by the country's [[Greek financial crisis|dire financial position]], with a heavy backlash against the ruling parties that supported stiff austerity measures. The ruling [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] party lost much ground, with no party having the numbers or the agreement to form a working coalition. As a result, new elections will immediately be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/15/greece-fresh-election-unity-talks-fail?newsfeed=true |title=Greece to hold fresh elections as unity talks fail |publisher=The Guardian |author=Helena Smith |date=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68ECnPuZl |archivedate=2012-06-06 |accessdate=06 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working majority==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

There have been occasions when, although a parliament or assembly is technically hung, the party in power has a [[working majority]]. For example in the United Kingdom the tradition is that the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Deputy Speakers do not vote and [[Sinn Féin]] MPs never take their seats, so these members can be discounted from the opposition numbers.

===United Kingdom===
In 2005 for Wales, this was the case in the [[National Assembly for Wales]], where Labour lost their majority when [[Peter Law]] was expelled for standing against the official candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 Westminster election]] in the [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent constituency]]. When the Assembly was [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2003|first elected]] on 1 May 2003, [[Welsh Labour|Labour]] won 30 seats, [[Plaid Cymru]] won 12, the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservatives]] won 11, [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] won 6, and the [[John Marek Independent Party]] won a seat. When [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] (Plaid) was reelected as the presiding officer, this reduced the number of opposition AMs who could vote to 29, as the presiding officer only votes in the event of a tie, and even then not on party political lines but rather according to [[Speaker Denison's rule]]. Labour, thus, had a working majority of one seat. This was lost when Law ran in Blaenau Gwent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200504/1c6a58e1-0c76-46b6-8b0d-f3fd085839fc.htm Labour lose assembly majority as Law quits], ePolitix.com.
