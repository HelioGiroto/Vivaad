'''The University of Sydney''' is a public university located in Sydney, New South Wales.  The main campus spreads across the suburbs of [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] and [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]] on the southwestern outskirts of the [[Sydney central business district|Sydney CBD]]. Founded in 1850, it is the oldest university in Australia and Oceania. It has 32,393 undergraduate and 16,627 graduate students (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/strategic_planning/statistics/enrol/enrol.php?ci=3&amp;type=lvl&amp;yr=2011 |title=Sydney University: 2011 Enrolments – All Levels |publisher=Sydney.edu.au |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Sydney is organised into sixteen faculties and schools, through which it offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and [[Doctorate|doctoral degrees]]. Three [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates have been affiliated with the University as graduate and faculty.

Sydney consistently ranks amongst the top universities in Australia and Oceania. In 2012, it was ranked 39th in the world; 3rd in Australia, behind [[Australian National University]] (24th) and the [[University of Melbourne]] (36th) in the 2012 [[QS World University Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-sydney/wur | title=The University of Sydney – QS | publisher=Times QS | date=Q4 2012 | accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Sydney is a member of Australia's [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]], Academic Consortium 21, the [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities]] (APRU) and the [[Worldwide Universities Network]]. The University is also colloquially known as one of Australia's [[sandstone universities]].

==History==
In 1848, in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], [[William Wentworth]] proposed a plan to expand the existing Sydney College into a larger university. Wentworth argued that a state university was imperative for the growth of a society aspiring towards self-government, and that it would provide the opportunity for 'the child of every class, to become great and useful in the destinies of his country'. It would take two attempts on Wentworth's behalf, however, before the plan was finally adopted.

The University was established via the passage of the University of Sydney Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=79 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 September 1850 and was assented on 1 October 1850 by Sir Charles Fitzroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51788553 |title=WILLIAM CHARLES WENTWORTH. |newspaper=[[Rockhampton Morning Bulletin|Rockhampton Bulletin (Qld. : 1871 – 1878)]] |location=Qld. |date=21 May 1872 |accessdate=1 May 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the University was inaugurated on 11 October 1852 in the Big Schoolroom of what is now [[Sydney Grammar School]]. The first principal was [[John Woolley (educator)|John Woolley]]. On 27 February 1858 the University received its [[Royal Charter]] from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], giving degrees conferred by the university rank and recognition equal to those given by universities in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;royal_charter&quot;&gt;[http://sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2011/51&amp;RendNum=0]&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1859, the University had moved to its current site in the Sydney suburb of [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]].

In 1858, the passage of the Electoral Act provided for the University to become a constituency for the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] as soon as there were 100 graduates with higher degrees. This seat in Parliament was first filled in 1876, but was abolished in 1880 one year after its second Member, [[Edmund Barton]], was elected to the Legislative Assembly.

Most of the estate of [[John Henry Challis]] was bequeathed to the University, which received a sum of £200,000 in 1889. This was thanks in part due to [[William Montagu Manning]] (Chancellor 1878–1895) who argued against the claims by British Tax Commissioners. The following year seven professorships were created; anatomy, zoology, engineering, history, law, logic &amp; mental philosophy, and modern literature.

===1950–2000===
The New England University College was founded as part of the University of Sydney in 1938, and separated to become the University of New England in 1954.

[[File:Parramattard1870susyd.jpg|thumb|right|The University of Sydney in the early 1870s, as viewed from [[Parramatta Road]]]]

During the late 1960s, the University of Sydney was at the centre of rows to introduce courses on [[Marxism]] and feminism at the major Australian universities. At one stage, newspaper reporters descended on the University to cover brawls, demonstrations, secret memos and a walk-out by Professor [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], a respected philosopher who held the Challis Chair of Philosophy from 1959 to 1991, after students at one of his lectures openly demanded a course on feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=West, William | title = Argumentative days over | work=The Australian | date = 1 January 1992 | page = Higher Education Supplement, p. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy department split over the issue to become the Traditional and Modern Philosophy Department, headed by Armstrong and following a more [[analytic philosophy|traditional approach to philosophy]], and the General Philosophy Department, which follows the French [[continental philosophy|continental approach]].

Under the terms of the Higher Education (Amalgamation) Act 1989 (NSW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hea1989248/ |title=HIGHER EDUCATION (AMALGAMATION) ACT 1989 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following bodies were incorporated into the University in 1990:
* the Sydney Branch of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]]
* the [[Cumberland College of Health Sciences]]
* the [[Sydney College of the Arts]] of the Institute of the Arts
* the [[Sydney Institute of Education]] of the [[Sydney College of Advanced Education]]
* the Institute of Nursing Studies of the Sydney College of Advanced Education
* the Guild Centre of the Sydney College of Advanced Education.

Prior to 1981, the Sydney Institute of Education was the [[Sydney Teachers College]].

The [[Orange Agricultural College]] (OAC) was originally transferred to the [[University of New England, Australia|University of New England]] under the Act, but then transferred to the University of Sydney in 1994, as part of the reforms to the University of New England undertaken by the University of New England Act 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/uonea1993281/ |title=UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND ACT 1993 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Southern Cross University Act 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/scua1993354/ |title=SOUTHERN CROSS UNIVERSITY ACT 1993 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, the University of Sydney transferred the OAC to [[Charles Sturt University]].

===2000–present===

[[File:University of Sydney.svg|thumb|right|Arms used in the University of Sydney logo, pre-2010]]

In 2001, University of Sydney Chancellor [[Leonie Kramer|Dame Leonie Kramer]] was forced to resign by the University's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] – PM, [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s322262.htm Dame Leonie Kramer Resigns]''. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Nick Greiner]], a former [[premier of New South Wales]], resigned from his position as chair of the University's Graduate School of Management because of academic protests against his simultaneous chairmanship of [[British American Tobacco]] (Australia). Subsequently, his wife, [[Kathryn Greiner]], resigned in protest from the two positions she held at the University as chair of the Sydney Peace Foundation and a member of the executive council of the Research Institute for Asia and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sydney Morning Herald]], [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/11/1060588325238.html Kathryn Follows Nick Out of Door in Protest]'' Sydney Morning Herald, 8 November 2003. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Public Service Association of NSW and the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] were in dispute with the University over a proposal to privatise security at the main campus (and the Cumberland campus.)&lt;ref&gt;Public Service Association of NSW, [http://www.psa.labor.net.au/campaigns/1124934892_16999.html ''Sydney University Petition on Security Services'']. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the University agreed to acquire a portion of the land granted to [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]] to develop the Sydney Institute of Health and Medical Research.  As a Roman Catholic institution, in handing over the land St John's placed limitations on the type of medical research that could be conducted on the premises, seeking to preserve the essence of the College mission. This caused concern among some groups, who argued that it would interfere with scientific medical research. However, this was rejected by the University's administration because the building was not intended for this purpose and there were many other facilities in close proximity where such research could take place.

At the start of 2010, the University controversially adopted a new logo. It retains the same University Arms, however it takes on a more modern look. There have been stylistic changes, the main one being the Coat of Arm's [[mantling]], the shape of the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield), the removal of the motto scroll, and also others more subtle within the Arms itself such as the mane and fur of the lion, the number of lines in the open book, and the colouration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newscategoryid=9&amp;newsstoryid=4371 |title=News &amp;#124; The University of Sydney |publisher=sydney.edu.au |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Coat of Arms from 1857 continues to be used for ceremonial and other formal purposes, such as on testamurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/ab/about/2009/VC_Rpt_to_Senate_0609.pdf |title=Report of the Vice-Chancellor and Principal |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/alumni/sam/archive/SAM_March10.pdf |title=Sydney Alumni Magazine |publisher=sydney.edu.au |date=2010-03 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coat of Arms==
The Grant of Arms was made by the [[College of Arms]] in 1857. The grant reads:
:''Argent on a Cross Azure and open book proper, clasps Gold, between four Stars of eight points Or, on a chief Gules a Lion passant Guardant also Or, together with this motto &quot;Sidere mens eadem mutato&quot; to be borne and used forever herafter by the said University of Sydney on their Common Seal, Shields or otherwise according to the Law of Arms.''

The use of eight-pointed stars was unusual for arms at the time, although they had been used unofficially as emblems for [[New South Wales]] since the 1820s and on the arms of the Church of England Diocese of Australia in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/10_subnav_08_01_06.htm|title=The Badge of New South Wales as adopted in 1876|publisher=Heritage Council of New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the University, the Latin motto ''Sidere mens eadem mutato'' can be translated as &quot;Though the constellations change, the mind is universal&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;logo&quot;/&gt; therefore, conveying the aspiration that &quot;the traditions of the older universities of the Northern Hemisphere are continued here in the Southern.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydney.edu.au/heraldry/coat_of_arms/index.shtml The University of Sydney's coat of arms] at official website&lt;/ref&gt; Author and university alumnus [[Clive James]] quipped in his 1981 autobiography that the motto loosely translates as &quot;Sydney University is really Oxford or Cambridge laterally displaced approximately 12,000 miles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=James|first=Clive|title=Unreliable memoirs|year=1981|publisher=Pan Books|isbn=978-0-330-26463-1|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University rankings==
The [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] 2011–2012 placed the University of Sydney 58th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/top-200.html |title=THE World University Rankings 2010 |publisher=THE |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Sydney currently has financial endowments totalling $829&amp;nbsp;million. A drop due to recent downturn of the global economic situation. The University's turnover, in turn, was A$1.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2008.

Latest figures show that the University of Sydney has received the highest amount of research grants, which may demonstrate its research competitiveness and the size of its students and staff body. The University of Sydney also has the second largest (behind [[Monash University]]) body of students and researchers among Australian universities.

The University of Sydney secured more than $46&amp;nbsp;million in funding in the 2007 round of [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) Project Grant, Capacity Building and Fellowship awards, the largest allocation to any university in the state.
The James Jones foundation has announced the 2007 recipient of the bicentennial award in university research linked to applied agricultural economics. The award includes various grant and research opportunities that may be taken up by both staff members and senior students. Five of the University's affiliated medical research facilities secured $38&amp;nbsp;million in the Australian government's 2006 budget, part of $163&amp;nbsp;million made available for a variety of development and expansion projects.

==Campus==

===Main campus===

The main campus is spread across two inner-city suburbs of Sydney: Camperdown and Darlington.

Originally housed in what is now [[Sydney Grammar School]], in 1855, the government granted the University land in [[Grose Farm]], three kilometres from the city, which is now the main [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] campus. The architect [[Edmund Blacket]] designed the original [[Neogothic]] [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] Quadrangle and Great Tower buildings, which were completed in 1862. The rapid expansion of the University in the mid-20th century resulted in the acquisition of land in Darlington across [[City Road, Sydney|City Road]]. The Camperdown/Darlington campus houses the University's administrative headquarters, and the Faculties of Arts, Science, Education and Social Work, Pharmacy, Veterinary Science, Economics and Business, Architecture, and Engineering. It is also the home base of the large Faculty of Medicine, which has numerous affiliated teaching hospitals across the state.

The main campus is also the focus of the University's student life, with the student-run [[University of Sydney Union]] (known as 'the Union') in possession of three buildings – Wentworth, Manning and Holme Buildings. These buildings house a large proportion of the University's catering outlets, and provide space for recreational rooms, bars and function centres. One of the largest activities organised by the Union is the Orientation Week (or 'O-week'), centring on stalls set up by clubs and societies on the Front Lawns.

The University is currently undertaking a large capital works program with the aim of revitalising the campus and providing more office, teaching and student space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.usyd.edu.au/c2010/about/summary.shtml |title=Campus 2010 + Building for the Future |publisher=Facilities.usyd.edu.au |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program will see the amalgamation of the smaller science and technical libraries into a larger library, and the construction of a central administration and student services building along City Road. A new building for the School of Information Technologies opened in late 2006, and has been located on a site adjacent to the Seymour Centre. The busy Eastern Avenue thoroughfare has been transformed into a pedestrian plaza, and a new footbridge has been built over City Road. The new home for the Sydney Law School, located alongside Fisher Library on the site of the old [[Edgeworth David]] and Stephen Roberts buildings, has been completed.

From 2007, the University will also use space in the former [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]] railway yards, just to the south of [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]], for examination purposes.

The campus is well served by public transport, being a short walk from [[Redfern railway station]] and served by buses on the neighbouring [[Parramatta Road]] and [[City Road, Sydney|City Road]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Sydney, Faculty of Education &amp; Social Work, [http://www.edsw.usyd.edu.au/about/sydney/transport.shtml &quot;About Sydney&quot;].

==Facilities and services==

===University of Sydney Library===
[[File:Fisher Library, University of Sydney.JPG|thumb|Fisher Library, the main building of the [[University of Sydney Library]].]]
The [[University of Sydney Library]] consists of thirteen individual libraries located across the University's various campuses. According to the library's publications, it is the largest academic library in the [[southern hemisphere]];&lt;ref name='Discover newsletter'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/news/news050.pdf |title=A Library for the 21st century: new generations, new models |accessdate=29 February 2008 |last=Hanfling |first=Su |date=2005-10 |format=PDF |work=Discover Newsletter |publisher=University of Sydney Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; university statistics show that in 2007 the collection consisted of just under 5 million physical volumes and a further 300,000 [[e-book]]s, for a total of approximately 5.3&amp;nbsp;million items.&lt;ref name='Usyd Stats 2008'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.usyd.edu.au/statistics/pubs/Statistics2008.pdf |title=The University of Sydney Statistics 2008 |accessdate=14 January 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=University of Sydney }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rare Books Library possesses several extremely rare items, including one of the two extant copies of the ''[[Gospel of Barnabas]]'' and a first edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''.

===Museums and galleries===
* The '''[[Nicholson Museum]]''' of Antiquities contains the largest and most prestigious collection of antiquities in Australia. It is also the country's oldest university museum, and features ancient artefacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Greece, Rome, Cyprus and Mesopotamia, collected by the University over many years and added to by recent archaeological expeditions.

* The '''[[Macleay Museum]]''' is named after Alexander Macleay, whose collection of insects begun in the late eighteenth century was the basis upon which the museum was founded. It has developed into an extraordinary collection of natural history specimens, ethnographic artefacts, scientific instruments and historic photographs.

* The '''University Art Collection''' was founded in the 1860s and contains more than 2,500 pieces, constantly growing through donation, bequests, and acquisition. It is housed in several different places, including the [[Sir Hermann Black Gallery]] and the [[War Memorial Art Gallery]].

* The '''Rare Books Library''' is a part of the [[Fisher Library]] and holds 185,000 books and manuscripts which are rare, valuable or fragile, including eighty medieval manuscripts, works by Galileo, Halley and Copernicus and an extensive collection of [[Australiana]]. The copy of the [[Gospel of Barnabas]], and a first edition of [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] are held here. Regular exhibitions of rare books are held in the exhibition room.

===Residential colleges===

[[File:St Johns College U Sydney from Parramatta Road.jpg|right|thumb|St John's College]]
[[File:Sancta Quad 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Quadrangle of Sancta Sophia College]]

The University has a number of residential college and halls of residence, based on the college system of [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] universities, each with its own distinctive style and facilities. All offer tutorial support and a wide range of social and sporting activities in a supportive communal environment. Five colleges are affiliated with religious denominations and while this gives each of these colleges a special character, students of any denomination or religion are eligible for admission. Unlike some residential colleges in British or American universities, the colleges are not affiliated with any specific discipline of study. &quot;Intercol&quot; refers to the six colleges which exist on campus. They are modelled on the British system of colleges and competition for entry is high each year. The Colleges compete in the Rawson Cup (sport for men) the Rosebowl cup (sport for women) and the Palladian Cup (drama, debating and music for both men and women).

The University also has three other residential systems, which are different to the colleges, and are not part of the intercol system. For a variety of reasons, the intercol network has chosen{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} to have no affiliation with these &quot;houses&quot;.

There is also a university-affiliated [[housing cooperative]], [[Stucco Co-operative|Stucco]].

===Student organisations===&lt;!-- NOTABLE student organisations ONLY --&gt;

[[File:Usydoweek.jpg|thumb|Orientation Week at University Place.]]

* '''Student Representatives''': Politically and academically, undergraduate students are represented by the [[University of Sydney Students' Representative Council|Students Representative Council (SRC)]] and postgraduate students by the [[Sydney University Postgraduate Representative Association]] (SUPRA).

* '''[[University of Sydney Union]]''': The University of Sydney Union (USU) is the oldest and largest university union in Australia. USU provides a range of activities, programs, services and facilities geared at giving students the university experience. This involves delivering a huge Clubs and Societies program, a varied entertainment program, student opportunities, a range of catering and retail services plus buildings and recreational spaces for students, staff and visitors.

* '''[[Sydney Uni Sport and Fitness]]''': Formerly known as the Sydney University Sports Union and Sydney University Women's Sports Association, Sydney University Sport is one of Australia's largest tertiary sporting bodies. It currently manages and administers 42 sport and recreation clubs, organises sporting and recreation events, and offers student and non-student members a comprehensive range of sporting facilities.

The SRC and Union are both governed by student representatives, who are elected by students each year. Elections for the USU Board of Directors occur in first semester; elections for the SRC President, and for members of the Students' Representative Council itself, occur in second semester, along with a separate election for the editorial board of the student newspaper ''[[Honi Soit]]'', which is published by the SRC. The elections are usually closely contested, and result in much of the main campus being covered with chalk messages from the various candidates. However, some complaints have been made in the pages of ''Honi Soit'' and other publications about the organisations' claims to represent the student body, citing perennially low voter turnouts and the general apathy of much of the university population to student politics.

The future of these organisations was believed to be under a shadow with the passage of legislation implementing [[voluntary student unionism]] in late 2005. The legislation prohibited the compulsory collection of fees from students, which had been the customary means of funding student organisations, after the beginning of Semester 2 of 2006. Although the organisations continue to be concerned about their long-term financial viability, they have secured significant funding from the University to partially make up for lost revenue.
