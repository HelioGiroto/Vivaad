The '''Great American Boycott''' ({{lang-es|'''El Gran Paro Estadounidense'''}}, lit. &quot;the Great American Strike&quot;) was a one-day [[boycott]] of [[United States]] schools and businesses by immigrants in the United States illegally, of mostly [[Latin America]]n origin that took place on May 1, 2006.

The date was chosen by boycott organizers to coincide with [[May Day]], the [[International Workers Day]] observed as a national holiday in Asia, most of Europe, and Mexico, but not officially recognized in the United States due to its Communist associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workers.org/2007/us/may-day-0215/ Coalition plans May Day actions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/487608/may_day_the_fight_behind_the_protest/ May Day: The Fight Behind the Protest - Business - redOrbit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maydaymovement.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.maydaymovement.blogspot.com/ National May 1st Movement for Worker and Immigrant Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a continuation of the [[2006_United_States_immigration_reform_protests|2006 U.S. immigration reform protests]], the organizers called for supporters to abstain from buying, selling, working, and attending school, in order to attempt to demonstrate through the extent to which the labor obtained of illegal immigrants is needed. Supporters of the boycott rallied in major cities across the U.S. to demand general [[amnesty]] and legalization programs for illegal aliens. For this reason, the day is referred to as ''A Day Without an Immigrant'' in reference to the [[2004 in film|2004]] [[political satire]] [[film]] ''[[A Day Without a Mexican]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Most who participated in the marches waved flags of Mexico and other Central and South American countries, while others waved flags bearing the likeness of slain [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[revolution]]ary leader [[Che Guevara]], and/or the [[red flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

While the economic effects of the boycott are unknown, most initial reports indicated that the boycott failed to halt &quot;business as usual&quot;.

In a show of solidarity, internationally, [[Trade union|labor unions]] and other groups engaged in a one-day boycott of U.S. products called the &quot;'''Nothing [[Gringo]] Boycott'''&quot;, particularly in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]n countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Origin==
[[Image:SF Protest.jpg|thumb|300px|Protesters waving various flags in San Francisco]]

The boycott was announced on April 10, 2006 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] by the [[March 25 Coalition]] of Catholic groups, illegal immigration advocacy organizations, and labor unions. Hermandad Mexicana, an affiliate of the [[Mexican American Political Association]], the [[Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles]] (CHIRLA), Amigos de Orange, and local [[MEChA]] chapters all promptly joined.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific News'' [http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5640841981493b34b3d0933ac577adf5 &quot;Groups Call for ‘A Day Without an Immigrant’&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was coordinated nationally by the May Day Movement for Worker &amp; Immigrants Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;maydaymovement.blogspot.com&quot;/&gt;

The coalition arose out of [[2006 U.S. immigration reform protests|protests]] against [[H.R. 4437]], a legislative proposal that was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] on December 16, 2005 by a vote of 239 to 182, only to die in the [[United States Senate]] by not being brought to the floor before the 109th Congress ended. This bill would have made residing in the U.S. illegally a [[felony]] and imposed stiffer penalties on those who knowingly employ and harbour noncitizens illegally. It also called for the construction of new border security fences along portions of the 2,000-mile [[United States–Mexico border]]. The coalition takes its name from the date of the first mass protest against the bill, a day which saw upwards of 500,000 demonstrators on the streets of Los Angeles, as well as hundreds of thousands in other major U.S. cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The March 25, 2006 protests were noted for their peaceful nature, despite the controversy surrounding the immigration issue.&lt;ref&gt;''[[LA Times]]''[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-immig26mar26,0,7628611.story?coll=la-home-headlines &quot;500,000 Pack Streets to Protest Immigration Bills&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'',
:&quot;The boycott grew from an idea hatched by a small band of [[Grassroots democracy|grass-roots]] advocates in Los Angeles, inspired by the [[Delano grape strike|farmworker movement]] of the 1960s led by [[Cesar Chavez]] and [[Bert Corona]]. Through the Internet and mass media catering to immigrants, they developed and tapped a network of union organizers, immigrant rights groups and others to spread the word and plan events tied to the boycott, timed to coincide with International Workers' Day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/us/02immig.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ei=5094&amp;en=e9b7414ed9b65b5f&amp;hp&amp;ex=1146542400&amp;partner=homepage &quot;Immigrants Take to U.S. Streets in Show of Strength&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial response==
The boycott and strike provoked controversy as soon as they were proposed. National organizations and prominent figures split over whether to support the boycott, with many moderates endorsing demonstrations but withholding support for the boycott. Many of the &quot;moderate&quot; demonstrations were scheduled for three o'clock in the afternoon, after working-hours for the many unskilled professions where illegal immigrant labor tends to be concentrated.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] urged immigrants not to boycott, and instead to protest after work and on the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' [http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-immig29apr29,1,6051484.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true &quot;Bush Asks Immigrants to Reject Work Boycotts&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}

[[California]] [[List of Governors of California|governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] said that a boycott would &quot;hurt everyone&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theworldlink.com&quot;&gt;''Coos Bay Sun'' [http://www.theworldlink.com/articles/2006/05/01/news/news10050106.txt &quot;Immigrants flex economic muscle with boycott&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:May1 Mex Flag.jpg|thumb|300px|Marchers in Los Angeles carrying a Mexican and American flag.]]

California's top education official opposed the boycott and called for students to stay in school on Monday.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} 

Los Angeles [[Mayor of Los Angeles, California|Mayor]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], the city's first Mexican-American mayor since the 19th century, called for children to attend school and for a late afternoon rally.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' [http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_3774092 &quot;City's students absent in droves&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2009}} He also urged protesters to carry American flags, and not the flags of their home countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;theworldlink.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] offered [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] as an alternative to boycotting, and suggested that churches toll their bells in memory of immigrants  who died trying to come to the U.S. The [[bishop]]s, too, urged students to stay in school.&lt;ref&gt;Fox News'' [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,193761,00.html &quot;'A Day Without Immigrants'&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

National Hispanic and immigration-advocacy groups were also split, with some fearing that the actions would provoke a backlash. The [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], normally a moderate organization, was one of the few to fully support both the boycott and the strike.

The [[Washington, D.C.]]-based National Capital Immigration Coalition denounced the Boycott, while the [[National Council of La Raza]] took no position whatsoever.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Numerous [[anti-war]], [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], [[socialist]] and [[communist]] groups also endorsed the Boycott. The [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism]] coalition, in particular, provided signs and mobilized supporters to attend demonstrations, and while the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] took no official stance, it offered advice and information for protesters on its website.&lt;ref&gt;American Civil Liberties Union [http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/25251res20060421.html &quot;Immigrant Marches / Marchas de los Inmigrantes&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} The [[AFL-CIO]] also endorsed the protests, saying that the H.R. 4437 &quot;isn't the answer&quot; to immigration issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFL-CIO&quot;&gt;[http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/thisistheaflcio/outfront/immigrant_rights.cfm Why We Fight for Immigrant Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} The AFL-CIO's executive vice president, [[Linda Chavez-Thompson]], stated: &quot;We believe that there is absolutely no good reason why any immigrant who comes to this country prepared to work, to pay taxes, and to abide by our laws and rules should be relegated to this repressive, second-class guest worker status.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFL CIO&quot;&gt;[http://www.aflcio.org/mediacenter/prsptm/sp02282006.cfm Remarks by AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson at Immigration Press Briefing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional demonstrations==
Organization of events fell to local groups. In some cases, the split that occurred on the national level was evident on the local level as well in that separate events were planned by the various organizers. Major events were held in:

*'''[[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]''' - An estimated 2,500 protesters turned out for the event, although Atlanta police had been prepared for as many as 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;''WSB Radio'' [http://wsbradio.com/news/050106rally.html &quot;Pro-Illegal Immigration Rally at Capitol&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:May 1 2006 Rally in Chicago.jpg|thumb|300px|A rally in Chicago]]

*'''[[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]]''' Riverside police estimated that approximately 3000 people marched from [[UC Riverside]] to the steps of the county administrative building in downtown Riverside. 1500 people congregated outside San Bernardino City Hall and later marched throughout the city. Many area businesses closed for the day, schools across Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties saw extra absences and UC Riverside's cafeteria traffic dipped 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ieprotest2may02,1,6182396.story &quot;Marchers Crowd Inland Streets&quot;] Los Angeles Times; May 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}

*'''[[Los Angeles]]''' - Between 1 and 2 million ([[Univision]] estimate) protesters marched in two separate marches,&lt;ref&gt;CNN [http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/01/immigrant.day/index.html &quot;Thousands march for immigrant rights&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; one beginning at 10:00 a.m. in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and primarily organized by the Mexican American Political Association, and the second beginning at 3:00 p.m. from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] down [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and organized by the &quot;We Are America&quot; coalition of religious groups including the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles]], ethnic interest groups, and labor organizations such as the [[Los Angeles County]] [[American Federation of Labor|Federation of Labor]], AFL-CIO. The impact of the boycott was felt throughout the Latino community, and Southern California generally. Businesses were closed, traffic piled up for miles around the march route, and over 90% of the daily traffic out of the [[Port of Los Angeles]] was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.indymedia.org/news/2006/05/155894.php &quot;FROM E.LA TO OLVERA STREET NO BUSINESS AS USUAL&quot;] Los Angeles IndyMedia; May 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.indymedia.org/news/2006/05/156164.php &quot;Report back: Troqueros May Day strike shuts down port&quot;] Los Angeles IndyMedia; May 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2010}}

*'''[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]''' - Nearly 70,000 people participated in a march through downtown Milwaukee, according to an organizer estimate.  That number is more than double the estimated 30,000 who attended a similar event about five weeks before, on March 23.  Though Police has estimated attendance there at 10,000-15,000  Participants marched along Wisconsin Ave. until reaching Veteran's Park, the site of a rally at noon on the lakefront.  Mayor [[Tom Barrett (politician)|Tom Barrett]] addressed the ralliers, saying &quot;Thank all of you for the fight you're fighting for peace and dignity.  You're showing Milwaukee and Wisconsin and the U.S. that the fight for justice can be done peacefully.&quot;  Wisconsin Restaurant Association president Ed Lump also spoke, emphasizing the importance of immigrants to the restaurant industry as workers, customers, managers, and entrepreneurs.  The crowd was littered with American flags and red, white, &amp; blue signs—people who brought Mexican flags or those of other nations were urged to put them away during the march.  According to Christine Neumann-Ortiz, director of the event's main coordinator Voces de la Frontera, roughly 200 Milwaukee businesses remained closed for all or part of the day.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee&gt;''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' [http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=420038 &quot;A mass appeal for immigration reform&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}

Republican congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] stated that &quot;The iron triangle of illegal employers, foreign governments and (interest) groups ... puts tremendous pressure on our elected officials to violate the desires of law-abiding Americans. As nearly every recent poll shows, Americans want secure borders -- not amnesty -- and sooner or later they'll elect representatives who will listen to their constituents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=118567 Newly empowered, undocumented immigrants plan more US protests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter-demonstrations took place in various cities to coincide with the day's events, although they were mostly small in size.&lt;ref name=Milwaukee/&gt; Some encouraged their members to buy from American businesses to offset the economic impact of the boycott. Among them are the Southern California [[talk radio]] hosts [[John and Ken]], who called for &quot;The Great American Spend-a-Lot&quot;, a contest with prizes for listeners who spent the most money.&lt;ref&gt;John and Ken Show [http://www.johnandkenshow.com/archives/2006/04/28/the-great-american-spend-a-lot/ &quot;The Great American Spend-a-lot&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}

The volunteer border security [[Minuteman Project]], which has organized citizens' patrols along the US-Mexican border to monitor and deter illegal immigration, hosted rallies across the country, starting on Wednesday, May 3 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;''Grand Forks Herald'' [http://www.grandforks.com/mld/grandforks/news/14461718.htm &quot;Groups rally in Minneapolis for tighter immigration controls&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} They also began constructing a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} barbed wire fence along the border in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Missourian'' [http://columbiamissourian.com/news/story.php?ID=19686 &quot;Walkout by Latino immigrants set for today&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} According to Minuteman Project founder [[Jim Gilchrist]], &quot;It's intimidation when a million people march down main streets in our major cities under the Mexican flag. This will backfire.&quot;

A new group, the '[[You Don't Speak For Me]]' coalition, was formed in response to the boycott to challenge the notion that May 1 protesters speak on behalf of all [[Hispanic]]s. According to former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Assistant Secretary of the Treasury]] Pete Nunez, who is the group's spokesperson, &quot;Millions of Hispanic-Americans -- including many who have gone through the immigration process the right way -- are offended by the demands being made by people who have broken our nation's laws.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo Business News [http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060426/dcw049.html?.v=49 &quot;Illegal Aliens on the Streets 'Don't Speak for Us,' Says New Hispanic-American Coalition&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}

CNN's [[Lou Dobbs]], criticized the boycott for its promotion by groups such as the radical protest organization [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism|ANSWER]], (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism). Dobbs also stated that &quot;It is no accident that they chose [[International Workers' Day|May 1]] as their day of demonstration and boycott. It is the worldwide day of commemorative demonstrations by various [[socialist]], [[communist]], and even [[anarchic]] organizations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''CNN'' [http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/01/dobbs.immigrantprotests/index.html &quot;Radical groups taking control of immigrant movement&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' suggested that the May 2 ouster of the mayor and two council members in the town of [[Herndon, Virginia]] who had suffered criticism for their support of a day-labor center was a negative reaction to the Boycott.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'' [http://www.washingtonpost.com./wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201805.html &quot;Labor Site Backlash Felt at Polls In Herndon&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Southern and Western states drew up new tougher anti-illegal immigration laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'' [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201789.html &quot;After Protests, Backlash Grows&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Post'' also credited backlash from the Boycott support in the [[Arizona legislature]] for the passage of laws penalizing businesses who hire illegal immigrants and on other crimes associated with illegal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'' [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201728.html &quot;Hill Impasse Spurs States to Tackle Illegal Immigration&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia has also since passed a law, which took effect in 2007, that prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving many social services and requires police and employers to report illegal workers to the Immigration Service.&lt;ref&gt;''BBC News'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4921000.stm &quot;Mexico slams Georgia migrant law &quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fox News|Fox News's]] [[Sean Hannity]] asked &quot;Why is it that so many people who didn't respect our laws and our sovereignty are demanding for the right to stay here, demanding for the right to jump in front of other people who are going through the process properly, and those that disagree are being called racist and bigoted?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15086136_ITM | title=The Great American Boycott. | The America's Intelligence Wire (May, 2006)}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}

According to an editorial by conservative commentator, [[Cinnamon Stillwell]] of the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], &quot;The one thing the boycott did achieve was to expose the lie that the country cannot function without the labor of illegal immigrants. While some may have been inconvenienced by the experience, the economy hardly came to a grinding halt. It seems there are still some jobs Americans are willing to do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;SFGate.com [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2006/05/10/cstillwell.DTL &quot;The Day Without Immigrants Backfires&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The boycott highlighted the concerns of millions living in the United States legally and illegally and the highly emotional issue of illegal aliens in the US, provoking intense debate on all sides of the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/may2006/immi-m02.shtml US: Millions of immigrant workers join May 1st &quot;boycott&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2006, President Bush announced plans for [[the Pentagon]] to deploy up to 6,000 [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] troops to help secure the Southern U.S. border.&lt;ref&gt;[CNN http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/15/sr.mon/index.html &quot;The Situation: Monday, May 15&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.R. 4437]] was passed by the House of Representatives on December 16, 2005 by a vote of 239 to 182.

On May 25, 2006, The U.S. Senate approved by a vote of 62-36, its own White House-backed immigration reform bill that would grant some illegal aliens a chance at citizenship and strengthen border security. Negotiations were held with the aim of meshing the Senate's immigration bill with H.R.4437, no agreement was reached before the election in November.&lt;ref&gt;[CNN http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/25/immigration/index.html &quot;Senate passes immigration bill&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
