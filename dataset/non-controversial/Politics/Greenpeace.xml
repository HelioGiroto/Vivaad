Greenpeace evolved from the peace movement and anti-nuclear protests in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], in the early 1970s. On September 15, 1971, the newly founded [[Don't Make a Wave Committee]] sent a chartered ship, ''Phyllis Cormack'', renamed ''Greenpeace'' for the protest, from Vancouver to oppose [[United States]] testing of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear devices]] in [[Amchitka]], [[Alaska]]. The Don't Make a Wave Committee subsequently adopted the name Greenpeace.&lt;ref name=&quot;odysseu&quot;&gt;Robert Hunter: Greenpeace to Amchitka, An Environmental Odyssey&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few years, Greenpeace spread to several countries and started to campaign on other environmental issues such as [[commercial whaling]] and [[toxic waste]]. In the late 1970s, the different regional Greenpeace groups formed Greenpeace International to oversee the goals and operations of the regional organizations globally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waves of Compassion. The founding of Greenpeace.&quot;/&gt; Greenpeace received international attention during the 1980s when the [[DGSE|French intelligence agency]] [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombed]] the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' in [[Auckland]]'s [[Waitemata Harbour]], one of the most well-known vessels operated by Greenpeace, killing one individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Rainbow Warrior ringleader heads firm selling arms to US government | date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | publisher=The Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/may/25/usnews.france | location=London | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Greenpeace evolved into one of the largest environmental organizations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Cole &amp; Sheila Foster: From the ground up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=| last=| title=And the biggest NGO in Bali? | date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2007-12-10| publisher=New Statesman | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/global-issues/2007/12/bali-climate-change-emissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground [[nuclear weapon test]] in the tectonically unstable island of [[Amchitka]] in [[Alaska]]. Because of the [[1964 Alaska earthquake]], the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a [[tsunami]]. Anti-nuclear activists protested against the test on the border of the U.S. and Canada with signs reading &quot;Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes&quot;. The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;&gt;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story, ISBN 0-86318-691-2&lt;/ref&gt;

While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opposers were [[Jim Bohlen]], a veteran who had served the U.S. Navy, [[Irving Stowe]] and [[Dorothy Stowe]], who had recently become [[Quaker]]s. As members of the [[Sierra Club Canada]], they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]], &quot;bearing witness&quot;, where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of [[Albert Bigelow]] in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Robert Hunter]] and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay St. became the HQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawthorn |first=Tom |url=http://tomhawthorn.blogspot.com/2011/03/for-sale-house-where-greenpeace-was.html |title=Tom Hawthorn's blog: For sale: The house where Greenpeace was born |publisher=Tomhawthorn.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and Bwy SE corner in Kitsilano, (Vancouver) before moving to West 4th at Maple (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace to Amchitka, An Environmental Odyssey by Robert Hunter.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate as to who are the actual founders of The Don't Make a Wave Committee. Researcher Vanessa Timmer has referred the early members as &quot;an unlikely group of loosely organized protestors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timmer&quot;/&gt; According to the current Greenpeace web page, the founders were Dorothy and Irving Stowe, Marie and Jim Bohlen, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, and Robert Hunter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenpeace: founders&quot;/&gt; The book ''The Greenpeace Story'' states that the founders were Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen and Paul Cote, a law student and peace activist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; An interview with Dorothy Stowe, Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim Bohlen and Robert Hunter identifies the founders as Paul Cote, Irving and Dorothy Stowe and Jim and Marie Bohlen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archive.greenpeace.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/vrml/rw/text/def/founders.html |title=Interview by Michael Friedrich: Greenpeace Founders |publisher=Archive.greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Watson]], who also participated in the anti-nuclear protests, maintains that he also was one of the founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/paul-watson-and-greenpeace.html |title=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society: Greenpeace Attempts to Make Captain Paul Watson &quot;Disappear&quot; |publisher=Seashepherd.org |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early member, [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]] also has stated that he was one of the founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenspirit.com/about.cfm?a=3 |title=Greenpsirit: Who is Patrick Moore? |publisher=Greenspirit.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace used to list Moore among &quot;founders and first members&quot; of The Don't Make a Wave Committee but has later stated that while Moore was a significant early member, he was not a founder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archive.greenpeace.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greenpeaceMoore&quot;&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/history/Patrick-Moore-background-information/ Patrick Moore background information]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Moore's own letter he applied to the already existing organization in March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/binaries/2008/12/patrick-moore-s-application-le.pdf Patrick Moore's application letter and Greenpeace's reply (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irving Stowe]] arranged a [[benefit concert]] (supported by [[Joan Baez]]) that took place on October 16, 1970 at the [[Pacific Coliseum]] in Vancouver. The concert created the financial basis for the first Greenpeace campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/11/22/a-long-lost-1970-benefit-concert-featuring-joni-mitchell-and-james-taylor-surfaces/ Lost 1970 Amchitka Concert Featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor Surfaces] ''The Wall Street Journal'', November 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amchitka (album)|Amchitka, the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace]] has been published by Greenpeace in November 2009 on CD and is also available as mp3 download via the Amchitka concert website. Using the money raised with the concert, the Don't Make a Wave Committee chartered a ship, the ''Phyllis Cormack'' owned and sailed by John Cormack. The ship was renamed ''Greenpeace'' for the protest after a term coined by activist Bill Darnell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt;

In the fall of 1971 the ship sailed towards Amchitka and faced the U.S. Coast Guard ship [[USCGC Confidence (WMEC-619)|''Confidence'']]&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; which forced the activists to turn back. Because of this and the increasingly bad weather the crew decided to return to Canada only to find out that the news about their journey and reported support from the crew of the ''Confidence'' had generated sympathy for their protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; After this Greenpeace tried to navigate to the test site with other vessels, until the U.S. detonated the bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; The nuclear test was criticized and the U.S. decided not to continue with their test plans at Amchitka.

In 1972, The Don't Make a Wave committee changed their official name to ''Greenpeace Foundation''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt; While the organization was founded under a different name in 1970 and was officially named Greenpeace in 1972, the organization itself dates its birth to the first protest of 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;The History of Greenpeace&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Background – September 14, 2009 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history |title=Greenpeace International: The History of Greenpeace |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace also states that &quot;there was no single founder, and the name, idea, spirit, tactics, and internationalism of the organization all can be said to have separate lineages&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenpeace: founders&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Background – October 29, 2008 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/founders |title=Greenpeace Official page: The Founders |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Rex Weyler]] put it in his chronology, ''Greenpeace'', in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's &quot;quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance&quot;.  Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there, and it served as the first office of the Greenpeace Foundation.

After the office in the Stowe home, (and after the first concert fund-raiser) Greenpeace functions moved to other private homes and held public meetings weekly on Wednesday nights at the Kitsilano Neighborhood House before settling, in the fall of 1974, in a small office shared with the SPEC environmental group, at 2007 W. 4th Avenue, at Maple Street, across from the Bimini neighbourhood pub. The address of this office has since been changed to 2009 W. 4th Avenue. The building still exists, and the office is up the stair at the “2009” door.

===First campaigns after Amchitka===
After the nuclear tests at Amchitka were over, Greenpeace moved its focus to the French atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing]] at the [[Moruroa|Moruroa Atoll]] in [[French Polynesia]]. The young organization needed help for their protests and were contacted by [[David McTaggart]], a former businessman living in New Zealand. In 1972 the yacht ''Vega'', a {{convert|12.5|m|ft|adj=on}} ketch owned by [[David McTaggart]], was renamed ''Greenpeace III'' and sailed in an anti-nuclear protest into the exclusion zone at Moruroa to attempt to disrupt French nuclear testing. This voyage was sponsored and organized by the New Zealand branch of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].&lt;ref&gt;Making Waves the Greenpeace New Zealand Story by Michael Szabo ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; The French Navy tried to stop the protest in several ways, including assaulting David McTaggart. McTaggart was supposedly beaten to the point that he lost sight in one of his eyes. Luckily, one of McTaggart's crew members photographed the incident and went public. After the assault was publicized, France announced it would stop the atmospheric nuclear tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt;

In the mid-1970s some Greenpeace members started an independent campaign, Project Ahab, against commercial [[whaling]], since Irving Stowe was against Greenpeace focusing on other issues than nuclear weapons. After Irving Stowe died in 1975, Phyllis Cormack left from Vancouver to face Soviet whalers on the coast of California. Greenpeace activists disrupted the whaling by going between the harpoons and the whales, and the footage of the protests spread across the world. Later in the 1970s the organization widened its focus to include [[toxic waste]] and commercial [[seal hunting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Brown &amp; John May: The Greenpeace Story&quot;/&gt;

===Organizational development===
[[File:Greenpeace ship &quot;Esperanza&quot; off Gravesend.jpg|thumb|[[MV Esperanza]], a former fire-fighter owned by the [[Russian Navy]], was relaunched by Greenpeace in 2002]]
Greenpeace evolved from a group of Canadian protesters into a less conservative group of environmentalists who were more reflective of the [[counterculture]] and [[hippie]] youth movements of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rexweyler.com/greenpeace/ |title=Greenpeace |publisher=Rex Weyler |date=1954-03-01 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social and cultural background from which Greenpeace emerged heralded a period of de-conditioning away from old world antecedents and sought to develop new codes of social, environmental and political behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;odysseu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2005/2005-05-02-05.asp]| Greenpeace founder Bob Hunter&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Frank Zelko has commented that &quot;unlike [[Friends of the Earth]], for example, which sprung fully formed from the forehead of [[David Brower]], Greenpeace developed in a more evolutionary manner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waves of Compassion.

In the mid-1970s independent groups using the name Greenpeace started springing up world wide. By 1977 there were 15 to 20 Greenpeace groups around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waves of Compassion.

Retrieved on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the Canadian Greenpeace office was heavily in debt. Disputes between offices over fund-raising and organizational direction split the global movement as the North American offices were reluctant to be under the authority of the Vancouver office and its president [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waves of Compassion.

Retrieved on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and energy===
[[File:&quot;Stop Global Warming&quot;, Greenpeace.jpg|thumb|An inflatable snow man conveying &quot;Stop Global Warming!&quot; at the [[G8]] (2007)]]
Greenpeace was one of the first parties to formulate a [[sustainable development]] scenario for climate change mitigation, which it did in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch3-ens3-1-2.html |title=IPCC, Climate Change 2007: Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change |publisher=Ipcc.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologists Marc Mormont and Christine Dasnoy, Greenpeace played a significant role in raising public awareness of global warming in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Mormont &amp; Christine Dasnoy; Source strategies and the mediatization of climate change. Media, Culture &amp; Society, Vol. 17, No. 1, 49–64 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has also focused on [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s, because of both their global warming potential and their effect on the ozone layer. Greenpeace was one of the leading participants advocating early phase-out of ozone depleting substances in the [[Montreal Protocol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UNEP: Our Planet: Celebrating 20 Years of Montreal Protocol&quot;/&gt; In the early 1990s, Greenpeace developed a CFC-free refrigerator technology, &quot;Greenfreeze&quot; for mass production together with the refrigerator industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNEP: Our Planet: Celebrating 20 Years of Montreal Protocol&quot;/&gt; United Nations Environment Programme awarded Greenpeace for &quot;outstanding contributions to the protection of the Earth's ozone layer&quot; in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Events/4C1_PublicInfo_Awards97.shtml |title=UNEP: The 1997 Ozone Awards |publisher=Ozone.unep.org |date=1997-09-16 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 one third of the world's total production of refrigerators were based on Greenfreeze technology, with over 200 million units in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNEP: Our Planet: Celebrating 20 Years of Montreal Protocol&quot;/&gt;

For this Greenpeace calls for the industrialized countries to cut their emissions at least 40% by 2020 (from 1990 levels) and to give substantial funding for developing countries to build a sustainable energy capacity, to adapt to the inevitable consequences of global warming, and to stop [[deforestation]] by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/greenpeace-climate-vision.pdf Greenpeace Climate Vision], May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[EREC]], Greenpeace has formulated a global energy scenario, &quot;Energy [R]evolution&quot;, where 80% of the world's total energy is produced with renewables, and the emissions of the energy sector are decreased by over 80% of the 1990 levels by 2050.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenpeace1&quot;&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2010/fullreport.pdf Energy (R)evolution, A Sustainable Global Energy Outlook, 2010, 3rd edition], Greenpeace &amp; EREC:&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kingsnorth court case====
In October 2007, six Greenpeace protesters were arrested for breaking in to the [[Kingsnorth power station]], climbing the 200 metre smokestack, painting the name [[Gordon Brown|Gordon]] on the chimney, and causing an estimated £30,000 damage. At their subsequent trial they admitted trying to shut the station down, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change from causing greater damage to property elsewhere around the world. Evidence was heard from [[David Cameron]]'s environment adviser [[Zac Goldsmith]], climate scientist [[James E. Hansen]] and an [[Inuit]] leader from Greenland, all saying that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. The six activists were acquitted. It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a &quot;lawful excuse&quot; defense in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/sep/10/activists.carbonemissions|title=Kingsnorth trial: Coal protesters cleared of criminal damage to chimney|date=2008-10-06|accessdate=2010-01-04|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Vidal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[The Daily Telegraph]] and [[The Guardian]] described the acquittal as embarrassment to the [[Brown Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Greenpeace Kingsnorth trial collapse is embarrassing for Gordon Brown

====&quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot;====

As part of their stance on the subject of renewable energy, Greenpeace have launched the &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign.&lt;ref name = &quot;GoBeyondOil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oil |title=Go beyond oil &amp;#124; Greenpeace UK |publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is focused on slowing, and eventually ending, the world's consumption of oil; with activist activities taking place against companies that pursue oil drilling as a venture. Much of the activities of the &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign have been focused on drilling for oil in the Arctic and areas affected by the [[Deepwater Horizon]] disaster. The activities of Greenpeace in the arctic have mainly involved the Edinburgh-based oil and gas exploration company, Cairn Energy; and range from protests at the Cairn Energy's headquarters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/paula-bear-wheres-your-spill-response-plan-cairn-20110526 |title=Paula Bear: Where's your spill response plan, Cairn? &amp;#124; Greenpeace UK |publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk |date=2011-05-29 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to scalling their oil rigs in an attempt to halt the drilling process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/update-arctic-pod-48-hours-and-going-strong-20110531 |title=Update from the Arctic pod: 48 hours and going strong! &amp;#124; Greenpeace UK |publisher=Greenpeace.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign also involves applying political pressure on the governments who allow oil exploration in their territories; with the group stating that one of the key aims of the &quot;Go Beyond Oil&quot; campaign is to &quot;work to expose the lengths the oil industry is willing to go to squeeze the last barrels out of the ground and put pressure on industry and governments to move beyond oil.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;GoBeyondOil&quot; /&gt;

====Nuclear power====
Greenpeace views [[nuclear power]] as a relatively minor industry with major problems, such as environmental damage and risks from uranium mining, nuclear weapons proliferation, and unresolved questions concerning nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/nuclear/problems Nuclear Problems Greenpeace.org.uk. Retrieved 27 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization argues that the potential of nuclear power to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate global warming]] is marginal, referring to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] energy scenario where an increase in world's nuclear capacity from 2608 TWh in 2007 to 9857 TWh by 2050 would cut global greenhouse gas emissions less than 5% and require 32 nuclear reactor units of 1000MW capacity built per year until 2050. According to Greenpeace the slow construction times, construction delays, and hidden costs, all limit the mitigation potential of nuclear power. This makes the IEA scenario technically and financially unrealistic. They also argue that binding massive amounts of investments on nuclear energy would take funding away from more effective solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenpeace1&quot;/&gt; Greenpeace views the construction of [[European Pressurized Reactor#Olkiluoto 3 pilot power plant|Olkiluoto 3]] nuclear power plant in [[Finland]] as an example of the problems on building new nuclear power.&lt;ref name=&quot;waste of time&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/nuclear-power-a-dangerous-was.pdf |title=Greenpeace International: 'Nuclear Power: a dangerous waste of time' |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Anti-nuclear advertisement=====
In 1994, Greenpeace published an anti-nuclear newspaper advert which included a claim that nuclear facilities [[Sellafield]] would kill 2,000 people in the next 10 years, and an image of a [[hydrocephalus]]-affected child said to be a victim of [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan]]. [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] viewed the claim concerning Sellafield unsubstantiated, and ASA did not accept that the child's condition was caused by radiation. This resulted in banning of the advert. Greenpeace did not admit fault, stating that a Kazakhstan doctor had said that the child's condition was due to nuclear testing. Adam Woolf from Greenpeace also stated that, &quot;fifty years ago there were many experts who would be lined up and swear there was no link between smoking and bad health.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/greenpeace-accused-of-telling-lies-in-advert-watchdog-bans-antinuclear-image-1447196.html|title=Greenpeace accused of telling lies in advert|publisher=The Independent|date=1994-09-07|accessdate=2009-12-13 | location=London | first=Rhys | last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN has estimated that the nuclear weapon tests in Kazakhstan caused about 100,000 people to suffer over three generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1516889.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kazakhstan highlights nuclear test aftermath | date=2001-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Press release blunder=====
In Philadelphia, in 2006, Greenpeace issued a press release that said &quot;In the twenty years since the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] tragedy, the world's worst nuclear accident, there have been nearly [FILL IN ALARMIST AND ARMAGEDDONIST FACTOID HERE],&quot;  The final report warned of plane crashes and reactor meltdowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpkidding&quot;&gt;Washington Post.

=====EDF spying conviction=====
In 2011, a French court fined [[Électricité de France]] (EDF) €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace's computer systems. Greenpeace was awarded €500,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15683090 |title=EDF fined for spying on Greenpeace nuclear campaign |author=Richard Black |publisher=BBC |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although EDF claimed that a security firm had only been employed to monitor Greenpeace, the court disagreed, jailing the head and deputy head of EDF's nuclear security operation for three years each. Two employees of the security firm, Kargus, run by a former member of France's secret services, received sentences of three and two years respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/10/edf-spying-greenpeace |title=EDF fined €1.5m for spying on Greenpeace |author=Hanna Gersmann |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging that mass production of palm oil may be disastrous on biodiversity of forests, Greenpeace is actively campaigning against the production, urging the industries and the government to turn to other forms of energy resources. One of the positive results of the campaign was GAR(Golden Agri-Resources),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenagri.com.sg/] Golden-Agri Resources official website.

The company signed an agreement which prevents the company from developing plantations in areas where large amounts of carbon are locked up.

====Removal of ancient tree====
In June 1995, Greenpeace took a trunk of a tree from the forests of the proposed [[national park]] of Koitajoki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?contentid=93031 |title=Finland’s environmental administration, 1995 |publisher=Ymparisto.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ilomantsi]], Finland and put it on display at exhibitions held in Austria and Germany. Greenpeace said in a press conference that the tree was originally from a logged area in the [[ancient forest]] which was supposed to be protected. [[Metsähallitus]] accused Greenpeace of theft and said that the tree was from a normal forest and had been left standing because of its old age. Metsähallitus also said that the tree had actually crashed over a road during a storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vihreavoima.tripod.com/finnish_greenpeace.htm |title=Stolen trunk of a tree: references from Iltasanomat. 9.6.1995 |publisher=Vihreavoima.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident received publicity in Finland, for example in the large newspapers ''[[Helsingin sanomat|Helsingin Sanomat]]'' and ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/arkisto/haku?pageNumber=1&amp;order=FIFO&amp;advancedSearch=1&amp;free=greenpeace&amp;date=20070110&amp;depa=Kaikki+osastot&amp;fromDay=1&amp;fromMonth=8&amp;fromYear=1995&amp;toDay=1&amp;toMonth=8&amp;toYear=1995 |title=References from Helsingin Sanomat, 1.8.1995 |publisher=Hs.fi |date=1995-01-08 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace replied that the tree had fallen down because the protective forest around it had been [[clearcutting|clearcut]], and that they wanted to highlight the fate of old forests in general, not the fate of one particular tree.&lt;ref&gt;Häirikkö lintukodossa : Suomen Greenpeace 1989–1998 (vastuullinen julkaisija: Matti Vuori, toimitus: Laura Hakoköngäs, 1998, ISBN 951-97079-3-X)&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace also highlighted that Metsähallitus admitted the value of the forest afterwards as Metsähallitus currently refers to Koitajoki as a distinctive area because of its old growth forests.&lt;ref&gt;Häirikkö lintukodossa : Suomen Greenpeace 1989–1998 (vastuullinen julkaisija: Matti Vuori, toimitus: Laura Hakoköngäs, 1998, ISBN 951-97079-3-X).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=6582 |title=Metsähallitus: The Nature of Koitajoki (in Finnish) |publisher=Luontoon.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)===
Greenpeace has also supported the rejection of [[Genetically modified food|GM food]] from the US in famine-stricken Zambia as long as supplies of non-genetically engineered grain exist, stating that the US &quot;should follow in the European Union's footsteps and allow aid recipients to choose their food aid, buying it locally if they wish. This practise can stimulate developing economies and creates more robust food security&quot;, adding that, &quot;if Africans truly have no other alternative, the controversial GE maize should be milled so it can't be planted. It was this condition that allowed Zambia's neighbours Zimbabwe and Malawi to accept it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feature story – September 30, 2002 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/eat-this-or-die/ |title=Eat this or die, The poison politics of food aid |publisher=Greenpeace |date=2002-09-30 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Zambia banned all GM food aid, the former agricultural minister of Zambia criticized, &quot;how the various international NGOs that have spoken approvingly of the government's action will square the body count with their various consciences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2002/oct/30/gm.food|title=Zambia slams door shut on GM relief food|first=Carrol|last=Rory|date=2002-10-30|accessdate=2010-10-18|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the decision of Zambia, Greenpeace has stated that, &quot;it was obvious to us that if no non-GM aid was being offered then they should absolutely accept GM food aid.

====Greenpeace on golden rice====
Greenpeace opposes the planned use of [[golden rice]], a variety of ''[[Oryza sativa]]'' [[rice]] produced through [[genetic engineering]] to [[biosynthesis|biosynthesize]] [[beta-carotene]], a precursor of pro-[[retinol|vitamin A]] in the edible parts of rice. According to Greenpeace, golden rice has not managed to do anything about malnutrition for 10 years during which alternative methods are already tackling malnutrition. The alternative proposed by Greenpeace is to discourage [[mono-cropping]] and to increase production of crops which are naturally nutrient-rich (containing other nutrients not found in golden rice in addition to beta-[[carotene]]). Greenpeace argues that resources should be spent on programs that are already working and helping to relieve malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Background – November 5, 2010 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/agriculture/problem/genetic-engineering/hands-off-our-rice/Greenpeace-and-Golden-Rice/ |title=and golden rice |publisher=Greenpeace |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Rice Project acknowledges that,
&quot;While the most desirable option is a varied and sufficient diet, this goal is not always achievable, at least not in the short term.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;goldenrice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenrice.org/ |title=goldenrice.org |publisher=goldenrice.org |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewal of these concerns coincided with the publication of a paper in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' about a version of golden rice with much higher levels of beta carotene.&lt;ref&gt;Paine JA, Shipton CA, Chaggar S, Howells RM, Kennedy MJ, Vernon G, Wright SY, Hinchliffe E, Adams JL, Silverstone AL, Drake R (2005) A new version of Golden Rice with increased pro-vitamin A content. Nature Biotechnology 23:482–487.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;golden rice 2&quot; was developed and patented by [[Syngenta]], which provoked Greenpeace to renew its allegation that the project is driven by [[profit motive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace.

Prakash, who is the director of the Center for Plant Biotechnology Research at [[Tuskegee University]] and is president of the AgBioWorld Foundation expressed the opinion that, &quot;[c]ritics condemned biotechnology as something that is purely for profit, that is being pursued only in [[Western world|the West]], and with no benefits to the consumer. Golden Rice proves them wrong, so they need to discredit it any way they can.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Checkbiotech.org.

===Toxics===
 
In July 2011, Greenpeace released its Dirty Laundry report accusing some of the world's top fashion and [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] brands of releasing [[toxic waste]] into China's rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace.[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/Dirty-Laundry/ Dirty Laundry: Unravelling the corporate connections to toxic water pollution in China].&lt;/ref&gt; The report profiles the problem of [[water pollution]] resulting from the release of toxic chemicals associated with the country's [[textile industry]]. Investigations focused on [[wastewater]] discharges from two facilities in China; one belonging to the [[Youngor Group]] located on the [[Yangtze River Delta]] and the other to Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the [[Pearl River Delta]]. Scientific analysis of samples from both facilities revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent [[hormone disruptor]] chemicals, including [[alkylphenols]], [[perfluorinated compound]]s and [[perfluorooctane sulfonate]].  
 	
The report goes on to assert that the Youngor Group and Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. - the two companies behind the facilities - have commercial relationships with a range of major clothing brands, including [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], [[Adidas]], [[Bauer Hockey]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Converse (shoe company)]], [[Cortefiel]], [[H&amp;M]], [[Lacoste]], [[Li Ning (company)]], [[Metersbonwe Group]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Phillips-Van Heusen]] and [[Puma AG]].

==Organizational structure==

===Governance===
[[File:GPIgovernance&amp;management.png|thumb|300px|right|The governance and management structure of Greenpeace.]]
Greenpeace consists of ''Greenpeace International'' (officially Stichting Greenpeace Council) based in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], and 28 regional offices operating in 45 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;organization&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Background – November 13, 2008 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured |title=Greenpeace, organization |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional offices work largely autonomously under the supervision of Greenpeace International. The executive director of Greenpeace is elected by the board members of Greenpeace International. The current director of Greenpeace International is [[Kumi Naidoo]] and the current Chair of the Board is Brazilian Ana Toni.&lt;ref name=&quot;executive director&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Background – November 16, 2009 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/management/executive-director |title=Greenpeace International, Executive Director |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Board&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Background – June 8, 2009 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure/board |title=Greenpeace International, Board of Directors |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2011-21-04 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace has a staff of 2,400&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual report 2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/international-annualreport-2008.pdf Greenpeace, Annual Report 2008] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and 15,000 volunteers globally.&lt;ref name=&quot;involved&quot;&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/getinvolved/Greenpeace International home page, Get involved]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each regional office is led by a regional executive director elected by the regional board of directors. The regional boards also appoint a trustee to The Greenpeace International Annual General Meeting, where the trustees elect or remove the board of directors of Greenpeace International. The role of the annual general meeting is also to discuss and decide the overall principles and strategically important issues for Greenpeace in collaboration with the trustees of regional offices and Greenpeace International board of directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/how-is-greenpeace-structured/governance-structure Governance Structure | Greenpeace International].

===Funding===
[[File:DDC-GP.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Greenpeace street fundraiser talking to a passer-by.]]Greenpeace receives its funding from individual supporters and foundations.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPI-FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBS&quot;/&gt; Greenpeace screens all major donations in order to ensure it does not receive unwanted donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/belgium/nl/press/reports/fundraisingpolicies.pdf |title=Greenpeace Fundaising policies |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization does not accept money from governments, intergovernmental organizations, political parties or corporations in order to avoid their influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPI-FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;funding&quot;/&gt; Donations from foundations which are funded by political parties or receive most of their funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations are rejected. Foundation donations are also rejected if the foundations attach unreasonable conditions, restrictions or constraints on Greenpeace activities or if the donation would compromise the independence and aims of Greenpeace.&lt;ref name=&quot;funding&quot;/&gt; Since in the mid-1990s the number of supporters started to decrease, Greenpeace pioneered the use of [[Street fundraiser|face-to-face fundraising]] where fundraisers actively seek new supporters at public places, subscribing them for a monthly direct debit donation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofii.org/active%20site/Members%20area/FF171GPIF2F.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Relationship Fundraising: A Donor-based Approach to the Business of Raising Money'', Ken Burnett, The White Lion Press Limited, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, most of the €202.5 million received by the organization was donated by about 2.6 million regular supporters, mainly from Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual report 2008&quot;/&gt;

In September 2003, the [[Public Interest Watch]] (PIW) complained to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], claiming that Greenpeace USA tax returns were inaccurate and in violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicinterestwatch.org/pdfs/PIW_report.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIW charged that Greenpeace was using non-profit donations for advocacy instead of charity and educational purposes. PIW asked the IRS to investigate the complaint. Greenpeace rejected the accusations and challenged PIW to disclose its funders, a request rejected by then-Executive Director of PIW, Mike Hardiman, because PIW does not have [[501c3]] tax exempt status like Greenpeace does in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=\Nation\archive\200309\NAT20030923b.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS conducted an extensive review and concluded in December 2005 that Greenpeace USA continued to qualify for its tax-exempt status. In March 2006  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that PIW had been funded by [[ExxonMobil]] prior to PIW's request to investigate Greenpeace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB114291044305003774-lMyQjAxMDE2NDIyMTkyMTEwWj.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Did a Group Financed by Exxon Prompt IRS to Audit Greenpeace? | date=2006-03-21 | first=Steve | last=Stecklow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ships==
Since Greenpeace was founded, seagoing ships have played a vital role in its campaigns. Now that the [[Rainbow Warrior (2011)|''Rainbow Warrior III'']] has been completed, the group has three ocean-going ships, the ''Esperanza'', ''Arctic Sunrise'' and ''Rainbow Warrior III''.&lt;ref name=&quot;COMM&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10620814 |title=Greenpeace commissions third Warrior |author=Vidal, John |date=18 January 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First ''Rainbow Warrior''===
{{main|Rainbow Warrior (1955)}}
{{See also|Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior}}
In 1978, Greenpeace launched the original ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'', a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}}, former fishing [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] named for the [[Cree]] legend that inspired early activist [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Robert Hunter]] on the first voyage to Amchitka. Greenpeace purchased the ''Rainbow Warrior'' (originally launched as the ''Sir William Hardy'' in 1955) at a cost of £40,000.  Volunteers restored and refitted it over a period of four months. First deployed to disrupt the hunt of the [[Iceland]]ic whaling fleet, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' would quickly become a mainstay of Greenpeace campaigns. Between 1978 and 1985, crew members also engaged in direct action against the ocean-dumping of toxic and radioactive waste, the [[Grey Seal]] hunt in [[Orkney]] and nuclear testing in the Pacific. Japan's Fisheries Agency has labeled Greenpeace ships as &quot;[[anti-whaling]] vessels&quot; and &quot;[[Ecoterrorism|environmental terrorists]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/pressreleases/oceans/2001dec14.html |title=Greenpeace Rejects Terrorism Label, 14 December 2001 |publisher=Archive.greenpeace.org |date=2001-12-14 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1985, the vessel was instrumental  for 'Operation Exodus', the evacuation of about 300 [[Rongelap Atoll]] islanders whose home had been contaminated with nuclear fallout from a US nuclear test two decades ago which had never been cleaned up and was still having severe health effects on the locals.&lt;ref name=&quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/history/mejato.htm &quot;The evacuation of Rongelap]&quot; Greenpeace. Retrieved 2009-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1985 the ''Rainbow Warrior'' was to lead a flotilla of protest vessels into the waters surrounding [[Moruroa]] atoll, site of French nuclear testing. The [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] occurred when the [[French government]] secretly bombed the ship in [[Auckland]] harbour on orders from [[François Mitterrand]] himself. This killed Dutch freelance photographer [[Fernando Pereira]], who thought it was safe to enter the boat to get his photographic material after a first small explosion, but drowned as a result of a second, larger explosion. The attack was a public relations disaster for France after it was quickly exposed by the New Zealand police. The French Government in 1987 agreed to pay New Zealand compensation of [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]13 million and formally apologised for the bombing. The French Government also paid [[French franc|₣]]2.3 million compensation to the family of the photographer.

===Second ''Rainbow Warrior''===
[[File:Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Greenpeace's second ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1989)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' ship arrives in [[Bali]] for the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2007 UN climate conference]].]]
In 1989 Greenpeace commissioned a replacement vessel, also named the [[Rainbow Warrior (1989)|Rainbow Warrior]] (also referred as ''Rainbow Warrior II''), which was retired from service on the 16th of August 2011 to be replaced by the third Rainbow Warrior. In 2005 the ''Rainbow Warrior II'' ran aground on and damaged the [[Tubbataha Reef]] in the Philippines while inspecting the reef for [[coral bleaching]]. Greenpeace was fined [[United States dollar|US$]]7,000 for damaging the reef and agreed to pay the fine saying they felt responsible for the damage, although Greenpeace stated that the Philippines government had given it outdated charts. The park manager of Tubbataha appreciated the quick action Greenpeace took to assess the damage to the reef.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]].

===Other vessels===

A French journalist under the pen name Olivier Vermont wrote in his book ''La Face cachée de Greenpeace'' (&quot;The Hidden Face of Greenpeace&quot;) that he had joined Greenpeace France and had worked there as a secretary.
