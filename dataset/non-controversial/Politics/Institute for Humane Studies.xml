==History==
[[File:Gmu law school.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Hazel Hall, home of the [[Mercatus Center]] and the Institute for Humane Studies on the [[George Mason University]] Arlington campus]]
The Institute for Humane Studies was founded in 1961 in [[Menlo Park, California]] by [[F. A. Harper|F. A. &quot;Baldy&quot; Harper]], in his [[Garage (house)|garage]], in order to promote [[peace]], [[prosperity]], and [[social harmony]] by fostering a greater understanding of [[Social science|human affairs]] and [[Liberty|freedom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Floyd Arthur 'Baldy' Harper, RIP by Rothbard&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Libertarianism Today by Huebert&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Writings of F.

After beginning an association with [[George Mason University]], Liggio, Walter Grinder, and [[John Blundell (economist)|John Blundell]] moved the institute to [[Fairfax, Virginia]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Libertarianism Today by Huebert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waging the War of Ideas by Blundell&quot;/&gt; The organization is currently located in Hazel Hall on the George Mason University [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] campus, along with sister organization the [[Mercatus Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Libertarianism Today by Huebert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koch by Bogardus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IHS in Philanthropy News Digest&quot;/&gt;

==Organization and funding==
The institute is governed by a board of directors, currently chaired by [[Charles G. Koch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IHS by Greenpeace&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries/institute-for-humane-studies/ | title=Institute for Humane Studies | publisher=Greenpeace | work=What We Do | accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other members of the board of directors are [[John Blundell (economist)|John Blundell]], [[Richard H.

IHS has received funding from a number of foundations, including the [[Sarah Scaife Foundation]], the [[Koch Family Foundations]], and the [[Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bridgeproject.com/?organization&amp;id=270906 |title=Recipient: Institute for Humane Studies |publisher=[[Media Matters for America|American Bridge 21st Century Foundation]]|date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Libertarianism Today by Huebert&quot; /&gt; In March 2012, in the midst of a legal dispute between [[Charles Koch]] and the [[Cato Institute]] that caused renewed scrutiny of Koch's political philanthropy, IHS's chief financial officer told the ''New York Times'' that Koch is &quot;a longtime and generous supporter of ours, but we’re not involved as a political organization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/us/cato-institute-and-koch-in-rift-over-independence.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=catoinstitute |title=Cato Institute Is Caught in a Rift Over Its Direction|publisher=New York Times|date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each summer, IHS runs a series of free, week-long summer seminars for university students from around the world. Seminars are interdisciplinary and include lectures on [[history]], [[economics]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;American Conservatism by Frohnen&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = ISI Books | isbn = 978-1-932236-43-9 | last = Frohnen | first = Bruce | coauthors = Jeremy Beer, Jeffrey O.

===Scholarships===
Through its Humane Studies Fellowship program, IHS awards scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students embarking on &quot;liberty-advancing careers in ideas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayn Rand by Gladstein and Meadowcroft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships BYU&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships Syracuse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships Lehigh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships Duke&quot; /&gt; Each summer, through the Summer Graduate Research Fellowship, IHS gives $5,000 stipends to young academics &quot;to refine and complete a publishable scholarly article or thesis chapter that engages ideas within the classical liberal tradition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships BYU&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships Syracuse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships Lehigh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships Duke&quot; /&gt;

In the ''[[Daily Caller]]'', Matthew Zwolinski wrote that IHS trains professors to expose students to libertarian ideas: &quot;[IHS] mentors graduate students through the process of finishing their classes and writing their dissertations. And it helps them find jobs. In the 50 years of its existence, IHS has put over 1,200 professors into classrooms across the country where they teach over a quarter of a million students each year. And those students are exposed to libertarian ideas not just in a 30-second advertisement or debate answer, but for an entire semester, rigorously and in depth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/01/12/libertarians-stop-worrying-about-ron-paul/ | title=Libertarians: Stop worrying about Ron Paul| publisher=[[Daily Caller]] |date=January 12, 2012|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
