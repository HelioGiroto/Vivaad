{{wiktionary}}
{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}
'''Normative''' has specialized contextual meanings in several academic disciplines. Generically, it means ''relating to an ideal standard or model.''&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, 2007:109 {{Specify|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it has strong connotations of relating to a ''typical'' standard or model (see also [[normality]]).

== Philosophy ==

In [[philosophy]], ''normative'' statements affirm how things should or [[Is-ought problem|ought]] to be, how to [[Value theory|value]] them, which things are [[goodness and value theory|good]] or bad, which [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s are [[right]] or [[wrong]].  Normative is usually contrasted with [[Positivist]] (i.e. descriptive, [[explanation|explanatory]], or [[constative]]) claims when describing types of [[theory|theories]], [[belief]]s, or [[proposition]]s.  Positivist statements are factual statements that attempt to describe [[reality]].

For example, &quot;children should eat vegetables&quot;, and &quot;those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither&quot; are normative claims. On the other hand, &quot;vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins&quot;, &quot;smoking causes cancer&quot;, and &quot;a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both&quot; are positive claims. Whether or not a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

It is only with [[David Hume]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in the 18th century that philosophers began to take cognizance of the logical difference between normative and descriptive statements and thinking. There are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be [[reason|rationally]] discussed or defended.  Among these schools are the tradition of [[practical reason]] extending from [[Aristotle]] through [[Kant]] to [[JÃ¼rgen Habermas|Habermas]], which asserts that they can, and the tradition of [[emotivism]], which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no rational content. &lt;!--last sentence/statement: i.e., objectivity vs. subjectivity(?)--&gt;

Normative statements and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life.  They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning [[thought]], [[belief]], [[emotion]] and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and are the basis of much ethical and political discourse.

Modern philosophy generally holds that the way in which individuals or societies define that which they consider to be appropriate - that is: to be in accordance with their (normative) standards - varies greatly between peoples and cultures. Others see a remarkable unity of human moral sentiment. Many philosophers have searched for a source of normative values which is independent of the individual's subjective morality and consequently objective and 'true' in nature.

== Social sciences and economics ==
In the [[social sciences]], the term &quot;normative&quot; has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a [[sociological]] context, to the role of cultural '[[norm (social)|norms]]'; the shared values or institutions that [[structural functionalist]]s regard as constitutive of the [[social structure]] and [[social cohesion]].  These values and units of [[socialization]] thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that ''ought'' to (with respect to the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that ''ought not'' occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially ''valued'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as &quot;[[crime]]&quot; or anti-social behaviour, see also [[normality]]) the normative effects of popularly-endorsed beliefs (such as &quot;[[family values]]&quot; or &quot;[[common sense]]&quot;) push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological [[conservatism]].

Normative economics deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, ''valued, ibid.'') economic outcomes. See economics aspect in [[normative economics]].

== Law ==
{{See also|Normative jurisprudence}}
In [[law]], as an academic discipline, the term &quot;normative&quot; is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
Normative elements are defined in [[ISO|International Organization for Standardization]] Directives Part 2 as &quot;elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions&quot;.  Provisions include &quot;requirements&quot;, &quot;recommendations&quot; and &quot;statements&quot;.  &quot;Statements&quot; include permissions, possibilities and capabilities.  A &quot;requirement&quot; is an &quot;expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted.&quot;  It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard, it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form &quot;shall&quot;).  There is much confusion between &quot;normative&quot; and &quot;requirement&quot;, however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.

In [[Standardization|standard]]s terminology still used by some organisations, &quot;normative&quot; means &quot;considered to be a [[prescriptive]] part of the standard&quot;. It characterises that part of the standard which describes what ''ought'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a ''valuable'' outcome (''ibid.''). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. &quot;Compliance&quot; is defined as &quot;complies with the normative sections of the standard&quot;; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.  

* Normative = prescriptive = how to comply
* Informative = descriptive = help with conceptual understanding

Typically, ''normative'' is contrasted with ''informative'' (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or [[Positive science|positive]] content).  Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements.  Informative data is not a requirement and doesnât compel compliance.
