'''Newton Leroy''' &quot;'''Newt'''&quot; '''Gingrich''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|nj|uː|t|_|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|ŋg|r|ɪ|tʃ}}; born '''Newton Leroy McPherson'''; June 17, 1943) is an American politician, author, and political consultant. He represented [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from 1979 until his resignation in 1999, and served as the 58th [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1995 to 1999. Gingrich was a [[Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012 |candidate]] for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican Party presidential nomination]].

In the 1970s, Gingrich taught history and geography at the [[University of West Georgia]]. During this period he [[political campaign|ran]] twice (1974 and 1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1384 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Newt Gingrich (b. 1943) |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[United States House of Representatives]] before winning in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1978|November 1978]]. He served as [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Whip]] from 1989 to 1995.

A co-author and architect of the &quot;[[Contract with America]]&quot;, Gingrich was a major leader in the Republican victory in the [[United States House of Representatives election, 1994|1994 congressional election]]. In 1995, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named him &quot;[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]&quot; for &quot;his role in ending the four-decades-long Democratic majority in the House&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr20111208&quot;&gt;''[[NPR]]'' (December 8, 2011).

Retrieved February 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While he was House speaker, the House enacted [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]], passed a [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997|capital gains tax cut]] in 1997, and in 1998 passed the first balanced budget since 1969. The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional election and pressure from Republican colleagues caused Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 5, 1998, and then the House on January 3, 1999.

Since leaving the House, Gingrich has remained active in public policy debates and worked as a political consultant. He founded and chaired several policy [[think tanks]], including [[American Solutions for Winning the Future]] and the [[Center for Health Transformation]]. He has written or co-authored 27 books. In May 2011, he announced his campaign for the [[Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012|Republican presidential nomination]]. On May 2, 2012, Gingrich ended his presidential campaign and endorsed front-runner [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newt Gingrich to formally end presidential campaign|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17927048|publisher=http://www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=May 2, 2012|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being raised [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and spending most of his adult life as a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]], Gingrich converted to Roman Catholicism in 2009. He has been married three times, with the first two marriages ending in divorce. He has two children from his first marriage and has been married to [[Callista Gingrich|Callista (Bisek) Gingrich]] since 2000.

==Early life, family, and education==
Newton Leroy McPherson was born at the [[Harrisburg Hospital]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], on June 17, 1943. His mother, Kathleen &quot;Kit&quot; McPherson (née Daugherty; 1925–2003), and father, Newton Searles McPherson (1923–1970),&lt;ref&gt;[http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Gingrich/Parents-Grandparents.php Newt Gingrich Parents and Grandparents]  ''2012.Republican-Candidates.org''. Retrieved 2012-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt; married in September 1942, when she was 16 and McPherson was 19. The marriage fell apart within days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Rourke |first= Mary |title= Kathleen Gingrich, 77; Mother of House Speaker Made News |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= September 25, 2003 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/25/local/me-gingrich25 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newt/newtchron.html| date=January 16, 1996| title=The Long March of Newt Gingrich|publisher=PBS|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|accessdate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000225|year=2007|title=Biography of Newton Gingrich|work=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of German, English, Scottish, and Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CC&amp;s_site=contracostatimes&amp;p_multi=CC&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1063FE5399CE953B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Immigration Divides Republican Opinion|work=Contra Costa Times|date=November 24, 1997|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, his mother married Army officer Robert Gingrich (1925–1996), who adopted Newt.&lt;ref name=&quot;stepfather obit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title= Robert Gingrich; Retired Army Officer, Father of House Speaker |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=Associated Press |date= November 21, 1996 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-21/news/mn-1442_1_robert-gingrich |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, a career officer, served tours in Korea and Vietnam.  In 1956 the family moved to Europe living for a period in Orleans, France and Stuttgart, Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newt/newtchron.html |title=A Newt Chronology &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingrich has three younger half-sisters, [[Candace Gingrich-Jones]], Susan Gingrich, and Roberta Brown&lt;ref name=&quot;stepfather obit&quot; /&gt; Gingrich was raised in [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]] (near Harrisburg) and on military bases where Robert Gingrich was stationed.

In 1960 the family moved to Georgia at [[Fort Benning]] during his junior year in high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

In 1961, Gingrich graduated from [[Baker High School (Columbus, Georgia)|Baker High School]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]]. He had been interested in politics since his teen years while living in [[Orléans]], France, where he visited the site of the [[Battle of Verdun]] and learned about the sacrifices made there and the importance of political leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gingrich |first1=Newt |last2=Gingrich Cushman |first2=Jackie |title=5 Principles for a Successful Life: From Our Family to Yours |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZmYJL2KJqkYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=newt+gingrich+verdun#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |year=2009 |month=May |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-46232-9|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing to obtain [[Conscription in the United States|deferments]] granted to college students and fathers, Gingrich did not enlist in the military, and was not [[Conscription in the United States#Vietnam War|drafted]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He expressed some regret about that decision in 1985, saying, &quot;Given everything I believe in, a large part of me thinks I should have gone over.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Vanity Fair| title=Good Newt, Bad Newt |last=Boyer| first=Peter J. |date=July 1989 |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newt/boyernewt1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingrich received a B.A. degree in history from [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]] in 1965. He then proceeded to earn an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] (1968) and PhD (1971) in modern European history, both from [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/newt-gingrich |title=Newt Gingrich|publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent six months in [[Brussels]] in 1969–70 working on his dissertation, &quot;Belgian Education Policy in the Congo 1945–1960&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norman |first=Laurence |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2012/01/18/newt-gingrichs-brussels-digs/ |title=Newt Gingrich’s Brussels Digs|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Gingrich joined the history department at [[University of West Georgia|West Georgia College]] as an assistant professor. In 1974 he moved to the geography department and was instrumental in establishing an [[interdisciplinary]] [[environmental studies]] program. Denied [[tenure]], he left the college in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203735304577167041714568630.html| work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Elizabeth | last=Williamson | title=Gingrich's College Records Show a Professor Hatching Big Plans| date=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Gingrich was the southern regional director for [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chameleon |first=Ed |last=Kilgore |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/84568/kilgore-gingrich-liberal-policies |magazine=The New Republic |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional campaigns===
In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1974|1974]], Gingrich made his first bid for political office as the Republican candidate in {{ushr|Georgia|6}}, which stretched from the southern [[Atlanta]] suburbs to the [[Alabama]] state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat [[John James Flynt, Jr.|Jack Flynt]] by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the more suburban areas of the district, but was unable to overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=31926 Race details for 1974 election] in 6th District&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich's relative success came as a considerable shock on two fronts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger—indeed, Gingrich was only the second Republican to even run against him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=16367 John James Flynt] bio page at OurCampaigns&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 1974 was a disastrous year for Republicans nationally due to fallout from the [[Watergate scandal]].

Gingrich sought a rematch in 1976, this time losing by 5,100 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=31093 |title=Race details for 1976 election |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Gingrich priming for another run in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1978|1978 elections]], Flynt decided not to run for re-election and retired. Gingrich defeated Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shepard, Virginia|publisher=Our Campaigns|date=June 23, 2007|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=31287|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gsu.edu/spcoll/pages/pages.asp?ldID=105&amp;guideID=551&amp;ID=4133 |title=Shapard, Virginia—GGDP Library Special Collections—Georgia State University Library |publisher=Library.gsu.edu |date=January 26, 1988 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district,&lt;ref&gt;Gingrich was also elected to 4 terms from a new 6th District (after redistricting following the 1990 census), as described in the next section.&lt;/ref&gt; only facing a close general election race once—in the [[United States House election, 1990|House elections of 1990]]—when he won by 978 votes in a race against Democrat [[David Worley]]. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, as well as most of the area's seats in the [[Georgia General Assembly|General Assembly]], well into the 1980s.

==In Congress==
[[File:Ronald Reagan with Newt Gingrich.jpg|thumb|240px|Rep. Gingrich meets with President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1985.]]

In 1981, Gingrich co-founded the Military Reform Caucus (MRC) and the Congressional Aviation and Space Caucus. During the [[1983 congressional page sex scandal]], Gingrich was among those calling for the [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|expulsion]] of representatives [[Dan Crane]] and [[Gerry Studds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= Steven V |last=Roberts |title=Congressman Asks Expulsion of Two |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/19/us/congressman-asks-expulsion-of-two.html |date=July 19, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich supported a proposal to ban loans from the [[International Monetary Fund]] to Communist countries and he endorsed a bill to make [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s birthday a national holiday.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite news |title=One Conservative Faults Two Parties |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/11/us/one-conservative-faults-two-parties.html?scp=1&amp;sq=One+Conservative+Faults+Two+Parties&amp;st=nyt |first=Steven V. |last=Roberts |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 11, 1983 |page=18A |at=National Desk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he founded the [[Conservative Opportunity Society]] (COS), a group that included young conservative House Republicans. Early COS members included [[Robert Smith Walker]], [[Judd Gregg]], [[Dan Coats]] and [[Connie Mack III]]. The group expanded over time to comprise several dozen representatives&lt;ref name=Balz&gt;{{cite news |title=Gingrich, Allies Made Waves and Impression; Conservative Rebels Harassed the House |first=Charles R |last=Babcock |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 20, 1994 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who met each week to exchange and develop ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;/&gt;

Gingrich's analysis of polls and public opinion identified the group's initial focus.&lt;ref name=Balz/&gt; [[Ronald Reagan]] adopted the &quot;opportunity society&quot; ideas for his 1984 re-election campaign, supporting the group's conservative goals on economic growth, education, crime, and social issues, which he had not emphasized during his first term.&lt;ref name=WashPo84&gt;{{cite news |title=Reagan Expected to Gloss Over Second-Term Sacrifices |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 12, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan also referenced an &quot;opportunity&quot; society in the first [[State of the Union address]] of his second term.&lt;ref name=Balz/&gt;

In May 1988, Gingrich (along with 77 other House members and [[Common Cause]]) brought ethics charges against Democratic Speaker [[Jim Wright]], who was alleged to have used a book deal to circumvent campaign-finance laws and House ethics rules. During the investigation, it was noted Gingrich had his own unusual book deal, for ''Window of Opportunity'', in which publicity expenses were covered by a [[limited partnership]], which raised $105,000 from Republican political supporters to promote sales of Gingrich's book.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wright's Key Accuser Has His Own Book Deal&quot;, ''The Washington Post'', March 20, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich's success in forcing Wright's resignation was in part responsible for his rising influence in the Republican [[caucus]].&lt;ref&gt;Germond, Jack W.; Witcover, Jules (March 24, 1989). &quot;Can Gingrich Unify GOP Without Throwing Bombs?&quot;.

In March 1989, Gingrich became [[House Minority Whip]] in a close election against [[Edward Rell Madigan]].&lt;ref name=Komarow&gt;{{cite news |title=House Republicans Elect Gingrich to No. 2 Spot, Chart Battle with Democrats |first=Steven |last=Komarow |agency=Associated Press |date=March 22, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Gingrich's first formal position of power within the Republican party&lt;ref name=Drinkard&gt;{{cite news |title=Party Mobilizes to Fill Cheney's Post |first=Jim |last=Drinkard |agency=Associated Press |date=March 13, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated his intention to &quot;build a much more aggressive, activist party.&quot;&lt;ref name=Komarow/&gt; Early in his role as Whip, in May 1989, Gingrich was involved in talks about the appointment of a [[Panama]]nian administrator of the [[Panama Canal]], which was scheduled to occur in 1989 subject to U.S. government approval. Gingrich was outspoken in his opposition to giving [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties|control over the canal]] to an administrator appointed by the dictatorship in [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House GOP Leader Questions Relinquishing Canal to Panama |first=Merrill |last=Hartson |agency=Associated Press |date=May 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingrich and others in the House, including the newly minted [[Gang of Seven]], railed against what they saw as ethical lapses under Democratic control for almost 40 years. The [[House banking scandal]] and [[Congressional Post Office scandal]] were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among the 450 members of the House who had engaged in [[check kiting]]; he had [[overdraft]]s on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/23/magazine/house-revolutionary.html|work=The New York Times|title=House Revolutionary|first=Adam|last=Clymer|date=August 23, 1992|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the 1990 United States Census, Georgia picked up an additional seat for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|1992 U.S. House elections]]. However, the Democratic-controlled [[Georgia General Assembly]] under the leadership of fiercely partisan Speaker of the House [[Tom Murphy (U.S. politician)|Tom Murphy]] specifically targeted Gingrich, eliminating the district that Gingrich represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/20murphy.html | work=The New York Times | first=Brenda | last=Goodman | title=Tom B.

Much of the southern portion of Gingrich's district, including his home in [[Carrollton, Georgia|Carrollton]], was drawn into the [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]-based 3rd District, represented by five-term Democrat [[Richard Ray]]. Gingrich remarked that &quot;The Speaker, by raising money and gerrymandering, has sincerely dedicated a part of his career to wiping me out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; At the same time, the Assembly created a new, heavily Republican 6th District in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] counties in the wealthy northern suburbs of Atlanta—-an area that Gingrich had never represented. However, Gingrich sold his home in Carrollton and moved to [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] in the new 6th. His primary opponent, State Representative Herman Clark, made an issue out of Gingrich's 22 kited checks in the House Bank Scandal, and also criticized Gingrich for moving into the district. After a recount Gingrich prevailed by 980 votes, or a 51% to 49% result&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/29/us/the-1992-campaign-gingrich-is-declared-winner-after-recount-in-a-primary.html &quot;Gingrich Is Declared Winner After Recount in a Primary&quot;].

===&quot;Republican Revolution&quot; of 1994===
{{Main|Republican Revolution}}
In the [[United States House of Representatives election, 1994|1994 campaign season]], in an effort to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a [[Contract with America]], which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=An EIB History Lesson on 1994| work=[[Rush Limbaugh]]|url= http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_031109/content/01125114.guest.html|last=Limbaugh|first=Rush|date=March 11, 2009|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as [[welfare reform]], [[term limits]], tougher crime laws, and a [[balanced budget]] law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.

In the November 1994 elections, Republicans gained 54 seats and took control of the House for the first time since 1954. Long-time [[House Minority Leader]] [[Bob Michel]] of [[Illinois]] had not run for re-election, giving Gingrich, the highest-ranking Republican returning to Congress, the inside track at becoming speaker. The midterm election that turned congressional power over to Republicans &quot;changed the center of gravity&quot; in the nation's capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/0,28757,2020388,00.html |title=Man of the Year 1995 |year=1995 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine named Gingrich its 1995 &quot;Man of the Year&quot; for his role in the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr20111208&quot;/&gt;

==Speaker of the House==

{{Main|Contract with America}}
The House fulfilled Gingrich's promise to bring all ten of the Contract's issues to a vote within the first 100 days of the session, even though most of the legislation was initially held up in the Senate by the objection of liberal/progressive interest groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sierraclub.org/planet/199412/yir-contract.asp|title=Contract on America's Environment|work=The Planet Newsletter|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|accessdate=August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President Clinton, who called it the &quot;Contract on America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/convention/2000/clinton.htm |title=ASNE—Luncheon address by President Bill Clinton |publisher=Asne.org |date=April 13, 2000 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation proposed by the [[104th United States Congress]] included term limits for Congressional Representatives, [[tax cuts]], welfare reform, and a [[balanced budget amendment]], as well as independent [[auditing]] of the finances of the House of Representatives and elimination of non-essential services such as the House barbershop and shoe-shine concessions. Following Gingrich's first two years as House Speaker, the Republican majority was re-elected in the 1996 election, the first time Republicans had done so in 68 years, and the first time simultaneously with a Democratic president winning re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I've Always Supported an 'All the Above' Energy Policy |first=Newt |last=Gingrich |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576117922236920088.html |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
====Welfare reform====
A central pledge of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s campaign was to reform the welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a [[universal health care]] program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill in as little as 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton Puzzle: How to Delay Welfare Reform Yet Seem to Pursue It |first=Jason |last=DeParle |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 5, 1994 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/us/clinton-puzzle-how-to-delay-welfare-reform-yet-seem-to-pursue-it.html |accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, after constructing two welfare reform bills that Clinton vetoed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillon&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation |last=Gillon |first=Steven |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-532278-1 |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich and his supporters pushed for passage of the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Connor |first=Brendon |year=2001 |title=The protagonists and ideas behind the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996: The enactment of a conservative welfare system |journal=Social Justice |issue=Winter 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingrich Was forced to negotiate with Clinton because he closed down the government by stopping such agenicies as the post office three separate occasions. Gingrich and the party had the votes to proceed and allow retro pay to the agencies Clinton had closed to help him save face. The bill was signed into law on August 22, 1996.

In his 1998 book ''Lessons Learned the Hard Way'', Gingrich encouraged volunteerism and spiritual renewal, placing more importance on families, creating tax incentives and reducing regulations for businesses in poor neighborhoods, and increasing property ownership by low-income families. He also praised [[Habitat for Humanity]] for sparking the movement to improve people's lives by helping them build their own homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way: A Personal Report |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=74–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balancing the federal budget====
A key aspect of the [[Contract with America]] was the promise of a [[United States federal budget|balanced federal budget]]. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress would not be able to draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gingrich concedes he can't force balanced budget in '96. |first=Ceci |last=Connolly |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=January 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 1997, Republican congressional leaders reached a compromise with Democrats and President Clinton on the federal budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152&amp;nbsp;billion in Republican sponsored tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115&amp;nbsp;billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24&amp;nbsp;billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2&amp;nbsp;billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton, GOP leaders craft budget package; Deal would erase shortfall by 2002, cut taxes by $ 85b. |first=Brian |last=McGrory |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=May 3, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton signs balanced budget, tax break law.
 |first=Sonya |last=Ross |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=August 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Clinton signed the budget legislation in August 1997. At the signing, Gingrich gave credit to ordinary Americans stating, &quot;It was their political will that brought the two parties together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton Lauds Bipartisanship Behind Budget; He Signs Bills That Will Cut Taxes For Many. |first=Marsha |last=Mercer |agency=Media General News Service |newspaper=Richmond Times Dispatch |date=August 6, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1998, with the economy performing better than expected, increased tax revenues helped reduce the federal budget deficit to below $25&amp;nbsp;billion. Gingrich then called upon Clinton to submit a balanced budget for 1999—three years ahead of schedule—which Clinton did, making it the first time the federal budget had been balanced since 1969.&lt;ref name=WashTimes1998&gt;{{cite news |title=Tonight we're gonna party like it's 1969. |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=January 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997====
In 1997 President Clinton signed into effect the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]], which included the largest [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]] cut in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over 55.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filetax.com/97taxact.html#home |title=Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 |publisher=Filetax.com |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also reductions in a number of other taxes on investment gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reaganomics: What We Learned |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704364004576132473777840938.html |first=Arthur B. |last=Laffer |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FindLaw&gt;{{cite web |title=The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997: An Overview of Selected Provisions |url=http://library.findlaw.com/1997/Jan/1/126242.html |author=Buchanon Ingersoll &amp; Rooney PC|work=FindLaw |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the act raised the value of inherited [[Estate (law)|estates]] and gifts that could be sheltered from taxation.&lt;ref name=FindLaw /&gt; Gingrich has been credited with creating the agenda for the reduction in capital gains tax, especially in the &quot;Contract with America&quot;, which set out to balance the budget and implement decreases in estate and capital gains tax. Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with Clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Like him or not, Gingrich deserves credit for budget |first=John |last=Farmer |newspaper=The Star-Ledger|location=Newark, NJ |date=August 4, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the Republican Congress in the face of opposition from the Clinton administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gingrich sees life in GOP revolution |first=John |last=Marelius |newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=August 19, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich along with [[Bob Dole]] had earlier set-up the [[Kemp Commission]], headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [[Jack Kemp]], a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1042061 |title=Kemp Commission |publisher=Npr.org |date=January 17, 1996 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = two&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/1996/0205taxes_gale/19960205.pdf |title = The Kemp Commission and the Future of Tax Reform. |first =William|last =Gale |publisher= [[Brookings Institute]] |date = February 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other legislation====
Among the first pieces of legislation passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]], which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to remove some of the entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Contract' fulfilled, but job isn't finished; GOP keeps up fast pace in Congress |first=Laurie |last=Kellman |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=April 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingrich shut down the highly regarded [[Office of Technology Assessment]], and relied instead on what the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists called &quot;self-interested lobbyists and think tanks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schwellenbach, Nick. [http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2011/12/renowned-physicists-cast-doubt-on-gingrichs-far-fetched-emp-scenario.html &quot;Renowned Physicists Cast Doubt on Gingrich's Far-Fetched EMP Scenario.&quot;] ''Project On Government Oversight'', December 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government shutdown===
{{Main|United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996}}
[[File:Nydailynews newt.jpg|thumb|''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' cover illustrated by [[Ed Murawinski]], showing Gingrich throwing a tantrum]]
Gingrich and the incoming Republican majority's promise to slow the rate of government spending conflicted with the president's agenda for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], education, the [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[public health]], leading to two temporary shutdowns of the federal government totaling 28 days.&lt;ref name=fram&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton Vetoes Borrowing Bill—Government Shutdown Nears As Rhetoric Continues To Roil |author=Alan Fram |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951113&amp;slug=2152355 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 13, 1995 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton said Republican amendments would strip the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] of its ability to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.&lt;ref name=fram/&gt;

A GOP amendment opposed by Clinton would have not only have increased [[Medicare (United States)#Part B: Medical insurance|Medicare Part B]] premiums, but it would also cancel a scheduled reduction. The Republicans held out for an increase in Medicare part B premiums in January 1996 to $53.50 a month. Clinton favored the then current law, which was to let the premium that seniors pay drop to $42.50.&lt;ref name=fram/&gt;

The government closed most non-essential offices during the shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history. The shutdown ended when Clinton agreed to submit a CBO-approved balanced budget plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Record-breaking federal shutdown ends |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9601/budget/01-06/pm/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=January 6, 1996 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the crisis, Gingrich's public image suffered from the perception that the Republicans' hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of Gingrich by Clinton during a flight on Air Force One to and from [[Yitzhak Rabin]]'s funeral in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=DeLay |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom DeLay |coauthors=Stephen Mansfield |title=No Retreat, No Surrender: One American's Fight |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich told reporters he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight. He complained of being instructed to use the plane's rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was &quot;part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9511/debt_limit/11-16/budget_gingrich/ |title=White House: Gingrich comment 'bizarre' |publisher=CNN |date=November 16, 1995 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingrich was widely lampooned for implying that the government shutdown was a result of his personal grievances, including a widely-shared editorial cartoon depicting him as a baby throwing a [[tantrum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://z.about.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/_/7/newt_baby.jpg Newt Baby].

Discussing the impact of the government shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, &quot;Everybody in Washington thinks that was a big mistake. They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected ... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Starving ObamaCare |author=Philip Klein |newspaper=The American Spectator |date=July/August 2010 |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/08/06/starving-obamacare/print}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 op-ed in ''The Washington Post'', Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gingrich WaPo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=If it comes to a shutdown, the GOP should stick to its principles |first=Newt |last=Gingrich |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/25/AR2011022502924_2.html?sid=ST2011022503108 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the House Ethics Committee concluded that inaccurate information supplied to investigators represented &quot;intentional or ... reckless&quot; disregard of House rules.&lt;ref name=dewar&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/011897.htm| title=Ethics Panel Supports Reprimand of Gingrich | work=The Washington Post | author=Yang, John E.; Dewar, Helen | page=A01 | date=January 18, 1997 | accessdate=August 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethics Committee's Special Counsel [[James M. Cole]] concluded that Gingrich had violated federal tax law and had lied to the ethics panel in an effort to force the committee to dismiss the complaint against him. The full committee panel did not agree whether tax law had been violated and left that issue up to the [[IRS]].&lt;ref name=dewar/&gt; In 1999, the IRS cleared the organizations connected with the &quot;Renewing American Civilization&quot; courses under investigation for possible tax violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D61138F937A35751C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | first=David E. | last=Rosenbaum | title=I.R.S.

Regarding the situation, Gingrich said in January 1997, &quot;I did not manage the effort intensely enough to thoroughly direct or review information being submitted to the committee on my behalf. In my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements were given to the committee, but I did not intend to mislead the committee.... I brought down on the people's house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer122296&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Panel Concludes Gingrich Violated Rules on Ethics|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/1222gingrich-ethics.html?scp=1&amp;sq=gingrich%20ethics&amp;st=cse|date=December 22, 1996|first=Adam|last=Clymer|authorlink=Adam Clymer|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership challenge===
In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans attempted to replace him as Speaker, claiming Gingrich's public image was a liability. The attempted &quot;coup&quot; began July 9 with a meeting of Republican conference chairman [[John Boehner]] of [[Ohio]] and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the attempted coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN|title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker. This would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Democrat [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
In 1998 Republicans lost five seats in the House—the worst midterm performance in 64 years by a party not holding the presidency. Gingrich, who won his reelection, was held largely responsible for Republican losses in the House.  His private polls had given his fellow Republican Congressmen a false impression that pushing the [[Lewinsky scandal]] would damage Clinton's popularity and result in the party winning a net total of six to thirty seats in the US House of Representatives in this election.&lt;ref name=kc.l&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989559,00.html | work=Time | title=Fall of the House Of Newt | date=November 16, 1998 | accessdate=August 17, 2012 | first1=Nancy | last1=Gibbs | first2=Michael | last2=Duffy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The day after the election, a Republican caucus ready to rebel against him prompted his resignation of the speakership. He also announced his intended and eventual full departure from the House in January 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1998&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/08/us/the-speaker-steps-down-excerpts-from-phone-call-about-gingrich-s-future.html &quot;The Speaker Steps Down&quot;], ''The New York Times'', November 8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; When relinquishing the speakership, Gingrich said he was &quot;not willing to preside over people who are [[cannibal]]s.&quot; And he said leaving the House would keep him from overshadowing his successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1998&quot;/&gt;

==Post-speakership==
Gingrich has since remained involved in national politics and public policy debate, especially on issues regarding healthcare, national security, and the role of religion in American public life.

===Policy===
[[File:Gingrich-01.jpg|thumb|right|Gingrich speaking at the [[Values Voter Summit]] in 2007]]
In 2003 he founded the [[Center for Health Transformation]] to develop a 21st century healthcare system that is centered on the individual, prevention focused, knowledge intense, and innovation rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthtransformation.net/cs/about_the_center |title=Our Unique Approach, Center for Health Transformation |publisher=Healthtransformation.net |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich supported the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003, creating the [[Medicare Part D]] federal prescription drugs benefit program. Some conservatives have criticized him for favoring the plan, due to its cost. However, Gingrich has remained a supporter, stating in a 2011 interview that it was a necessary modernization of Medicare, which was created before pharmaceutical drugs became standard in medical care. He has said that the increase in cost from medication must be seen as preventive, leading to reduced need for medical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gingrich Says He Doesn't Regret Supporting Medicare Drug Plan Which Is Now a $7.2&amp;nbsp;Trillion Unfunded Liability |first=Nicholas |last=Ballasy |url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/gingrich-no-regret-supporting-medicare-p |work=CNS News |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 15, 2011, interview on Meet the Press, Gingrich repeated his long-held belief that &quot;all of us have a responsibility to pay—help pay for health care&quot;, and suggested this could be implemented by either a mandate to obtain health insurance or a requirement to post a bond ensuring coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;WaPo20110516&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gingrich calls Medicare voucher proposal 'right-wing social engineering{{'-}}|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gingrich-calls-medicare-voucher-proposal-right-wing-social-engineering/2011/05/15/AFHhoR4G_story.html|date=May 16, 2011|first=Emi|last=Kolawole|work=The Washington Post|first2=Rachel|last2=Weiner|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PoliticoMarr20110516&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Newt Gingrich's rough roll-out|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55082.html|date=May 16, 2011|first=Kendra|last=Marr|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|separator=,|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview Gingrich said &quot;I don't think right wing social engineering is any more desirable than left wing social engineering.

Gingrich has served on several commissions, including the Hart-Rudman Commission, formally known as the [[US Commission on National Security/21st century|U.S. Commission on National Security/21st century]], which examined issues affecting the armed forces, law enforcement and intelligence agencies with regards to national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Advisory board urges new emphasis for U.S. defenders |first=Deborah |last=Martinez |newspaper=Corpus Christi Caller-Times |date=April 20, 2000 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he became the co-chair of a task force for UN reform, which aimed to produce a plan for the U.S. to help strengthen the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-Top Lawmakers to Advise on U.N.

===Businesses===
After leaving Congress in 1999, Gingrich started a number of for-profit companies:&lt;ref name=&quot;house&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The house that Newt built |work=The Washington Post |date=November 26, 2011 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-house-that-newt-built/2011/11/26/gIQAqxpazN_graphic.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001 and 2010, the companies he and his wife owned in full or part had revenues of almost $100 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/newt-gingrich-and-how-he-got-rich/2011/11/21/gIQAftOglN_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop |author=Karen Tumulty and Dan Eggen|date=November 26, 2011 |title=Newt Gingrich Inc.: How the GOP hopeful went from political flameout to fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to financial disclosure forms released in July 2011, Gingrich and his wife had a net worth of at least $6.7 million in 2010, compared to a maximum net worth of $2.4 million in 2006. Most of the increase in his net worth was because of payments to him from his for-profit companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;net worth&quot;/&gt;

====Gingrich Group and the Center for Health Transformation====
The Gingrich Group was organized in 1999 as a consulting company. Over time, its non-health clients were dropped, and it was renamed the [[Center for Health Transformation]]. The two companies had revenues of $55 million between 2001 and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;$55 million&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Bloomberg |date=November 22, 2011 |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LV1JSD6K50YD01-3AAFC4U13OJKS56R4Q4KOVLVDN |title=Gingrich Health Center and Consulting Group Paid $55 Million }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revenues came from more than 300 health-insurance companies and other clients, with membership costing as much as $200,000 per year in exchange for access to Gingrich and other perks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=November 18, 2011 |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2011/11/18/WP-Gingrich-Think-Tank-Collected-37-million-from-Health-Care-Industry.aspx#page1 |title=Gingrich Think Tank Collected $37M from Health-Care Industry|author=Dan Eggen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inc&quot;/&gt; In 2011, when Gingrich became a presidential candidate, he sold his interest in the business and said he would release the full list of his clients and the amounts he was paid, &quot;to the extent we can&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;small business&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;$55 million&quot;/&gt; In April 2012, the Center for Health Transformation filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chatper 7 bankruptcy]], planning to liquidate its assets to meet debts of $1–$10 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-bankruptcy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Atlanta Business Chronicle]] | title = Newt Gingrich health care think tank files bankruptcy | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2012/04/05/newt-gingrich-think-tank-files.html | first = Dave | last = Williams | date = April 5, 2012 | accessdate = April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-bankruptcy&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times | date = April 5, 2012 | accessdate = April 5, 2012 | first = Gerry | last = Mullany | coauthors = Mike McIntire | title = Former Gingrich Consultancy Files for Bankruptcy | url = http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/former-gingrich-consultancy-files-for-bankruptcy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2010, Gingrich consulted for [[Freddie Mac]], a [[Government-sponsored enterprise|government-sponsored]] secondary home mortgage company, which was concerned about new regulations under consideration by Congress. Regarding payments of $1.6 million for the consulting,&lt;ref name=&quot;$55 million&quot;/&gt; Gingrich said that &quot;Freddie Mac paid Gingrich Group, which has a number of employees and a number of offices a consulting fee, just like you would pay any other consulting firm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;distances&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MSNBC |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/11/19/8900367-gingrich-distances-self-from-freddie-mac |date=November 19, 2011 |title=Gingrich distances self from Freddie Mac |author=Jo Ling Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, he said that he could not make public his contract with Freddie Mac, even though the company gave permission, until his business partners in the Center for Health Transformation also agreed to that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Bloomberg |title=Gingrich Leaves Freddie Contract Release to Partners |author=Clea Benson and Loraine Woellert |date= January 6, 2012 |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-06/freddie-mac-says-gingrich-is-welcome-to-release-his-contracts-as-adviser.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2007, Gingrich expressed interest in running for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Gingrich May Run in 2008 if No Frontrunner Emerges| work=The Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901444.html| first=Juliet| last=Eilperin|date=June 10, 2006|accessdate=August 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 13, 2005, Gingrich suggested he was considering a run for president, saying, &quot;There are circumstances where I will run&quot;, elaborating that those circumstances would be if no other candidate champions some of the platform ideas he advocates. On September 28, 2007, Gingrich announced that if his supporters pledged $30&amp;nbsp;million to his campaign by October 21, he would seek the nomination.

However, insisting that he had &quot;pretty strongly&quot; considered running,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The rise of Newt-world| work=[[politico (newspaper)|politico]]|url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16717.html|last=Libit|first=Daniel|date=December 21, 2008|accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 29 spokesman Rick Tyler said that Gingrich would not seek the presidency in 2008 because he could not continue to serve as chairman of American Solutions if he did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Gingrich says he won't run for president| work=[[The Seattle Times]]|url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003913741_nonewt30.html|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing campaign finance law restrictions (the [[McCain-Feingold]] campaign law would have forced him to leave his American Solutions political organization if he declared his candidacy), Gingrich said, &quot;I wasn't prepared to abandon American Solutions, even to explore whether a campaign was realistic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Gingrich rules out presidential run| work=[[reuters]]|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN2923578620070930|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009 special election in New York's 23rd congressional district, Gingrich endorsed moderate Republican candidate [[Dede Scozzafava]], rather than [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative Party]] candidate [[Doug Hoffman]], who had been endorsed by several nationally prominent Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/10/newt_gingrich_endorses_dede_sc.html |title=Newt Gingrich endorses Dede Scozzafava in NY-23 House race |publisher=syracuse.com |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was heavily criticized for this endorsement, with conservatives questioning his candidacy for President in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malkin |first=Michelle |url=http://michellemalkin.com/2009/10/26/newt-for-2012-no-thanks/ |title=Newt for 2012?

===Presidential campaign, 2012===
{{main|Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012}}
In late 2008 several political commentators, including [[Marc Ambinder]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/huck.php &quot;So Why's Huck An Early '12 Frontrunner?&quot;] by Marc Ambinder, The Atlantic.com, Oct 2, 2008.

A July 2010 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling indicated that Gingrich was the leading GOP contender for the Republican nomination with 23% of likely Republican voters saying they would vote for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_National_716.pdf |title=Public Policy Polling|accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Newt Gingrich by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gingrich at a political conference in Orlando, September 2011]]
Describing his views as a possible candidate during an appearance on ''[[On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren|On the Record]]'' with [[Greta Van Susteren]] in March 2009, Gingrich said, &quot;I am very sad that a number of Republicans do not understand that this country is sick of [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]. [Americans] are sick of politicians taking care of themselves. They are sick of their money being spent in a way that is absolutely indefensible ... I think you're going to see a steady increase in the number of incumbents who have opponents because the American taxpayers are increasingly fed up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Newt Gingrich for President in 2012?|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,508628,00.html|last=Van Susteren|first=Greta|date=March 10, 2009|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2011, Gingrich officially announced a website entitled &quot;Newt Exploratory 2012&quot; in lieu of a formal [[exploratory committee]] for exploration of a potential presidential run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/03/03/gingrich-dips-toe-in-2012-waterswith-a-website/|title=Gingrich Dips Toe in 2012 Waters|last=King Jr.|first=Neil|date=March 3, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2011, Gingrich officially announced his intention to seek the GOP nomination in 2012.

On June 9, 2011, a group of Gingrich's senior campaign aides left the campaign en masse, leading to doubts about the viability of his presidential run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/gingrich-senior-campaign-staff-resigns/ |first1=Jeff |last1=Zeleny |first2=Trip |last2=Gabriel |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Gingrich senior campaign staff resigns |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 2011, two more senior aides left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gingrich Loses Members of Finance Team|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/gingrich-loses-members-of-finance-team/|date=June 21, 2011|first=Michael D.|last=Shear|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newt2012 News| url=http://www.newt.org/news |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Gingrich stated that he had not quit the race for the Republican nomination, and pointed to his experience running for 5 years to win his seat in Congress, spending 16 years helping to build a Republican majority in the house and working for decades to build a Republican majority in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Newt’s Still In| first = Lloyd| last = Grove| url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/07/22/newt-gingrich-still-running-for-president-in-2012.html| work = The Daily Beast| date = July 22, 2011| accessdate =August 8, 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/1312834686425365| archivedate = August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators noted Gingrich's resilience throughout his career, in particular with regards to his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside the Beltway |first=Jennifer |last=Harper |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/5/inside-the-beltway-607052627/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=July 5, 2011 |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Troubles aside, Gingrich shows confidence in campaign| first = Meghan| last = Malloy| url = http://iowaindependent.com/58359/troubles-aside-gingrich-shows-confidence-in-campaign| newspaper = Iowa Independent| date = July 12, 2011| accessdate =August 8, 2011|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/1312834680609890| archivedate = August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After then-front-runner [[Herman Cain]] was damaged by allegations of past [[sexual harassment]], Gingrich gained support, and quickly became a contender in the race, especially after Cain suspended his campaign. By December 4, 2011, Gingrich was leading in the national polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iadRlJ45WWnO0flE_EZ86dD104bg?docId=CNG.8f17da86e52ecbcd28cd3a3c9304ac70.1c1 |title=Gingrich takes Republican lead in presidential race |publisher=Google |date=December 4, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after an abundance of negative ads run by his opponents throughout December, Gingrich's national polling lead had fallen to a tie with [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;Montopoli, Brian.

On January 3, 2012, Gingrich finished in fourth place in the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|Iowa Republican caucuses]], far behind [[Rick Santorum]], Romney, and [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref name=iowaresults&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/primaries/state/ia?hpt=hp_pc1 CNN Election Center – Iowa], CNN.

After the field narrowed with the withdrawal from the race of Huntsman and [[Rick Perry]], Gingrich won the [[South Carolina]] [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2012|Republican primary]] on January 21, obtaining about 40% of the vote, considerably ahead of Romney, Santorum and Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Huma (January 21, 2012).

[[ABC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; This surprise victory allowed Gingrich to reemerge as the frontrunner once again heading into Florida.

On January 31, 2012, Gingrich placed second in the [[Florida Republican primary, 2012|Republican Florida primary]], losing by a fifteen percentage point margin, 47% to 32%. Some factors that contributed to this outcome include two strong debate performances by Romney (which were typically Gingrich's strong suit), the wide margin by which the Gingrich campaign was outspent in television ads,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/28/mitt-romney-florida-primary-newt-gingrich-super-pac_n_1239002.html |work=Huffington Post | first=Paul | last=Blumenthal | title=How Money Helped Romney's Florida Comeback | date=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a widely-criticized proposal by Gingrich to have a permanent colony on the moon by 2020 to reinvigorate the American Space Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/science/space/for-a-moon-colony-technology-is-the-easy-part.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | title=For a Moon Colony, Technology Is the Easy Part | date=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that Mitt Romney had hired a debate coach to help him perform better in the Florida debates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wset.com/story/16619489/romneys-new-debate-coach&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72433.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich did, however, significantly outvote Santorum and Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Montopoli, Brian (January 31, 2012).

On February 7, 2012, Gingrich came in last place in the [[Minnesota Republican caucuses, 2012|Minnesota Republican caucuses]] with about 10.7% of the vote.

On [[Super Tuesday]] Gingrich won his home state, Georgia, which has the most delegates, in &quot;an otherwise dismal night for him&quot;. Santorum took Tennessee and Oklahoma, where Gingrich had previously performed well in the polls, though Gingrich managed a statistical second place showing in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newt SUPER TUESDAY&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harnden|first=Toby|title=Mitt Romney fails to deliver knockout punch feels 'pretty darn good' after six wins on 'Super Tuesday'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2111287/Super-Tuesday-2012-results-Mitt-Romney-wins-Ohio-doubts-remain-weak-frontrunner-status.html|work=Daily Mail |location=London|accessdate=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gingrich is most widely identified with the 1994 [[Contract with America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2011/0511/Election-101-Ten-questions-about-Newt-Gingrich-as-a-presidential-candidate/What-does-he-have-going-for-him |title=Election 101: Ten questions about Newt Gingrich as a presidential candidate (3.

He favors a strong immigration border policy and a guest worker program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Winning the Future |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=2006 |publisher=Regnery |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-59698-007-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] mandate for cars sold in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;[[Jonathan H.

In 2007, Gingrich authored a book, ''[[Rediscovering God in America]]'', arguing that the [[Founding Fathers]] actively intended the new republic to not only allow, but encourage, religious expression in the public square. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Following publication of the book, he was invited by [[Jerry Falwell]] to be the speaker for the second time at Liberty University's graduation, on May 19, 2007, due to Gingrich having, &quot;dedicated much of his time to calling [the United States of] America back to our Christian heritage&quot;.&lt;ref name=newsmaxfalwell&gt;Falwell, Jerry.

Gingrich's later books take a large-scale policy focus, including ''Winning the Future'', and the most recent, ''[[To Save America]]''. Gingrich has identified education as &quot;the number one factor in our future prosperity&quot;, and has partnered with [[Al Sharpton]] and Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] on education issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33931557/ns/meet_the_press/ |title=Meet the Press Transcript |first=David |last=Gregory |date=November 15, 2009 |work=Meet the Press |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
