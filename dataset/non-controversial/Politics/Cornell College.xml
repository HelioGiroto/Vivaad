'''Cornell College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]]. Originally called the Iowa Conference Seminary, the school was founded in 1853 by Reverend Samuel M. Fellows. Four years later, in 1857, the name was changed to Cornell College, in honor of iron tycoon William Wesley Cornell, who was a distant relative of [[Ezra Cornell]] (founder of [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]).

==Overview==
Cornell students study ''one course at a time'' (commonly referred to as &quot;the block plan&quot; or &quot;OCAAT&quot;). Since 1978, school years have been divided into nine &quot;blocks&quot; of three-and-a-half weeks each (usually followed by a four-day &quot;block break&quot; to round out to four weeks), during which students are enrolled in a single class; what would normally be covered in a full semester's worth of class at a typical university is covered in just seventeen-and-one-half Cornell class days.  While schedules vary from class to class, most courses consist of around 30 hours of lecture, along with additional time spent in the laboratory, studying audio-visual media, or other activities. [[Colorado College]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; [[Quest University]] in Squamish, British Columbia; [[Tusculum College]] in [[Tusculum, Tennessee]]; and [[University of Montana - Western|The University of Montana - Western]] are the only other colleges operating under this academic calendar. Beginning academic year 2012–2013, Cornell will be changing to an eight block calendar. 

From its inception, Cornell has accepted women into all degree programs. In 1858, Cornell was host to Iowa's first female recipient of a baccalaureate degree, Mary Fellows, a member of the first graduating class from Cornell College. She received a bachelor's degree in mathematics. In 1871, Harriette J. Cooke became the first female college professor in the United States to become a full professor with a salary equal to that of her male colleagues.

==Campus buildings==
The most widely recognizable building on Cornell's campus is King Chapel.  The chapel is the site of the annual convocation at the commencement of the school year as well as the baccalaureate service in the spring for graduating students.  The chapel contains a large organ (over 3000 pipes) and is often the site of musical performances.  No classes are held in the chapel, and religious services are held in the nearby Allee Chapel.

Old Sem, for a short while the only building of the original college, now houses administrative offices of the college.

Cornell contains 9 academic buildings.  College Hall (also sometimes called &quot;Old Main&quot;), the second-oldest building of the college, houses classrooms and offices of several social science and humanities departments.  South Hall, originally a male dormitory, houses the Politics and English Departments.  Prall House contains offices and classrooms of the Philosophy and Religion Departments.  The Merle West Science Center houses the Physics, Biology, and Chemistry Departments.  West Science contains the school's only stadium seating lecture-style classroom, with a capacity around 100.  The Norton Geology Center contains both an extensive museum and classrooms for geological sciences.  Law Hall includes the Math, Computer Science, and Psychology Departments, and also is the computing hub of the campus.  McWethy Hall, formerly a gymnasium, was remodeled and now contains the studios and offices of the Art Department.  Armstrong Hall and Youngker Hall are adjoining fine arts buildings.  Armstrong Hall is the location of the Music Department, while Youngker Hall contains the Theatre Department, including Kimmel Theatre.  In addition, the Small Sport Center and the Lytle House contain classrooms of the Kinesiology Department.

Cole Library serves both the college and the Mount Vernon community.

Cornell has several residence halls. Pfeiffer Hall, Tarr Hall, and Dows Hall together form the &quot;Tri-Hall&quot; area. Tarr was once an all-male residence hall, but now houses both males and females. Dows is an all-female residence hall, and Pfeiffer is co-ed for all years. Pfeiffer was extensively renovated in 2008. Pauley-Rorem Hall is a combination of two residence halls that are joined in the middle by a common set of stairs. Until 2012-2013, female first-years resided in Pauley, and male first-years resided in Rorem. In the school year of 2012-2013, both residence halls became coed by floor. Olin Hall and Merner Hall are co-ed upper-class residence halls. New Hall and Russell Hall (formerly Clock Tower Hall) were opened in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and offer suite-style living. Students may choose more independent living options in apartments at 10th Avenue, Armstrong House, and Harlan House, and even at the Sleep Inn through an arrangement with Cornell. Nearly all Cornell students are required to live on-campus or in campus apartments, so most students do not rent non-college housing, and many students choose to live in the residence halls for all four years at Cornell.

The Cornell campus is centered around a modest hill, the feature noted in the moniker &quot;Hilltop Campus.&quot; Several campus buildings are grouped on the hilltop, while the athletic facilities and some residential buildings are located farther downhill on the campus's northwest side.

==Athletics==
Cornell College fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams, all of which compete in [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] sports. It is a member of the [[Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cornellrams.com/ Athletics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell has achieved its greatest success in [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]]. Cornell wrestlers have won eight individual national titles, and in 1947, the wrestling team won the NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] and [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] national championships. Sixty-Two Cornell wrestlers have been named NCAA All-Americans, and seven have been elected to the [[National Wrestling Hall of Fame]].  Seven wrestlers have also been in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cornellrams.com/sport/0/11.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Cornell team has also met with success recently. In 2011, the women's [[volleyball]] team captured the IIAC title and went on to take part in the national tournament for the first time in school history. 

After 15 years of playing in the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Cornell College will move to the [[Midwest Conference]] beginning in the 2012-13 academic year.

Twenty-five Cornell students have earned NCAA Postgraduate Scholarships, awarded annually to students in their final year of eligibility who excel both athletically and academically. Cornell ranks in the top 15 Division III colleges in recipients of this award.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Cornell's [[American football|football]] rivalry with [[Coe College]] dates to 1891, making it the oldest intercollegiate rivalry west of the Mississippi. Coe currently holds the lead in the series, 60-51-4.

Cornell's [[mascot]] is a [[ram (sheep)|Ram]].  In 1949 the Royal Purple, the school's yearbook, offered a $5 prize for someone who could come up with a new mascot to replace either the &quot;Purples&quot; or &quot;Hilltoppers.&quot;  A sophomore came up with the idea for the ram.

==Intercollegiate Mock Trial==
A very young program, having existed for only four years, the Cornell College [[Mock Trial]] team has been relatively successful, and is currently ranked 16th in the nation. Competing against over 700 teams in the nation including: Yale university, Princeton University, New York University and Washington and Lee University, the Cornell Mock Trial team finished sixth in the nation at the 2010 AMTA (American Mock Trial Association) Nationals.

The Cornell Team has seen success throughout the year seeing victories in Mac II hosted by Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, the Bluejay Invitational hosted by Creighton University, the Fantastic Flyer Invitational hosted by Lewis University in Oak Brook, Illinois, and St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota and the AMTA Opening Round Championship held in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Cornell Mockers have received numerous individual awards including two All-American attorney awards at the Gold Round National competition in April 2010.
