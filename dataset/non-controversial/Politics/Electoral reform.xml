{{Elections}}
'''Electoral reform''' is change in electoral systems to improve how public desires are expressed in election results. That can include reforms of:

*[[Voting system]]s, such as [[proportional representation]], a [[two-round system]] (runoff voting), [[instant-runoff voting]], Instant Round Robin Voting called [[Condorcet method|Condorcet Voting]], [[approval voting]], citizen [[initiative]]s and [[referendum]]s and [[recall election]]s.
*Vote-counting procedures
*Rules about political parties, typically changes to election laws
*Eligibility to vote
*How candidates and political parties are able to stand ([[nomination rules]]) and how they are able to get their names onto ballots ([[ballot access]])
*Electoral constituencies and election district borders
*[[Ballot]] design and [[voting equipment]]
*Scrutineering (election monitoring by candidates, political parties, etc.)
*Safety of voters and election workers
*Measures against bribery, coercion, and conflicts of interest
*Financing of candidates' and referendum campaigns
*Factors which affect the rate of voter participation ([[voter turnout]])

== Continuous change ==
There are many such movements globally, in almost all democratic countries, as part of the basic definition of a democracy is the right to change the rules. [[Political science]] is imperfect; electoral reforms seek to make politics work a bit better, a bit sooner. The solution to the problems of democracy tends to be &quot;more democracy.&quot; Electoral reform is a permanent feature of any healthy democracy.

The [[Electoral Reform Society]] is a political pressure group based in the United Kingdom, believed to be the oldest organisation concerned with electoral systems in the world. The Society advocates scrapping First Past the Post (FPTP) for all National and local elections arguing that the system is 'bad for voters, bad for government and bad for democracy'.

== Nation-building ==
In less democratic countries, elections are often demanded by dissidents; therefore the most basic electoral reform project such countries is to achieve a transfer of power to a democratically elected government with a minimum of bloodshed, e.g. in South Africa in 1994. This case highlights the complexity of such reform: such projects tend to require changes to national or other constitutions, and to alter balances of power. Electoral reforms are often politically painful.

== Role of United Nations ==
The [[United Nations]] Fair Elections Commission provides international observers to national elections that are likely to face challenges by the international community of nations, e.g., in 2001 in Yugoslavia, in 2002 in Zimbabwe.

The United Nations standards address safety of citizens, coercion, scrutiny, and eligibility to vote. They do not impose ballot styles, party diversity, or borders on electoral constituencies. Various global political movements, e.g., [[labour movement]]s, the [[Green party]], [[Islamism]], [[Zionism]], advocate various cultural, social, ecological means of setting borders that they consider &quot;objective&quot; or &quot;blessed&quot; in some other way. Contention over electoral constituency borders within or between nations and definitions of &quot;refugee&quot;, &quot;citizen&quot;, and &quot;right of return&quot; mark various global conflicts, including those in Israel/Palestine, Kashmir, the Congo, and Rwanda.

== Electoral borders ==
Redrawing of electoral constituency (or &quot;riding&quot; or &quot;district&quot;) borders should be conducted at regular intervals, or by statutory rules and definitions, if for no other reason than to eliminate [[Apportionment (politics)|malapportionment]] attributable to population movements. Some electoral reforms seek to fix these borders according to some cultural or ecological criterion, e.g., [[bioregionalism|bioregional]] democracy – which sets borders to fit exactly to [[ecoregion]]s – to avoid the obvious abuse of &quot;[[gerrymandering]]&quot; in which constituency borders are set deliberately to favor one party over another, or to improve management of the public's commonly owned property.

== National reforms ==
National electoral reform projects tend to be simpler and less focused on life-and-death matters.  Australia and [[electoral reform in New Zealand|New Zealand]] held Royal Commissions to find the best form of &quot;proportional representation&quot; of parties in the legislature and redesigned ballots to select or elect these Members of Parliament.

=== Australia ===
The Proportional Representation Society of Australia generally advocate [[single transferable vote]] and [[proportional representation]].

=== Canada ===
Several national and provincial organizations promote electoral reform, especially by advocating one form or another of proportional representation. The largest [[grassroots]] organization advocating electoral reform nationally is [[Fair Vote Canada]]. Several referendums to decide whether or not to adopt such reform have been held during provincial elections in the last decade; none has thus far resulted in a change from the plurality system currently in force. Controversially, the threshold for adoption of a new voting system has regularly been set at a &quot;supermajority&quot;, for example, 60% of ballots cast approving the proposed system in order for the change to be implemented.

=== New Zealand ===
[[Electoral reform in New Zealand]] began in 1986 with the report of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] entitled ''Towards A Better Democracy''.  The Royal Commission recommended that [[Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) be adopted instead of the current [[first-past-the-post]] system. After two referendums in 1992 and 1993, New Zealand adopted MMP.
In 2004, some local body elections in New Zealand were elected using single transferable vote instead of the [[Plurality-at-large voting|block vote]].

=== United Kingdom ===
*''For 19th century reforms, see [[The Reform Bills]]. Also the [[Reform Act 1832]], the [[Reform Act 1867]] and the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]].''

The United Kingdom has generally used first-past-the-post (FPTP) for many years, but there have been several attempts at reform. A 1910 Royal Commission on Electoral Systems recommended AV be adopted for the Commons.&lt;ref name=butler04&gt;[Butler D (2004). &quot;Electoral reform&quot;, ''Parliamentary Affairs'', '''57''': 734-43]&lt;/ref&gt; A very limited introduction of single transferable vote (STV) came in the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]]. A Speaker's Conference on electoral reform in January 1917 unanimously recommended a mix of AV and STV for elections to the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=butler04/&gt; However, in a vote that August, the Commons rejected STV by 32 votes in the committee stage of the Representation of the People Bill and, by 1 vote, substituted alternative vote (AV). The House of Lords then voted for STV, but the Commons insisted on AV. In a compromise, AV was abandoned and the Boundary Commission were asked to prepare a limited plan of STV to apply to 100 seats. This plan was then rejected by the Commons, although STV was introduced for the university constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;Butler DE (1953), &quot;The Electoral System in Britain 1918-1951&quot;, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 1921, a Private Member's Bill to introduce STV was rejected 211 votes to 112 by the Commons. A Liberal attempt to introduce an Alternative Vote Bill in March 1923 was defeated by 208 votes to 178. On 2 May 1924, another Private Member's Bill for STV was defeated 240 votes to 146 in the Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Butler DE (1953), &quot;The Electoral System in Britain 1918-1951&quot;, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1931, the minority Labour government, then supported by the Liberals, introduced a Representation of the People Bill that included switching to AV. The Bill passed its second reading in the Commons by 295 votes to 230 on 24 February 1931 and the clause introducing AV was passed in the committee stageby 277 to 253. (The Speaker had refused to allow discussion of STV.) The Bill's second reading in the Lords followed in June, with an amendment replacing AV with STV in 100 constituencies being abandoned as outwith the scope of the Bill. An amendment was passed (by 80 votes to 29) limiting AV to those constituencies in boroughs with populations over 200,000. The Bill received its third reading in the Lords on 21 July, but the Labour government fell in August and the Bill was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Butler DE (1953), &quot;The Electoral System in Britain 1918-1951&quot;, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections to the European Parliament in mainlaind Britain were originally under FPTP, but were switched to list PR following pressure to standardise with the rest of the EU.

When Labour re-gained power in 1997, they introduced a number of new assemblies, in London, Wales and Scotland, and opted for additional member systems of PR in all of these. They also adopted the [[supplementary vote]] system for directly-elected mayors. Within Scotland, a Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition in the new Scottish Parliament later introduced STV for local elections.  However, such reforms were not without their problems.  When 7% of votes (over 140,000) were discounted or spoilt in the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary and [[local council]] elections, [[Scottish First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] protested that 'the decision to conduct an STV election at the same time as a [[first-past-the-post]] ballot for the [[Scottish Parliament]] was deeply mistaken'&lt;ref&gt;Gallop, Nick in The Constitution and Constitutional Reform p.29 (Philip Allan, 2011) ISBN 978-0-340-98720-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2010 UK General Election]] campaign, the possibility of a [[hung parliament]] and the earlier expenses scandal pushed electoral reform up the agenda, something long supported by the Liberal Democrats. There were protests in favour of electoral reform organised by [[Take Back Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clegg-is-urged-to-abandon-deal-as-tories-rule-out-vote-reform-1969467.html |title=Clegg is urged to abandon deal as Tories rule out vote reform - UK Politics, UK |publisher=The Independent |date= 9 May 2010|accessdate=2010-05-09 | location=London | first1=Jane | last1=Merrick | first2=Brian | last2=Brady | first3=Jonathan | last3=Owen | first4=Lewis | last4=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a move to a largely elected Lords. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government held a [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|referendum]] on introducing AV for the Commons on 5 May 2011, which was defeated.

There are a number of groups in the [[United Kingdom]] campaigning for electoral reform including the [[Electoral Reform Society]], Make Votes Count Coalition and [[Fairshare]].

=== United States ===
{{main|Electoral reform in the United States}}
In 2002 the United States enacted the [[Help America Vote Act]] significantly reforming its electoral process. Electoral reform is a continuing process in the United States motivated by the fear of both [[electoral fraud]] and [[disfranchisement]].
