{{Liberalism sidebar}}

'''Liberalism in the United States''' is a broad political philosophy centered on the [[unalienable rights]] of the individual. The fundamental [[liberalism|liberal]] ideals of [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of religion]] for all belief systems, and the [[separation of church and state]], right to [[due process]] and [[equality under the law]] are widely accepted as a common foundation across the spectrum of liberal thought.  The main focus of [[modern liberalism in the United States]] includes issues such as [[voting rights]] for all adult citizens, [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[environmental justice|protection of the environment]], and the provision by the government of [[social services]], such as: equal education opportunities, access to health care, transportation infrastructure, basic food for the hungry and basic shelter for the homeless.  Some American liberals, who call themselves [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberals]], or [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], support fundamental liberal ideals but disagree with modern liberal thought, holding that [[economic freedom]] is more important than equality of opportunity, and that promoting the [[social welfare provision|general welfare]] of society exceeds the legitimate role of government.&lt;ref&gt;Pena, David S. ''Economic Barbarism and Managerialism,'' 2001, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Without a qualifier, the term &quot;liberalism&quot; since the 1930s in the United States usually refers to &quot;modern liberalism&quot;, a political philosophy exemplified by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and, later, [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]].  It is a form of [[social liberalism]], whose accomplishments include the [[Works Progress Administration]] and the [[Social Security Act]] in 1935, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

According to [[Louis Hartz]], liberalism in the United States differs from [[Liberalism worldwide|liberalism elsewhere in the world]] because America never had a resident hereditary [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]],&lt;ref&gt;Louis Hartz, ''The Liberal Tradition in America'', (1991) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and so avoided the worst of the class warfare that swept Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans&quot;, [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], in ''The Politics of Hope'', (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|American Enlightenment}}

The origins of American liberalism lie in [[Age of Enlightenment|the political ideals of The Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bryan-Paul Frost|author2=Jeffrey Sikkenga|title=History of American Political Thought|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w81L1qAhNjoC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Constitution of the United States]] of 1787 set up the first modern [[Republicanism in the United States|republic]], with sovereignty in the people (not in a monarch) and no hereditary ruling aristocracy.  However, the Constitution limited liberty by accepting slavery. The [[Founding Fathers]] recognized the contradiction, and most expected slavery to wither away. Indeed it was abolished in all the Northern states by 1804, but due to the demand for raw cotton by the [[Industrial Revolution]], plantation slavery continued to flourish in the Deep South.

From the time of the Revolution to the present day, America has  extended liberty to ever broader classes of people.  The states abolished restrictions on voting in the early 19th century. The Constitution was amended in 1865 to abolish slavery, in 1870 to extend the vote to Black men, in 1920 to extend the vote to women, and in 1971 to lower the voting age to 18.  The [[Jim Crow]] system of the South between the 1890s and 1960s relegated blacks to second class citizenship, until it was overthrown by the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and new federal laws in 1964 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Fernbach and Charles Julian Bishko, ''Charting democracy in America'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Jefferson believed that America should remain a nation of small farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: from Jefferson to Clinton?'' (1995) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  As America became more and more a nation of businessmen, liberals began to fear threats to liberty from corruption and monopolies (called &quot;trusts&quot; at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Sandel, ''Democracy's Discontent: America in Search of a Public Philosophy'' (1996) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few—especially in the new fast-growing cities—raised questions whether political democracy could survive the power of the rich.

The dominance of the Republican Party for most of the era 1860-1932, the [[Third Party System]], and the [[Fourth Party System]], prevented any major reversal of the [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]].  During the [[Progressive Era]] of the early 20th century, laws were passed restricting monopolies (the antitrust movement) and regulating railroad rates.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Buenker, John C. Burnham, and Robert M. Crunden, ''Progressivism'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, &quot;Democracy, Republicanism and Efficiency: The Values of American Politics, 1885-1930,&quot; in Byron Shafer and Anthony Badger, eds, ''Contesting Democracy: Substance and Structure in American Political History, 1775-2000'' (2001) pp 149–180&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1933, modern liberals used the [[New Deal]] to provide jobs during the [[Great Depression]].  The [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security act of 1935]] provided retirement and disability income for Americans unable to work or unable to find jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M. Mileur, ''The New Deal and the triumph of liberalism'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Social Security Act of 1965]], this was extended to provide benefits for Americans unable to work due to illness.

In the 1960s, liberals fought for the rights of blacks and women, and for protection of the environment. They split on the issue of the Vietnam War.

A reaction against modern American liberalism began with Barry Goldwater, which led to the eventual election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. The intellectual foundations of this conservative resurgence included the works of free-market economists [[Milton Friedman]] and the  [[Chicago School of Economics]], who argued against central economic planning (with the notable exception of the Federal Reserve), regulation of business, and Keynesian economics.  Deregulation began in the mid-1970s and had broad support from both liberals and conservatives.  Reagan successfully lowered marginal tax rates, most notably for those at the top of the income distribution, while his Social Security reforms raised taxes on the middle and bottom of the income distribution, leaving their total tax burden unchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt, David (13 April 2010). Taxing the Rich, Over Time ''The New York Times''.&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/taxing-the-rich-over-time/|title=Leonhardt, David (13 April 2010) Taxing the Rich, Over Time ''The New York Times''|accessdate=2012-04-08 | date=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic president [[Bill Clinton]] (1993–2001) worked with conservatives, against strong liberal opposition, to end some of the main welfare programs and to implement [[NAFTA]], linking the economies of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Clinton pushed to extend modern liberal ideals especially in the areas of health care (where he failed) and environmental protection (where he had more success).&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, ''The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974-2008'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Louis Hartz]], liberalism was the only significant political tradition in the United States.  However in the 1970s, [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] and [[J. G. A. Pocock]] saw [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] as the main political tradition.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}  In the 1980s, J. David Green returned to Hartz's thesis, but saw two different types of liberalism in the tradition, which he called ''humanist'' and ''reform''.  More recently, writers have seen a multitude of traditions, including liberalism, republicanism and Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Ericson and Green, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=May 2011}}{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}

==Varieties of liberalism==
{{Main|Liberalism}}

===Early Liberalism===
{{Main|American Enlightenment}}
{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2010}}
The United States of America was the first country to be founded on the liberal ideas of [[John Locke]] and other philosophers of the Enlightenment, with no monarchy, no hereditary aristocracy, and no established religion.  The American [[Bill of Rights]] guarantees every citizen the freedoms advocated by the liberal philosophers: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to gather in peaceful assembly, the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, and the right to bear arms, among other freedoms and rights.  In this sense, virtually all Americans are liberals.  However, questions arose, both before and after the country was founded.  In the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1856-57, the Supreme Court ruled that these rights only applied to White men, and that Blacks had no rights whatsoever that any White man was obliged to respect.  Therefore the constitution was amended several times to extend these rights to ever larger classes of citizens, to all citizens in 1868, then specifically to Blacks in 1870, to women in 1919, and to people unable to afford a poll tax in 1964.

===Classical liberalism===
{{Main|Classical Liberalism}}

[[Classical liberalism]] in the United States (also called ''laissez-faire liberalism''&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, Ian, ''Political Ideology Today'' (2002), Manchester University Press, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;) is the belief that a free market economy is the most productive.  It may be represented by [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s statement &quot;that government is best which governs least.&quot;  Classical liberalism is a philosophy of individualism and self-responsibility.  Classical liberals in the United States believe that if the economy is left to the natural forces of supply and demand, free of government intervention, the result is the most abundant satisfaction of human wants.  Modern classical liberals oppose the concepts of [[social democracy]] and the [[welfare state]].

===Modern liberalism===
{{Main|Modern liberalism in the United States}}
{{Progressivism}}
In 1883 [[Lester Frank Ward]] (1841–1913) published ''Dynamic Sociology: Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences'' and laid out the basic tenets of modern American liberalism while at the same time attacking the laissez-faire policies advocated by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Steele Commager, ed., ''Lester Ward and the Welfare State'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was a passionate advocate for a sociology which would intelligently and scientifically direct the development of society.&lt;ref&gt;on Ward and Sumner see Charlotte G. O'Kelley,  and John W. Petras, &quot;Images of Man in Early American Sociology. Part 2: The Changing Concept of Social Reform,&quot; ''Journal of the History of ohe Behavioral Sciences'' 1970 6(4): 317-334&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential thinker in the [[Progressive Era]] was [[Herbert Croly]] (1869 &amp;ndash; 1930). He effectively combined classical liberal theory with [[progressivism|progressive]] philosophy and founded the periodical ''[[The New Republic]]'' to present his ideas. Croly presented the case for a [[mixed economy]], increased spending on education, and the creation of a society based on the &quot;brotherhood of mankind.&quot; In 1909, Croly published ''[[The Promise of American Life]]'', in which he proposed raising the general standard of living by means of economic planning, though he opposed aggressive unionization.&lt;ref&gt;Byron Dexter, &quot;Herbert Croly and the Promise of American Life,&quot; ''Political Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 70, No. 2 (June 1955), pp. 197-218 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2145222 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Techniques of Democracy]]'' (1915) he argued against both dogmatic individualism and dogmatic socialism.  As editor of the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'', Croly had the forum to reach the intellectual community.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Levy, ''Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Liberalism wagers that a state... can be strong but constrained – strong because constrained... Rights to education and other requirements for human development and security aim to advance the opportunity and personal dignity of minorities and to promote a creative and productive society. To guarantee those rights, liberals have supported a wider social and economic role for the state, counterbalanced by more robust guarantees of civil liberties and a wider social system of checks and balances anchored in an independent press and pluralistic society. - Paul Starr, sociologist at Princeton University, The New Republic, March 2007}}

==Changes in liberalism in the United States==
{{Main|Modern liberalism in the United States}}

===The New Deal===
President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1882 &amp;ndash; 1945), came to office in 1933 amid the economic calamity of the [[Great Depression]], offering the nation a [[New Deal]] intended to alleviate economic want and joblessness, provide greater opportunities, and restore prosperity.  His presidency from 1933 to 1945, the longest in U.S. history, was marked by an increased role for the Federal government in addressing the nation's economic and other problems.  [[Work relief program]]s provided jobs, ambitious projects such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] were created to promote economic development, and a [[Social security]] system was established. The Great Depression dragged on through the 1930s, however, despite the New Deal programs, which met with mixed success in solving the nation's economic problems. Economic progress for minorities was hindered by discrimination, about which the Roosevelt administration did less than subsequent administrations, but more than had been done before. The New Deal provided direct relief for minorities in the 1930s (through the [[Works Progress Administration]], [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and other agencies); and, during World War II, executive orders and the [[Fair Employment Practices Commission|FEPC]] opened millions of new jobs to minorities and forbade discrimination in companies with government contracts. The 1.5 million black veterans in 1945 were fully entitled to generous veteran benefits from the [[GI Bill]] on the same basis as everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Black, ''Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Deal consisted of three types of programs designed to produce &quot;Relief, Recovery and Reform&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Sitkoff, ed. ''Fifty Years Later: The New Deal Evaluated'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relief''' was the immediate effort to help the one-third of the population that was hardest hit by the depression. Roosevelt expanded Hoover's FERA work relief program, and added the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), and starting in 1935 the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). In 1935 the [[Social Security Act]] (SSA) and [[unemployment benefit#United States|unemployment insurance]] programs were added. Separate programs were set up for relief in rural areas, such as the [[Resettlement Administration]] and [[Farm Security Administration]].

'''Recovery''' was the goal of restoring the economy to pre-depression levels. It involved &quot;pump priming&quot; (deficit spending), dropping the [[gold standard]], efforts to re-inflate farm prices that were too low, and efforts to increase [[foreign trade]].  New Deal efforts to help corporate America were chiefly channeled through a Hoover program, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).

'''Reform''' was based on the assumption that the depression was caused by the inherent instability of the market and that government intervention was necessary to rationalize and stabilize the economy, and to balance the interests of farmers, business and labor. Reform measures included the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA), regulation of Wall Street by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|Securities Exchange Act]] (SEA), the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) for farm programs, [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) insurance for bank deposits enacted through the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] of 1933, and the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA) (also known as the Wagner Act) dealing with labor-management relations. Despite urgings by some New Dealers, there was no major anti-trust program. Roosevelt opposed [[socialism]] (in the sense of state ownership of the means of production), and only one major program, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), involved government ownership of the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

In international affairs, Roosevelt's presidency was dominated by isolationism until 1938, followed by an increasingly central role in [[World War II]], especially after America's formal entry into the war in 1941. Anticipating the post-war period, Roosevelt strongly supported proposals to create a [[United Nations]] organization as a means of encouraging mutual cooperation to solve problems on the international stage. His commitment to internationalist ideals  was in the tradition of [[Woodrow Wilson]], architect of the failed [[League of Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raabcollection.com/detail.aspx?cat=2&amp;subcat=38&amp;man=261 |title=Franklin Roosevelt Autographs - Presidential |publisher=Raab Collection |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to his support for the establishment of the [[United Nations]], with the proviso that the U.S. would have a veto power.&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo Hamby, ''For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom 1940-1945'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism during the Cold War===
U.S. liberalism of the [[Cold War]] era was the immediate heir to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and the slightly more distant heir to the [[Progressive Era|Progressives]] of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol Stern]] wrote, &quot;Cold War liberalism deserves credit for the greatest American achievement since [[World War II]] &amp;mdash; winning the Cold War.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Sol (Winter, 2010) [http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_1_ramparts.html &quot;The Ramparts I Watched.&quot;] ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential tenets of Cold War liberalism can be found in Roosevelt's [[Four Freedoms]] (1941): of these, [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion|of religion]] were classic liberal freedoms, as was &quot;freedom from fear&quot; (freedom from tyrannical government), but &quot;freedom from want&quot; was another matter. Roosevelt proposed a notion of freedom that went beyond government non-interference in private lives. &quot;Freedom from want&quot; could justify positive government action to meet economic needs, a concept more associated with the concepts of Lincoln's Republican party, Clay's Whig Party, and Hamilton's economic principles of government intervention and subsidy than the more radical [[socialism]] and [[social democracy]] of European thinkers or with prior versions of classical liberalism as represented by Jefferson's Democratic-Republican and Jackson's Democratic party.

In the 1950s and 1960s, both major U.S. political parties included liberal and conservative factions. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] had two wings: on the one hand, Northern and Western liberals, on the other generally conservative Southern [[whites]]. Difficult to classify were the northern [[urban area|urban]] Democratic &quot;[[political machine]]s&quot;. The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but would slowly come apart over racial issues. Some historians have divided the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] into liberal [[Wall Street]] and conservative [[Main street|Main Street]] factions; others have noted that the GOP's conservatives came from landlocked states (Robert Taft of Ohio and Barry Goldwater of Arizona) and the liberals tended to come from California (Earl Warren and Paul N. &quot;Pete&quot; McCloskey), New York ([[Nelson Rockefeller]]), and other coastal states.

Opposing both [[communism]] and conservatism, Cold War liberalism resembled earlier &quot;liberalisms&quot; in its views on many social issues and personal liberty, but its economic views were not those of [[free market|free-market]] Jeffersonian liberalism nor those of European social democrats.  They never endorsed state socialism, but did call for spending on education, science, and infrastructure, notably the expansion of [[NASA]] and the construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]].  Their progressive ideas continued the legacy of Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Most prominent and constant among the positions of Cold War liberalism were:
* Support for a domestic economy built on a balance of power between labor (in the form of organized [[trade union|unions]]) and management (with a tendency to be more interested in large corporations than in [[small business]]).
* A foreign policy focused on containing the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies, one factor leading to its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] at the end of 1991.
* The continuation and expansion of New Deal social welfare programs (in the broad sense of welfare, including programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]).
* An embrace of [[Keynesian economics]]. By way of compromise with political groupings to their right, this often became, in practice [[military Keynesianism]].

At first liberals generally did not see FDR's successor [[Harry S. Truman]] as one of their own, viewing him as a Democratic Party hack. However, liberal politicians and liberal organizations such as the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) sided with Truman in opposing communism both at home and abroad, sometimes at the sacrifice of [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hubert Humphrey]], for example, in 1950 put before the Senate a bill to establish detention centers where those declared subversive by the [[President of the United States|President]] could be held without trial.  It did not pass.

Liberals were united in their opposition to [[McCarthyism]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Fried, ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The liberal consensus===
{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2010}}
By 1950, the liberal ideology was so intellectually dominant that the literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]] could write that &quot;liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition... there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in circulation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bloom, ''Prodigal sons: the New York intellectuals &amp; their world'' (1986) P. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost two decades, Cold War liberalism remained the dominant paradigm in U.S. politics, peaking with the landslide victory of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] over [[Barry Goldwater]] in the 1964 presidential election. Lyndon Johnson had been a New Deal Democrat in the 1930s and by the 1950s had decided that the Democratic Party had to break from its segregationist past and endorse racial liberalism as well as economic liberalism.  In the face of the disastrous defeat of Goldwater, the Republicans accepted more than a few of Johnson's ideas as their own, so to a very real extent, the policies of President Johnson became the policies of the Republican administrations of [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[Gerald R. Ford]].

===Liberals and civil rights===
Cold War liberalism emerged at a time when most [[African American]]s were politically and economically disenfranchised.  Beginning with ''To Secure These Rights'', an official report issued by the Truman White House in 1947, self-proclaimed liberals increasingly embraced the civil rights movement.  In 1948, President Truman desegregated the armed forces and the Democrats inserted a strong civil rights plank in the party platform, even though delegates from the Deep South walked out, and nominated a third party ticket, called Dixiecrat, headed by [[Strom Thurmond]].  Truman abolished discrimination in the Armed Forces, which led to the integration of military units in the early 1950s.  However, no civil rights legislation was passed until a weak bill was passed in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974'' (1996) pp 148=64, 413&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, relations between white liberals and the civil rights movement became increasingly strained; civil rights leaders accused liberal politicians of temporizing and procrastinating, although they realize they needed the support of Northern lights to pass any legislation over Southern obstructionism. The white liberals believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would only anger many Southern whites and make it even more difficult to pass civil rights laws through Congress. Thereafter, in response to that concern, civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] agreed to tone down the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963. Kennedy finally endorsed the March on Washington, and proposed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], but he could not get it passed during his lifetime. [[Lyndon Johnson]], who took office in November 1963, used the image of Kennedy's martyrdom to mobilize northern support, along with the black leadership community, to pass major civil rights legislation, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The result was an end to segregation, and an end to restrictions on black voting, but also a wave of black riots in the inner cities, but made for &quot;long hot summers&quot; in every major city from 1964 through 1970.  The riots alienated much of the white working class, that had been the base of the labor union element in the civil rights coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974'' pp 542-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil rights movement itself was becoming fractured. On 8 March 1964, [[Malcolm X]] stated he was going to organize a [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] organization that would try to &quot;heighten the political consciousness&quot; of African Americans.&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D17FB395415738DDDA00894DB405B848AF1D3 |title=Malcolm X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Handler |first=M. S. |date=March 9, 1964 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, a [[Black Power]] movement had emerged; Black Power advocates accused white liberals of trying to control the civil rights agenda.  Proponents of Black Power wanted African-Americans to follow an &quot;ethnic model&quot; for obtaining power, not unlike that of Democratic political machines in large cities.  This put them on a collision course with urban machine politicians.  And, on its edges, the Black Power movement contained racial separatists who wanted to give up on integration altogether &amp;mdash; a program that could not be endorsed by American liberals of any race.  The mere existence of such individuals (who always got more media attention than their actual numbers might have warranted) contributed to &quot;white backlash&quot; against liberals and civil rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974'' pp 550-55, 652-668&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleoliberalism===
{{Main|Paleoliberalism}}
{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2010}}
As the civil rights and [[anti-war]] protesters of the late 1960s and early 1970s began to organize into a recognizable school of thought known as the [[New Left]], many &quot;anti-Soviet liberals and social democrats in the tradition of Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Humphrey and Henry (&quot;Scoop&quot;) Jackson… preferred to call themselves 'paleoliberals'&quot;, according to historian [[Michael Lind]].

Lind also notes that some of these people became ''[[neoconservatism|neoconservatives]]''. {{Ref||Lind}}, although paleoliberals such as [[Peter Beinart]] exist to this day.

===Liberals and Vietnam===
{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2010}}
While the civil rights movement isolated liberals from the working class and southern Democrats, the [[Vietnam War]] threw another wedge into the liberal ranks, dividing pro-war &quot;hawks&quot; such as Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] from &quot;doves&quot; such as Senator (and 1972 presidential candidate) [[George McGovern]]. As the war became the leading political issue of the day, agreement on domestic matters was not enough to hold the liberal consensus together.

Vietnam was part of the strategy of [[containment]] of Soviet Communism which began in ernest after WWII with the decesent of the so-called [[Iron Curtain]]. In the 1960 presidential campaign, the Kennedy was more hawkish on [[Southeast Asia]] than the Richard Nixon. Although it can be argued that the war expanded only under Johnson, there was much continuity of their [[United States Cabinet|cabinets]].

As opposition to the war grew, a large portion of that opposition came from within liberal ranks.  After Johnson refused to run again, assassination removed [[Robert Kennedy]] from contention and noted liberal [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Hubert Humphrey emerged from the disastrous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] with the presidential nomination of a deeply divided party. Much of the party's [[right-wing politics|right wing]] had seceded to run [[Alabama]] [[governor]] [[George Wallace]]. The result was a narrow victory for Republican Richard Nixon, a man who, although a [[California]] native, was largely regarded as from the old Northeast [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Establishment.  Nixon enacted many liberal policies, including the establishment of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], normalizing relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], and starting the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] to reduce the availability of [[ballistic missile]]s.

===Nixon and the liberal consensus===

{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2010}}
While the differences between Nixon and the liberals are obvious &amp;ndash; the liberal wing of his own party favored politicians like [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[William Scranton]], and Nixon overtly placed an emphasis on &quot;law and order&quot; over civil liberties, and [[Nixon's Enemies List]] was composed largely of liberals &amp;ndash; in some ways the continuity of many of Nixon's policies with those of the Kennedy-Johnson years is more remarkable than the differences. Pointing at this continuity, [[Noam Chomsky]] has called Nixon, &quot;in many respects the last liberal president.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noam Chomsky |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200006--.htm |title=The Colombia Plan: April 2000, by Noam Chomsky |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although liberals turned increasingly against the Vietnam War, to the point of running the very dovish [[George McGovern]] for President in 1972, the war had, as noted above, been of largely liberal origin. Similarly, while many liberals condemned actions such as the Nixon administrations support for the [[History of Chile#20th century|1973 Chilean coup]], it was not entirely dissimilar to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961 or the [[History of the Dominican Republic|marine landing in the Dominican Republic in 1965]].

The political dominance of the liberal consensus, even into the Nixon years, can best be seen in policies such as the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency or in Nixon's (failed) proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income by way of a [[negative income tax]]. [[Affirmative action]] in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. Even the Nixon &quot;[[War on Drugs]]&quot; allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican or Democrat.  Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] and his policy of ''détente'' with the Soviet Union were probably more popular with liberals than with his conservative base.

An opposing view, offered by [[Cass R. Sunstein]], in ''The Second Bill of Rights'' (Basic Books, 2004, ISBN 0-465-08332-3) argues that Nixon, through his [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] appointments, effectively ended a decades-long expansion under U.S. law of economic rights along the lines of those put forward in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

===American Liberalism, 1970 to the present day===
{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2010}}
During the Nixon years (and through the 1970s), the liberal consensus began to come apart. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough to make up for the loss of some Southern Democrats. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the U.S. and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it. Within the Democratic party leadership, there was a turn toward moderation after the defeat of liberal George McGovern in [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972]].

Meanwhile, in the Republican ranks, a new wing of the party emerged. The [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] Goldwater Republicans laid the groundwork for, and partially fed in to the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Republicans.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} In 1980, Ronald Reagan was the Republican party's Presidential nominee. More [[moderate|centrist]] groups such as the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) were on equal footing with liberals for control of the Democratic Party in this time. The centrist-liberal alliance of the federal level Democrats lasted through the 1980s, declined in the 1990s when more conservative political figures sided with the Republican party, and returned in the 2010s, when congress split almost totally along party lines.

It has been hypothesized that the election of the first African-American President [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 could bring liberalism to the mainstream of American political thought once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1858873,00.html | work=Time Magazine | title=The New Liberal Order | date=2008-11-13 | accessdate=2012-02-12 | first1=Peter | last1=Beinart}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Republicans have worked to prevent that.   In an interview in the National Journal, October 23, 2010, Senate Minority Learder Mitch McConnell stated: &quot;The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Journal, October 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics of American liberals==
While it is difficult to gather demographic information on ideological groups, recent surveys by the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] and [[CBS News]], between 18% and 27% of American adults identify as liberal, versus moderate or conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://documents.nytimes.com/new-york-times-cbs-news-poll-the-war-in-afghanistan#p=12 |title=New York Times/CBS News Poll: The War in Afghanistan |publisher=New York Times|date=2009-12-10|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], exit polls showed that 22% of the electorate self-identified as &quot;liberal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1 |title=Exit Polls Conducted by Edison Research Media |publisher=CNN |date=2008-11-04|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 study by the Pew Research Center, liberals were tied with the conservative sub-group, the &quot;Enterprisers&quot;, for the most affluent group, and were the ideological demographic with the highest rate of college education. Of those who identified as liberal, 49% were college graduates and 41% had household incomes exceeding $75,000, compared to 27% and 28% as the national average, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=945|title=Pew Research Center. (10 May 2005). Beyond Red vs. Blue.|accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism also remains the dominant political ideology in academia, with 72% of full-time faculty identifying as liberal in a 2004 study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurtz, H. (29 March 2005). College Faculties A Most Liberal Lot, Study Finds. ''The Washington Post''.&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8427-2005Mar28.html|title=Kurtz, H.

''The Washington Post''.|accessdate=2007-07-02 | date=2005-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] were most liberal, whereas business and engineering departments were the least liberal, though even in the business departments, liberals outnumbered conservatives 49% to 39%. Generally, the more educated a person is the more likely he or she is to hold liberal beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Bannon, B. R. (27 August 2003). In Defense of the 'Liberal' Professor. ''Indianapolis Star''.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegenews.org/x2782.xml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081120193155/http://www.collegenews.org/x2782.xml|archivedate=2008-11-20|title=O'Bannon, B. R. (27 August 2003). In Defense of the 'Liberal' Professor. ''Indianapolis Star''.|accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000, 2004 and 2006 elections, the vast majority of liberals voted in favor of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], though liberals may also show support for the [[Green Party (United States)|Greens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN.
