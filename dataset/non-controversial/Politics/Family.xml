{{Family law}}

In [[human]] context, a '''family''' (from {{lang-la|familia}}) is a [[Social group|group]] of [[people]] affiliated by [[consanguinity]], affinity, or co-residence. In most societies it is the principal institution for the socialization of children.  Anthropologists most generally classify family organization as [[Matrilocality|matrilocal]] (a mother and her children); conjugal (a wife, husband, and children, also called [[nuclear family]]); and [[consanguinity|consanguinal]] (also called an extended family) in which parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family.

There are also concepts of family that [[non-traditional family|break with tradition]] within particular societies, or those that are transplanted via migration to flourish or else cease within their new societies.{{clarify|date=July 2012}} As a unit of [[socialization]] the family is the object of analysis for [[sociology of the family|sociologists of the family]]. [[Genealogy]] is a field which aims to trace family lineages through history. In [[science]], the term &quot;family&quot; has come to be used as a means to [[Biological classification|classify groups]] of objects as being closely and exclusively related. In the study of [[animal]]s it has been found that many species form groups that have similarities to human &quot;family&quot;—often called &quot;[[pack (canine)|pack]]s.&quot;  Sexual relations among family members are regulated by rules concerning [[incest]] such as the [[incest taboo]].

Extended from the human &quot;family unit&quot; by [[affinity (sociology)|affinity]] and consanguinity are concepts of family that are physical and metaphorical, or that grow increasingly inclusive extending to [[community]], [[village]], [[city]], [[region]], [[nation]]hood, [[global village (term)|global village]] and [[humanism]].

==Procreation==
{{main|Family planning}}
One of the primary functions of the family is to produce and reproduce persons, biologically and/or socially. This can occur through the sharing of material substances (such as semen, and food); the giving and receiving of care and nurture ([[nurture kinship]]); jural ties of rights and obligations; and moral and sentimental ties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider p. 182&quot;&gt;Schneider, David 1984 A Critique of the Study of Kinship. Ann Arbor: [[University of Michigan Press]]. p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze-Guattari (1972). Part 2, ch. 3, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one's experience of one's family shifts over time. From the perspective of [[children]], the family is a &quot;family of orientation&quot;: the family serves to locate children socially and plays a major role in their [[enculturation]] and socialization.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Russon|Russon, John]], (2003) ''Human Experience: Philosophy, Neurosis, and the Elements of Everyday Life'', Albany: [[State University of New York Press]]. pp. 61–68.&lt;/ref&gt; From the point of view of the parent(s), the family is a &quot;family of procreation,&quot; the goal of which is to produce and enculturate and socialize children.&lt;ref&gt;George Peter Murdoch ''Social Structure'' p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; However, producing children is not the only function of the family; in societies with a sexual division of labor, [[marriage]], and the resulting relationship between two people, it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive [[household]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric. 1982 Europe and the People Without History. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harner, Michael 1975 &quot;Scarcity, the Factors of Production, and Social Evolution,&quot; in Population. Ecology, and Social Evolution, Steven Polgar, ed. Mouton Publishers: [[the Hague]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rivière, Peter 1987 &quot;Of Women, Men, and Manioc&quot;, Etnologiska Studien (38).&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;conjugal&quot; family includes only the husband, the wife, and unmarried children who are not of age. The most common form of this family is regularly referred to in [[sociology]] as a [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/anth370/gloss.html Oregonstate.edu], Nuclear family – &quot;A family group consisting of wife, husband (or one of these) and dependent children.&quot; – Definitions of Anthropological Terms – Anthropological Resources – (Court Smith) Department of Anthropology, [[Oregon State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;consanguineal&quot; family consists of a parent and his or her children, and other people. Although the concept of consanguinity originally referred to relations by &quot;blood,&quot; [[cultural anthropologist]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider p. 182&quot;/&gt; have argued that one must understand the idea of &quot;blood&quot; metaphorically and that many societies understand family through other concepts rather than through [[genetic distance]]. A &quot;matrilocal&quot; family consists of a [[mother]] and her children. Generally, these children are her biological offspring, although adoption of children is a practice in nearly every society. This kind of family is common where women have the resources to rear their children by themselves, or where men are more mobile than women.

==History of the family==
{{Main|History of the family}}
[[File:ValentinianIIIfamily.jpg|thumb|A group portrait of a mother, son and daughter on glass, [[Roman Empire]], c. 450 AD.]]
The diverse data coming from [[ethnography]], history, law and social statistics, establish that the human family is an institution and not a biological fact founded on the natural relationship of [[consanguinity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacan3801&quot;&gt;Lacan 1938–2001, pp. 24–25, 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FugierPascal226&quot;&gt;Fugier Pascal, 2007, p.226-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Early scholars of family history applied [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s biological [[theory of evolution]] in their theory of evolution of family systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Sociology/Founding the discipline |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2009-07-26 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551887/sociology/222961/Founding-the-discipline#ref=ref748622}}&lt;/ref&gt; American anthropologist [[Lewis H. Morgan]] published ''[[Ancient Society]]'' in 1877 based on his theory of the three stages of human progress from [[Primitive culture|Savagery]] through [[barbarian|Barbarism]] to [[Civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1877&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's book was the &quot;inspiration for [[Friedrich Engels]]' book&quot; ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' published in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Cultural Anthropology |accessdate= 2009-07-22 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/146165/cultural-anthropology/38786/Marxism-and-the-collectors#ref=ref423234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels expanded Morgan's hypothesis that economical factors caused the transformation of primitive community into a class-divided society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Marxists Internet Archive |accessdate=2009-07-17 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels' theory of [[resource]] control, and later that of [[Karl Marx]], was used to explain the cause and effect of change in family structure and function. The popularity of this theory was largely unmatched until the 1980s, when other sociological theories, most notably [[structural functionalism]], gained acceptance.

==Kinship terminology==
[[File:CousinTree kinship.svg|thumb|375px|Family tree showing the relationship of each person to the orange person. Cousins are colored green. The genetic kinship degree of relationship is marked in red boxes by percentage (%).]]
[[File:Mahrams Chart.png|thumb|600px|Family chart. Note that not all ''relatives'' are shown in the chart (specially at step-relatives).]]
{{Main|Kinship terminology}}
Anthropologist [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881) performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world. Although much of his work is now considered dated, he argued that [[kinship]] terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions. For example, most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between a child and a parent). Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and [[marriage]] (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than &quot;blood&quot;).

Morgan made a distinction between kinship systems that use ''classificatory'' terminology and those that use ''descriptive'' terminology. Classificatory systems are generally and erroneously understood to be those that &quot;class together&quot; with a single term relatives who actually do not have the same type of relationship to ego. (What defines &quot;same type of relationship&quot; under such definitions seems to be genealogical relationship. This is problematic given that any genealogical description, no matter how standardized, employs words originating in a folk understanding of kinship.) What Morgan's terminology actually differentiates are those (classificatory) kinship systems that do not distinguish lineal and collateral relationships and those (descriptive) kinship systems that do. Morgan, a lawyer, came to make this distinction in an effort to understand [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] inheritance practices. A Seneca man's effects were inherited by his sisters' children rather than by his own children.&lt;ref&gt;Tooker, Elisabeth. [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204%28197903%2920%3A1%3C131%3AAVOMOK%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E &quot;Another View of Morgan on Kinship.&quot;] ''Current Anthropology'' 20, no. 1 (March 1979): 131–134.&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan identified six basic patterns of kinship terminologies:
* [[Hawaiian kinship|Hawaiian]]: only distinguishes relatives based upon sex and generation.
* [[Sudanese kinship|Sudanese]]: no two relatives share the same term.
* [[Eskimo kinship|Eskimo]]: in addition to distinguishing relatives based upon sex and generation, also distinguishes between lineal relatives and collateral relatives.
* [[Iroquois kinship|Iroquois]]: in addition to sex and generation, also distinguishes between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation.
* [[Crow kinship|Crow]]: a matrilineal system with some features of an Iroquois system, but with a &quot;skewing&quot; feature in which generation is &quot;frozen&quot; for some relatives.
* [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]]: like a Crow system but patrilineal.

===Western kinship===
{{See also|Cousin chart}}
[[File:Georgische Familie.jpg|thumb|Georgian family of writer [[Vazha-Pshavela]] (in the middle, sitting)]]

Most Western societies employ [[Eskimo kinship]] terminology. This kinship terminology commonly occurs in societies based on [[conjugal family|conjugal]] (or [[nuclear family|nuclear]]) families, where nuclear families have a degree of relative mobility. Members of the nuclear use descriptive kinship terms:
* '''[[Mother]]''': a female parent
* '''[[Father]]''': a male parent
* '''[[Son]]''': a male child of the parent(s)
* '''[[Daughter]]''': a female child of the parent(s)
* '''[[Sibling|Brother]]''': a male child of the same parent(s)
* '''[[Sibling|Sister]]''': a female child of the same parent(s)
* '''[[Grandparent|Grandfather]]''': father of a father or mother
* '''[[Grandparent|Grandmother]]''': mother of a mother or father
* '''[[Cousin]]s''': two people that share the same [[grandparent]](s)

[[File:Baby Mother Grandmother and Great Grandmother.jpg|thumb|An [[infant]], his [[mother]], his maternal [[grandmother]], and his [[great-grandmother]].]]
Such systems generally assume that the mother's husband has also served as the biological father. In some families, a woman may have children with more than one man or a man may have children with more than one woman. The system refers to a child who shares only one parent with another child as a &quot;half-brother&quot; or &quot;half-sister.&quot; For children who do not share biological or adoptive parents in common, English-speakers use the term &quot;stepbrother&quot; or &quot;stepsister&quot; to refer to their new relationship with each other when one of their biological parents marries one of the other child's biological parents. Any person (other than the biological parent of a child) who marries the parent of that child becomes the &quot;stepparent&quot; of the child, either the &quot;stepmother&quot; or &quot;stepfather.&quot; The same terms generally apply to children adopted into a family as to children born into the family.

Typically, societies with conjugal families also favor [[neolocal]] residence; thus upon marriage a person separates from the nuclear family of their childhood (family of orientation) and forms a new nuclear family (family of procreation). However, in the western society the single parent family has been growing more accepted and has begun to truly make an impact on culture. The majority of single parent families are more commonly single mother families than single father. These families face many difficult issues besides the fact that they have to rear their children on their own, but also have to deal with issues related to low income. Many single parents struggle with low incomes and must cope with other issues, including rent, child care, and other necessities required in maintaining a healthy and safe home. Members of the nuclear families of members of one's own (former) nuclear family may class as lineal or as collateral. Kin who regard them as lineal refer to them in terms that build on the terms used within the nuclear family:
* [[Grandparent]]
** '''Grandfather''': a parent's father
** '''Grandmother''': a parent's mother
* '''Grandson''': a child's son
* '''Granddaughter''': a child's daughter

For collateral relatives, more classificatory terms come into play, terms that do not build on the terms used within the nuclear family:
* '''[[Uncle]]''': father's brother, mother's brother, father's sister's husband, mother's sister's husband
* '''[[Aunt]]''': father's sister, mother's sister, father's brother's wife, mother's brother's wife
* '''[[Nephew]]''': sister's son, brother's son, wife's brother's son, wife's sister's son, husband's brother's son, husband's sister's son
* '''[[Niece]]''': sister's daughter, brother's daughter, wife's brother's daughter, wife's sister's daughter, husband's brother's daughter, husband's sister's daughter

When additional generations intervene (in other words, when one's collateral relatives belong to the same generation as one's grandparents or grandchildren), the prefixes &quot;great-&quot; or &quot;grand-&quot; modifies these terms. Also, as with grandparents and grandchildren, as more generations intervene the prefix becomes &quot;great-grand-,&quot; adding an additional &quot;great-&quot; for each additional generation. Most collateral relatives have never had membership of the nuclear family of the members of one's own nuclear family.
* '''[[Cousin]]''': the most classificatory term; the children of aunts or uncles. One can further distinguish cousins by degrees of collaterality and by generation. Two persons of the same generation who share a grandparent count as &quot;first cousins&quot; (one degree of collaterality); if they share a great-grandparent they count as &quot;second cousins&quot; (two degrees of collaterality) and so on. If two persons share an ancestor, one as a grandchild and the other as a great-grandchild of that individual, then the two descendants class as &quot;first cousins once removed&quot; (removed by one generation); if they shared ancestor figures as the grandparent of one individual and the great-great-grandparent of the other, the individuals class as &quot;first cousins twice removed&quot; (removed by two generations), and so on. Similarly, if they shared ancestor figures as the great-grandparent of one person and the great-great-grandparent of the other, the individuals class as &quot;second cousins once removed&quot;. Hence one can refer to a &quot;third cousin once removed upwards.&quot;

Cousins of an older generation (in other words, one's parents' first cousins), although technically first cousins once removed, are often classified with &quot;aunts&quot; and &quot;uncles.&quot; Similarly, a person may refer to close friends of one's parents as &quot;aunt&quot; or &quot;uncle,&quot; or may refer to close friends as &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister,&quot; using the practice of [[fictive kinship]]. English-speakers mark relationships by marriage (except for wife/husband) with the tag &quot;-in-law.&quot; The mother and father of one's spouse become one's mother-in-law and father-in-law; the female spouse of one's child becomes one's daughter-in-law and the male spouse of one's child becomes one's son-in-law. The term &quot;[[sister-in-law]]&quot; refers to three essentially different relationships, either the wife of one's sibling, or the sister of one's spouse, or, in some uses, the wife of one's spouse's sibling. &quot;[[Brother-in-law]]&quot; expresses a similar ambiguity. The terms &quot;half-brother&quot; and &quot;half-sister&quot; indicate siblings who share only one biological or adoptive parent.

==Family in the West==

===Family types===
[[File:Families US.png|thumb|300px|Family arrangements in the [[United States]] have become more diverse with no particular household arrangement representing half of the United States population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marriages, Families &amp; Intinamtjnjje Relationships&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Brian |coauthors=Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom |year=2005 |title=Marriages, Families &amp; Intinamte Relationships |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, MA |id=0-205-36674-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The different types of families occur in a wide variety of settings, and their specific functions and meanings depend largely on their relationship to other social institutions. [[Sociologist]]s have a special interest in the function and status of these forms in stratified (especially [[Capitalism|capitalist]]) societies. The term &quot;[[nuclear family]]&quot; is commonly used, especially in North America and Europe, to refer to conjugal families. Sociologists distinguish between conjugal families (relatively independent of the kindred of the parents and of other families in general) and nuclear families (which maintain relatively close ties with their kindred). The term &quot;[[extended family]]&quot; is also common, especially in North America and Europe. This term has two distinct meanings. First, it serves as a synonym of &quot;consanguinal family&quot; (consanguine means &quot;of the same blood&quot;). Second, in societies dominated by the conjugal family, it refers to &quot;[[Kinship|kindred]]&quot; (an egocentric network of relatives that extends beyond the domestic group) who do not belong to the conjugal family. These types refer to ideal or normative structures found in particular societies. Any society will exhibit some variation in the actual composition and conception of families. Much sociological, [[historical]] and [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] research dedicates itself to the understanding of this variation, and of changes in the family that form over time. ''Times have changed; it is more acceptable and encouraged for mothers to work and fathers to spend more time at home with the children. The way roles are balanced between the parents will help children grow and learn valuable life lessons. There is great importance of communication and equality in families, in order to avoid role strain. '' &lt;ref&gt;Levitan, Sara. 2010. What Happens to Family Life? http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1981/09/art4full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the work of scholars [[Max Weber]], [[Alan Macfarlane]], [[Steven Ozment]], [[Jack Goody]] and [[Peter Laslett]], the huge transformation that led to modern marriage in Western democracies was &quot;fueled by the religio-cultural value system provided by elements of Judaism, early Christianity, Roman Catholic canon law and the Protestant Reformation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3322 |publisher=Religion-online.org |title=The Collapse of Marriage by Don Browning – The Christian Century |date=February 7, 2006 |pages=24–28 |accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Less-known family types==

In contemporary Europe and North America, people in academic, political and civil sectors have called attention to single-father-headed households, and families headed by [[same-sex]] couples,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} although academics point out that these forms exist in other societies. Also the term ''blended family'' or ''[[stepfamily]]'' describes families with mixed parents: one or both parents remarried, bringing children of the former family into the new family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blendedandblessed.com/BlendedBlog.dsp Blended and Blessed] – Encouraging Step-Families, blendedandblessed.com{{Dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in sociology, particularly in the works of social psychologist [[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdp.cam.ac.uk/contacts/staff/profiles/mlamb.html |title=Department of Social and Developmental Psychology: PPSIS Faculty, Academic Profile |publisher=Sdp.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''traditional family'' refers to &quot;a middleclass family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological children,&quot; and ''nontraditional'' to exceptions from this rule. Most of the US households are now non-traditional under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf] paragraph 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of communication patterns in families, there are a certain set of beliefs within the family that reflect how its members should communicate and interact. These family communication patterns arise from two underlying sets of beliefs. One being conversation orientation (the degree to which the importance of communication is valued) and two, conformity orientation (the degree to which families should emphasize similarities or differences regarding attitudes, beliefs, and values).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCornack|first=Steven|title=Reflect &amp; Relate an introduction to interpersonal communication|year=2010|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston/NY|pages=369–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Adults and Child.jpg|thumb|Family members]]

===Sociological views===
Contemporary society generally views the family as a haven from the world, supplying absolute fulfilment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Zinn and Eitzen discuss the image of the &quot;family as  haven [...] a place of [[intimacy]], [[love]] and [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] where individuals may [[Escapism|escape]] the competition of dehumanizing forces in modern society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
During [[industrialization]], &quot;[t]he family as a repository of warmth and tenderness (embodied by the mother) stands in opposition to the competitive and aggressive world of commerce (embodied by the father). The family's task was to protect against the outside world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zinn and Eitzen (1987) ''[http://books.google.com/books?cd=2&amp;id=bS9HAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22vitally+needed+but+missing+in+other+social+arrangements%22&amp;q=protection#search_anchor Diversity in American families]'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zinn and Eizen note, &quot;The protective image of the family has waned in recent years as the ideals of family fulfillment have taken shape. Today, the family is more compensatory than protective. It supplies what is vitally needed but missing in other social arrangements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zinn and Eitzen (1987) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=bS9HAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22vitally+needed+but+missing+in+other+social+arrangements%22&amp;dq=%22vitally+needed+but+missing+in+other+social+arrangements%22&amp;cd=2 Diversity in American families]'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The popular wisdom&quot;, according to Zinn and Eitzen, sees the family structures of the past as superior to those today, and families as more stable and happier at a time when they did not have to contend with problems such as illegitimate children and [[divorce]]. They respond to this, saying, &quot;there is no golden age of the family gleaming at us in the far back historical past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zinn and Eitzen (1987) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=bS9HAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22age+of+the+family+gleaming%22&amp;dq=%22age+of+the+family+gleaming%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=14 Diversity in American families]'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Desertion by spouses, illegitimate children, and other conditions that are considered characteristics of modern times existed in the past as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zinn and Eitzen (1987) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=bS9HAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Desertion+by+spouses,+illegitimate%22&amp;dq=%22Desertion+by+spouses,+illegitimate%22&amp;cd=4 Diversity in American families]'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that whether or not one views the family as &quot;declining&quot; depends on one's definition of &quot;family&quot;. The high rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock births indicate a decline in the institution of the family{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. ''Married couples have dropped below half of all American households. This drop is shocking from traditional forms of the family system. Only a fifth of households were following traditional ways of having married couples raising a family together.&lt;ref&gt;Tavernise, Sabrina. (2011). Married Couples Are No Longer a Majority, Census Finds.  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/us/26marry.html?_r=1#&lt;/ref&gt; ''No longer are marriages arranged for political or economic gain, and children are not expected to contribute to family income. Instead, people choose mates based on [[love]]. This increased role of love indicates a societal shift toward favoring emotional fulfilment and relationships within a family, and this shift necessarily weakens the institution of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2005. Marriage, A History: How Love Conquered Marriage. New York: Viking/Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Mead considers the family as a main safeguard to continuing human progress. Observing, &quot;Human beings have learned, laboriously, to be human&quot;, she adds: &quot;we hold our present form of humanity on trust, [and] it is possible to lose it&quot; ... &quot;It is not without significance that the most successful large-scale abrogations of the family have occurred not among simple savages, living close to the subsistence edge, but among great nations and strong empires, the resources of which were ample, the populations huge, and the power almost unlimited&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Male and Female'', New York, 1949. pp. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

As an agent of socialization, family is the primary source of influence behind the formation of personality and the growth of a child,&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J. &quot;Sociology: 7th Canadian Edition&quot;. (Toronto: Pearson, 2011), 112&lt;/ref&gt; due to its influence on the basics of personality and its role providing gender identity. This impact is large as the family confers its [[social position]] onto the child when it is brought into the world.

===Oedipal family model and fascism===
The model, common in the western societies, of the family triangle, husband-wife-children isolated from the outside, is also called the ''[[oedipal model]] of the family'',and it is a form of [[patriarchal]] family. Many philosophers and psychiatrists analyzed such a model.
In the family, they argue, the young develop in a perverse relationship, wherein they learn to love the same person who beats and oppresses them. ''Young children grow up and develop loving the person that is oppressing them physically or mentally.  These children are taught differently than the appropriate way of raising affectionate children.&lt;ref&gt;“About Family.” Word Press. Published 31 March 2012. http://kirkomrik.wordpress.com/2012/03/31/more-notes-about-family/&lt;/ref&gt; ''The family therefore constitutes the first cell of the fascist society, as they will carry this attitude of love for oppressive figures in their adult life.&lt;ref name=&quot;FoucaultPreface&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich33GermCell&quot;&gt;[[Wilhelm Reich]] (1933) ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'', Chapter V, ''The Sex-Economic Presuppositions of the Authoritarian Family''&lt;/ref&gt; Fathers torment their sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips&quot;&gt;John Phillips [http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/elljwp/anthropology.htm#Structural%20Anthropology Structural Linguistics and Anthropology], courses.nus.edu.sg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich36SexRev&quot;/&gt; Deleuze and Guattari, in their analysis of the dynamics at work within a family, &quot;track down all varieties of fascism, from the enormous ones that surround and crush us to the petty ones that constitute the tyrannical bitterness of our everyday lives&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FoucaultPreface&quot;&gt;Foucault (1984) Preface to the American edition of ''[[Anti-Œdipus]]'' pp. xiii–xvi).&lt;/ref&gt;

As it has been explained by Deleuze, Guattari and Foucault, as well as other philosophers and psychiatrists such as [[Ronald David Laing|Laing]] and [[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]], the [[patriarchal]]-family conceived in the West tradition serves the purpose of perpetuating a [[propertarian]] and [[authoritarian]] society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deleuze-Guattari72p129-31&quot;/&gt; The child grows according to the oedipal model, which is typical of the structure of capitalist societies,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacan3801&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FugierPascal226&quot;/&gt; and he becomes in turn owner of [[submissive]] children and protector of the woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reich36SexRev&quot;&gt;[[Wilhelm Reich]] [1936] ''[[The Sexual Revolution]]'', Chapter V, ''The compulsive family as educational apparatus'', pp. 71–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;patriarchal_proprietary&quot;&gt;{{it}} [[Gianni Vattimo]] ''[http://www.feltrinelli.it/FattiLibriInterna?id_fatto=3891 Tutto in famiglia]'' (article appeared on ''[[Il Manifesto]]'' October 15, 2004), feltrinelli.it {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;luttazzi_patriarchal_family&quot;&gt;{{it}} [[Daniele Luttazzi|Luttazzi, Daniele]] ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN8807840545&amp;id=H19BcLL2thEC Bollito misto con mostarda]'' (2005) p. 262, books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adorno_family&quot;&gt;[[Theodor W.

As the young undergoes physical and [[psychological repression]] from someone for whom they develop love, they develop a loving attitude towards authority figures. They will bring such attitude in their adult life, when they will desire [[Social control|social repression]] and will form docile subjects for society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deleuze-Guattari72p129-31&quot;&gt;Deleuze-Guattari (1972). Part 2, ch. 7, pp. 129–31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]], in his systematic study of [[Sexology|sexuality]], argued that rather than being merely repressed, the desires of the individual are efficiently mobilized and used,&lt;ref name=&quot;FoucaultPreface&quot;/&gt; to control the individual, alter [[interpersonal relationships]] and control the masses. Foucault believed [[organized religion]], through [[moral]] [[prohibition]]s, and [[economic power]]s, through [[advertising]], make use of unconscious sex drives. Dominating desire, they dominate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the analysis of [[Michel Foucault]], in the west:
{{Quote|the [conjugal] family organization, precisely to the extent that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the other [[Power (sociology)|power]] mechanisms, was used to support the great &quot;maneuvers&quot; employed for the [[Malthusian]] control of the birthrate, for the populationist incitements, for the medicalization of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms.|Michel Foucault|''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' vol I, chap. IV, sect. ''Method'', rule 3, p. 99}}

==Size==
[[Natalism]] is the [[belief]] that [[human reproduction]] is the basis for individual existence, and therefore promotes having large families. Many religions, e.g., [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/NipponDawn/torah.html Joys of A Large Family], by Rebbetzin Faige Twerski. angelfire.com&lt;/ref&gt; encourage their followers to procreate and have many children, however many of them also propound [[stewardship (theology)|stewardship]] and responsibility to care for the environment and society. In recent times, however, there has been an increasing amount of [[family planning]] and a following decrease in the [[total fertility rate]] in many parts of the world, in part due to improvements in health care, concerns of [[overpopulation]], decreasing need for manual labor and increasing [[cost of raising a child]] as workers need to be more skilled. Many countries with [[population decline]] offer incentives for people to have large families as a means of [[Population decline#National efforts to reverse declining populations|national efforts to reverse declining populations]].

==Criticism==
The family being such a deep-rooted and much-venerated institution, few intellectuals have ventured to speak against it. [[Familialism]] has been atypically defined as a “social structure where … a family's values are held in higher esteem than the values of the individual members of the family.”&lt;ref&gt;“Your Dictionary (the Dictionary You Can Understand)”. Dictionary definitions. [http://www.yourdictionary.com/familism familialism].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Favoritism]] granted to relatives regardless of [[wiktionary:merit|merit]] is called [[nepotism]].

The Russian-American [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Individualism|individualist]] philosopher, novelist and playwright [[Ayn Rand]] compared partiality towards [[consanguinity]] with [[racism]], as a small-scale manifestation of the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;rand&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |title=[[Ayn Rand and the World She Made]] |last=Heller |first=Anne C. |pages 320–321 |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-385-51399-9 |oclc=2290274371}} Said in [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4JWE7mp8nI one of the lectures] Ayn Rand delivered.&lt;/ref&gt; “The worship of the family is merely racism, like a crudely primitive first installment on the worship of the tribe. It places the [[accident of birth]] above a man's values and duty to the tribe above a man's right to his own life.”&lt;ref&gt;Said in [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4JWE7mp8nI one of the public lectures] Ayn Rand delivered&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she spoke in favor of [[childfree]] lifestyle, while following it herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;rand&quot;/&gt;

The British [[Social criticism|social critic]], poet, mountaineer and occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] censured the institution of family in his works: “Horrid word, family!  Its very [[etymology]] accuses it of servility and stagnation. / Latin, ''[[Wiktionary:famulus|famulus]]'', a servant; Oscan, ''[[Wiktionary:Faamat|Faamat]]'', he dwells. … [T]hink what horrid images it evokes from the mind.  Not only [[Victorian era|Victorian]]; wherever the family has been strong, it has always been an engine of tyranny.  Weak members or weak neighbours: it is the mob spirit crushing [[Holy Guardian Angel|genius]], or overwhelming opposition by brute arithmetic. … In every [[Magick|Magical]], or similar system, it is invariably the first condition which the Aspirant must fulfill: he must once and for all and for ever put his family outside his magical circle.”&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''[[Magick Without Tears]]''. Capter LII “[http://hermetic.com/crowley/magick-without-tears/mwt_52.html Family: Public Enemy No. 1]”. Falcon Press, 1982. ISBN 0-941404-17-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The American journalist [[Marty Nemko]] considers family to be overrated. “Politicians, clerics, and just plain folks extol family as our most important institution. / I believe family is overrated. So many people suffer inordinately from family. … / Millions of people don't even speak with a family member. Millions more spend years and fortunes on [[Psychotherapy|therapists]], trying to undo the ills that family perpetrated on them. / All this shouldn’t be surprising. After all, unlike with friends, we are placed in our family of origin at random, with no say in the matter.”&lt;ref&gt;Nemko, Marty. &quot;[http://martynemko.blogspot.ca/2008/09/family-is-overrated.html Family is Overrated]. September 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Bible===
In the [[gospel]]s of the [[New Testament]] [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Mark#Chapter 3|Mark 3:31-35]] and [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Mark#Chapter 3|Matthew 23:9]], it is written, “There came then [Jesus'] brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him. / And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. / And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? / And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! / For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother. … / And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.” 

[[Jesus Christ]] is also recorded in the [[Bible]] as saying, “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple” ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter14|Luke 14:26]]), as well as “Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. / And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, / But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.” ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Mark#Chapter 10|Mark 10:29-30]]).

Such passages abound: [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 8-21, 10:34-36, 12:47-49, 15:4-7; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2:46-49, 8:20-21, 9:59-62, 11:27-28, 12:51-53.
