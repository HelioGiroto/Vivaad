      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31482">A '''dependent territory''', '''dependent area''' or '''dependency''' is a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] that does not possess full political [[independence]] or [[sovereignty]] as a [[sovereign state]] yet remains politically outside of the controlling state's integral area.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dependency is commonly distinguished from other [[subnational entity|subnational entities]] in that they are not considered to be part of the integral territory of the governing State. A subnational entity typically represents a division of the State ''proper'', while a dependent territory often maintains a great degree of autonomy from the controlling State. Historically, most colonies were considered to be dependencies of their controlling State. Most of these have either become independent, by joining neighbouring independent countries, or assimilated into the conquering state. The dependencies that remain generally maintain a very high degree of political autonomy. Although dependencies retain a degree of autonomy, not all autonomous entities are considered to be dependencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/council.htm United Nations Trusteeship Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories.djvu|200px|thumb|The United Nations Trusteeship Agreements or were listed by the General Assembly as Non-Self-Governing. (Official document 2002)]]

Many political entities have a special position [[List of special entities recognized by international treaty or agreement|recognized by international treaty or agreement]] resulting in a certain level of autonomy or differences in immigration rules. These are sometimes&lt;ref name=&quot;The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories&quot;&gt;[http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf United Nations General Assembly 15th Session - The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories (pages:509-510)]&lt;/ref&gt; considered dependencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listaba.com/list/01000326594567/ Listaba.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but are officially considered by their controlling states to be integral parts of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories&quot;/&gt; Examples are [[Åland]] ([[Finland]]), [[Svalbard]] ([[Norway]]), [[Azores]] ([[Portugal]]), [[Madeira]] (Portugal), [[Hong Kong]] ([[China]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2006.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Macau]] (China).

== Lists of dependent territories ==

===Australia===

Although all territories of [[Australia]] are considered to be fully integrated in its [[Federation|federative system]], and the official status of an external territory does not differ largely from that of a mainland territory (except in regards to immigration law), debate remains as to whether the external territories are integral parts of Australia, due to their not being part of Australia in 1901, when its constituent states [[Federated state|federated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Description ==
Three [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]] are in a form of association with the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. They are independently administrated jurisdictions, although the British Government is solely responsible for defence and international representation, and has ultimate responsibility for ensuring good government. They do not have diplomatic recognition as independent states, but they are not an integrated part of the UK, nor do they form part of the [[European Union]]. The UK Parliament retains the ability to legislate for the Crown dependencies even without the agreement of the insular legislatures. None of the Crown dependencies has representatives in the UK Parliament. [[Bermuda]] and [[Gibraltar]] have similar relationships to the UK as the Crown dependencies. While Britain is officially responsible for defence and international representation, these jurisdictions maintain their own militaries and have been granted limited diplomatic powers, in addition to having internal self-government. Nevertheless, they are [[British overseas territories]].

New Zealand and dependencies share the same [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] and constitute one [[Realm of New Zealand|realm]]. The [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] are officially termed [[associated state]]s.

[[Puerto Rico]] (since 1952) and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (since 1986) are non-independent states freely associated with the [[United States]].
The mutually negotiated Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States was approved in 1976. The Covenant was fully implemented November 3, 1986, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation no. 5564, which conferred United States citizenship on legally qualified CNMI residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern Mariana Islands at the CIA's page|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cq.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2010-07-15|author=CIA|date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]], Puerto Rico is described as a Commonwealth and Puerto Ricans have a degree of [[autonomous entity|administrative autonomy]] similar to citizens of a [[U.S. state]]. Puerto Ricans &quot;were collectively made [[U.S. citizenship#Birthright citizenship|U.S. citizens]]&quot; in 1917 as a result of the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]].&lt;ref&gt;The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion: 1803-1898. By Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H. Sparrow. New York: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers. 2005. Page 166, 178. &quot;U.S. citizenship was extended to residents of Puerto Rico by virtue of the Jones Act, chap. 190, 39 Stat. 951 (1971) (codified at 48 U.S.C. § 731 (1987)&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico at the CIA's page|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rq.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2010-07-15|author=CIA|date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used name in Spanish of the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]], ''Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico'', literally &quot;Associated Free State of Puerto Rico&quot;, which sounds similar to &quot;free association&quot; particularly when loosely used in Spanish, is sometimes erroneously interpreted to mean that Puerto Rico's relationship with United States is based on a [[Compact of Free Association]] and at other times erroneously held to mean that Puerto Rico's relationship with United States is based on an [[Interstate compact]]. This is a constant source of ambiguity and confusion when trying to define, understand and explain Puerto Rico's political relationship with the United States. For various reasons [[Politics of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico's political status]] differs from that of the Pacific Islands that entered into Compacts of Free Association with the United States. As sovereign states, these islands have full right to conduct their own foreign relations, while the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] has territorial status subject to United States congressional authority under the Constitution's Territory Clause, “to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory… belonging to the United States.”.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinalReport&quot;&gt;[http://www.prfaa.com/eng/PuertoRicoBookletFinal.pdf December 2005 report of the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status]&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rico does not have the right to unilaterally declare independence, and at the last referendum (1998) the narrow majority voted for &quot;none of the above&quot;, which was a formally undefined alternative used by commonwealth supporters to express their desire for an &quot;enhanced commonwealth&quot; option.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinalReport&quot;/&gt;

This kind of relationship also can be found in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which is a [[federacy]]. The [[Netherlands|continental part]] is organized like a unitary state but the status of its territories ([[Aruba]], since 1986, and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], since 1954 until 2010) can be considered dependencies or &quot;associated non-independent states&quot;. After the split-up of the Netherlands Antilles, [[Curaçao]] and [[Saint Maarten]] are separate associated states like Aruba.

Additionally, [[Denmark]] operates in a similar manner to a federacy. The [[Faroes]] and [[Greenland]] are two self-governing territories, or regions within the Kingdom. The relationship between Denmark proper and the two territories is semi-officially termed the &quot;[[Rigsfællesskabet]]&quot;.
