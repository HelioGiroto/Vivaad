{{Refimprove|date=January 2011}}
A '''government in exile''' is a political group which claims to be a [[Sovereign state|country]]'s legitimate [[government]], but is unable to exercise legal power and instead resides in a foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=government-in-exile |title=Princeton University WordNet |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments in [[exile]] usually plan to one day return to their native country and regain formal power. A government in exile differs from a [[rump state]] in the sense that a rump state controls at least part of its former territory.&lt;ref&gt;Tir, J. , 2005-02-22 &quot;Keeping the Peace After Secessions: Territorial Conflicts Between Rump and Secessionist States&quot; Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Honolulu, Hawaii Online &lt;.PDF&gt;. 2009-05-25 from [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p72056_index.html allacademic.com]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during [[World War I]], nearly all of [[Belgium]] was [[Military occupation|occupied]] by [[German Empire|Germany]], but Belgium and its allies held on to a small slice in the country's west. A government in exile, conversely, has lost all its territory.

Governments in exile frequently occur during [[war]]time occupation, or in the aftermath of a [[civil war]], [[revolution]], or [[Coup d'état|military coup]]. For example, during German expansion in [[World War II]], some [[Europe]]an governments sought refuge in the [[United Kingdom]], rather than face destruction at the hands of [[Nazi Germany]]. A government in exile may also form from widespread belief in the illegitimacy of a ruling government.For instance, the [[Syrian National Council]] was formed as a result of the [[Syrian Civil War]], which sought to end the rule of the ruling [[Ba'ath Party]].

The effectiveness of a government in exile depends primarily on the amount of external support it can receive, either from foreign governments or from the population of its own country. Some governments in exile develop into a formidable force, posing a serious challenge to the [[incumbent]] [[regime]] of the country, while others are maintained chiefly as a symbolic gesture.

The phenomenon of a government in exile predates formal use of the term. In periods of [[Monarch|monarchical government]], exiled monarchs or dynasties sometimes set up exile courts—as the [[House of Stuart]] did when driven from their throne by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and at the [[Glorious Revolution]], or the [[House of Bourbon]] did during the [[French Revolution]] and the rule of [[Napoleon]]. With the spread of [[constitutional monarchy]], monarchical governments in exile started to include a [[prime minister]].{{example needed|date=May 2012}}

==Activities==
[[International law]] recognizes that governments in exile may undertake many types of actions in the conduct of their daily affairs. These actions include:
* becoming a party to a bilateral or international [[treaty]]
* amending or revising its own [[constitution]]
* maintaining [[military forces]]
* retaining, or newly obtaining, [[diplomatic recognition]] from other states
* issuing [[Identity document|identity cards]]
* allowing the formation of new [[Political party|political parties]]
* holding [[election]]s

In cases where a host country holds a large [[expatriate]] population from a government in exile's home country, or an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] population from that country, the government in exile might come to exercise some administrative functions within such a population. For example, the WWII [[Provisional Government of Free India]] had such authority among the [[Malaysian Indian|ethnically Indian]] population of [[British Malaya]], with the consent of the then [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military authorities.

==Current governments in exile==
Governments in exile may have [[List of states with limited recognition|little or no recognition from other states]]. Some exiled governments have some characteristics in common with [[rump state]]s. Such disputed or partially in exile cases are noted in the tables below.

===Deposed governments of current states===
These governments in exile were created by [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] governments or rulers who continue to claim legitimate authority of the state they once controlled.

The ROC membership in the United Nations continued to exist through 1971 despite the fact that the ROC government lost the Chinese mainland and moved to Taiwan in 1949. The reduction of a huge area under its effective control in 1949 did not eliminate the very existence of the ROC as a sovereign state as defined by international law. In short, the ROC government has continued to exercise its sovereignty over territories under its effective control since 1912. It has never disappeared from the world as a sovereign state.&quot; &lt;br&gt; p118. &quot;President Harry S. Truman of the United States stated on January 5, 1950 that 'Taiwan was surrendered to ... Chiang Kai-Shek, and for the past four years, the United States and the other Allied Powers have accepted the exercise of the Chinese authority over the island.'&quot;&lt;br&gt; p118.-119. &quot;The Republic of China is, by any standard, a political entity, recognized by 29 countries as of today. It has a defined territory, with Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu together with its population of 21 million, under its effective control ever since 1945 or earlier. ... &lt;br&gt; The Republic of China indeed is a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933. It also complies with the definition as 'state' defined by current theory of international law, as discussed in the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States of 1987.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its status as a government in exile is disputed.

There are also reports that Chiang's advisors convinced him that if the ROC mission stayed to represent Taiwan, Chiang would be under pressure to demonstrate in some constitutional way that his Chinese government-in-exile represented the people of Taiwan rather than the vast population of China. Doing so would require Chiang to dismantle his existing regime (which was elected in 1947 on the Chinese mainland and continued to rule in Taiwan under emergency martial law provisions without benefit of elections), adopt an entirely new constitu­tion, and install an entirely new government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOWnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ROC Government in Exile Is Illogical (English transl.)|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&amp;mnum=115&amp;anum=8153|date=June 1, 2010|publisher=(original source: [http://www.nownews.com/2010/06/01/142-2609610.htm &quot;「流亡政府」邏輯不通&quot; by NOWnews Network])|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TIME magazine, Far Eastern Economic Review, Stanford University, US State Dept., Public Broadcasting Service, BBC, US Congressional Research Service, UK Parliament, UK Foreign Office, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, and numerous law journals have all referred to the Republic of China on Taiwan as a government in exile.

===Exiled governments of non-self-governing or occupied territories===
These governments in exile are governments of [[Self-governance|non-self-governing]] or occupied territories. They claim legitimate authority over a territory they once controlled, or claim legitimacy of a [[Decolonization|post-decolonization]] authority. The claim may stem from an exiled group's election as a legitimate government.

The [[United Nations]] recognizes the [[right of self-determination]] for the population of these territories, including the possibility of establishing independent sovereign states.

The declaration was recognized by dozens of countries, but never implemented on the ground.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unlimitedtopten.com/2011/01/top-ten-governments-currently-in-exile.html Top Ten Governments Currently In Exile]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}:&quot;The state of Palestine was proclaimed in 1988, but in exile. A declaration of a &quot;State of Palestine&quot; was approved on November 15, 1988, by the Palestinian National Council, the legislative body of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). The declaration was ignored, and eventually rejected, by the State of Israel. Israel controls the territories since 1967 Six-Day War when it captured them from Egypt and Jordan. Currently, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) envision the establishment of a State of Palestine to include all the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, living in peace with Israel under a democratically elected and transparent government. The PNA, however, does not claim sovereignty over any territory and therefore is not the government of the &quot;State of Palestine&quot; proclaimed in 1988. Enough said.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7254434.stm Palestinians 'may declare state']:&quot;Saeb Erekat, disagreed arguing that the Palestine Liberation Organisation had already declared independence in 1988. &quot;Now we need real independence, not a declaration. We need real independence by ending the occupation. We are not Kosovo. We are under Israeli occupation and for independence we need to acquire independence,&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

| Established in [[Sweden]] by several members of [[National Committee of the Republic of Estonia|Otto Tief's government]]; did not achieve any international recognizion. In fact, it was not recognized even by Estonian diplomatic legations that were seen by western countries as legal representatives of the annexed state.
A rival government was created by another group of Estonian exiles in the same year in [[Munich]] but it was short lived.

===Sovereign Military Order of Malta===
The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] may be considered a case of a government in exile, since it is without territory but recognised as a sovereign government by numerous sovereign countries. However, it does not claim to be a sovereign state, rather a &quot;sovereign subject&quot; of international law. In addition, it no longer claims jurisdiction over Malta, and recognises and maintains diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of Malta]].

===World War II===
Many countries established a government in exile after loss of [[sovereignty]] in connection with [[World War II]]:
*[[Belgium]] (invaded 10 May 1940; see [[Pierlot IV Government]])
*[[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] (established in 1940 by [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] and recognised by the British and other United Nations governments)
*[[Free French Forces|Free France]], based in [[London, England|London]] (from June 1940 to 1944)
*[[Greece]] (invaded 28 October 1940; see [[Greek government in exile]])
*[[Luxembourg]] (invaded 10 May 1940)
*Netherlands (invaded 10 May 1940; see [[Dutch government in exile]])
*[[Norway]] (invaded 9 April 1940)
*[[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] (invaded 9 December 1941)
*[[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (invaded 6 April 1941)

Other exiled leaders in Britain in this time included [[King Zog of Albania]] and [[Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia]].

The [[Provisional Government of Free India]] (1943–45) was established by Indian nationalists in exile during the war; unlike most other governments in exile in this war, it was allied to the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and claimed power over an Allied (specifically, British) territory. A [[Bulgarian government-in-exile|Bulgarian government in exile]] and [[Vichy France]] were also allied with the Axis.

====The Danish exception====
The [[Occupation of Denmark]] (9 April 1940) was administered mainly by the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Office]], contrary to other occupied lands that were under [[Military Administration (Nazi Germany)|military]] or [[Reichskommissariat|civilian administration]]. [[Denmark]] did not establish a government in exile, although there was an Association of Free Danes established in [[London]]. [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]] and his government remained in [[Denmark]], and functioned comparatively independently for the first three years of German occupation. Meanwhile, [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] were occupied by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]], and effectively separated from the Danish crown. (See [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland during World War II]], and [[History of Greenland during World War II]].)

===Persian Gulf War===
Following the Iraqi invasion and occupation of [[Kuwait]] on August 2, 1990, [[Sheikh]] [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] and senior members of his government fled to [[Saudi Arabia]], where they set up a government-in-exile operating out of a luxury hotel in [[Dhahran]]. The Kuwaiti government in exile was far more affluent than most other such governments, having full disposal of the very considerable Kuwaiti assets in western banks—of which it made use to conduct a massive [[propaganda]] campaign denouncing the Iraqi occupation and mobilising public opinion in the West in favor of war with [[Iraq]]. In March 1991, following the American victory in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the Sheikh and his government were able to return to Kuwait.
