{{Politics}}
{{Forms of government}}

'''Politics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''politikos'' &quot;of, for, or relating to citizens&quot;) as a term is generally applied to the [[art]] or [[science]] of running governmental or state affairs, including behavior within civil [[government]]s, but also applies to institutions, fields, and special interest groups such as the [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] segments of society. It consists of &quot;social relations involving [[authority]] or [[Power (philosophy)|power]]&quot; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politics Portal|url=http://www.enciclopedia.com.pt/articles.php?article_id=843|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern political discourse focuses on democracy and the relationship between people and politics.  It is thought of as the way we &quot;choose government officials and make decisions about public policy&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Losco|first=Joseph|title=AmGov|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Ep_strasbourg_6.jpg|left|thumb|[[European Parliament]]]]
The word ''politics'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[Politics (Aristotle)|Πολιτικά]] (''politika''), modeled on [[Aristotle]]'s &quot;affairs of the city&quot;, the name of his book on governing and governments, which was rendered in English mid-15 century as Latinized &quot;Polettiques&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=politics |title=Politics |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it became &quot;politics&quot; in [[Middle English]] c. 1520s (see the [[Concise Oxford Dictionary]]). The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from [[Middle French]] ''politique'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''politicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoliticus |title=A Latin Dictionary |author= Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the Greek πολιτικός (''politikos''), meaning amongst others &quot;of, for, or relating to citizens&quot;, &quot;civil&quot;, &quot;civic&quot;, &quot;belonging to the state&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs πολιτικός |author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πολίτης (''polites''), &quot;citizen&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpoli%2Fths πολίτης |author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that from πόλις (''[[polis]]''), &quot;city&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpo%2Flis πόλις |author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of politics is reflected in the origin and development, and economics of the institutions of [[government]].

=== The state ===
{{Main|State (polity)}}
[[File:Sun-tzu.jpg|right |thumb |[[Sun Tzu]]]]

The origin of the [[State (polity)|state]] is to be found in the development of the [[Art of Warfare|art of warfare]]. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Robert L.|title=A Theory of the Origin of the State|journal=Science|date=21|year=1970|month=August|volume=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kings in many countries like China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of [[kingship]] stood at the forefront until the French Revolution put an end to the &quot;[[divine right of kings]]&quot;.  Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the 21st Century A.D. British Monarchy.  Kingship becomes an institution through heredity.

The king ruled his kingdom with the aid of his [[Privy council|Council]] without it he could not hold his territories. The Council is the king's master mind. The Council is the germ of [[constitutional government]]. Long before the council became a bulwark of democracy, it rendered invaluable aid to the institution of kingship by:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

# Preserving the institution of kingship through heredity.
# Preserving the traditions of the social order.
# Being able to withstand criticism as an impersonal authority.
# Being able to manage a greater deal of knowledge and action than a single individual such as the king.

The greatest of the king's subordinates, the [[earls]] in England and Scotland, the [[dukes]] and [[counts]] in the Continent, always sat as a right on the Council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts [[tribute]]. One of the functions of the Council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of [[military service]] and the establishment of [[lordship]]s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=73–96 |quote=The origin of the State, or Political Society, is to be found in the development of the art of military warfare.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state and property ====
[[Property]] is the right vested on the individual or a group of people to enjoy the benefits of an object be it material or intellectual. A right is a power enforced by public trust. Sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is opposed to public trust. Nevertheless, a right is really the creation of public trust, past, present or future. The growth of knowledge is the key to the history of property as an institution. The more man becomes knowledgeable of an object be it physical or intellectual, the more it is appropriated. The appearance of the State brought about the final stage in the evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry. In the presence of the State, man can hold landed property. The State began granting lordships and ended up conferring property and with it came [[inheritance]]. With landed property came rent and in the exchange of goods, profit, so that in modern times, the &quot;lord of the land&quot; of long ago becomes the landlord. If it is wrongly assumed that the value of land is always the same, then there is of course no evolution of property whatever. However, the price of land goes up with every increase in population benefitting the landlord. The landlordism of large land owners has been the most rewarded of all political services. In industry, the position of the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an industry, the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit. Towards the latter part of the Middle Ages in Europe, both the State - the State would use the instrument of [[confiscation]] for the first time to satisfy a debt - and the Church - the Church succeeded in acquiring immense quantities of land - were allied against the village community to displace the small landlord and they were successful to the extent that today, the village has become the ideal of the [[individualist]], a place in which every man &quot;does what he wills with his own.&quot; The State has been the most important factor in the evolution of the institution of property be it public or private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=97–111 |quote=No political institution is of greater importance, none has been the subject of greater controversy, than the institution of property.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state and the justice system ====
As a military institution, the State is concerned with the [[allegiance]] of its subjects as disloyalty is a risk to its national security. Thus arises the law of [[treason]]. Criminal acts in general, breaking the peace and treason make up the whole of [[criminal law]] enforced by the State as distinguished from the law enforced by private individuals. State justice has taken the place of clan, feudal, merchant and ecclesiastical justice due to its strength, skill and simplicity. One very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that, until comparatively late in history, the royal courts alone kept written records of their proceedings. The [[trial by jury]] was adopted by the Royal Courts, securing it's popularity and making it a bulwark of liberty. By the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]], with the separation of Church and State, in the most progressive countries, the State succeeded in dealing with the business of administering justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=112–124 |quote=We are so accustomed to look upon the administration of justice as an inevitable duty of the State...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state ====
The making of laws was unknown to primitive societies.

That most persistent of all patriarchal societies, the [[Jewish]], retains to a certain extent its tribal law in the [[Gentile]] cities of the West. This tribal law is the rudimentary idea of law as it presented itself to people in the patriarchal stage of society, it was [[convention (norm)|custom]] or [[observance]] sanctioned by the approval and practice of ancestors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The state of affairs which existed in the 10th century, when every town had its own laws and nations like France, Germany, Spain and other countries had no national law until the end of the 18th century, was brought to an end  by three great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

# '''Records:''' From the early Middle Ages in Europe there come what are called folk-laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal is becoming the State. They are due almost universally to one cause: the desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects. These are not legislation in the sense of law-making but statements or declarations of custom. They are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people. Unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written. It is always possible to point to the exact text and show what it says. Nevertheless, the written text can change by addition with every new edition.
# '''Law Courts:''' By taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all the communities and ignoring the differences, English common law was modeled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the districts of the kingdom. The reason why in the rest of Europe, there was no common law till centuries later is because the State in those countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when England did. One of the shrewdest moves by which the English judges pushed their plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in every case to [[questions of fact]]. At first the jury used to give answers both on law and fact; and being a purely local body, they followed local custom. A famous division came to pass: the province of the judge and the province of the jury.
# '''Fictions:''' Records and Law Courts were valuable in helping the people adapt to law-making but like Fictions, they were slow and imperfect. Though slowly, Fictions work because it is a well known fact that people will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it to the end if the fact is out in the open.

Finally there is the enactment of laws or legislation. When progress and development is rapid, the faster method of [[political representation]] is adopted. This method does not originate in primitive society but in the State need for money and its use of an assembly to raise the same. From the town assembly, a national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang [[Parliament]] all over Europe around the end of the 12th century but not entirely representative or homogeneous for the nobility and the clergy. The clergy had amassed a fortune in land, about one-fifth of all Christendom but at the time, in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Church was following a policy of isolation; they adopted the rule of [[celibacy]] and cut themselves from domestic life; they refused to plead in a secular court; they refused to pay taxes to the State on the grounds that they had already paid it to the [[Pope]]. Since the main object of the king in holding a national assembly was to collect money, the Church could not be left out and so they came to Parliament. The Church did not like it but in most cases they had to come.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The medieval Parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the realm: nobles, clergy, peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular institution mainly because it meant [[taxation]]. Only by the strongest pressure of the Crown were Parliaments maintained during the first century of their existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those countries where the Crown was weak, Parliament ceased to exist. The notion that parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by historical facts. Originally, the representative side of Parliament was solely concerned with money; representation in Parliament was a liability rather than a privilege. It is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose begins to serve another. People who were asked to contribute with large sums of money began to [[petition]]. Pretty soon, sessions in Parliament would turn into bargaining tables, the king granting petitions in exchange for money. However, there were two kinds of petitions, one private and the other public and it was from this last that laws were adopted or [[legislation]] originated. The king as head of State could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful legislation ever took place. Even to the present day, this has always been the basis of all successful legislation: public custom is adopted and enforced by the State.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the early days of political representation, the [[majority]] did not necessarily carry the day and there was very little need for contested [[election]]s but by the beginning of the 15th century, a seat in Parliament was something to be cherished. Historically speaking, the dogma of the equality of man is the result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority but the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another institution of modern times: the [[party system]]. The party system is an elaborate piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each other for the vote of an electorate; its advantage being equal representation interesting a large number of people in politics; it provides effective criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition of a large number of wealthy and educated people guaranteeing a consistent policy in government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

These three institutions: political representation, majority rule and the party system are the basic components of modern political machinery; they are applicable to both central and local governments and are becoming by their adaptability ends in themselves rather than a machinery to achieve some purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=124–139 |quote=As we have before stated (p. 41), the notion that law could be made was unknown to primitive society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state and the executive system ====
The administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government. In the enactment and enforcement of laws, the victory of the State is complete but not so in regards to administration the reason being that it is easy to see the advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration of domestic, religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum by government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Image:Kanzler21a.jpg|thumb|left|The [[German Chancellery]] (Bundeskanzleramt) in [[Berlin]]]]
Originally, the state was a military organization. For many years, it was just a territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of people. Slowly, however, the people gained political representation for none can really be said to be a member of the State without the right of having a voice in the direction of policy making. One of the basic functions of the State in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order; it has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens. To maintain law and order the State develops means of [[communication]]. Historically, the &quot;king's highway&quot; was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal armies not as an incentive to [[commerce]]. In almost all countries, the State maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such as those delineated in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] are rather limited. The State's original function of maintaining law and order within its borders gave rise to [[police]] administration which is a branch of the dispensation of [[Justice]] but on its preventive side, police jurisdiction has a special character of its own, which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial work. In the [[curfew]], the State shows early in history the importance of preventing disorder. In early days, next to maintaining law and order, the State was concerned with the raising of [[revenue]].  It was then useful to the State to establish a [[Technical standard|standard]] of [[weights and measures]] so that value could be generally accepted and finally the State acquired a [[monopoly]] of [[coin]]age. The regulation of labor by the State as one of its functions dates from the 15th century, when [[the Black Plague]] killed around half of the European population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The invariable policy of the State has always been to break down all intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual. This was the policy until [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' was published promoting a strong public reaction against State interference. By its own action, the State raised the issue of the poor or the State relief of the [[indigent]]. The State, of course, did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt with it such as the village, the church and the [[guild]]s, it practically assumed full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it. The Great Poor Law Report of 1834 showed that [[communism]] was widespread in the rural areas of England. In newly developed countries such as the [[colonies]] of the [[British Empire]], the State has refused to take responsibility for the poor and the relief of poverty, although the poor classes lean heavily towards State socialism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Recognizing the great power of the State, it is only natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the people should invoke general State aid.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Political representation has helped to shape State administration. When the voice of the individual can be heard, the danger of arbitrary interference by the State is greatly reduced. To that extent is the increase of State activity popular. There are no hard and fast rules to limit State administration but it is a fallacy to believe that the State is the nation and what the State does is necessarily for the good of the nation. In the first place, even in modern times, the State and the nation are never identical. Even where &quot;universal suffrage&quot; prevails, the fact remains that an extension of State administration means an increased interference of some by others, limiting freedom of action. Even if it is admitted that State and nation are one and the same, it is sometimes difficult to admit that State administration is necessarily good. Finally, the modern indiscriminate advocacy of State administration conceals the fallacy that State officials must necessarily prove more effective in their action than [[private enterprise]]. Herein lies the basic difference between [[Public administration|Public]] and [[Business Administration]]; the first deals with the [[public weal]] while the second deals basically in [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] but both require a great deal of [[education]] and [[ethical code|ethical conduct]] to avoid the mishaps inherent in the relationship not only of business and labor but also the State and the Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=140–150 |quote=We come now to the last, and by far the most difficult department of State activity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The varieties of political experience ====
&lt;!-- [[File:The Ratification of the Treaty of Munster, Gerard Ter hey (1648).jpg|right |thumb |[[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648), resulting from the first modern diplomatic congress, instituted the legal concept of sovereignty.]] deleted file--&gt;
[[File:The Ratification of the Treaty of Munster, Gerard Ter Borch (1648).jpg|thumb|right|280px|''The swearing of the oath of ratification of the treaty of Münster in 1648'' (1648) by [[Gerard ter Borch]].]]

According to Aristotle, States are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to an increase in knowledge of the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned. Generally speaking, no form of government could be considered the best if the best is considered to be the one that is most appropriate under the circumstances. All States are varieties of a single type, the sovereign State. All the [[Great Powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an autocratic government or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a Constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten Constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the Legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. Nevertheless, the written constitution is essential. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are two forms of government, one a strong central government as in France and the other a local government such as the ancient divisions in England that is comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1870 and in the 20th century, [[Australia]]. The Federal States introduced the new principle of agreement or [[contract]]. Compared to a [[federation]], a [[confederation]]'s singular weakness is that it lacks [[judicial power]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the [[American Civil War]], the contention of the Confederate States that a State could [[secede]] from the Union was untenable because of the power enjoyed by the Federal government in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to professor [[A. V. Dicey]] in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Z3gCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=politics+history#v=onepage&amp;q= |pages=1–164 |year=1900 |publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political party===
{{Main|political party}}
A '''political party''' is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within [[government]], usually by participating in [[elections|electoral campaigns]], educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===World politics===
[[File:UNNYbuilding.jpg|right |thumb |[[New York City|NYC]] [[United Nations|UN]]]]
The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the [[Third Reich]] but also the rise and fall of [[communism]]. The development of the [[Atomic bomb]] gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in [[World War II]]. Later, the development of the [[Hydrogen bomb]] became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.

[[Political science]], the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=power+corrupts+and+absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20corrupts%20and%20absolute%20power%20corrupts%20absolutely |page=566 |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=0-19-534334-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] defined politics as &quot;who gets what, when, and how&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Barbara A.|last2=Bardes|first2=Mack C.|last3=Shelley|first3=Steffen W.|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-538-49719-0|edition=2011–2012 Student|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, [[political economy]], which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who has defined politics as &quot;responding to conflict with dialogue,&quot; offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, &quot;Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies,&quot; in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at [[Columbia University]], first occupied by Prussian émigré [[Francis Lieber]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farr |first1=James |last2=Seidelman |first2=Raymond |title=Discipline and history |url=http://books.google.com/?id=e9_jbbroRHsC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Discipline+and+history+Francis+Lieber+Karl+Marx&amp;q= |year=1993 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-06512-7 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=...a chair at Columbia in 1857 as professor of history and political science, the very first of its kind in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectra==

{{Main|Political spectrum}}
Several different [[political spectrum]]s have been proposed.

===Left-right politics===
{{Main|Left–right politics}}
Recently in history, political analysts and politicians divide politics into [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by [[Aristotle]] or [[Hobbes]], for instance), and dates from the [[French Revolution]] era, when those members of the [[National Assembly]] who supported the [[republic]], the common people and a [[secular society]] sat on the left and supporters of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege and the Church sat on the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knapp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]] in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a [[proletarian]] revolution to overthrow the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a [[classless]] and [[Stateless communism|stateless]] society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values [[tradition]] and [[social stratification]] while the left wing often values [[reform]] and [[egalitarianism]], with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with [[social democracy]] or [[Regulated market|regulated capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000932.html#C |author=Daniel J. Levinson |title=CONSERVATISM AND RADICALISM |publisher=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norberto Bobbio]], one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality, while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobbio&quot;&gt;[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, &quot;Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction&quot; (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, [[University of Chicago Press]]. ISBN 0-226-06246-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ideologies, notably [[Christian Democracy]], claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, &quot;In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include [[Fascist]] [[Terza Posizione]] economic politics in Italy, [[Gaullism]] in France, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, and [[National Action Party (Mexico)#&quot;National Action&quot; politics|National Action Politics]] in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Authoritarian-libertarian politics===
[[Authoritarianism]] and [[civil libertarianism|libertarianism]] refer to the amount of individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where &quot;individual [[rights]] and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus Kemmelmeier|title=Individualism, Collectivism, and Authoritarianism in Seven Societies|year=2003|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=304–322|doi=10.1177/0022022103034003005|author-separator=,|display-authors=1|last2=Burnstein|first2=Eugene|last3=Krumov|first3=Krum|last4=Genkova|first4=Petia|last5=Kanagawa|first5=Chie|last6=Hirshberg|first6=Matthew S.|last7=Erb|first7=Hans-Peter|last8=Wieczorkowska|first8=Grazyna|last9=Noels|first9=Kimberly A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while libertarians generally oppose the [[Sovereign state|state]] and hold the [[individual]] as [[sovereign]]. In their purest form, libertarians are [[anarchism|anarchists]], who argue for the total abolition of the state, while the purest authoritarians are [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] who support state control over all aspects of [[society]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

For instance, [[classical liberalism]] (also known as ''[[laissez-faire]] liberalism'',&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; or, in much of the world, simply ''liberalism'') is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and [[limited government]]. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], &quot;the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political corruption==
{{Main|Political corruption}}
{{cquote2|Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it.| [[William Pitt the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;''Safire's political dictionary'', by William Safire, 2008, Oxford University Press US, pg 566&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Political corruption#Graft|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. While corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking|trafficking]], it is not restricted to these activities. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm African corruption 'on the wane'], 10 July 2007, [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning &quot;rule by thieves&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
