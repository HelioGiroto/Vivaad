'''Ukraine without Kuchma!''' or '''UbK''' ({{lang-uk|Україна без Кучми!}}; ''Ukrayina bez Kuchmy!'') was a mass [[protest]] [[political campaign|campaign]] preceding the [[Orange Revolution]] that took place in [[Ukraine]] in 2000&amp;ndash;2001. Unlike the Orange Revolution the UbK was effectively extinguished by the government enforcement units followed by numerous arrests of the opposition and the Ukrainian-speaking participants. Seeking the criminal responsibility for those events was renewed with the election of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] as the [[President of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2010/12/15/5674619/ The Procurator General (General Prosecutor) &quot;digs up&quot; after Shkil and other participants of UbK (Ukrianian Pravda, Dec.15, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot; was organized by the [[parliamentary opposition|political opposition]], influenced by the infamous [[Cassette Scandal]], presidential elections of 1999, and aimed mainly to demand the resignation of the newly elected [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]]. The protests did not disappear untraced and resulted in consolidation of the democratic opposition which led to the [[Orange Revolution]].

==Beginning of the protests==

The first and barely noticed action of the campaign took place on 15 December 2000 on [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Maydan Nezalezhnosti (''Independence Square'')]], the main plaza of [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv''), the Ukrainian [[Capital (political)|capital]]. The protesters sought Kuchma's stepping down and proper investigations of the disappearance of journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]].

==Growth of political support==

Soon, the initiative grew into a mass campaign widely supported by students and opposition activists. The opposition parties, having lost the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1999|1999 Ukrainian presidential election]] shortly before the scandal, considered the campaign as a natural reason for unification and reinforcement. The protests were organized as a network [[coalition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=X0PAQrsx-6YC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22Ukraine+without+Kuchma%22+Tymoshenko+Lutsenko&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=_UhdTdGlFo-t4QaVktioCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ukraine%20without%20Kuchma%22%20Tymoshenko%20Lutsenko&amp;f=false Revolution in Orange:The Origins of Ukraine’s Democratic Breakthrough] by [[Anders Aslund]] &amp; [[Michael McFaul]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], 2006, ISBN 978-0-87003-221-9 (page 33)&lt;/ref&gt; and guided by collective leadership. However, [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]{{Dubious|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ciKIBazTof8C&amp;pg=PA351&amp;dq=Ukraine+without+Kuchma&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=XkZdTZv9A8aXOorm6MwK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukraine%20without%20Kuchma&amp;f=false Central and East European Politics:From Communism to Democracy] by [[Sharon Wolchik]] and [[Jane Curry]], [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]], 2007, ISBN 978-0-7425-4068-2 (page 351)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ck7j26KuoKcC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Ukraine+without+Kuchma+Tymoshenko&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=j0ddTe3-Jt6g4QbRrbmKCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukraine%20without%20Kuchma%20Tymoshenko&amp;f=false The Colour Revolutions in the Former Soviet Republics:Successes and Failures] by [[Donnacha Ó Beacháin]] and Abel [[Polese]], [[Routledge]], 2010, ISBN 978-0-415-58060-1 (page 34)&lt;/ref&gt; (at the time leading the [[National Salvation Committee]]),&lt;ref name=Europe&gt;[http://books.google.nl/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C&amp;pg=PA4295&amp;dq=National+Salvation+Committee+Tymoshenko&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Europa World Year Book 2], [[Routledge]], 2004, ISBN 978-1-85743-255-8, page 4295&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] (at that time representing the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]) and independent [[Volodymyr Chemerys]] became prominent leaders of the action. More than a dozen [[political parties]] supported the campaign, among them Socialists, the influential right-centrist [[People's Movement of Ukraine]] (both represented in Ukraine's [[parliament]], [[Verkhovna Rada]]), extreme-right [[UNA-UNSO]] and others. The leaders put aside the political differences between such mutually antagonistic groups and concentrated on anti-authoritarian protest and demands for political freedom. They also united in acceptance of broad{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} [[Western world|Western]] support for the campaign.

==Mass phase of the protests==

Students and youth constituted the majority of participants, although the campaign gained wide public support. Protesters set up a makeshift [[tent]] encampment on the [[sidewalk]]s of the plaza and neighbouring Khreschatyk Street. Active supporters were living or taking shifts in the tents, while many others occasionally visited the rallies. [[Discotheque]]s and concerts of liberal-oriented musicians were organized on the plaza. Student [[Strike action|strike]]s took place at some [[universities]]. [[Lviv]] and some other cities joined the campaign, but to a lesser extent.

==Authorities' efforts to tackle the protests==

Frightened by the scale and unusual [[tactic (method)|tactics]] of the campaign, the authorities repeatedly tried to destroy the camp using police and masked [[agent provocateur|provocateurs]], but avoided mass clashes. Trying to stop the protests, [[Mayor of Kiev|Kiev's mayor]] [[Oleksandr Omelchenko]] ordered a major reconstruction of the plaza, fencing most of it off. This prevented the protesters from gathering large crowds, but barely affected the campaign. Authorities in some other cities adopted the tactic, announcing &quot;construction work&quot; on their main squares, usually with no activity behind the newly-installed fences.

==Controversial political impact on Cabinet==

Lacking general unity and forming a minority in the Verkhovna Rada, opposition politicians could provide protesters with only limited support, such as initiating a mock [[impeachment]] of Kuchma and making parliamentary protest. Pro-Western [[Liberalism|liberals]] were constrained in actions since they were backing up Kuchma's [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]], highly-popular reformist [[Viktor Yushchenko]], in his efforts to oppose pro-President [[Oligarchy|oligarch]]s. The campaigners called on him to support their demands and take the lead. But Yushchenko refused, instead co-signing a highly critical public address with together with Kuchma. Some influential [[News media|media]] became [[bias]]ed in favor of the authorities.

Leonid Kuchma received three leaders of the campaign, heard out their daring accusations and demands, but refused to satisfy any. According to Volodymyr Chemerys, the President claimed that he would sack the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|police Minister]] [[Yuriy Kravchenko|Kravchenko]] (accused in Gongadze's abduction), as protesters demanded, if only Yushchenko suggested this dismissal officially as Prime Minister - which never happened.

==Violent ending==
{{main|UbK March Unrest}}
Occasional mass demonstrations were organized in front of government buildings. The organizers claimed a strategy of [[non-violent resistance]] but failed to sustain it. On 9 March 2001, the birthday of [[Taras Shevchenko]], there were few clashes between protesters and [[riot police]], and dozens were injured: arguably the most violent and populous riots in Ukraine's modern history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/videos/2011/03/9/30212/ 2001: mass clashes with militsia (Ukrainian Pravda, Mar. 9, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides of the incident blamed the other. Protest leaders argued that police provoked the last and most violent clash near the presidential palace, by blocking a procession and infiltrating it with provocateurs. Indeed, militarized right-wing extremists led the fight. In response, authorities conducted mass arrests in the city, focussing on [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]-speaking youth. Several opposition MPs took advantage of their [[parliamentary immunity]] by storming [[police]] stations and [[Police car|cars]] in efforts to release the apprehended.

The public impression of the incident led to a gradual decrease of support for the campaign. Soon, it was declared finished. A group of active participants of the March 9 clashes was convicted and imprisoned.

==Long-term effects==

Later that year, Prime Minister [[Viktor Yushchenko]] was sacked by President Kuchma and joined the opposition. In [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 parliamentary election]], he led the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] (''Nasha Ukraina'') [[electoral coalition]] that won the vote, but failed to form a majority in the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Many UBK leaders were united in that coalition, while others participated in the Socialist Party and [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc|Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc]](the successor of the [[National Salvation Committee]]&lt;ref name=Europe/&gt;), which later became the political allies of Our Ukraine.

Yushchenko's campaign in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] was significantly influenced by the [[slogan]]s, tactics and general spirit of UBK. The [[Orange Revolution]], provoked by massive [[electoral fraud]] during the vote, happened in a manner very similar to 2001 campaign and was led mainly by the same politicians and activists.

After becoming the President, Yushchenko appointed [[Yuriy Lutsenko]], one of the leaders of campaign, [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Minister of the Internal Affairs]] (i.e. the chief of the [[militsiya]]) and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] was appointed [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tymoshenko.com.ua&quot;&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Tymoshenko_Profile/1291005.html Ukraine's Gold-Plaited Comeback Kid], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (September 23, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=[[President of Ukraine|Presidential decree]]|number=144/2005|law=144/2005|name=

The main events and general trends of the UBK campaign are studied in “The Face of Protest” TV [[Documentary film|documentary]] ({{lang-uk|’’Обличчя протесту’’ – ‘’Oblytchia Protestu’’}}) made in 2003 by Andriy Schevchenko. The film is based on the various TV footages of the protests and interviews of the participants on both sides (from campaign leaders to [[militsiya|militsioners]]).
