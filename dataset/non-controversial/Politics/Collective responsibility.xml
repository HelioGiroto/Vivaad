'''Collective responsibility''' is a concept or doctrine, according to which individuals are to be held responsible for other people's actions by tolerating, ignoring, or harboring them, without actively collaborating in these actions.

==In religion==
{{see also|Corporate personality}}
This concept is found in the [[Old Testament]] (or Tanakh), some examples include the account of the [[Noah's Ark|Flood]], the [[Tower of Babel]], [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and in some interpretations, the [[Book of Joshua]]'s [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]]. In those records entire communities were punished on the act of the vast majority of their members, however it is impossible to state that there were no innocent people, or children too young to be responsible for their deeds.

The practice of blaming the [[Jews]] for [[Jesus]]' death is the longest example of collective responsibility.  In this case, the blame was cast not only on the Jews of the time but upon successive generations. This comes from Matthew 27:25-66 New International Version (NIV) 25 All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”

==Collective punishment==
{{main|collective punishment}}
Collective responsibility in the form of collective punishment is often used as a disciplinary measure in closed institutions, e.g. [[boarding schools]] (punishing a whole class for the actions of a single unknown pupil), military units, prisons (juvenile and adult), psychiatric facilities, etc. The effectiveness and severeity of this measure may vary greatly, but it often breeds distrust and isolation among their members, and is almost always a sign of [[authoritarian]] tendencies in the institution or its home society. For example, in the Soviet [[Gulag]]s, all members of a ''brigada'' (work unit) were punished for bad performance of any of its members.

Collective punishment is also practiced in situation of war, [[economic sanctions]], etc., presupposing the existence of [[collective guilt]]. Collective guilt, or guilt by association, is the controversial collectivist idea that groups of humans can bear guilt above and beyond the guilt of individual members, and hence an individual holds responsibility for what other members of their group have done, even if they themselves didn't do this. Contemporary systems of criminal law accept the principle that guilt shall only be personal. Others view groups as being entities in themselves (an [[entitative]] group), capable of holding guilt or responsibility independent of any of the group's members.

[[Shooting of the Romanov family|The mass shootings of Nicholas II's family]] in 1918 may be regarded as an example of such an approach. Another example is when [[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe|ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe]] were held collectively responsible for [[Nazi]] crimes, resulting in numerous atrocities against the German population, including killings (see [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II]] and [[Beneš decrees]]).

==In business==
As the business practices known as [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) and [[sustainability]] mature and converge with the responsibilities of governments and citizens, the term &quot;collective responsibility&quot; is beginning to be more widely used.

Collective responsibility is widely applied in corporations, where the entire workforce is held responsible for failure to achieve corporate targets (for example, profit targets), irrespective of the performance of individuals or teams which may have achieved or overachieved within their area. [[Collective punishment]], even including measures that actually further harm the prospect of achieving targets, is applied as a measure to 'teach' the workforce. 
Where corporate targets are achieved, however, rewards are carefully targeted to those perceived by management to have contributed, often disproportionately concentrated at senior management levels.
The impact on morale of this practice is commonly ignored as it is not measurable on balance sheets.

==In culture==
The concept of collective responsibility is present in literature, most notably in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s &quot;[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]&quot;, a poem telling the tale of a ship's crew who died of thirst because they approved of one crew member's killing of an [[albatross]].
1959's ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and 1983's prison drama ''[[Bad Boys (1983 film)|Bad Boys]]'' depict collective responsibility and punishment.
