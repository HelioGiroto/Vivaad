      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77745">[[Suffrage]], the '''right to vote''' in a particular country, generally derives from [[citizenship]].  In most countries, the right to vote is reserved to those who possess the [[citizenship]] of the country in question. Some countries, however, have extended suffrage rights to non-citizens.  Suffrage rights extended to non-citizens are often restricted or limited in some ways, with the details of the restrictions or limitations varying from one country to another.

==Overview==
In some cases, the [[United States]] being one such case, some [[Administrative division|subnational]] entities have granted voting rights to non-citizens. Conceptions of subnational citizenship have been reasons to grant this right to those normally excluded from it.  Other countries have granted voting rights to non-citizens who hold citizenship of a country which is a fellow member of a [[Supranationalism|supranational]] organization (e.g. members of the [[European Union]]).  In a few cases, countries grant voting rights to citizens and non-citizens alike.

In a 2003 paper, David C. Earnest (then a graduate research assistant at [[George Washington University]]) surveyed practice of voting rights for resident [[Alien (law)|aliens]] (or [[immigrant]]s), concluding that although the practice is surprisingly widespread, the details varied considerably from country to country.&lt;ref name=earnest2003a&gt;{{Cite journal

In another paper, Earnest compared voting rights for resident aliens in 25 democracies, grouping them into five categories as follows:&lt;ref name=earnest2003b&gt;{{Cite journal

*0: No rights (Australia by [[Grandfathering|grandfathered]] franchise after 1984, Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, Denmark before 1977, Finland before 1981, France, Germany except for 1989-90, Greece, Ireland before 1962, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands before 1979, Norway before 1978, Spain before 1985, Sweden before 1976, the United Kingdom before 1949, and the United States before 1968).
*1: Rights granted only by subnational governments (Canada from 1975 to the present; West Germany in 1989, the Netherlands from 1979 to 1981, Switzerland from 1960 to the present, and the United States from 1968 to the present).
*2: Local rights, discriminatory (Denmark from 1977 to 1980; Finland from 1981 to 1990; Israel from 1960 to the present; and Norway from 1978 to 1981).
*3: National rights, discriminatory (Australia from 1960 to 1984, Canada from 1960 to 1974, Ireland from 1985 to the present, New Zealand from 1960 to 1974, Portugal, the United Kingdom).
*4: Local rights, nondiscriminatory (Denmark after 1980, Finland after 1990, Hungary, Ireland 1963 to 1984, the Netherlands after 1981, Norway after 1981, Spain after 1985, Sweden after 1976).
*5: National rights, nondiscriminatory (New Zealand after 1975; Uruguay for 15 years-resident, since 1952)

After receiving his [[Doctorate]] in 2004, Dr. Earnest published a further paper examining the political incorporation
of aliens in three European democracies: Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=earnest2005&gt;{{Cite journal

==Supranational groupings==
A number of separate supranational groupings of countries exist, and membership in some of these groupings may involve multinational agreements and treaties in which member countries agree to some degree of reciprocity regarding voting rights. Some individual countries are members of more than one supranational groupings, and some supranational groupings of countries are members of other supranational groupings of countries.

===European Union (EU)===

The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] imposed [[reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] inside the [[European Union]] concerning [[voting rights]] in [[local election]]s; this already existed for the [[European elections]]. In several European states, the [[public debate]] on the right of foreigners to vote was therefore renewed, as some foreign residents had the right to vote (European foreign residents) while others, non-Europeans, did not. As a result of this debate, [[Luxembourg]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Belgium]] extended the right to vote, in different manners, to all foreign residents (which was already the case in [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Netherlands]]).

The [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Baltic Sea States Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://suffrage-universel.be/vo/euvocbss.htm Voting Rights and the Right to Stand for Public Office], Council of the Baltic Sea States, February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; have produced various recommendations in favor of the introduction of the right to vote and of [[eligibility]] to all foreign residents in local elections. The 1992 Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/144.htm 1992 Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level]&lt;/ref&gt; from the Council of Europe, is opened to signatures and [[ratification]]s.

===Commonwealth of Nations (CN)===
The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (CN), usually known as the ''Commonwealth'' and formerly as the ''British Commonwealth'', is a voluntary association of over 50 independent sovereign states, most of which are former colonies of the [[British Empire]]. A few Commonwealth countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] itself, allow [[Commonwealth citizen]]s (formerly &quot;[[British subject]]s&quot;) voting and/or eligibility rights at all levels, either with or without specific restrictions not applying to local citizens: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Malawi]] (all foreign residents, not only Commonwealth citizens), [[Mauritius]], [[Namibia]] (all foreign residents, not only Commonwealth citizens), [[New Zealand]] (all foreign residents, before 1975 only Commonwealth citizens), [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].

==Individual national cases==
===Antigua and Barbuda===
(CN member) [[Commonwealth citizen]]s may vote and are eligible for parliamentary elections, but &quot;allegiance to a foreign State&quot; is a criterion for ineligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Argentina===
Article 61 of the Constitution of the city of [[Buenos Aires]] states that &quot;''Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and not accumulative. The foreign residents enjoy this right, with the correlative obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in this district, in the terms established by the law''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Australia===
(CN member) National voting rights were granted to [[Commonwealth citizen]]s from 1960 to 1984.&lt;ref name=earnest2003b/&gt; In 1984, 1947 legislation which had allowed non-citizen voting was repealed, but voters registered before 1984 retained their voting rights.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{Cite web

===Austria===
(EU member) In 2002, non-citizens were granted voting rights in state elections in Vienna, but the decision was overturned by the Constitutional Court in June 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Belgium===
(EU member) European Union residents in [[Belgium]] were given the right to vote and to be candidates for the [[European Parliament election, 1994 (Belgium)|1994 European Parliament election]], then for the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2000|2000 Municipal elections]]. They had however first only the right to be elected as municipal councillors, not at the executive level ([[schepen]]/alderman or [[burgomaster]]/mayor), the alderman level was only opened for them from the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2006|2006 Municipal elections]], the mayor level may not be opened to them because it includes a function of administrative police. In conformance with EU regulations, EU residents are submitted to the same residence conditions as Belgian nationals, i.e. residence in the commune at the closure date of the electoral roll (July 31 for the municipal elections).

In 2004, voting rights in municipal elections were extended to non-European Union foreigners living in Belgium, with certain conditions attached.&lt;ref name=earnest2005/&gt; Non-EU foreigners must have been living in Belgium for at least five years before becoming entitled to vote. Any non-EU foreigner who wants to take advantage of the new legislation must also sign an oath of allegiance to the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian constitution]], formally agree to respect the country’s laws and sign the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Also, non-EU foreigners are not allowed to stand as candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

As [[Compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]] in Belgium, and all electors are automatically on the [[electoral roll]]s (extracted from a computerized National Register&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

At the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2006|2006 Municipal elections]], only 20.9% (110,973 out of 529,878) of the potential EU voters enlisted (17.6%, or 87,858 out of 498,315 at the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2000|2000 Municipal elections]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===France===
(EU member) EU residents have voting and eligibility rights for local and European elections. 

In [[France]], the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] has discussed extending the right to vote to foreigners since the early 1980s (it was the 80th proposition of the [[110 Propositions for France]] electoral program of 1981), but as it needed a [[French Constitution|Constitutional]] change it was felt that it would have been blocked by the [[Senate of France|Senate]]. The alternative would have been a referendum, but as it was generally assumed that a majority of the public opinion was against it, it could have resulted in a defeat of the government. On May 3, 2000, a bill was voted on by the National Assembly by the [[Plural Left|Left]] and 2 centrist [[Union for French Democracy]] deputies, but it was blocked by the Senate.

Polls suggest that a narrow majority of the public opinion is now favorable to it and even [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and a few other prominent right-wing politicians like [[Philippe Séguin]] (candidate to the mayorship of [[Paris]] in 2001) [[Gilles de Robien]] and [[Jean-Louis Borloo]] have stated publicly that they personally supported it, but that they would respect the overwhelming opposition to it within their own parties. In January 2006 left-wing senators again tried to put the bill to allow foreigners to vote on the agenda, but the right-wing majority again blocked it.

In the late 1990s-early 2000s some symbolic local referendums on the subject were organized either under the auspices of the [[Ligue des droits de l'homme]] or of the municipal authorities, one of them in [[Saint-Denis]], at the initiative of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] mayor. The [[Cergy]] administrative court ruled in 2006 that the referendums were not legally binding. Other communist or socialist-led municipalities organized such referendums, including [[Le Blanc-Mesnil]] (PCF), [[Bondy]] (PS), [[Stains]] (PCF), [[La Courneuve]] (PCF) and [[Aubervilliers]] (PCF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Germany===
(EU member) In February 1989, the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] approved local voting rights for Danish, Irish, Norwegian, Dutch, Swedish, and Swiss 5-year residents; the state of [[Hamburg]] approved local voting for 8-year residents. Both were struck down as unconstitutional by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] on October 31, 1990 (Ruling 83, 37), considering that the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], when stating in its article 28 that for districts and municipalities &quot;the people&quot; must be represented by election, only meant by &quot;the people&quot; the German citizens resident on the territory of that administrative unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Hong Kong===
Voting is a relatively recent right in [[Hong Kong]], initiated only towards the end of the [[Colonial Hong Kong|British colonial period]] (1842–1997) and enlarged{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} somewhat after handover.  For this territory, the right to vote accompanies a person’s permanent resident status in Hong Kong, not their citizenship.&lt;ref name=HKimmigrantvoting /&gt;

The right of Hong Kong permanent residents to vote is guaranteed in Article 26 of the Basic Law, where nationality is not even mentioned. And as stipulated in Article 24, permanent residents include foreign persons who have taken up permanent residency in Hong Kong for more than 7 years and other persons (regardless of nationality) who have right of abode in Hong Kong only.

While voting by persons holding foreign passports has gone largely unchallenged, there is some indication that increasing appeals to patriotism may make non-citizen voting an issue of debate in the future.&lt;ref name=HKimmigrantvoting&gt;{{Cite web

On April 18, 2008, Conor Lenihan, the Minister for Integration, announced that full voting rights including for the President and [[Dáil Éireann]] would be extended to all EU migrants. This has yet to come in to force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/18/ireland.eu ''EU migrants living in Ireland to be allowed to vote'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In 1960, non-citizen voting rights in local elections were granted for holders of a permanent resident card (&quot;blue card&quot;).&lt;ref name=earnest2003b/&gt; Most permanent residents, a status created by the 1952 ''Entry into Israel Law'', are migrants, but other groups fall into the same category.

Following the 1967 annexation of [[East Jerusalem]], Israel conducted a census on June 26, 1967 in the annexed territory and granted permanent Israeli residency to those present at the time of the census (those not present lost the right to reside in Jerusalem). They can still vote in municipal elections and play a role in the administration of the city. At the end of 2005, 93% of the Arab population of East Jerusalem had permanent residency and 5% had Israeli citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2007n/11_07_084b.doc |title=Selected Statistics on Jerusalem Day 2007 (Hebrew) |date=May 14, 2007 |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]|format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the annexed [[Golan Heights]], fewer than 10% of the Druze are Israeli citizens, the remainder hold Syrian citizenship and have the status of permanent residents.

In 2003 the [[The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem|Black Hebrews]] were granted permanent residency status by the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Italy===
(EU member) EU residents have voting and eligibility rights for municipal (and inframunicipal) and European elections.&lt;ref&gt;art. 11 of the Law of 6 February 1996, n. 52, “Recepimento della direttiva 94/80/CE del Consiglio sull’elettorato attivo e passivo dei cittadini dell’Unione europea residenti in Italia nelle consultazioni per l’elezione dei consigli comunali” and Legislative Decree of 12 Avril 1996, n. 197 “Attuazione della direttiva 94/80/CE concernente le modalità di esercizio del diritto di voto e di eleggibilità alle elezioni comunali per i cittadini dell’Unione Europea che risiedono in uno Stato membro di cui non hanno la cittadinanza”&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the extension of local voting rights to non-EU residents (''[[extracomunitari]]'') resurfaces from time to time. A proposition included in the programme of the [[Prodi I Cabinet]] in 1997 had to be withdrawn because of the opposition from the Commission for Constitutional Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettredelacitoyennete.org/italie26.htm La Lettre de la citoyenneté], n°26, March–April 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettredelacitoyennete.org/italie30.htm La Lettre de la citoyenneté], n°30, November–December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Although the parties that support the Berlusconi governments oppose this extension, [[Gianfranco Fini]], leader of the post-fascist [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], supported it e.g. in 2004 and 2008, when he was president of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Miraglia, [http://www.lettredelacitoyennete.org/italie67.htm Même Gianfranco Fini est pour le droit de vote des immigrés], La Lettre de la citoyenneté, n°67, January–February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Jozsef, [http://www.letemps.ch/Facet/print/Uuid/164c2d32-ee4d-11dd-b87c-1c3fffea55dc/Gianfranco_Fini_le_recentreur_de_la_droite_italienne Gianfranco Fini, le recentreur de la droite italienne], [[Le Temps]], 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some elective local consultative council for foreigners, notably in [[Rome]], and since 2005 several municipal councils voted motions asking for the extension of voting rights to non-EU residents.

===Japan===
Currently the [[Constitution of Japan]] defines voting rights as only for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/c01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, some [[permanent resident]]s from Korea (see &quot;[[Koreans in Japan]]&quot;) petitioned the [[Supreme Court]] to gain voting rights. The Supreme Court declined in 1995, but it also declared that it is not prohibited to do so. In addition, one of justices expressed that the foreigners should be guaranteed the voting right at local elections (to be checked for accuracy).

During the 2009 legislative elections campaign, it appeared that the [[New Komeito Party]], the [[Japanese Communist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] were clearly in favor of extending local voting rights to foreign residents, while the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] was totally opposed to it and the [[Democratic Party of Japan]] was divided on this matter, but rather in favor of the extension of voting rights, so gaining the support of the Korean Residents Union in Japan ([[Mindan]]) for many of its candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Setsuko Kamiya, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090827a3.html Mindan fights for foreigners' local-level suffrage], [[The Japan Times]], August 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, The Democratic Party is considering making a draft law to permit this.

===Jersey===
The right to vote in [[Jersey]] is determined by residency, not citizenship, citizens of any state may vote in Jersey elections provided they fulfill the other requirements for electoral registration.

===Netherlands===
(EU member) In 1979 non-citizens were allowed to vote in local elections in Rotterdam.  This was expanded nationwide in 1985 (though necessary reforms meant aliens did not vote in local elections until 1986). Residents without Dutch nationality are not allowed to vote in national elections, only in regional elections (i.e. city, province) and European elections if aliens are holding a passport from an European country.&lt;ref name=earnest2003b/&gt;&lt;ref name=earnest2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

===New Zealand===
(CN member) National voting rights were granted in 1853 to all British subjects who met the other qualifications (e.g. property), to some non-citizens from 1960 to 1974, and to all permanent residents from 1975 onwards, see [[History of voting in New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=earnest2003b/&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; However, permanent residents cannot gain election to parliament unless they hold New Zealand citizenship. One party-list candidate in the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 election]], [[Kelly Chal]], could not assume her position as a member of parliament because she did not meet that criterion. Although the former MP [[Matt Robson]], was an Australian citizen at the time of his election, he was able to stand for election, because he was registered as a voter before 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_128859&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?ObjectID=128859 |title=No longer a 'foreign' minister |author=Bingham, Eugene |date=5 April 2000 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Voting and eligibility rights were granted to [[Nordic Passport Union]] country citizens with a 3 years residence condition for [[Municipalities of Norway|municipal]] and  [[Counties of Norway|county]] elections in 1978. These rights were extended to all foreign residents in 1983. The voters enrollment is automatic. As a consequence of the 1983 extension, a 1990 bilateral treaty between Norway and [[Spain]] granted voting rights in Spain for Norwegian citizens. Currently, residing citizens of [[Nordic Passport Union]] countries may vote in local elections on the same basis as Norwegian citizens without any length of residence condition.

===Portugal===
In 1971, [[Brazil]]ian residents were granted voting and eligibility rights in Portugal for [[Municipalities of Portugal|municipal]] elections with a 2 years residency requirement and 4 years for eligibility. In 1982, this provision was extended to [[Cape Verde]] residents in the frame of reciprocity between [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]. It was again extended in 1997, under a general rule of reciprocity but with a 4 years residency requirement, to [[Peru]]vian and [[Uruguay]]an residents with eligibility (after 5 years of residency) and to residents from [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Estonia]], [[Israel]], [[Norway]] and [[Venezuela]] without eligibility.&lt;ref name=waldrauch2003/&gt;

The 3 years reside condition was suppressed in 1997 for residents from EU (in conformity with the European legislation) and the [[Nordic Passport Union]].

===Switzerland===
Some voting rights have been granted to non-citizens by subnational governments, the first being Neuchâtel in 1849, then Jura in 1978 and several others afterwards.

Because [[Switzerland]] is a federal state with three different levels – the Confederation, the 26 cantons and their local communes – non-citizen voting rights vary greatly depending on the individual entity. Foreigners may not cast ballots on the national level, but they may be entitled to vote and, in some cases, to run for office on the cantonal or communal level. Five [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] have already recognized the right of foreigners to vote ([[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Vaud]] in 2003, [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] in 2004, [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] in 2005), plus three, [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] (1995), [[Graubünden]] (2003) and [[Basel-Stadt]] (2005) which accord to each municipality the authority to decide on the subject. Some [[referendum]]s unsuccessfully took place in other cantons.&lt;ref name=earnest2003b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

{{Main|Right of foreigners to vote in the United States }}

More than 20 states or territories, including colonies before the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], admitted foreigners' right to vote for all elections. As of May 2010, however, most of those foreign voting and office holding rights have been repealed and, {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, no foreigner was allowed vote at the national or state level in the US, and only a handful of local governments allowed foreigners to vote.{{cn|date=September 2012|reason=unsupported assertion added in 2010 -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Right_of_foreigners_to_vote&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=372932937}}  These few foreign voting rights at the local level have been granted to non-citizens by [[U.S. states|state]] governments from 1968 onwards.

In Venezuela, the right to vote in municipal, parish (county), and state elections extends to foreigners over the age of eighteen who have ten years’ residency or more in the country. The provision for non-citizen voting appears in Article 64 of the Venezuelan Constitution of 1999, and has its constitutional roots in a 1983 Amendment to the previous Constitution of 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
