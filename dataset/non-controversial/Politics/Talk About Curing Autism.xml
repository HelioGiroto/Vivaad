'''Talk About Curing Autism''' (TACA) is a [[nonprofit]] 501c3 organization founded in 2000 and based in [[Irvine, California]] by Lisa Ackerman when her son was diagnosed and the doctor gave her no hope.  TACA provides information, resources, and support to families affected by [[autism]].  TACA aims to reduce the lag time between [[Autism spectrum|autism diagnosis]] and effective treatments and endeavors to strengthen the [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autism community]] by connecting families and professionals who can help them, allowing them to share stories and information to help people with autism be the best they can be.

Currently, TACA holds monthly meetings featuring speakers in many states across the United States.

==National spokesperson==
In September, 2007, TACA announced the appointment of its new national spokesperson, [[Jenny McCarthy]], whose son Evan was diagnosed with an [[autism spectrum]] disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacanow.org/jenny/jenny-mccarthy-autism.htm Our New Spokesperson, Jenny McCarthy.] TACA.  Retrieved on 2007-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiser, Paige. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20071018/ai_n21065459 Actors in action; Chicago-rooted stars use lofty platform to help.]
''Chicago Sun-Times'',  October 18, 2007.  Retrieved on 2007-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deardorff, Julie. [http://www.startribune.com/1244/story/1517673.html McCarthy puts hope in lexicon of autism.] ''Chicago Tribune'', October 30, 2007.  Retrieved on 2007-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Evan's recovery from autistic symptoms is described in his mother's concurrently released fourth book, ''Louder than Words – A Mother’s Journey in Healing Autism''.

In 2010, Jenny McCarthy distanced herself from her prior claims that childhood vaccines were to blame for her son's disorder.  Jenny now says she wants vaccinations &quot;better researched&quot; — rather than getting rid of them altogether, as she previously promoted.

== Pacific Life Foundation Grant==
In January 2009, TACA received a $300,000 grant from the Newport Beach-based [[Pacific Life Foundation]].  TACA launched three new programs for Orange County, California families including a Spanish-language program, the addition on an in house advocate to provide education, training and support for families, and scholarships that would allow families to procure independent assessments for their children.  All of these programs are offered at no charge to families affected by families.

As a result, TACA now has a Spanish-language section of their website, [http://espanol.tacanow.org En Español], which is a resource for Spanish-speaking parents of children with autism regardless of their location.

==Controversy==

TACA, as an organization, prominently supports the research of [[Andrew Wakefield]], a former physician and autism researcher who was recently shown to have falsified information about patients who participated in the study that claimed a link between autism and vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/01/05/health/AP-EU-MED-Autism-Fraud.html?_r=1 ''New York Times'', 5 January 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The British Medical Journal reported that Wakefield was paid more than $675,000 by a lawyer seeking to sue vaccine makers on the basis that children had developed autism after receiving MMR vaccinations. An award-winning investigation by [[Brian Deer]] for [[The Sunday Times]] of London, the UK’s [[Channel 4]] TV network, and the [[British Medical Journal]], revealed that the children's medical records show that some clearly had symptoms of developmental problems long before getting their shots, and several had no autism diagnosis at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Wakefield was later barred from practicing medicine in the United Kingdom by the General Medical Council, stating that he was found to have acted &quot;dishonestly and irresponsibly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8695267.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, and 41 separate studies listed by the American Academy of Pediatrics which show no link between vaccines and autism [http://www.aap.org/immunization/families/faq/vaccinestudies.pdf], TACA continues to promote Andrew Wakefield, his books, and the stance that childhood immunizations are a significant contributor to autism spectrum disorders.
