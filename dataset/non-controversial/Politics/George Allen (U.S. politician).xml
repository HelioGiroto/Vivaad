'''George Felix Allen''' (born March 8, 1952) is a former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Virginia]], and the son of former [[National Football League|NFL]] head coach [[George Allen (football)|George Allen]]. Allen served Virginia in the state legislature, as the [[List of Governors of Virginia|67th]] [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]], and in both bodies of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], winning election to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2000|2000]]. Allen's re-election in the [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006|2006]] race seemed likely until he was accused of using a racist epithet when referring to a staffer of his opponent, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jim Webb]]. Allen lost the election to Webb by fewer than 10,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mulkern |first=Anne C. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/06/02/02greenwire-george-allen-returns-tries-to-counter-democrat-78713.html |title=George Allen returns, tries to counter Democrats on climate |publisher=The New York Times |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen now serves on the [[Rancho del Cielo|Reagan Ranch]] Board of Governors of [[Young America's Foundation]] where he is a Reagan Ranch Presidential Scholar. Allen was the Republican candidate in the [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2012|2012 election]] for the Senate, which he lost to [[Tim Kaine]].

==Early life, education, and early law career (1952-1982)==
Allen was born in [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], California. Allen's father, [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Herbert Allen]], was a legendary [[National Football League|NFL]] coach who was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=14 |title=George Allen|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Football Hall of Fame]] |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2006 senatorial campaign it was revealed that Allen's mother, Henrietta [[Lumbroso]], was born to [[Sephardic Jewish]] parents in [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lumbrosofamily&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=New 'N Word' Woe For George Allen|publisher=CBS News|date=September 26, 2006|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/26/politics/main2039589.shtml|accessdate=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger sister, Jennifer, an author and correspondent for [[NFL Network]], and two brothers, including [[Bruce Allen (American football)|Bruce Allen]], the current general manager of the [[Washington Redskins]] and former general manager of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].  He and his family lived there until 1957. They moved to the suburbs of Chicago after George Sr. got a job with the [[Chicago Bears]]. Then, the family moved back to Southern California ([[Palos Verdes]]) in 1966 after Allen's father was named head coach of the [[Los Angeles Rams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.about.com/od/arenafootball/l/bl_georgeallen.htm |title=George Allen: Pro Football Hall of Fame Head Coach |publisher=[[About.com]] |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen graduated in 1970 from [[Palos Verdes High School]], where he was a member of the [[falconry]] club and the car club. He was also [[quarterback]] of the varsity [[football team]].

Allen attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], for a year. His father had in the meantime taken over the head coaching duties with the Washington Redskins in 1970 and the younger Allen transferred to the [[University of Virginia]], in 1971, where he received a B.A. degree with distinction in history in 1974. He was class president in his fourth year at UVA.

After graduating, Allen completed a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in 1977. In 1976 he was the chairman of the &quot;Young Virginians for [[Ronald Reagan]]&quot;.

==Virginia House of Delegates (1982-1991)==
===Elections===
Allen's first race for the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] was in 1979, two years after he graduated from law school. He placed third in a field of four candidates. Allen states that he lost because he wasn't himself and was listening to the advice of his campaign manager who suggested he wear [[brogues|wingtips]] instead of his usual [[cowboy boots]]. 

He ran again in 1983 with the cowboy boots and won the election, defeating incumbent Democrat James B. Murray, whose 24th district was eliminated after redistricting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&amp;p_theme=wt&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0EF5B8FC5840C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Coach Allen would love this fight |publisher=The Washington Times |date=September 27, 1991 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dela.state.va.us/dela/MemBios.nsf/735bd5cd47938ad585256c23006d3f8a/e4ef4e14c8ea301085256b35005fcf1a?OpenDocument |title=Welcome to the Virginia House of Delegates |publisher=Dela.state.va.us |date=1920-07-04 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter T.

===Tenure===
He was a delegate from 1983 to 1991. He lived in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and represented parts of [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] and [[Nelson County, Virginia|Nelson County]].

Allen was a strong advocate for the [[Capital punishment in Virginia|death penalty]], and actively supported expanding it in Virginia. For several years in a row, Allen introduced a bill that would add murder in commission of an attempted robbery to the list. Each year, the bill died in the House Courts of Justice Committee. Allen would continue to collect newspaper clippings for his file and followed every murder in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1989-01-16/news/8901160050_1_robbery-attempt-death-penalty-law-store-clerk |title=Delegate Renews Fight To Expand Death Penalty |publisher=Daily Press |date=1989-01-16 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen supported a statewide referendum on whether or not to create a [[Virginia Lottery|state lottery system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gersh|first=R. D.|title=Lottery bill heading for vote by delegates|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kg8QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PIwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6743,388459&amp;dq=george+allen+virginia+delegate&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=February 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, he proposed a referendum that would allow assets of illegal drug dealers to go to law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Digging into dealers' pockets, not taxpayers'|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BWUQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I4wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6411,81186&amp;dq=george+allen+charlottesville&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=November 1, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives (1991-1993)==
===Elections===
;1991
Incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[D. French Slaughter, Jr.]], of [[Virginia's 7th congressional district]], decided to resign because of a series of strokes. Allen faced Slaughter's cousin, Kay Slaughter, who was also a Charlottesville City Councilman. Allen defeated her 64%-36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=141643 |title=VA District 7 Special Race - Nov 05, 1991 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-11-17-99&quot;&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Jake Tapper |first=Jake |last=Tapper |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/11/17/robb/print.html |title=Dead senator running? | work=[[Salon magazine]] |date=November 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1992/redistricting
In the 1990s round of [[United States congressional apportionment|redistricting]], Allen's district, which stretched from the fringes of the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] suburbs to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and included much of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], was eliminated, even though Virginia gained a congressional seat as a result of the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 Census]]. While Republicans claim the principal factor in redistricting were partisanship of the [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] controlled [[Virginia General Assembly]], available new [[Geographic information system|GIS technology]] were forecasting likely election behavior of some hypothetical districts. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had a mandate to create a black-majority district in accordance with the [[Voting Rights Act]]. Allen's district was eliminated as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iTdFWR4Y-y8C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq=virginia+(1991+OR+1990)+redistricting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lssd-WnK7P&amp;sig=HYGfhTmJaJI9vRErOSQ6_L6OmVY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yk1xTLSuAcTflged3KzLDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=virginia%20(1991%20OR%201990)%20redistricting&amp;f=false

While his home in [[Earlysville, Virginia|Earlysville]] was placed in the [[Virginia's 5th congressional district|5th District]] of [[Lewis F. Payne, Jr.]], most of his district was placed in the newly redrawn [[Virginia's 10th congressional district]], represented by fellow Republican [[Frank Wolf]]. Allen moved to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]] and prepared to challenge Wolf in a primary. [[Republican Party of Virginia|state Republican leaders]] had let it be known that he could not expect any support for his planned run for governor in 1993 if he made such a challenge. Allen decided not to run in either the 5th, nor the 10th. After Democrat U.S. Congressman [[James Olin]] of the [[Virginia's 6th congressional district]] decided to retire, there was speculation Allen could run there. However, he decided not to move his family and run in the 6th district either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VP&amp;p_theme=vp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAFF4D4B2FAB410&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=The Virginian-Pilot Archives |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=1991-12-20 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virginia Governor (1994-1998)==
[[Image:George Allen visiting USS George Washington, July 22, 1996.JPEG|thumb|right|Governor Allen visiting the [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS ''George Washington'']] in July 1996.]]
In November 1993, Allen was elected the 67th [[Governor of Virginia]], serving from 1994 to 1998. His opponent in the 1993 election, Attorney General [[Mary Sue Terry]], had an early 29-point lead in public opinion polls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00610F73F550C708CDDA80994DB494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fD%2fDemocratic%20Party |title=The 1993 Elections: Virginia; Conservative Republican Wins Easily |work=New York Times |author=B.

This response to a surge of crime in the state connected with voters, in contrast to Terry's proposal to increase [[gun control]] as a remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL628a.cfm |title=Remarks of Governor George Allen to the Heritage Foundation |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |author=George Allen |date=December 9, 1998 |accessdate=November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2007}} Allen overcame the deficit and won with 58.3% of the vote, the largest margin (+17.4 points) since [[Albertis S. Harrison Jr.]] defeated [[H. Clyde Pearson]] with a margin of +27.7 points in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/valeg/php/election.php The Virginia Elections and State Elected Officials Database Project, 1776–2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=286 |title=Governor of Virginia |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen could not run for re-election because Virginia's constitution does not allow a governor to succeed himself; {{As of|2012|lc=on}} Virginia is the only state that has such a provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1996/vp960516/05160010.htm |title=One Price of a One-Term Governor High Turnover|publisher=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |page=A14 |date=May 16, 1996 |accessdate=October 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welfare reform===
During his 1993 campaign for Governor, Allen vowed to reform Virginia's welfare system, stating that &quot;Our obligation as a society is to provide a hand up to those in need, rather than a handout ...Welfare is not to be a permanent status for anyone in life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ht--8-17-93&quot;&gt;Harris, John F.

==Return to the private sector (1998-2001)==
===McGuireWoods===
In February 1998, Allen became a Richmond-based partner at the law firm McGuire Woods Battle &amp; Boothe (now [[McGuireWoods]] LLP), as head of its business expansion and relocation team. At the time, Allen said &quot;I think it's healthy to get out of government. If you stay in too long, you lose track of reality and the real world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hilpert, [http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/1998/02/16/story3.html &quot;Ex-Gov.

Allen made almost no money from the stock, according to his communications director, John Reid.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerPros&quot;/&gt; According to the ''Associated Press'', Allen steered compensation from his board service, other than stock options, to his law firm.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP-10-8-06&quot;/&gt; He was granted options worth $1.5&amp;nbsp;million at their peak.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerPros&quot;/&gt; Allen listed them on his disclosure forms for 2002 and 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerPros&quot;/&gt; but never exercised them.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerPros&quot;/&gt;

===Commonwealth Biotechnologies===
Allen joined Commonwealth's board of directors about two months after leaving the governor's office in January 1998. &quot;I learned a lot on their board and enjoyed working with 'em, and they seem to be doing all right, I guess,&quot; Allen said in October 2006.

Commonwealth granted Allen options on 15,000 shares of company stock at $7.50 a share in May 1999. Allen steered other compensation from his board service to his law firm, McGuire Woods. As of late 2006, Allen had not cashed in any options; the stock as of that date was well under $5 per share, making the options valueless for the moment. Commonwealth reported its first full year of profitability in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP-10-8-06&quot;/&gt;

===Com-Net Ericsson===
Allen became a member of the advisory board of Com-Net Ericsson in February 2000. The advisory board's responsibility was to meet at least twice a year and provide advice and service. Allen terminated his service on the board before the end of 2000. He was paid approximately $300,000 for his services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.roanoke.com/politics/day619.html Chris Flores, ''News &amp; Advance'', June 2002, cited at]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen ran for the U.S. Senate and defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent U.S. Senator [[Chuck Robb]] 52%-48%.

{{main|United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006}}
Allen's term in the Senate expired in January 2007. He sought re-election in [[U.S. Senate election, 2006|2006]]. Allen won the Republican nomination on August 11, 2006, and faced two opponents in the general election: the Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of the Navy [[James H. Webb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD/MGArticle/RTD_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1137836125082&amp;path=!news&amp;s=1045855934842 |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch |title=Former Robb aides endorse Webb in primary |last=Schapiro |first=Jeff E. |date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate=October 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gail Parker]], a retired [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] officer and retired civilian Pentagon budget analyst who ran on the [[Independent Green Party of Virginia|Independent Green Party]] ballot line. Allen ran a campaign that appealed to cultural, hard right-wing conservatives. During the campaign the [[Marshall-Newman Amendment]] was also on the ballot.

The pivotal moment in the campaign, and the one that the vast majority of political observers attribute Allen's stunning upset loss to Webb, came on August 11, 2006, at a campaign stop in [[Breaks, Virginia]], near the Kentucky border, where Allen twice used the word &quot;macaca&quot; to refer to the dark-complexioned, S. R. Sidarth, who was filming the event as a &quot;tracker&quot; for the opposing Jim Webb campaign. In what was dubbed as his &quot;Macaca moment”, Allen said:

: &quot;This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Macaca, or whatever his name is. He's with my opponent... Let's give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.&quot;

Sidarth is of Indian ancestry, but was born and raised in Fairfax County, Virginia. Allen's &quot;Macaca moment&quot; quickly went viral and, virtually overnight, it became the hot topic on all of the network and cable television news shows. 

Webb won by approximately a third of a percent – 8,805 votes – but it wasn't until November 9, 2006 that Allen finally held a press conference in Alexandria, Virginia announcing he had conceded the race to now Senator Elect, James Webb, and would not seek a recount.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Co-authored the [[Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act]], which extends the ban on various Internet taxes until 2007

;21st century Nanotechnology Research &amp; Development Act
In 2002, Allen co-sponsored, together with Senators [[Ron Wyden]] and [[Joe Lieberman]], bipartisan legislation that promoted nanotechnology research and development in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-10-01-02&quot;&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2328693/NANOTECHNOLOGY-Senators-Introduce-Bill-to.html “Senators Introduce Bill to Promote Nanotech R&amp;D”], Nano Technology”, October 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st century Nanotechnology Research &amp; Development Act&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-10-01-02&quot;/&gt; was signed into law by President Bush on December 3, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-12-03-03&quot;&gt;Alexander Cate, [http://www.nano.gov/html/news/releases/PresSignsNanoBill.htm “President Bush Signs Bill Authorizing U.S. Nanotechnology Program”], “National Science and Technology Council”,  December 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act launched the National Nanotechnology Program, to establish goals, priorities, and metrics for evaluation of federal nanotechnology research and development, investment in federal nanotech research and development programs, and provide for interagency coordination of federal nanotechnology activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-6-11-09&quot;&gt;[http://www.nsti.org/press/PRshow.html?id=4496 “The Nanobusiness Alliance: nanoTox Appoints Gov. George Allen to Board of Directors”], “Nano Science and Technology Institute”, June 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The National Nanotechnology Program, the single largest federally-funded, multi-agency scientific research initiative since the space program in the 1960s, got $3.63&amp;nbsp;billion of funding over the period of four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-04-05-06&quot;&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/senator-george-allen-receives-nvtc-2006-chairmans-award-55974982.html “Sen. Allen Receives Northern Virginia Technology Council 2006 Chairman’s Award”], “PR Newswire”, April 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen was the founding Chair of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-04-05-06&quot;/&gt; In 2009, he joined the board of the company Nano Risk Assessment, Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-6-11-09&quot;/&gt;

===Committee assignments===
Allen was a member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship|Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Energy and Natural Resources Committee]].

Allen was appointed in the last [[United States Congress|Congress]] to serve as the chairman of the High Tech Task Force. Allen was elected as a member of the Senate Republican leadership as Chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] in 2002, and oversaw a net gain of four seats for the Republicans in the [[U.S. Senate election, 2004|2004 Senate elections]]. His successor as NRSC chair was Senator [[Elizabeth Dole]]. Dole was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee|NRSC]] in 2006, when Allen was defeated for re-election by [[Jim Webb]].

==Post-Senate career (2007−present)==
===Political ambitions===
;2008 presidential election
Prior to his loss to Webb in the November 2006 senatorial election, Allen had traveled a number of times to [[Iowa]] (the first state with a [[Iowa Caucus|presidential caucus]]) and [[New Hampshire]] (the first state with a [[New Hampshire primary|presidential primary]]). He had been widely assumed to be preparing a run for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/powergrid/16381/ |last=Heilemann |first=John |title=George III |date=March 13, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2006 |work=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of 175 Washington insiders by ''[[National Journal]]'', released in April 2005, Allen was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwen |last=Glazer |url=http://www.moore-info.com/signedsealed....htm |title=Signed, Sealed... But Not So Fast. Insiders' Predictions For WH 2008 May Not Match Public's Vision |work=National Journal |date=April 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an insider survey by ''National Journal'' a year later, in May 2006, Allen had dropped to second place, and [[John McCain]] held a 3-to-1 lead over Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2006/05/watch_your_verb.html |title=McCain Roars Past Allen In New NJ Insiders Poll |work=National Journal |date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the November 2006 election, it was widely assumed that Allen was no longer a viable candidate for the Republican nomination, principally because of the damage caused by the incidents that caused his double-digit lead in the polls to turn to a narrow defeat that contributed to the Republicans' loss of control of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Allen Greene, [[BBC News]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6134432.stm ''&quot;White House hopefuls begin race&quot;''], November 10, 2006.

Retrieved November 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2006, Allen gave an interview in which he stated that he would not seek the 2008 nomination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/16207686.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the campaign of GOP presidential candidate [[Fred Thompson]] announced that Allen was one of three national co-chairs for the 2008 presidential campaign. That month, Allen declined to speculate on his political future. 

;2009 gubernatorial election
Commenting on the [[Virginia gubernatorial election, 2009|2009 governor's race in Virginia]], Allen not only said that he had made no decisions but that &quot;Susan and I have listened to a lot of people encouraging us to do that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Shear, [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/10/09/george_allen_is_back_and_touti.html &quot;George Allen's Back And Touting Thompson&quot;], ''Washington Post'', October 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 8, 2008, Allen said that he would not run for governor in 2009, but later left open the possibility of challenging Democratic Senator Webb in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Sandhya Somashekhar and Tim Craig, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/08/AR2008010801952.html &quot;Allen Rejects Run Next Year For 2nd Term As Governor&quot;], ''Washington Post'', January 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political activism ===
In March 2007, Allen became a [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Scholar with [[Young America's Foundation]]. He is also the President of George Allen Strategies, a lobbying and consulting firm based in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;George Allen Strategies (2009). [http://www.georgeallenstrategies.com/index.php/site/principals/ Principals]. Retrieved August 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a position he had held since July 2007. Between January 2010 and August 2011, he was paid $347,000 by the firm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=Washington Post |date=September 27, 2011 |url=http://www.dailymail.com/ap/ApLife/201109273276 |author=Anita Kumar |title=George Allen's Energy-industry Interests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Allen started the American Energy Freedom Center, a non-profit conservative think tank that is a project of the [[Institute for Energy Research]].&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;Sandhya Somashekhar, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/13/AR2009081302109_pf.html Allen Tries to Shake Off the 'Macaca' Shadow], ''Washington Post'', August 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was paid $20,000 to be the center's chairman in 2010; he ceased his affiliation with the organization in December of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy&quot;/&gt;

In May 2010, [[Regnery Press]] published Allen's first book, ''What Washington Can Learn From the World of Sports'', in which he drew parallels and contrasts between two of the nation’s favorite passions. Allen suggested that government needed to look no further than the football field, baseball diamond, or basketball court to solve today's pressing problems because, in sports, teamwork is essential, cheating is frowned upon, and the rules don’t change.

[[Image:George Allen Crozet.jpg|thumb|150px|Allen campaigning at the July 4, 2011 parade in [[Crozet, Virginia]]]] On January 24, 2011, Allen officially announced, through a video on his campaign website, that he was running for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate, to reclaim the seat held by Senator [[Jim Webb]], who defeated Allen on November 2006.&lt;ref name=huffpost1-24-11&gt;{{Citation

===1994 Republican state convention===
At the Republican state convention in 1994, Allen spoke of his political opponents saying he would enjoy &quot;knocking their soft teeth down their whiny throats.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;In Tight Virginia Race, Seeking Every Edge, by Jonathan Weisman, New York Times, 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Kaine find common ground at forum, by David Sherfinski-The Washington Times, 28 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership of Barr Labs stock===
It was reported on August 8, 2006, that Allen owned stock in [[Barr Pharmaceuticals]], maker of the [[Levonorgestrel|Plan B]] &quot;[[morning after pill]]&quot;. The Webb campaign criticized Allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose. Allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because Barr has created jobs in Virginia, and by pointing to his consistently [[pro-life]] voting record.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-barrlabs&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/08/AR2006080801323.html |title=Abortion Foe Allen Faulted for Stock in Morning-After Pill Maker |work=Washington Post |date=August 9, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2006 |last=Craig |first=Tim |page=B05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As governor, Allen pushed successfully for parental notification of teenagers' abortions, and in the Senate, he opposed the approval of Plan B for over-the-counter sales, though he still favors its legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/22/AR2006102201161.html |title=Women's Vote Could Tip Close Contest |last=Rein |first=Lisa |page=A01 |work=Washington Post |date=October 23, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen opposes the use of public funding for elective abortions, although he supports the legality of abortions in cases of incest, rape, or when the woman's life is endangered.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProjectVoteSmart&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vote-smart.org/npat.php?can_id=CNIP9093 |title=2006 Congressional National Political Awareness Test |publisher=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2006, at a campaign stop in [[Breaks Interstate Park|Breaks, Virginia]], near the [[Kentucky]] border, Allen twice used the word ''[[Macaca (slur)|macaca]]'' to refer to [[S.R. Sidarth]], an [[Indian-American]], who was filming the event as a &quot;tracker&quot; for the opposing Webb campaign. 
Allen apologized, first saying he intended to say &quot;mohawk,&quot; an incorrect reference to Sidarth's hair cut. He then revised his story, saying he meant to call Sidarth &quot;caca&quot; and then claiming that he did not know the meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081400589.html |title=Allen Quip Provokes Outrage, Apology |first=Tim |last=Craig |date=August 15, 2006 |work=Washington Post |page=A01 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QezZMh6m | archivedate = July 27, 2007| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' speculated that, were it not for this double utterance, Allen would have been a strong candidate for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 GOP presidential nomination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'What If' of Allen Haunts the GOP Race|author=Tim Craig|work=The Washington Post|date=February 6, 2008|page=B01|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020503237.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It is derived from the name of the genus comprising [[macaque]] monkeys whose name has also itself been used as a racial slur.  Allen's mother was born in North Africa.  The macaque's genus name, Macaca, is a latinization of the Bantu (Kongo) ma-kako, meaning &quot;monkey&quot;.

===Allegations of Allen's use of racial slurs in college===
	 
On September 24, 2006, [[Salon.com]] Washington correspondent Michael Scherer reported that the magazine had interviewed 19 of his teammates and that &quot;[t]hree former college football teammates of Sen. George Allen say that the Virginia Republican repeatedly used the racial epithet '[[nigger]]' and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks during the early 1970s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nword&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://salon.com/news/feature/2006/09/24/allen_football/ |title=Teammates: Allen used &quot;N-word&quot; in college |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |date=September 24, 2006 |accessdate=October 29, 2006|first=Michael |last=Scherer}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Allen's classmates who made such a claim is [[University of Virginia]] political science professor [[Larry Sabato]].

===Mother's religious and ethnic background===
On August 25, 2006, the Jewish periodical ''[[The Forward]]'' reported that in all likelihood, Allen's mother Etty Allen, ''née'' Henrietta Lumbroso, was Jewish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forward&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/articles/1442/alleged-slur-casts-spotlight-on-senatores-jewis/ |title=Alleged Slur Casts Spotlight On Senator’s (Jewish?)

Freedom of religion. So I'd like to ask you, why is that relevant, my religion, Jim's religion, or the religious beliefs of anyone out here?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0609/24/rs.01.html |title=CNN Reliable Sources |last=Kurtz |first=Howard |date=September 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to criticize Fox for making his religious heritage an issue, stating that &quot;one of those values is freedom of religion and not making aspersions about people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6123064 |title=NPR |last=Naylor |first=Bryan |date=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This incident was then used to prompt speculation that he wanted to conceal his Jewish ancestry. The next day, Allen issued a statement confirming his mother's Jewish ancestry. Allen said his mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public, and had originally asked Allen to keep that information private.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-092106&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/20/AR2006092001965.html |title=Allen's Mother Revealed Jewish Heritage to Him Last Month |work=Washington Post |date=September 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2006 |last=Shear |first=Michael D |page=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allen speaks about his Jewish heritage===

On August 19, 2010, Allen, the keynote speaker, addressed the [[Jewish Learning Institute]]’s [[National Jewish Retreat]] in [[Reston, Virginia]]. In a late August 2006 visit, Allen asked his mother about her Jewish ancestry. After she revealed her Jewish ancestry, Allen described the discovery of his true roots as “interestingly positive.” In referring to Allen’s mother concealing her Jewish heritage, Allen said that “I’m proud of my family and heritage. And I wanted to learn more about it, which I have...”&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-8-19-10&quot;&gt;[http://lubavitch.com/news/article/2029427/Former-Governor-and-Senator-George-Allen-Addresses-National-Jewish-Retreat.html &quot;Former Governor and Senator George Allen Addresses National Jewish Retreat&quot;], Chabad Lubavitch News&quot;, August 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Allen’s Jewish grandfather, Felix Lumbroso, was imprisoned by the Nazis for his resistance efforts in French Tunisia. Allen's middle name, Felix, honors his grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-8-19-10&quot;&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-08-19-allen19_ST_N.htm&quot;], USA Today&quot;, August 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen went on to add that:

“The core principle of freedom of conscience, beliefs and religion was no longer a matter of enlightened philosophy to me; it became deeply personal in my heart-wrenching realization of how fear and persecution so tormented my loving, loyal mother’s life.”&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-8-19-10&quot;/&gt;

Allen’s speech also covered his devoted interests to stop racism and anti Semitism:

“A salient lesson I learned is: when injustice or the ugly head of racism, anti-Semitism, or repression arises, leaders must deplore it. Otherwise, people may believe it to be acceptable or condoned...We need to understand that the denial of freedom and opportunity to any person anywhere is an injustice that should be intolerable to freedom-loving people everywhere.”&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-8-19-10&quot;/&gt;

The speech ended with a standing ovation as Allen blew the symbolic shofar, a ram’s horn used for Jewish Holy days.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-8-21-10&quot;&gt;Jason Horowitz, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/20/AR2010082005487_2.html?sid=ST2009081303022 &quot;George Allen looks to his roots while planting campaign seeds&quot;], &quot;Washington Post&quot;, August 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on the Confederate flag===

Allen wore a [[Confederate flag]] pin for his high school senior class photo. In 1993, Allen's first statewide TV campaign ad for governor included a Confederate flag. Greg Stevens, the political consultant who made the 1993 TV ad, confirmed its inclusion. Allen has confirmed that the pin in his high school yearbook was a Confederate flag. Allen, who was observed by classmates at Palos Verdes High School driving his Ford Mustang with the Confederate flag in the front license plate frame, has said &quot;it is possible&quot; that he had a Confederate flag on his car in high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;RaceProblem&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20060508&amp;s=lizza050806 |title=GEORGE ALLEN'S RACE PROBLEM |publisher=The New Republic |date=May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some minority groups, especially African-Americans, in Virginia criticized Allen for his policies and his embrace of the Confederate flag. Allen however claimed that the confederate flag is a symbol of southern and state heritage as Virginia was the capital of the Confederacy. Allen also opposed a [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|separate state holiday commemorating]] [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081401114.html |title=George Allen's America |work=Washington Post |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state holiday in favor of Martin Luther King Jr. was initially attached to Lee-Jackson day, a day honoring noted Confederate Generals [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Stonewall Jackson]]. 

In 1995, 1996, and 1997, Allen proclaimed April as Confederate History and Heritage Month and called the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] &quot;a four-year struggle for independence and sovereign rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEFD7103CF932A25757C0A961958260 |title=Governor Is Criticized For 'Confederacy Month' |work=The New York Times |date=April 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On October 2, 2010, columnist [[Robert McCartney (journalist)|Robert McCartney]] of the ''Washington Post'' reported that Allen supports current Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's plan to name April 2011 &quot;Civil War in Virginia&quot; month.&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-9-24-10&quot;&gt;Rosiland S. Helderman, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092406276.html &quot;Seeking racial unity over slavery silence, McDonnell turns 'Confederate History Month' into 'Civil War in Virginia' remembrance&quot;], &quot;Washington Post&quot;, September 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Allen in a two-sentence response to my request for comment, said he agreed with McDonnell's 'decision to recognize all aspects of this pivotal and tragic time in our nation's history.'  Although he didn't use the word 'slavery,' Allen indirectly welcomed the Union's victory in 1865 as an advance for liberty.
'It is vital that we understand the motivations, lives and deaths of the men and women of every background, race and social status who were part of this important struggle to fulfill the words of the Declaration of Independence, that all men and women should enjoy the freedom and rights given to them by God,' Allen said.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HT-10-02-10&quot;&gt;Robert McCartney, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/02/AR2010100203167_pf.html &quot;McCartney: McDonnell was right to scrap Confederate History Month, but will rest of Va. GOP follow his admirable lead?&quot;], &quot;Washington Post&quot;, October 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving in the Senate, Allen played a minor role as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer in the 2003 film ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'', a movie that included many [[cameo appearance|cameo]]s of politicians such as Senator [[Robert Byrd]] and former Senator [[Phil Gramm]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1329758/&lt;/ref&gt;  His role included singing &quot;[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]]&quot;.

===Allen's sister's memoir===
In 2000, Allen's younger sister [[Jennifer Allen Richard]] wrote in her memoir ''Fifth Quarter: The Scrimmage of a Football Coach's Daughter'' ([[Random House]] Publishing, 2000) that Allen sometimes violently attacked his younger siblings and his sister's boyfriend during his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812992326 Fifth Quarter: The Scrimmage of a Football Coach's Daughter] Contains editorial reviews&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Richard qualified some of the claims made in the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Complicates&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1961584&amp;page=3 |title=Campaign Complicates Allen's Ambitions|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=May 14, 2006 Ron Fournier}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that the book was a &quot;novelization of the past&quot; and written from the perspective of a young girl &quot;surrounded by older brothers and a larger-than-life father.&quot; She states that she has a good relationship with her brother and noted that Allen stepped in for their father to walk her down the aisle at her wedding.

==Personal life==
Allen married Anne Patrice Rubel in June 1979. They divorced in 1983. In 1986 Allen married Susan Brown. The couple has three children: Tyler, Forrest and Brooke. The Allens are residents of [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]], Virginia.

Allen is a member of the [[Presbyterian Church]]. He is fond of using [[American football|football]] [[metaphor]]s, a tendency that has been remarked upon by journalists and political commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/05/a_tough_questio.html |title=A Tough Question for George Allen |work=The Decembrist |date=May 13, 2005 |accessdate=August 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1422-2005Feb5.html |title=Mixing Politics, Pigskins |work=The Washington Post |date=February 6, 2006 |page=C01 | first=Dana | last=Milbank | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
