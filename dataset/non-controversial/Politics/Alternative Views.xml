      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5983">'''''Alternative Views''''' was one of the longest running [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] programs in the United States. Produced in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1978, it produced 563 hour-long programs featuring news, interviews and opinion pieces from a progressive political perspective.  Show founders and on-air hosts, [[Douglas Kellner]] and [[Frank Morrow]], produced the show on virtually no budget using facilities at [[Austin Community Television]] (ACTV) and [[The University of Texas at Austin]].[http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/printer_18971.shtml]  They also pioneered an innovative syndication system that placed the program in almost 80 television markets around the country.

== Audience share ==
Viewership was on a par with the local [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station.  Two surveys, one undertaken by the cable company, and another commissioned by it, indicate that from 20,000 to 30,000 Austin viewers watched ''Alternative Views'' each week.

== Distribution network ==
The audience for ''Alternative Views'' went well beyond the confines of Austin, Texas.  Many [[Public-access television]] channels allow members to sponsor programs for exhibition in their cable market.  In spring 1984 ''Alternative Views'' began sending program tapes to Public-access TV contacts in Dallas and San Antonio.  In Fall 1984 they added Fayetteville, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Urbana, Illinois.  Cities around the United States subsequently joined, and, by the late 1980s, the program was shown in New York, Boston, Portland, San Diego, Marin County, California, Fairfax and Arlington Virginia, Cincinnati, San Francisco, Columbus, Ohio, New Haven, and many other cities.[http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/battle/Alternative%20Media.pdf]

== Content ==
Each installment of ''Alternative Views'' included a regular news section that utilized material from mostly non-mainstream news sources to provide stories ignored by establishment media, or interpretations of events different from the mainstream.

''Alternative Views'' landed many significant interviews during its run, and it was often ahead of mainstream media in identifying major stories.  Its first program featured an Iranian student who discussed opposition to the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] and the possibility of his overthrow.  It also had a detailed discussion of the [[Sandinista]] movement struggling to overthrow [[Anastasio Somoza]].  It would be several weeks before national broadcast media discovered these movements.

Early shows included long-form interviews with Senator [[Ralph Yarborough]], a Texas progressive responsible for legislation like the [[National Defense Education Act]], and former CIA officials like [[John Stockwell]] and [[Philip Agee]], who both presented arguments for shuttering the CIA.

Other interviewees included:

Anti-war and anti-nuclear activists like [[Helen Caldicott]], [[George Wald]], [[Ramsey Clark]], [[Daniel Ellsberg]], Michael Klare, David Dellinger, and representatives of the European peace movement.[http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Jun2003/mamoun0603.html]

US New Left activists like David MacReynolds, [[Stokely Carmichael]], Greg Calvert, and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].

Feminists, gay activists, union activists, and representatives of local progressive groups appeared on the show; and officials from the [[Soviet Union]],  Nicaragua, Allende's former government in Chile, the democratic front in [[El Salvador]], and many other Third World countries and revolutionary movements.

In addition, ''Alternative Views'' broadcast many documentaries, both self-produced and produced by others, and it screened raw video footage of the bombing of Lebanon and aftermath of the massacres at [[Sabra and Shatila]], of the assassinations of five communist labor organizers by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Greensboro, North Carolina, and of counterrevolutionary activity in [[Nicaragua]].

== Staff ==
''Alternative Views'' was staffed exclusively by volunteers, many of whom have become influential filmmakers and television producers.  It was founded by [[Douglas Kellner]] and [[Frank Morrow]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. (Kellner is now a chair at [[UCLA]].) There were other producers and hosts, many of whom were drawn from Kellnerâ€™s philosophy courses, including [[Ali Hossaini]], [[Tommy Pallotta]], [[Noah Khoshbin]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Steven Best]], [[James Scott]] and [[Danny Postel]].
