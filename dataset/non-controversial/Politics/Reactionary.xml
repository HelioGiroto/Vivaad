      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17408">A '''reactionary''' is an individual that holds political viewpoints which cause them to seek to return to a previous state (the [[status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]) in a society. Reactionaries are considered to be one end of a political spectrum whose opposite pole is perceived [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], though reactionary ideologies may be themselves radical. While it has not been generally considered positive to be regarded as a reactionary it has been adopted as a self-description by some such as [[H. L. Mencken]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.906/article_detail.asp ''Journalism with a Hammer'' A review of The Skeptic: A Biography of H.L. Mencken, by Terry Teachout]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Warner]] of Craigenmaddie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geraldwarner/100048734/scrap-the-meaningless-terms-left-and-right-and-reclaim-the-honourable-title-reactionary/ | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Scrap the meaningless terms Left and Right and reclaim the honourable title 'reactionary' | date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Lukacs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/1890318124 ''Confessions of an Original Sinner'' First Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Conservatism sidebar}}

== Usage and history ==
The [[French Revolution]] gave the English language three politically descriptive words denoting anti-progressive politics: ''reactionary'', ''conservative'' and ''right''. ''Reactionary'' derives from the French word ''réactionnaire'' (an early nineteenth-century coinage), and ''[[Conservatism|conservative]]'' from ''conservateur'', identifying monarchist parliamentarians opposed to the revolution.&lt;ref name=Austin&gt;''The Governments of Europe'', Frederic Austin OGG, Rev. Ed., The MacMillan Co., 1922, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; In this French usage, ''reactionary'' denotes &quot;a movement towards the reversal of an existing tendency or state&quot; and a &quot;return to a previous condition of affairs.&quot; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites the first English-language usage in 1799 in a translation of [[Lazare Carnot]]'s letter on the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reply of L. N. M. Carnot, citizen of France ... to the report made on the conspiracy of the 18th Fructidor |last=Carnot |first=L. N. M. |year=1799 |publisher=J. Wright |location=London |page=149| edition=3rd| |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xMdDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q=reactionaries&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Revolution, conservative forces (especially the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) organized opposition to the progressive socio-political and economic changes brought by the revolution, and to fight to restore the temporal authority of the Church and [[The Crown|Crown]]. In nineteenth-century European politics, the ''reactionary class'' included the Roman Catholic Church's hierarchy—the [[clergy]], the [[aristocracy]], [[Royal family|royal families]], and [[Monarchism|royalists]]—believing that national government is the sole domain of the Church and the state. In France, supporters of traditional rule by direct heirs of the [[House of Bourbon]] dynasty were labeled the ''[[legitimist]] reaction''. In the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], the monarchists were the ''reactionary faction'', later renamed ''conservative''.&lt;ref name=Austin /&gt; In Protestant Christian societies, ''reactionary'' described those supporting tradition against modernity.

In the nineteenth century, ''reactionary'' denoted people who idealised [[feudalism]] and the pre-modern era—before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the French Revolution—when economies were mostly [[Agrarianism|agrarian]], a [[landed aristocracy]] dominated society, a hereditary king ruled and the Roman Catholic Church was society's moral center. Those labeled as ''reactionary'' favored the [[aristocracy]] instead of the [[middle class]] and the [[working class]]. Reactionaries opposed democracy and parliamentarism.

=== Thermidorian Reaction ===
The [[Thermidorian Reaction]] was a movement within the revolution against perceived excesses of the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]. On July 27, 1794 (9 Thermidor year II in the [[French Republican Calendar]]), [[Maximilien Robespierre]]'s [[Reign of Terror]] was brought to an end. The overthrow of Robespierre signalled the reassertion of the French [[National Convention]] over the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. The Jacobins were suppressed, the prisons were emptied and the Committee was shorn of its powers. After the execution of some 104 Robespierre supporters, the Thermidorian Reaction stopped the use of the guillotine against alleged counterrevolutionaries, set a middle course between the monarchists and the radicals and ushered in a time of relative exuberance and its accompanying corruption.

===The Restored French Monarchy===
With the [[Congress of Vienna]], the monarchs of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] formed the ''[[Holy Alliance]]'', a form of collective security against [[revolution]] and [[Bonapartism]] inspired by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]]. This instance of reaction was surpassed by a movement that developed in France when, after the second fall of [[Napoleon]], the ''Restoration,'' or re-instatement of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty, ensued. This time it was to be a [[constitutional monarchy]], with an [[election|elected]] lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. The Franchise was restricted to men over the age of forty, which indicated that for the first fifteen years of their lives they had lived under the ''[[ancien régime]]''. Nevertheless, King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] was worried that he would still suffer an intractable parliament. He was delighted with the [[ultra-royalist]]s, or Ultras, whom the election returned, declaring that he had found a ''[[chambre introuvable]]'', literally, an &quot;unfindable house&quot;. But he later realized that they were too ultra for a royal.

It was the [[Declaration of Saint-Ouen]] which had prepared the way for the Restoration. Before the French Revolution, which radically and bloodily overthrew most aspects of French society's organization, the only way that constitutional change could be instituted was by referring it to old legal documents that could be interpreted as agreeing with the proposal. Everything new had to be expressed as a righteous revival of something old that had lapsed and had been forgotten. This was also the means used for diminished aristocrats to get themselves a bigger piece of the pie. In the eighteenth century, those gentry whose fortunes had so diminished that they lived at the level of peasants went skulking for every ancient feudal law that would give them a little something. The &quot;ban,&quot; for example, meant that all their peasants had to grind their grain in the lord's mill. So they came to the [[French States-General of 1789]] fully prepared to press for the expansion of such practices in all provinces, to the legal limit. They were horrified when the French Revolution permitted common citizens to go hunting, one of the few advantages that they had always maintained everywhere.

Thus with the restoration of the Bourbons, the Chambre Introuvable set about reverting every law to return things not merely to the age of the [[absolute monarchy]], but before that to the age in which the aristocracy really was a socially powerful class. It is this which clearly distinguishes a &quot;reactionary&quot; from a &quot;conservative.&quot; The conservative would have accepted many improvements brought about by the revolution, and simply refused a program of wholesale ''reversion''. Hence one should be wary of the use of the word &quot;reactionary&quot; in later days as a political slur, since there is nothing to compare with the Chambre Introuvable in other countries. For example, Russia certainly had no such aristocrats after 1989. Later French kings similarly had trouble with their parliaments.

===The clerical philosophers===
{{Main|Clerical philosophers}}
In the Revolution's aftermath, France was continually wracked with the quarrels between the right-wing [[legitimists]] and left-wing Revolutionaries. Herein arose the clerical philosophers—[[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Louis de Bonald]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]—whose answer was restoring the [[House of Bourbon]] and reinstalling the Roman Catholic Church as the [[established church]]. Since then, France's political spectrum has featured similar divisions. (see ''[[Action Française]]'').  The ideas of the clerical philosophers were buttressed by the teachings of the nineteenth century popes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Metternich and containment===
During the period of 1815-1848, [[Prince Metternich]], the [[foreign minister]] of the [[Austrian Empire]], stepped in to organize containment of revolutionary forces through international alliances meant to prevent the spread of revolutionary fervour. At the [[Congress of Vienna]], he was very influential in establishing the new order, the [[Concert of Europe]], after the overthrow of [[Napoleon]].

After the Congress, Prince Metternich worked hard bolstering and stabilizing the conservative regime of the Restoration period. He worked furiously to prevent Russia's Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] (who aided the liberal forces in Germany, Italy and France) from gaining influence in Europe. The Church was his principal ally, promoting it as a conservative principle of order while opposing nationalistic and liberal tendencies within the Church. His basic philosophy was based on [[Edmund Burke]], who championed the need for old roots and an orderly development of society. He opposed democratic and [[parliament]]ary institutions but favoured modernizing existing structures by gradual [[reform movement|reform]]. Despite Metternich's efforts a series of [[1848 Revolutions|revolutions rocked Europe in 1848]].

===20th century===
[[Image:Warning in Internet Cafe in Thu Duc, Vietnam-1.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Warning against visiting &quot;reactionary&quot; websites in a Vietnamese cyber cafe]]
In the twentieth century, ''reactionary'' denoted opponents of [[socialism]] and [[communism]], such as the [[White Armies]], who fought in the [[Russian Civil War]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] after the [[October Revolution]]. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] terminology, ''reactionary'' is a [[pejorative]] adjective denoting people whose ideas might appear to be socialist, but, in essence, contain elements of [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]], [[nationalism]], [[fascism]] or other characteristics of the [[ruling class]]. ''Reactionary'' also denotes supporters of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], and régimes such as [[Vichy France]], Spain under [[Francisco Franco]], and Portugal under [[Antonio Salazar]]. One example of this took place after [[Boris Pasternak]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. On October 26, 1958, the day following the [[Nobel Committee]]'s announcement, Moscow's ''Literary Gazette'' ran a polemical article by David Zaslavski entitled, ''Reactionary [[Propaganda]] Uproar over a Literary Weed''.&lt;ref&gt; [[Olga Ivinskaya]], ''A Captive of Time: My Years with Pasternak'', Doubleday, 1978. Page 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactionary feelings were often coupled with a hostility to modern, industrial means of production and a nostalgia for a more rural society. The [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime in [[France]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime, the [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] regime in [[Portugal]], and Maurras's ''[[Action Française]]'' political movements are examples of such traditional reactionary feelings, in favour of [[authoritarian]] regimes with strong unelected leaders and with Catholicism as a [[state religion]]. The [[motto]] of Vichy France was &quot;[[travail, famille, patrie]]&quot;(&quot;work, family, homeland&quot;), and its leader, [[Marshal]] [[Philippe Pétain]], declared that &quot;la terre, elle ne ment pas&quot; (&quot;the earth, it does not lie&quot;) in an indication of his belief that the truest life is rural and agrarian.

Fascism is generally considered to be reactionary, due to its glorification of ancient national history and some of the social arrangements prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century. The Italian fascists showed a desire to bring about a new social order based on the ancient feudal principle of delegation (though without serfdom) in their enthusiasm for the [[corporate state]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] said that &quot;fascism is reaction&quot; and that &quot;fascism, which did not fear to call itself reactionary... has not today any impediment against declaring itself illiberal and anti-liberal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerarchia, March, 1923 quoted in [[George Seldes]], ''Facts and Fascism'', eighth edition, New York: In Fact, 1943, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Giovanni Gentile|Gentile]] and Mussolini also attacked certain reactionary policies, particularly monarchism and&amp;mdash;more veiled—some aspects of Italian conservative [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. They wrote, &quot;History doesn't travel backwards. The fascist doctrine has not taken De Maistre as its prophet. Monarchical absolutism is of the past, and so is ecclesiolatry.&quot; They further elaborated in the political doctrine that fascism &quot;is not reactionary [in the old way] but revolutionary.&quot; Conversely, they also explained that fascism was of the right, not of the left. Fascism was certainly not simply a return to tradition: it carried the centralised state beyond even what had been seen in [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]]. Fascist [[single-party state]]s were as centralised as most [[communist states]], and fascism's intense [[nationalism]] was not found in the period prior to the French Revolution.

The [[Nazism|National Socialists]] did not consider themselves reactionary and considered the forces of reaction (Prussian [[monarchist]]s, [[Junker|nobility]], [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic]]) among their enemies right next to their [[Red Front (UK)|Red Front]] enemies in the Nazi Party march ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied|Die Fahne hoch]]''. The fact that the Nazis called their 1933 rise to power the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft|National]] [[Revolution]]'', shows that they supported some form of revolution. Nevertheless, they idealized tradition, folklore, classical thought, leadership (as exemplified by [[Frederick the Great]]), rejected the liberalism of the Weimar Republic, and called the German state the [[Third Reich]] (which traces back to the medieval [[First Reich]] and the pre-Weimar [[Second Reich]]). (See also  [[Reactionary modernism]].)

[[Clericalism|Clericalist]] movements sometimes labeled as [[clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] by their critics, can be considered reactionaries in terms of the 19th century, since they share some elements of fascism, while at the same time promote a return to the pre-revolutionary model of social relations, with a strong role for the Church. Their utmost philosopher was [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]].

Modern American Conservatism is also considered to be a reactionary ideology.  The emphasis on restoring moral traditionalism to the social and political order as well as a nascent nationalism inherent to the ideology both clearly place conservatism in the category of reactionary ideologies.  Conservatism, more broadly than the Modern American variant, is generally opposed to change in the status quo and manifests as a reaction to change.
