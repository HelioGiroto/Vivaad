[[File:Masque.jpg|thumb| 1832 first edition, printed by Bradbury and Evans, Edward Moxon, London.]][[File:Masque42.jpg|thumb| 1842 title page, with added poems &quot;Queen Liberty&quot; and &quot;Song-To the Men of England&quot;, J. Watson, London.]]
'''''The Masque of Anarchy''''' is a political poem written in 1819 (see [[1819 in poetry]]) by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] following the [[Peterloo Massacre]] of that year. In his call for freedom, it is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of [[nonviolent resistance]].

The poem was not published during Shelley's lifetime and did not appear in print until 1832 (see [[1832 in poetry]]), when published by Edward Moxon in London with a preface by [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]].&lt;ref name=cocel&gt;Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', Oxford University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-19-860634-6&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley had sent the manuscript in 1819 for publication in The [[Examiner]]. Leigh Hunt withheld it from publication because he &quot;thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kind-heartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse.&quot; The epigraph on the cover of the first edition is from ''[[The Revolt of Islam]]'' (1818): &quot;Hope is strong; Justice and Truth their winged child have found.&quot;

==Synopsis==

Written on the occasion of the massacre carried out by the British Government at St Peter's Field, Manchester 1819, Shelley begins his poem with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time &quot;God, and King, and Law&quot; - and he then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action: &quot;Let a great assembly be, of the fearless, of the free&quot;. The crowd at this gathering is met by armed soldiers, but the protestors do not raise an arm against their assailants:

:''&quot;Stand ye calm and resolute,''
:''Like a forest close and mute,''
:''With folded arms and looks which are''
:''Weapons of unvanquished war.''

:''And if then the tyrants dare,''
:''Let them ride among you there,''
:''Slash, and stab, and maim and hew,''
:''What they like, that let them do.''

:''With folded arms and steady eyes,''
:''And little fear, and less surprise
:''Look upon them as they slay''
:''Till their rage has died away''

:''Then they will return with shame
:''To the place from which they came,
:''And the blood thus shed will speak
:''In hot blushes on their cheek.

:''Rise like Lions after slumber''
:''In unvanquishable number,''
:''Shake your chains to earth like dew''
:''Which in sleep had fallen on you-''
:'''''Ye are many — they are few'''''&quot; &lt;ref name=AFP&gt;http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley elaborates on the psychological consequences of violence met with pacifism. The guilty soldiers he says, will return shamefully to society, where &quot;blood thus shed will speak/In hot blushes on their cheek&quot;. Women will point out the murderers on the streets, their former friends will shun them, and honorable soldiers will turn away from those responsible for the massacre, &quot;ashamed of such base company&quot;. A version was taken up by [[Henry David Thoreau]] in his essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|''Civil Disobedience'']], and later by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] in his doctrine of ''[[Satyagraha]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; Gandhi's passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weber, &quot;Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor,&quot; Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's ''Masque of Anarchy'' to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weber, &quot;Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor,&quot; Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem mentions several members of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]'s government by name: the Foreign Secretary, [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] who appears as a mask worn by [[Murder]], the Home Secretary, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]] whose guise  is taken by [[Hypocrisy]], and the Lord Chancellor, [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]] whose ermine gown is worn by [[Fraud]].  Led by [[Anarchy]], a skeleton with a crown, they try to take over [[England]], but are slain by a mysterious armored figure who arises from a mist. The maiden [[Hope]], revived, then calls to the people of England:

:''&quot;Men of England, heirs of Glory,''
:''Heroes of unwritten story,''
:''Nurslings of one mighty Mother,''
:''Hopes of her, and one another;''

:''What is Freedom? Ye can tell ''
:''That which Slavery is too well,''
:''For its very name has grown''
:''To an echo of your own''

:''Let a vast assembly be,''
:''And with great solemnity''
:''Declare with measured words, that ye
:''Are, as God has made ye, free!

:''The old laws of England--they ''
:''Whose reverend heads with age are grey,''
:''Children of a wiser day;''
:''And whose solemn voice must be ''
:''Thine own echo--Liberty!''

:''Rise like Lions after slumber''
:''In unvanquishable number,''
:''Shake your chains to earth like dew''
:''Which in sleep had fallen on you-''
:''Ye are many — they are few&quot;''

Political authors and campaigners such as [[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]], [[Paul Foot]] among others describe it as &quot;the greatest political poem ever written in English&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;holmes&quot;&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 1-59017-037-7 |title = Shelley: The Pursuit | publisher = New York Review of Books | year = 2003 (1st ed. 1974) | pages = 532 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_dC8_eLftKwC&amp;pg=PA532| author = [[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;foot&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.isreview.org/issues/46/shelley.shtml | author = [[Paul Foot]] |title = Shelley: Trumpet of Prophecy | journal = [[International Socialist Review (1997)|International Socialist Review]] | issue = 46 |month = March–April | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
