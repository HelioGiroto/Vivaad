[[Image:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[political cartoon]] depicting [[Preston Brooks]]'s attack on [[Charles Sumner]], an example of legislative violence.]]
'''Legislative violence''' broadly refers to any violent clashes between members of a [[legislature]], often physically inside the legislature and triggered by divisive issues and tight votes. Such clashes have occurred in many countries across time, and notable incidents still regularly occur.

Although the sight of brawling politicians is incongruous with a legislature's stately image, its occupants, like in any other workplace, are still prone to stress and anger. The confrontational nature of politics and the high stakes often add to the simmering tensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc 2004&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3560977.stm &quot;When politicians attack...&quot;], [[BBC News]], March 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Rome ==
[[Image:Cesar-sa mort.jpg|300px|thumb|''Morte de Césare'' (Death of Caesar) by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]]]]
Roman general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] was famously [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] by a group of senators on the [[Ides of March]], 44 BC during a meeting of the [[Roman Senate]]. The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination lead to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

A member of the legislative assembly has been assaulted on 10 November 2009 in the state assembly. One of the members 'who can't speak Marathi' took oath in Hindi the national language of India. This was objected to by a right wing party Maharashtra Navanirmana Samithi, that wants Marathi to be the official language in the state. Four members of the Maharashtra Navaniramana Samithi were immediately suspended for 4years. Violence is extremely unusual in the legislatures of India.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-10/india/28082548_1_abu-asim-azmi-oath-taking-vasant-gite&lt;/ref&gt;

;1 December 2006
Hours before the scheduled Oath of Office ceremony for [[Felipe Calderón]] in the Legislative Palace, the legislature erupted in a brawl. It was the latest installment of the string of fistfights that rattled the Mexican legislature. The incident was broadcast on live television. In spite of such events the ceremony took place. Calderón entered the Congress chamber through a back door directly onto the podium, and in a quick ceremony took the Oath of Office amid jeers. Then, after singing the national anthem which silenced the opposition for a while, he took a quick exit rather than deliver his inaugural address to Congress (the traditional follow-up to the oath taking).&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/12/01/mexico.new.government.ap/index.html &quot;Mexican Congress in brawl before inauguration&quot;].

==Taiwan==
{{wikinews|Taiwan MP shoves proposal in mouth}}
The [[Legislative Yuan]] of the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) is probably the most notable example of legislative violence today. In the history of the Legislative Yuan, numerous [[violent]] acts have occurred during parliamentary sessions. It is popularly referred locally as &quot;Legislative Brawling&quot; ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|立委群毆}}). In 1995, the Legislative Yuan was presented with the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] Peace Award, for &quot;demonstrating that politicians gain more by punching, kicking and gouging each other than by waging war against other nations.&quot; Listed below are the most current brawlings in the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan.

;23 March 2004
A serious scuffle broke out between the ruling and opposition party members after an argument over vote recounts from the [[ROC presidential election, 2004|presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3559687.stm &quot;Taiwan leader denies vote-rigging&quot;], [[BBC News]], March 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers [[Chu Hsing-yu]] and [[Lai Ching-teh]] got into a brawl over legislative procedures. TV stations showed Chu grabbing Lai and trying to wrestle him onto a desk. He then tried to [[headbutt]] his colleague before jabbing him in the stomach. The brawl resulted in having a traffic policeman called into the chamber to test Chu's alcohol level, after he was accused of being drunk. The tests showed no sign of alcohol influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3692855.stm &quot;Taiwan politicians brawl over procedure&quot;], [[BBC News]], May 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition members failed to get her to cough it up by pulling her hair. She later spat the proposal out and tore it up. This is the third time that the DPP’s actions have stopped a vote over this issue.

Two dozen members overwhelmed the Speaker's podium, which became a free-for-all between the ruling ([[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]]) and opposition ([[Kuomintang|KMT]]) parties with punches and sprayed water, requiring at least one hospitalization. The fight was over an alleged delay of the annual budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6636237.stm Taiwanese MPs in parliament brawl], [[BBC News]], May 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], the government and the opposition are separated by red lines drawn on the carpet. The red lines in front of the two sets of benches are two sword-lengths apart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foreign News: Off the Carpet|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883453,00.html|accessdate=28 July 2010|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=10 June 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or a little more than two sword-lengths apart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foreign News: Renovated Bottle|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813689,00.html|accessdate=28 July 2010|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=6 November 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;); a Member is traditionally not allowed to cross the line during debates, supposedly because the Member might then be able to attack an individual on the opposite side. These procedures were made because the Members were allowed to carry weapons into the House in its founding days.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc 2004&quot; /&gt;

;1972
During a dispute over the conduct of British soldiers on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], Independent Socialist MP [[Bernadette Devlin]] punched the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Home Secretary [[Reginald Maudling]]. Her aggression was in response to the comments made by Maudling, who was maintaining that the British Army had fired at Bloody Sunday protesters in self-defence, contrary to the testimonies of civilian eye-witnesses (including Devlin herself). She argued that she was being denied the right to speak. Her actions resulted in her being banned from the House of Commons for six months.

In the aftermath of a rancorous debate with Labour MPs over the [[Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977|Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill]], Conservative [[Michael Heseltine]] was enraged by a group who began singing ''[[The Red Flag]]''. He seized the chamber's [[ceremonial mace]] and brandished it over his head, but was restrained by [[Jim Prior]], and after his departure legislative action was suspended for the day.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82544.stm Mace - Commons]&quot;, BBC News, published December 22, 2005, accessed June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lyon-griswold-brawl.jpg|right|thumb|''Congressional Pugilists'', a 1798 political cartoon depicting the fight between Griswold and Lyon.]]
Federalist Congressman [[Roger Griswold]] of [[Connecticut]] attacked [[Vermont]] Representative [[Matthew Lyon]] with a [[hickory]] walking stick in the chambers of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.

The two men had a prior history of conflict. On January 30 of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face. As a result of Lyon's actions in that case, he became the first Congressman to have charges filed against him with that body's ethics committee, although he escaped censure through a vote in the House.

;May 22, 1856
Congressman [[Preston Brooks]] of [[South Carolina]] famously assaulted [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]] for a previous speech of his, saying his uncle [[Andrew Butler]] took &quot;a mistress who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean, the harlot, Slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After having consulted with fellow South Carolina Congressman [[Laurence Keitt]] on the situation, Brooks and Keitt decided that Sumner had the social status of a &quot;drunkard&quot; and was thus unworthy of the traditional challenge to a [[duelling|duel]]. Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, &quot;Let them be!&quot; Keitt was censured for his actions and resigned in protest, but was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat by his South Carolina constituency within a month. For several decades following, Senators often carried walking [[Cane (tool)|cane]]s and even [[revolver]]s in the Senate Chamber, fearing a similar assault.

;February 5, 1858,
Congressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democrat side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a &quot;black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy&quot;. Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that “No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.” Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would &quot;choke him for that&quot;. A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

;February 24, 1887
The [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party’s attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].

;February 20, 1902
During a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of &quot;treachery&quot; for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine Annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On February 28, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.

In 1988 when [[Pope John Paul II]] addressed the European Parliament, [[Ian Paisley]], then an [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]], denounced him as the [[Antichrist]] and was subjected to booing by fellow MEPs who also threw objects at him; [[Otto von Habsburg]] was among those who helped physically eject him from the room.
