{{Confuse|Federation}}
{{Forms of government}}

A '''confederation''' (or '''confederacy'''), in modern political terms, is a permanent union of political units for common action in relation to other units.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Usually created by [[treaty]] but often later adopting a common [[constitution]], confederations tend to be established for dealing with critical issues (such as [[defense (military)|defense]], [[foreign affairs]], or a common [[currency]]), with the [[central government]] being required to provide support for all members.

The nature of the relationship among the states constituting a confederation varies considerably. Likewise, the relationship between the member states, the central government, and the distribution of powers among them is highly variable. Some looser confederations are similar to [[intergovernmental organization]]s, while tighter confederations may resemble [[Federation|federations]].

In a non-political context, confederation is used to describe a type of organization which consolidates authority from other autonomous (or semi-autonomous) bodies. Examples include sports confederations or confederations of pan-[[Europe|European]] [[trades union|trades unions]].

In [[Canada]], the word ''confederation'' has an additional, unrelated meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref_&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/fed_state_01-e.asp |title=How Canadian Govern Themselves, First Edition, 1980 by Eugene Forsey, Ch. on A Federal State p.1 |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Confederation&quot; refers to the process of (or the event of) establishing or joining the Canadian federal state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref_&quot; /&gt;

In the context of the history of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], a confederacy may refer to a semi-permanent political and military alliance consisting of multiple nations (or &quot;tribes&quot;, &quot;bands&quot;, or &quot;villages&quot;) which maintained their separate leadership. One of the most well-known is the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], but there were many others during different eras and locations across North America; these include the [[Western Confederacy]], [[Powhatan Confederacy]], [[Seven Nations of Canada]], [[Pontiac's Confederacy]], [[Illinois Confederation]], [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]], [[Great Sioux Nation]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy]], and [[Iron Confederacy]].

== Examples==
=== Belgium ===
Many authors are now speaking of [[Belgium]] as a country with some aspects of a confederation. C.E. Lagasse wrote it about the agreements between Belgian Regions and Communities: &quot;We are near the political system of a Confederation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;French ''Le confédéralisme n'est pas loin'' Charles-Etienne Lagasse, ''Les nouvelles institutions politiques de la Belgique et de l'Europe'', Erasme, [[Namur (city)|Namur]] 2003, p. 405 ISBN 2-87127-783-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent de Coorebyter]], Director of the CRISP&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisp.be/UK/UK_index.html Belgian research center whose activities are devoted to the study of decision-making in Belgium and in Europe]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in ''[[Le Soir]]'' &quot;Belgium is undoubtedly a federation... [but] has some aspects of a confederation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;French: &quot;La Belgique est  (...) incontestablement, une fédération : il n’y a aucun doute  (...) Cela étant, la fédération belge possède d’ores et déjà des traits confédéraux qui en font un pays atypique, et qui encouragent apparemment certains responsables à réfléchir à des accommodements supplémentaires dans un cadre qui resterait, vaille que vaille, national.&quot; Vincent de Coorebyter &quot;La Belgique (con)fédérale&quot; in [[Le Soir]] 24 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Quévit, Professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven]] wrote also in [[Le Soir]] &quot;The Belgian political system is already in dynamics of a Confederation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;French: &quot;Le système institutionnel belge est déjà inscrit dans une dynamique de type confédéral.&quot; Michel Quévit ''Le confédéralisme est une chance pour les Wallons et les Bruxellois'', [[Le Soir]], 19 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The same author wrote previously about this issue in 1984 with other professors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Deschamps, Michel Quévit, Robert Tollet, &quot;Vers une réforme de type confédéral de l'État belge dans le cadre du maintien de l'union monétaire,&quot; in ''Wallonie 84'', n°2, pp. 95-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Belgian regions and communities lack the crucial autonomy to quit the Belgian state. As such, the federal aspects seems to dominate.

===Canada===
Canada is a federation and not a confederation, since it is a single sovereign nation-state. [[Canadian Confederation]] generally refers to the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] which initially formed the [[Dominion of Canada]] from three of the colonies of [[British North America]], and to the subsequent incorporation of other colonies and territories. Thus on July 1, 1867 Canada became a self-governing [[dominion]] of the British Empire with a [[Federalism|federal structure]] under the leadership of [[Sir John A. Macdonald]]. The provinces originally involved were Canada (comprising Canada West, now [[Ontario]], formerly [[Upper Canada]]; and Canada East now [[Quebec]], formerly [[Lower Canada]]), [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]]. Later participants were [[Manitoba]], [[British Columbia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] (created as provinces from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1905), and finally Newfoundland (now [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) in 1949. Canada is an unusually decentralized, &quot;collaborative&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;Page=archive&amp;Sub=speeches-discours&amp;Doc=19990422-eng.htm Collaborative Federalism in an era of globalization&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[federation|federal state]] and not a confederate association of sovereign states,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/sites/lop/aboutparliament/forsey/fed_state_01-e.asp How Canadians Govern Themselves, 7th ed]&lt;/ref&gt; (the usual meaning of ''confederation'' in modern terms). A Canadian law, the [[Clarity Act]], and a court ruling, [[Reference re Secession of Quebec]], set forth the conditions for negotiations to allow [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian provinces]] (though not [[Territories of Canada|territories]]) to leave the Canadian federal state; however, as this would require a constitutional amendment, there is no current &quot;constitutional&quot; method for withdrawal.

===European Union===
Due to its unique nature, and the political sensitivities surrounding it, there is no common or legal classification for the [[European Union]] (EU). However, it does bear some resemblance to both a confederation and a federation. The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a single economic market, open internal borders, a common currency and allow for numerous other areas where powers have been transferred and directly applicable laws are made. However, unlike a federation, the EU does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs, defence and taxation. Furthermore, laws sometimes must be transcribed into national law by national parliaments; decisions by member states are taken by special majorities with blocking minorities accounted for; and treaty amendment requires ratification by every member state before it can come into force.

However, academic observers more usually discuss the EU in the terms of it being a federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Josselin2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |last=Josselin |first=Jean Michel |last2=Marciano |first2=Alain |year=2006 |title=The Political Economy of European Federalism |series=Series: Public Economics and Social Choice |publisher=Centre for Research in Economics and Management, University of Rennes 1, University of Caen |page=12 |id=WP 2006-07; UMR CNRS 6211 |url=http://crem.univ-rennes1.fr/wp/2006/ie-200607.pdf |quote=A complete shift from a confederation to a federation would have required to straightforwardly replace the principalship of the member states ''vis-à-vis'' the Union by that of the European citizens....

Josselin (U. de Rennes-1/CREM) and Marciano (U. de Reims CA/CNRS).&lt;/ref&gt; As international law professor [[Joseph H. H.

As a consequence, both confederate and federate features coexist in the judicial landscape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Josselin |first=Jean Michel  |last2=Marciano |first2=Alain |year=2006 |title=The political economy of European federalism |series=Series: Public Economics and Social Choice |publisher=Centre for Research in Economics and Management, University of Rennes 1, University of Caen |page=12 |id=WP 2006-07; UMR CNRS 6211 |url=http://crem.univ-rennes1.fr/wp/2006/ie-200607.pdf |format=PDF |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutgers University political science professor R. Daniel Kelemen has observed: &quot;Those uncomfortable using the 'F' word in the EU context should feel free to refer to it as a quasi-federal or federal-like system. Nevertheless ... the EU has the necessary attributes of a federal system. It is striking that while many scholars of the EU continue to resist analyzing it as a federation, most contemporary students of federalism view the EU as a federal system.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;A Political Theory of Federalism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bednar|first=Jenna|title=A Political Theory of Federalism|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University|pages=223-270}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{When|date=March 2012}} According to Thomas Risse and Tanja A. Börzel, &quot;the EU only lacks two significant features of a federation. First, the Member States remain the 'masters' of the treaties, i.e., they have the exclusive power to amend or change the constitutive treaties of the EU. Second, the EU lacks a real 'tax and spend' capacity, in other words, there is no fiscal federalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Risse and Tanja A. Börzel, [http://centers.law.nyu.edu/jeanmonnet/archive/papers/00/00f0101-04.html Who is Afraid of a European Federation? How to Constitutionalise a Multi-Level Governance System, Section 4: The European Union as an Emerging Federal System], Jean Monnet Center at [[NYU School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] found opposition from the United Kingdom towards including the word &quot;federal&quot; in the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], and hence replaced the word with &quot;Community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1435550/Giscard%27s-%27federal%27-ruse-to-protect-Blair.html |title=Giscard's 'federal' ruse to protect Blair |work=The Daily Telegraph |author=Evans-Pritchard, Ambrose |date= 2003-07-08 |accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iroquois League===
The [[Iroquois]] League, historically the '''[[Iroquois Confederacy]]''', is a group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (in what is now the United States) and [[First Nations]] (in what is now Canada) that consists of six nations: the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], the [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]], the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], the [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]], the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] and the [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]]. The Iroquois have a representative government known as the Grand Council. The Grand Council is the oldest governmental institution still maintaining its original form in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; The League has been functioning since prior to major European contact.  Each tribe sends chiefs to act as representatives and make decisions for the whole nation.

===Serbia and Montenegro===
[[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2003–2006) was a confederation that was formed by the two remaining republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFR Yugoslavia): [[Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Montenegro]] and neighboring [[Republic of Serbia (federal)|Serbia]] were sole [[Succession of states|legal successors]] to FR Yugoslavia, which consequently ceased to exist. The country was reconstituted as a very loose [[political union]] called the '''State Union of Serbia and Montenegro'''. It was established on February 4, 2003.

As a confederation, Serbia and Montenegro were united only in very few realms, such as defense, foreign affairs and a very weak common president of the confederation. The two constituent republics functioned separately throughout the period of its short existence, and continued to operate under separate economic policies, as well as using separate currencies (the [[euro]] was and still is the only legal tender in Montenegro, while the [[dinar]] was still the legal tender in Serbia). On 21 May 2006, the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence referendum]] was held. Final official results indicated on 31 May that 55.5% of voters voted in favor of independence. The state union effectively came to an end after Montenegro's formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006, and Serbia's formal declaration of independence on 5 June.

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland, officially known as the [[Swiss Confederation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ |title=Startseite |publisher=admin.ch |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bk.admin.ch/dokumentation/02070/index.html?lang=en |title=Federal Chancellery - The Swiss Confederation – a brief guide |publisher=Bk.admin.ch |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swissconfederationinstitute.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a modern country that refers to itself as a confederation. However, Switzerland is a confederation only in name, as after the civil war of 1847, when some of the Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the [[Sonderbundskrieg]]), the resulting political system acquired all the characteristics of a [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;Haller/Kölz, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a confederacy since its inception in 1291 as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], originally created as an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps, and retains the confederal name. The confederacy facilitated management of common interests (free trade) and ensured peace in the important mountain trade.

== Historical confederations ==
[[Image:Frankfurter Fürstentag 1863 Abschlußphoto.jpg|thumb|400px|The monarchs of the member states of the [[German Confederation]] meet in [[Frankfurt]] in 1863.]]
Historical confederations (especially those predating the 20th century) may not fit the current definition of a confederation, may be proclaimed as a federation but be confederal (or the reverse), and may not show any qualities that are today recognized as those of a confederation.
