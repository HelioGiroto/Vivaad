{{Socialism sidebar}}

'''Democratic socialism''' is a variant of [[socialism]] that rejects centralized, elitist or [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] means of transitioning from capitalism to socialism. Democratic socialism advocates for the immediate creation of decentralised [[economic democracy]] from the grassroots level, undertaken by and for the [[working class]] itself. 

The term is often used by socialists who favour spontaneous revolution from below or gradualist [[reformism]] over organised [[revolutionary socialism]], in effort to distinguish themselves from [[Leninism|Leninist]] socialists, who seek to organise a [[revolution]]ary movement by a [[vanguard party]] based on principles of [[democratic centralism]]. 

Democratic socialists endorse a post-capitalist, socialist economic system as an alternative to capitalism. Some democratic socialists advocate [[market socialism]] based on workplace self-management, while others support a non-market system based on  [[Decentrally planned economy|decentralized]]-participatory planning. Many contemporary democratic socialists reject centralized planning as a basis for democratic socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Schweickart, David. ''Democratic Socialism''. Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice (2006): http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm: &quot;Virtually all (democratic) socialists have distanced themselves from the economic model long synonymous with 'socialism,' i.e. the Soviet model of a non-market, centrally-planned economy...Some have endorsed the concept of 'market socialism,' a post-capitalist economy that retains market competition, but socializes the means of production, and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace.  Some hold out for a non-market, participatory economy.  All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==

Democratic socialism is difficult to define, and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of [[socialism]] that follow an electoral, [[reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism, rather than a [[revolution]]ary one.&lt;ref&gt;This definition is captured in this statement: [[Anthony Crosland]] &quot;argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant.&quot; (Chris Pierson, &quot;Lost property: What the Third Way lacks,&quot; ''Journal of Political Ideologies'' (June 2005), 10(2), 145–163 URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13569310500097265). Other texts which use the terms &quot;democratic socialism&quot; in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Sweden]]'' (St Martin’s Press 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, this definition is invoked to distinguish democratic socialism from [[Stalinism|Stalinist socialism]], as in Donald Busky's ''Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey'',&lt;ref&gt;See pp.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Tomlinson's ''Democratic Socialism and Economic Policy: The Attlee Years, 1945-1951'', Norman Thomas ''Democratic Socialism: a new appraisal'' or [[Roy Hattersley]]'s ''Choose Freedom: The Future of Democratic Socialism''.

But for those who use the term in this way, the scope of the term &quot;socialism&quot; itself can be very vague, and include proposals compatible with [[capitalism]]. For example, Robert M. Page, a Reader in Democratic Socialism and Social Policy at the [[University of Birmingham]], writes about &quot;transformative democratic socialism&quot; to refer to the politics of the [[Clement Attlee]] government (a strong [[welfare state]], fiscal redistribution, some nationalisation) and &quot;revisionist democratic socialism,&quot; as developed by [[Anthony Crosland]] and [[Harold Wilson]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The most influential revisionist Labour thinker, Anthony Crosland..., contended that a more &quot;benevolent&quot; form of capitalism had emerged since the [Second World War] ... According to Crosland, it was now possible to achieve greater equality in society without the need for &quot;fundamental&quot; economic transformation. For Crosland, a more meaningful form of equality could be achieved if the growth dividend derived from effective management of the economy was invested in &quot;pro-poor&quot; public services rather than through fiscal redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M Page, &quot;Without a Song in their Heart: New Labour, the Welfare State and the Retreat from Democratic Socialism,&quot; ''Jnl Soc. Pol.'', 36, 1, 19–37  2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, some proponents of [[market socialism]] see the latter as a form of democratic socialism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, David Miller, ''Market, State, and Community: Theoretical Foundations of Market Socialism'' (Oxford University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of this set of definitions is [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s argument, set out in ''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'' (1941), that [[liberal democracies]] were evolving from &quot;liberal capitalism&quot; into democratic socialism, with the growth of [[workers' self-management]], [[industrial democracy]] and regulatory institutions.&lt;ref&gt;See John Medearis, &quot;Schumpeter, the New Deal, and Democracy,&quot; ''The American Political Science Review'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, other definitions of democratic socialism sharply distinguish it from [[social democracy]].&lt;ref name=sdvrds&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/pdf/widemsoc.pdf What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Peter Hain]] classifies democratic socialism, along with [[libertarian socialism]], as a form of [[anti-authoritarian]] &quot;[[The Two Souls of Socialism|socialism from below]]&quot; (using the term popularised by [[Hal Draper]]), in contrast to [[Stalinism]] and social democracy, variants of [[authoritarian]] [[state socialism]]. For Hain, this democratic/authoritarian divide is more important than the [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]]/[[reformist]] divide.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hain]] ''Ayes to the Left'' Lawrence and Wishart.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this definition, it is the active participation of the population as a whole, and workers in particular, in the management of economy that characterises democratic socialism, while [[nationalisation]] and [[economic planning]] (whether controlled by an elected government or not) are characteristic of state socialism. A similar, but more complex, argument is made by [[Nicos Poulantzas]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=article&amp;view=1242 Towards a Democratic Socialism],&quot; ''New Left Review'' I/109, May–June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Draper himself uses the term &quot;revolutionary-democratic socialism&quot; as a type of [[socialism from below]] in his ''[[The Two Souls of Socialism]]''. He writes: &quot;the leading spokesman in the Second International of a revolutionary-democratic Socialism-from-Below [was] [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who so emphatically put her faith and hope in the spontaneous struggle of a free working class that the myth-makers invented for her a 'theory of spontaneity{{'&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Draper, ''The Two Souls of Socialism'', &quot;[http://www.sirendesign.net/solidarity/socialism.htm#Chap7 Chapter 7: The Revisionist Facade].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, about [[Eugene Debs]], he writes: {{&quot;'}}Debsian socialism' evoked a tremendous response from the heart of the people, but Debs had no successor as a tribune of revolutionary-democratic socialism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hal Draper, ''The Two Souls of Socialism'', &quot;[http://www.sirendesign.net/solidarity/socialism.htm#Chap8 Chapter 8: The 100% American Scene].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions fall between the first and second set, seeing democratic socialism as a specific political tradition closely related to and overlapping with social democracy. For example, [[Bogdan Denitch]], in ''Democratic Socialism'', defines it as proposing a radical reorganization of the socio-economic order through public ownership, [[workers' control]] of the [[labor process]] and redistributive tax policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Denitch, ''Democratic Socialism: The Mass Left in Advanced Industrial Societies'' (Allanheld, Osmun, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert G. Picard similarly describes a democratic socialist tradition of thought including [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Evan Durbin]] and [[Michael Harrington]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Press and the Decline of Democracy: Democratic Socialist Response in Public Policy'' (1985 Praeger/Greenwood).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''democratic socialism'' can be used in a third way, to refer to a version of the [[Soviet democracy|Soviet model]] that was reformed in a democratic way. For example, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] described [[perestroika]] as building a &quot;new, humane and democratic socialism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul T. Christensen &quot;Perestroika and the Problem of Socialist Renewal&quot; ''Social Text'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, some former [[Communist parties]] have rebranded themselves as democratic socialist, as with the [[The Left Party.PDS|Party of Democratic Socialism]] in Germany.

Justification of democratic socialism can be found in the works of social philosophers like [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[Axel Honneth]], among others. Honneth has put forward the view that political and economic ideologies have a social basis, that is, they originate from intersubjective communication between members of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Honneth|first=Axel|authorlink=Axel Honneth|chapter=The Limits of Liberalism:  On the Political-Ethical Discussion Concerning Communitarianism|year=1995|editor-surname= Honneth|editor-first= Axel|title=The Fragmented World of the Social|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-2300-X|pages=231–247 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honneth criticises the liberal state because it assumes that principles of [[individual liberty]] and [[private property]] are ahistorical and abstract, when, in fact, they evolved from a specific social discourse on human activity. Contra [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[individualism]], Honneth has emphasised the inter-subjective dependence between humans; that is, our well-being depends on recognising others and being recognised by them. Democratic socialism, with its emphasis on social [[collectivism]], could be seen as a way of safeguarding this dependency.

In recent years, some{{who?|date=April 2012}} have suggested replacing &quot;democratic&quot; with &quot;participatory&quot; upon seeing the reduction of the former to parliamentarism.

==History==
===Forerunners and formative influences===

[[Fenner Brockway]], a leading British democratic socialist of the [[Independent Labour Party]], wrote in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Levellers]] were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]] were the pioneers of [[workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]] were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]]. All three equate to democratic socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Peter Hain]] ''Ayes to the Left'' Lawrence and Wishart, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[EP Thompson]] in ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' by [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] groups like the [[London Corresponding Society]] and by polemicists such as [[Thomas Paine]]. Their concern for both democracy and [[social justice]] marks them out as key precursors of democratic socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Taylor [http://www.zyworld.com/albionmagazineonline/english_radicalism.htm  “A Potted History of English Radicalism”] ''Albion Magazine'' Summer 2007; M. Thrale (ed.) ''Selections from the Papers of the London Corresponding Society 1792-1799'' (Cambridge University Press, 1983); E. P. Thompson ''The Making of the English Working Class''. Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;socialist&quot; was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827&lt;ref&gt;Hain, op cit, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;  and came to be associated with the followers of the [[Wales|Welsh]] reformer [[Robert Owen]], such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]] who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers again stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation, in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. The [[Chartists]] similarly combined a [[labour movement|working class politics]] with a call for greater democracy. Many countries have this.

The British [[moral philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of economic socialism within a [[Liberalism|liberal]] context. In later editions of his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that &quot;as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fred. &quot;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/John Stuart Mill].&quot; ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 10 July 2007. Retrieved 17 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.&quot;  Bruce Baum, &quot;[J. S. Mill and Liberal Socialism],&quot; Nadia Urbanati and Alex Zacharas, eds., ''J. S. Mill’s Political Thought: A Bicentennial Reassessment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, [[Henry George]] promoted the [[Single Tax]] Movement, which sought a form of democratic socialism via [[progressive taxation]], with tax only on [[natural resource]]s. George remained an advocate of the [[free market]] for the allocation of all other goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.henrygeorge.org/canons.htm Taxes: What Are They Good For?]&quot; Henry George Institute. Retrieved 17 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern democratic socialism===
[[Image:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Keir Hardie]] was an early democratic socialist, who founded the [[Independent Labour Party]] in Great Britain]]

Democratic socialism became a prominent movement at the end of the 19th century. In [[Australia]], the Labour and Socialist movements were gaining traction and the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) was formed in [[Barcaldine, Queensland]] in 1891 by striking pastoral workers. A minority government led by the party was formed in [[Queensland]] in 1899 with [[Anderson Dawson]] as the [[Premier of Queensland]] where it was founded and was in power for one week, the world's first democratic socialist party led government.{{fact|date=April 2012}} The ALP has been the main driving force for workers' rights in Australia, backed by Australian Trade Unions, in particular the [[Australian Workers Union]]. Since the [[Whitlam Government]], the ALP has moved towards [[Social Democracy|Social Democratic]] and [[Third Way]] ideals which are found among many of the ALP's [[Labor Unity|Right Faction]] members. Democratic Socialist, [[Christian Socialist]], [[Libertarian Marxist]] and [[Agrarian socialism|Agrarian Socialist]] ideologies lie within Labor's [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Left Faction]].

In the US, [[Eugene V. Debs]], one of the most famous American socialists, led a movement centered around democratic socialism and made five bids for President, once in 1900 as candidate of the [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|Social Democratic Party]] and then four more times on the ticket of the [[Socialist Party of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Busky, &quot;Democratic Socialism in North America,&quot; ''Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey'' especially pp.153-177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The socialist industrial unionism of [[Daniel DeLeon]] in the [[United States]] represented another strain of early democratic socialism in this period. It favored a form of government based on industrial unions, but which also sought to establish this government after winning at the ballot box.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Busky &quot;Democratic Socialism in North America&quot; ''Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey'' especially pp.150-154.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition continued to flourish in the [[Socialist Party of America]], especially under the leadership of [[Norman Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Fitrakis, &quot;[http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/dissertations/AAI9029621 The idea of democratic socialism in America and the decline of the Socialist Party: Eugene Debs, Norman Thomas and Michael Harrington. (Volumes I and II)]&quot; (January 1, 1990). ETD Collection for Wayne State University. Paper AAI9029621. See also &quot;[http://www.dsausa.org/pdf/widemsoc.pdf What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] from Vermont is a self-described democratic socialist, and is the only self-described socialist to ever be elected to the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/04/AR2006110401124.html |title=Exceedingly Social, But Doesn't Like Parties |accessdate=2009-03-17 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2006-11-05 |quote=Vermont ...[is]... about to send the first avowed socialist to the Senate since ... well ... never. | first=Michael | last=Powell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the democratic socialist tradition was represented in particular by the [[William Morris]]' [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]], and in the 1880s by the [[Fabian Society]], and later the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) founded by [[Keir Hardie]] in the 1890s, of which [[George Orwell]] would later be a prominent member.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Busky, &quot;Democratic Socialism in Great Britain and Ireland,&quot; ''Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey'', pp.83-5 on Morris, pp.91-109 on Hardie and the ILP. On Morris as democratic socialist, see also volume 3 of David Reisman, ed., ''Democratic Socialism in Britain: Classic Texts in Economic and Political Thought, 1825–1952'' and [[E P Thompson]], ''William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary'' (London: Merlin, 1977). On the ILP as democratic socialist, see also [http://www.the-ilp.org.uk/ilphist.htm The ILP: A Very Brief History]; James, David, Jowitt, Tony, and Laybourn, Keith, eds. ''The Centennial History of the Independent Labour Party''. Halifax: Ryburn, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s, the [[guild socialism]] of [[G. D. H. Cole]] attempted to envision a socialist alternative to [[Soviet]]-style [[authoritarianism]], while [[council communism]] articulated democratic socialist positions in several respects, notably through renouncing the [[vanguard party|vanguard]] role of the revolutionary party and holding that the system of the [[Soviet Union]] was not authentically socialist.&lt;ref&gt;On Cole as democratic socialist, see also volume 7 of David Reisman, ed, ''Democratic Socialism in Britain: Classic Texts in Economic and Political Thought, 1825–1952''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giuseppe Saragat.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Italian President [[Giuseppe Saragat]]]]
In other parts of [[Europe]], many democratic socialist parties were united in the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] (the &quot;Two and a Half International&quot;) in the early 1920s and in the [[London Bureau]] (the &quot;Three and a Half International&quot;) in the 1930s. These internationals sought to steer a course between the social democrats of the [[Second International]], who were seen as insufficiently socialist (and had been compromised by their support for [[World War I]]), and the perceived anti-democratic [[Third International]]. The key movements within the Two and a Half International were the ILP and the [[Austromarxism|Austromarxists]], and the main forces in the Three and a Half International were the ILP and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;F. Peter Wagner, ''Rudolf Hilferding: Theory and Politics of Democratic Socialism'' (Atlantic Highlands 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Polasky, ''The Democratic Socialism of Emile Vandervelde: Between Reform and Revolution'' (Oxford 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Italy]], the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]] broke away from the [[Italian Socialist Party]] in 1947, when this latter joined the Soviet-funded [[Italian Communist Party]] to prepare the decisive [[Italian general election, 1948|general election of 1948]]. Despite remaining a minor party in Italian Parliament for fifty years, its leader [[Giuseppe Saragat]] became [[President of Italy]] in 1964.

During [[India]]'s [[Indian independence movement|freedom movement]], many figures on the left of the [[Indian National Congress]] organized themselves as the [[Congress Socialist Party]]. Their politics, and those of the early and intermediate periods of [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]'s career, combined a commitment to the socialist transformation of society with a principled opposition to the one-party authoritarianism they perceived in the [[Stalinist]] revolutionary model. This political current continued in the [[Praja Socialist Party]], the later [[Janata Party]] and the current [[Samajwadi Party]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.kamat.com/database/content/democratic_socialism/ Vikas Kamat Democratic Socialism in India].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Appadorai, &quot;Recent Socialist Thought in India,&quot; ''The Review of Politics'' Vol. 30, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 349-362.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], Zulfikar Ali Bhutto introduced the concept of democratic socialism, and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] remained one of the prominent supporter for the socialist democratic policies in the country. [[Pakistan Socialist Party]] and [[Pakistan Social Democratic Party]], together with PPP, committed to the socialist transformations and reforms with an opposition to one-party dictatorship and authoritarianism.

In the [[Middle East]], the biggest democratic socialist party is the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)]].

The ''folkesocialisme'' or [[Popular Socialism|people's socialism]] that emerged as a vital current of the left in [[Scandinavia]] beginning in the 1950s could be characterized as a democratic socialism in the same vein. Former Swedish prime minister [[Olof Palme]] is an important proponent of democratic socialism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Därför är jag demokratisk socialist,&quot; speech by Olof Palme at the 1982 [[Socialdemokraterna|Social Democratic]] party congress&lt;/ref&gt;
