      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8864">An '''independence referendum''' is a type of [[referendum]] in which the citizens of a [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] decide whether the territory should become an [[Independence|independent]] [[country]]. The independence referendum is considered successful if the citizens vote in favor of independence or unsuccessful if they do not. A successful independence referendum may or may not result in independence, depending on whether relevant political factors outside of the territory recognize the results.

==Expected independence referendums==
*[[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]] independence referendum (envisioned by Peace Agreement from 2000 to be held between 2015 and 2020)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ips.cap.anu.edu.au/ssgm/resource_documents/bougainville/PDF/BougainvillePeaceAgreement29Aug01.pdf Bougainville Peace Agreement from 2000]: &quot;The referendum will be held no sooner than ten years, and in any case no later than
fifteen years, after the election of the [[autonomous Bougainville Government]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[New Caledonia]] independence referendum ([[Nouméa Accord|expected]] between 2014 and 2019)
*[[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]] to take place in Second half of Parliamentary term in 2014.

==Plausible future referendums==
*[[Catalonia]] - The Catalan Parliament approved on September 27, 2012 to hold a referendum on self-determination. The Spanish government said that they would stop it. Since an independence referendum will be presumably forbidden by Spain, other democratic ways could be used in the very near future to give Catalan people their right to chose their own future and decide if they want Catalonia to become an independent state.
*[[Quebec]] - Given the results of the [[Quebec general election, 2008|2008 Quebec election]], the likelihood of another referendum in Quebec has remained stable. The sovereignist [[Parti Québécois]] finished second behind a federalist party, regaining official opposition status momentarily lost in the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 Quebec election]].
*[[Western Sahara]] independence referendum (proposed by [[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]])
*[[Republika Srpska]] - The Prime Minister of Republika Srpska [[Milorad Dodik]] brought the idea of an independence referendum for RS into public debate when [[Montenegro]] seceded from the [[State Union of Serbia and Montenegro|union]] with [[Serbia]] in an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] on May 21, 2006. In an interview published in the Serbian media, Dodik said a referendum on independence for RS was a fair solution and that 99&amp;nbsp;percent of Bosnian Serbs support secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dodik stated that this referendum is &quot;inevitable&quot; since [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has no viable future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0609&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;P=5434 Link to reprint of article by Croatian newsagency Hina]. See also [[Matthew Parish]], [http://old.balkaninsight.com/en/main/comment/23797/ Republika Srpska After Independence]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ambazonia]] - With the ruling by the African Charter for Human and Peoples Rights in 2009, Southern Cameroons is recognized as a distinct people &quot;automatically entitled to all the other rights which are built into Article 20 (1-2) of the African Charter, which include the inalienable and unquestionable right to self-determination&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southerncameroonsig.org/2009/12/press-release-and-christmas-message-from-scapo-to-the-people-of-the-southern-cameroons.html#more&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] - As the result of a dispute between the [[Netherlands]] and [[Indonesia]] over West Papua, the [[New York Agreement]] was signed in 1962, making the territory a UN trusteeship and setting up a status referendum. In 1969 that [[Act of Free Choice|referendum]] was held, but only 1025 hand-picked men were allowed to vote and the result has since been called into question; Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] and a number of Western parliamentarians have called for the [[United Nations]] to look into the matter and possibly hold a re-vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB128/|title=Indonesia's 1969 Takeover of West Papua Not by &quot;Free Choice&quot;|editor=Simpson, Brad|date=2004-07-09|accessdate=2010-12-28|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
