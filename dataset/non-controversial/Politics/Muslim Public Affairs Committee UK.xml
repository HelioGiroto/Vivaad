The '''Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK''' ('''MPACUK''') is a non-profit [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Muslim]] organisation founded to address what it perceived as the under-representation of Muslims in British politics. The organisation is active primarily in electoral campaigns and media appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/about-mpacuk.html] About MPACUK. Retrieved 2010-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aims and policies==
MPACUK encourages Muslims to participate in [[tactical voting]] against [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] who support policies which it considers not to be in Muslims' interest. This can extend both to national issues such as [[civil liberties]], [[Islamophobia]] and anti-terror legislation; and to foreign policy, including the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israel-Palestine conflict]] and the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 Lebanon war]].

The group describes its activities as guided by four overarching principles: Reviving the fard (obligation) of Jihad, Anti-Zionism, institutional revival, and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/about-mpacuk.html] About MPACUK. Retrieved 2010-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
====Stop Islamophobia Week====
In July 2011, MPACUK launched the [[Stop Islamophobia Week]] campaign due to the rise in [[Islamophobia#United_Kingdom | anti-muslim hate crimes]]. This was a campaign aimed at raising awareness of Islamophobia and encouraging Muslims to do something constructive in response. Particular focus was given to the Srebrenica massacre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leedspsc.org.uk/mpacuk-launches-stop-islamophobia-week/]&lt;/ref&gt; which was commemorated by a vigil outside the embassy of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. 

In July 2012 with MPACUK continued [[Stop Islamophobia Week]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/story/090712/ceo-mpacuk-siw-2012.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Elections==
====2011====
In 2011 a campaign to encourage Muslims in Britain to vote YES in the UK was launched in response to the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/story/060411/vote-yes-5th-may.html], MPACUK Say Vote Yes&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010====
MPACUK was involved in campaigning to unseat 6 MPs in England. This included campaigning against [[Phil Woolas]] for alleged anti-Muslim bias. The campaign resulted in Phil Woolas winning a majority by 103 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news-headlines/40898/woolas-toasts-103-majority]. Oldham Election Result. Retrieved 2010-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after an eventual court-case resulted in suspension as an MP and ban from holding public office for three years for &quot;knowingly making false statements about his Liberal Democrat opponent&quot; [[Elwyn Watkins]], by alleging in his campaign literature that Watkins attempted to get support from Muslim extremists who advocated violence against Woolas. MPACUK was active in the Oldham campaign, and according to the BBC, &quot;urged Muslim voters to help unseat Phil Woolas, and targeted several other Labour MPs, who MPAC judged to have pro-Israeli positions and who supported the war in Iraq.&quot; Woolas stated &quot;There was vehement anti-semitism going on in the area, canvassing amongst the Asian population in the area saying: don't vote for the Jew. As it happens, I'm not Jewish but the fact my son's Christian name is a Jewish name was used against me.&quot; MPACUK denied responsibility for the rumours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11940564]. BBC MPACUK involvement article. Retrieved 2010-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year MPACUK campaigned to remove [[Andrew Dismore]] from office, stating he was someone &quot;who backed the Iraq war and has a long record of Islamophobia&quot;, and claimed responsibility for his defeat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/8153929.Muslim_group_claiming_responsibility_for_Dismore_defeat/] Times, MPACUK claims responsibility for defeat of Andrew Dismore in Hendon. Retrieved 2011-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005====
[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Lorna Fitzsimons]] became the target of an MPACUK campaign when she stood for re-election at the 2005 General Election in the constituency of [[Rochdale]], which has a significant Muslim population. The All-Party Parliamentary Report noted with concern MPACUK's campaign against Lorna Fitzsimons and that leaflets had been printed by MPACUK, which claimed that Fitzsimons had done nothing to help the Palestinians because she was a Jewish member of the [[Labour Friends of Israel]].&lt;ref name=All-Party/&gt; Fitzsimons, who was a member of the Labour Friends of Israel, is not in fact Jewish.&lt;ref name=&quot;somethingjewish&quot;&gt;Ben Morris, [http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/2014_bicom_s_new_ceo.htm BICOM's new CEO], SomethingJewish.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; MPACUK later apologised for the inaccurate description.&lt;ref name=All-Party/&gt; 

MPACUK was described by [[Jack Straw]] as &quot;most egregious&quot; after it actively campaigned for Muslims in his [[Blackburn]] [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]] to [[tactical voting|vote tactically]] against him in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/491623_labour_lord_attacks_lies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of antisemitism==
In 2004, MPACUK was the subject of a [[No Platform|no-platform]] order by the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], because of its alleged publication of antisemitic conspiracy theories and inciteful racist material, and further material on its website encouraging activists to break the law.&lt;ref&gt;Motion 118: Welfare, Minutes of NUS Annual Conference, 29–31 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lorna Fitzsimons's defeat, in 2006, [[Community Security Trust|CST]] accused MPACUK of antisemitism. An All Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-semitism observed that MPACUK was criticised by the CST for promoting the idea of a worldwide Zionist conspiracy and using material taken from neo-Nazi, white nationalist, and Holocaust denial websites. The report also noted CST's assertion that &quot;use of ‘Zionist’ as a replacement for ‘Jewish’ is common on the MPACUK website&quot; and that MPACUK has articulated antisemitic conspiracy theories through the language of anti-Zionism.&lt;ref name=All-Party&gt;[http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf]. Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry Into Antisemitism], [[All-Party Parliamentary Group against Anti-Semitism]], 7 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

MPACUK denies being anti-semitic and stated that &quot;it is worth noting that the labels of anti-Semitism and holocaust denial are being placed upon anyone that is critical of Israel by some Zionists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/faq#n653], MPACUK FAQ: Are you anti-Semitic? Do you deny the holocaust?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
====2006====
MPACUK and others sent an open letter with Birmingham Civic Society (2006) in protest to the renowned racist MP Enoch Powell being honoured in a memorial plaque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/content/view/3169/]&lt;/ref&gt;
A response was received from the Chairman of the society, Dr Freddie Gick, who replied with “I would be grateful if you could reassure members of the community that....as long as I remain Chairman of this Society, no such suggestion (Enoch Powell) would ever be given any serious consideration.” .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/content/view/3169/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005====
MPACUK launched a campaign against [[Oxfam]] for collaborating and trading with [[Starbucks]] who were accused of supporting [[Israel]]. The campaign came to an end when Oxfam announced they would be ceasing trade with Starbucks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/content/view/383/39/]&lt;/ref&gt;

MPACUK launched a campaign against Satellite Graphics Ltd who printed the [[British National Party]] magazine (BNP), “The Voice of Freedom”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1486514/Guess-who-prints-the-BNPs-anti-Muslim-newspaper-...-a-firm-owned-by-Saudis.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite Graphics Ltd are owned by Saudi Research and Marketing Company and after an online campaign, the Saudi Research and Marketing Company cut the funding of the BNP’s magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpacuk.org/content/view/502/33/]&lt;/ref&gt;
