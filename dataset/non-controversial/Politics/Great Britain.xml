'''Great Britain''' ({{lang-cy|Prydain Fawr}}, {{lang-gd|Breatainn Mhòr}}, {{lang-kw|Breten Veur}}, {{lang-sco|Great Breetain}}), also known as '''[[Britain (placename)|Britain]]''', is an [[island]] situated to the north-west of [[Continental Europe]].  It is the [[List of islands by area|ninth largest island in the world]], the largest [[Europe]]an island and the largest of the [[British Isles]]. With a population of about 60.0&amp;nbsp;million people in mid-2009,  it is the [[List of islands by population|third most populous island]] in the world, after [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Honshū]].  Great Britain is surrounded by over 1,000  smaller [[islands]] and [[islets]]. The island of [[Ireland]] lies to its west. Politically, Great Britain may also refer to the island itself together with a number of surrounding islands which constitute the territory of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].{{#tag:ref|Definitions and recommended usage varies. For example, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''Britain'' as an island and ''Great Britain'' as a political unit formed by England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|quote=Britain:/ˈbrɪt(ə)n/ the island containing England, Wales, and Scotland.

The name is also often used loosely to refer to the United Kingdom.|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Great+Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the [[Cambridge Guide to English Usage]] gives ''Britain'' as &quot;familiar shorthand for ''Great Britain'', the island which geographically contains England, Wales and Scotland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Pam|authorlink=Pam Peters|title=The [[Cambridge Guide to English Usage]]|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-62181-X|page=79|quote=The term Britain is familiar shorthand for Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=note0/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islands.unep.ch/Tiarea.htm |title=Islands by land area, United Nations Environment Programme |publisher=Islands.unep.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ons&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/pop0610.pdf|title=Population Estimates|date=24 June 2010|work=National Statistics Online|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=24 September 2010|location=Newport, Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.geohive.com/cntry/ Geohive.com Country data]; [http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2000/final/hyodai.htm Japan Census of 2000]; [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/ United Kingdom Census of 2001]. The editors of [[List of islands by population]] appear to have used similar data from the relevant statistics bureaux, and totalled up the various administrative districts that comprise each island, and then done the same for less populous islands. An editor of this article has not repeated that work. Therefore this plausible and eminently reasonable ranking is posted as unsourced [[Wikipedia:Common knowledge|common knowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapzone.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/mapzone/didyouknow/howmany/q_14_27.html |title=says 803 islands which have a distinguishable coastline on an Ordnance Survey map, and several thousand more exist which are too small to be shown as anything but a dot |publisher=Mapzone.ordnancesurvey.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the island is [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of the sovereign state of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and most of the United Kingdom's territory is in Great Britain. Most of England, Scotland, and Wales are on the island of Great Britain, as are their respective capital cities: [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[Cardiff]].

The [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] resulted from the political union of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] with the [[Acts of Union 1707]] on 1 May 1707 under [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. In 1801, under a new [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]], this kingdom merged with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. After the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) most of Ireland seceded from the Union, which then became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The relatively limited variety of [[fauna]] and [[flora]] on the island is due to its size and the fact that wildlife has had little time to develop since the [[last glacial period]]. The high level of [[Urbanization|urbanisation]] on the island has contributed to a species extinction rate that is about 100 times greater than the background species extinction rate.

==Political definition==
{{Main|Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom}}
Great Britain is the largest island of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Politically, Great Britain refers to England, Scotland and Wales in combination,&lt;ref name=&quot;Key facts about the United Kingdom&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Key facts about the United Kingdom | work = | publisher = Direct.gov.uk | url = http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/LivingintheUK/DG_10012517 | accessdate = 11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not [[Northern Ireland]]; it includes a number of islands off England, Scotland and Wales such as the [[Isle of Wight]], [[Anglesey]], the [[Isles of Scilly]], the [[Hebrides]], and the island groups of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]. It does not include the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]] which are not part of the United Kingdom, instead being self-governing [[British Crown Dependencies|dependent territories]] with their own legislative and taxation systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Key facts about the United Kingdom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ademuni-Odeke | first = | title = Bareboat Charter (ship) Registration | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 1998 | page = 367 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=rvIWmznNEGYC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=great+britain+political+definition+isle+of+man | isbn = 90-411-0513-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political union that joined the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] happened in 1707 when the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] ratified the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] and merged the parliaments of the two nations, forming the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], which covered the entire island. Prior to this, a personal union had existed between these two countries since the 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]] under [[James VI of Scotland and I of England]].

==Geographical definition==
{{See|Geography of England|Geography of Scotland|Geography of Wales}}
Great Britain lies on the European continental shelf and to the northwest of [[Continental Europe]] and east of Ireland. It is separated from the continent by the [[North Sea]] and by the [[English Channel]], which narrows to {{convert|34|km|mi}} at the [[Straits of Dover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eosnap.com/?tag=strait-of-dover |title=accessed 14 November 2009 |publisher=Eosnap.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretches over about ten degrees of [[latitude]] on its longer, north-south axis, and occupies an area of {{convert|209,331|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, excluding all the smaller surrounding islands of the [[archipelago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot;&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Island Directory Tables &quot;Islands By Land Area&quot;. Retrieved from http://islands.unep.ch/Tiarea.htm on 13 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]], [[Irish Sea]], [[St George's Channel]] and [[Celtic Sea]] separate the island from the island of [[Ireland]] to its west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition + corrections|year=1971|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=14&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;2010|page=42 [corrections to page 13]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is physically connected with continental Europe via the [[Channel Tunnel]], the longest undersea rail tunnel in the world which was completed in 1993. Geographically, the island is marked by low, rolling countryside in the east and south, while hills and mountains predominate in the western and northern regions. It is surrounded by over 1,000 smaller [[islands]] and [[islets]]. The greatest distance between two points is 601.5 miles (968&amp;nbsp;km) (between [[Land's End]], [[Cornwall]] and [[John O'Groats]], [[Caithness]]), or 838 miles (1,349&amp;nbsp;km) using the national road network.

The [[English Channel]] is thought to have been created between 450,000 and 180,000&amp;nbsp;years ago by two catastrophic [[glacial lake outburst flood]]s caused by the breaching of the [[Weald-Artois Anticline]], a ridge which held back a large [[proglacial lake]], now submerged under the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta |first=Sanjeev |coauthors=Jenny S.

The sea level was about {{convert|120|m}} lower than today, and the bed of the North Sea was dry and acted as a land bridge, now known as [[Doggerland]], to the Continent. It is generally thought that as sea levels gradually rose after the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age, Doggerland became submerged beneath the North Sea, cutting off what was previously the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500 BC.&lt;ref name=gaffney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livebettermagazine.com/eng/magazine/pdf_docs/2008_01/Global_Warming_Gaffney.pdf |title=Vincent Gaffney, &quot;Global Warming and the Lost European Country&quot; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The island was first inhabited by people who crossed over the land bridge from the European mainland. Traces of early humans have been found (at [[Boxgrove Quarry]], Sussex) from some 500,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Gräslund| first= Bo| title = Early humans and their world|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2005|page=62|chapter=Traces of the early humans | isbn=978-0-415-35344-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modern humans from about 30,000 years ago. Until about 10,000 years ago, Great Britain was joined to Ireland, and as recently as 8,000 years ago it was joined to the continent by [[Doggerland|a strip of low marsh]] to what is now [[Denmark]] and the [[Netherlands]].  In [[Cheddar Gorge]], near [[Bristol]], the remains of animal species native to mainland Europe such as [[antelope]]s, [[brown bear]]s, and [[wild horse]]s have been found alongside a human skeleton, '[[Cheddar Man]]', dated to about 7150 BC. Thus, animals and humans must have moved between mainland Europe and Great Britain via a crossing.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, Robert. ''Great Tales from English History''.  New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co, 2004. ISBN 0-316-10910-X.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain became an island at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]] when sea levels rose due to [[isostatic depression]] of the crust and the melting of [[glacier]]s.

According to [[John T. Koch]] and others, Britain in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] that also included Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal where [[Celtic languages]] developed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | publisher = Aber | place = UK | date = 2008–5 | url = http://www.aber.ac.uk/aberonline/en/archive/2008/05/au7608/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite web| format = PDF | url= http://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Research/ODonnell.pdf| work =O'Donnell Lecture | year = 2008 | title = Appendix | accessdate = 2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Koch2009&gt;{{Cite book| last = Koch | first = John | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 | publisher = Palaeohispanica | year = 2009 | location = | pages = 339–51 | url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf | doi = | id = | issn = 1578-5386 | accessdate = 2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146413465|title=New research suggests Welsh Celtic roots lie in Spain and Portugal|last=Koch|first=John|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko|title = Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature| year= 2010|publisher= Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|page=384|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Rethinking the Bronze Age and the Arrival of Indo-European in Atlantic Europe | url = http://www.oxbowbooks.com/pdfs/books/Celtic%20West%20conf.pdf|publisher=University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies and Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford| format = PDF | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fix|text=are 6 citations necessary?}} but this stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the [[Hallstatt culture]].

Its [[Iron Age]] inhabitants are known as the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]], a group speaking a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]]. The Romans conquered most of the island (up to [[Hadrian's Wall]], in northern England) and this became the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] province of ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]''. For 500 years after the Roman Empire fell, the Britons of the south and east of the island were assimilated or displaced by invading [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes ([[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]], often referred to collectively as [[Anglo-Saxons]]). At about the same time, [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] tribes from Ireland invaded the north-west, absorbing both the [[Picts]] and [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] of northern Britain, eventually forming the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century. The south-east of Scotland was colonised by the [[Angles]] and formed, until 1018, a part of the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]]. Ultimately, the population of south-east Britain came to be referred to, after the Angles, as the [[English people]].

Germanic speakers referred to Britons as ''Welsh''. This term eventually came to be applied exclusively to the inhabitants of what is now Wales, but it also survives in names such as [[Wallace (surname)|Wallace]], and in the second syllable of [[Cornwall]]. ''Cymry'', a name the Britons used to describe themselves, is similarly restricted in modern Welsh to people from Wales, but also survives in English in the place name of [[Cumbria]]. The Britons living in the areas now known as Wales, Cumbria and Cornwall were not assimilated by the Germanic tribes, a fact reflected in the survival of Celtic languages in these areas into more recent times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis1974&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Peter Berresford| authorlink = Peter Berresford Ellis|title=The Cornish language and its literature|year=1974|publisher= Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul | location=London|isbn=0-7100-7928-1|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Germanic invasion of Southern Britain, many Britons emigrated to the area now known as [[Brittany]], where [[Breton language|Breton]], a Celtic language closely related to Welsh and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and descended from the language of the emigrants, is still spoken. In the 9th century, a series of Danish assaults on northern English kingdoms led to them coming under Danish control (an area known as the [[Danelaw]]). In the 10th century, however, all the English kingdoms were unified under one ruler as the kingdom of England when the last constituent kingdom, Northumbria, submitted to [[Edgar I|Edgar]] in 959. In 1066, England was [[Norman Conquest|conquered by the Normans]], who introduced a French ruling élite that was eventually assimilated. Wales came under Anglo-Norman control in 1282, and was officially annexed to England in the 16th century.
On 20 October 1604 King James, who had succeeded separately to the two thrones of England and Scotland, proclaimed himself as &quot;King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} When James died in 1625 and the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] were drafting a proclamation, [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Earl of Kellie]] insisted that it use the phrase King of Great Britain which James had preferred rather than King of Scotland and England or vice-versa.&lt;ref&gt;HMC 60, ''Manuscripts of the Earl of Mar and Kellie'', vol.2 (1930), p.226&lt;/ref&gt; While that title was also used by many of his successors, England and Scotland each remained legally in existence as separate countries with their own parliaments until 1707, when each parliament passed an [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] to ratify the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed the previous year. This had the effect of creating a united kingdom, with a single, united parliament, from 1 May 1707. Though the Treaty of Union referred to the new all-island state as the &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;, many regard the term 'United Kingdom' as being descriptive of the union rather than part of its formal name (which the Treaty stated was to be 'Great Britain' without further qualification.) Most reference books, therefore, describe the all-island kingdom that existed between 1707 and 1800 as the &quot;Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;.

{{hatnote|Main article: [[Britain (name)|Britain]]}}
The oldest mention of terms related to the formal name of Britain was made by [[Aristotle]] (c. 384–322 BC), in his text ''[[On the Universe]]'', Vol. III. To quote his works, &quot;There are two very large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;... ἐν τούτῳ γε μὴν νῆσοι μέγιστοι τυγχάνουσιν οὖσαι δύο, Βρεττανικαὶ λεγόμεναι, Ἀλβίων καὶ Ἰέρνη, ...&quot;, transliteration &quot;... en toutoi ge men nesoi megistoi tynchanousin ousai dyo, Brettanikai legomenai, Albion kai Ierne, ...&quot;, ''Aristotle: On Sophistical Refutations. On Coming-to-be and Passing Away. On the Cosmos.'', 393b, pages 360–361, Loeb Classical Library No. 400, London William Heinemann LTD, Cambridge, Massachusetts Harvard University Press MCMLV&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago has been referred to by a single name for over 2,000 years: the term British Isles derives from terms used by classical geographers to describe this island group. [[Pliny the Elder]] (c. 23–79 AD) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (iv.xvi.102) records of Great Britain: &quot;It was itself named Albion, while all the islands about which we shall soon briefly speak were called the Britanniae.&quot;{{Dubious|date=July 2011}}

The earliest known name of Great Britain is ''[[Albion]]'' (Ἀλβίων) or ''insula Albionum'', from either the Latin ''albus'' meaning white (referring to the [[white cliffs of Dover]], the first view of Britain from the continent) or the &quot;island of the ''Albiones''&quot;, first mentioned in the ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'' in the sixth century BC, and by [[Pytheas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;snyder&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The name ''Britain'' descends from the Latin name for Britain, ''Britannia'' or ''Brittānia'', the land of the Britons. [[Old French]] ''Bretaigne'' (whence also [[Modern French]] ''Bretagne'') and [[Middle English]] ''Bretayne, авBreteyne''. The French form replaced the [[Old English]] ''Breoton, Breoten, Bryten, Breten'' (also ''Breoton-lond, Breten-lond''). Britannia was used by the Romans from the 1st century BC for the British Isles taken together. It is derived from the travel writings of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Pytheas]] around 320 BC, which described various islands in the North Atlantic as far north as [[Thule]] (probably [[Norway]]).

The peoples of these islands of ''Prettanike'' were called the Πρέττανοι, ''[[Priteni]]'' or ''Pretani''.&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt;
''Priteni'' is the source of the [[Welsh language]] term [[Prydain]], ''Britain'', which has the same source as the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] term [[Cruithne (people)|Cruithne]] used to refer to the early [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] speaking inhabitants of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Derivation of &quot;Great&quot;===
After the Anglo-Saxon period, ''Britain'' was used as a historical term only.
[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''c.''&amp;nbsp;1136) refers to the island of Great Britain as ''Britannia major'' (&quot;Greater Britain&quot;), to distinguish it from ''Britannia minor'' (&quot;Lesser Britain&quot;), the continental region which approximates to modern [[Brittany]]. The term ''Great Britain'' was first used officially in 1474, in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between [[Cecily of York|Cecily]] the daughter of [[Edward IV of England]], and [[James IV of Scotland|James]] the son of [[James III of Scotland]], which described it as &quot;this Nobill Isle, callit Gret Britanee.&quot; As noted above it was used again in 1604, when [[James I of England|King James VI and I]] styled himself &quot;King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland.&quot;

===Use of the term ''Great Britain''===
The term ''Great Britain'' refers to the largest island within the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. It is also used to refer to England, Scotland and Wales as a unit (including many smaller islands which &quot;have administrative ties with the mainland&quot;). It does not include Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=UK 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|place=London|publisher=Office for National Statistics|pages=vii|date= 29 November 2004|isbn = 0-11-621738-3|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/social-trends-rd/the-official-yearbook-of-the-united-kingdom/2005-edition/index.html|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Britain (disambiguation)|Britain]]'', as opposed to Great Britain, has been used to mean the United Kingdom, for example in official government yearbooks between 1975 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Britain 2001:The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom, 2001|place=London|publisher=Office for National Statistics|pages=vii|date=August 2000|year=2000|isbn=0-11-621278-0|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/britain2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, however, the yearbooks have only used the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=UK 2002: The Official Yearbook of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|place=London|publisher=Office for National Statistics|pages=vi|date=August 2001|year=2001|isbn=0-11-621738-3|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/UK2005/UK2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initials '''GB''' or '''GBR''' are used in some international codes instead of the initials '''UK''' to refer to the United Kingdom. Examples include: [http://www.upu.int/en/the-upu/member-countries/western-europe/great-britain.html Universal Postal Union], international sports teams, [[NATO]], the [[International Organization for Standardization]] country codes [[ISO 3166-2:GB|ISO 3166-2]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]], and [[List of international license plate codes|international licence plate codes]].

On the Internet, '''[[.uk]]''' is used as a [[country code top-level domain]] for the United Kingdom. A '''[[.gb]]''' top-level domain was also used to a limited extent in the past, but this is now effectively obsolete because the domain name registrar will not take new registrations.
