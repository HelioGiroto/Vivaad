==Activities==
===Courses===
Common Purpose runs a range of leadership development courses that offer participants the inspiration, knowledge and connections to help them become more active and engaged in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/7036877/Common-Purpose-Business-Club-Video.html |title=Common Purpose - Business Club Video |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its courses run in 11 countries worldwide and aim at improving the way organisations work by increasing the number of informed individuals who are actively involved in shaping the future of the area in which they work.&lt;ref name=&quot;indiatimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph1&quot;/&gt;

===Participants===
Common Purpose works with a wide range of organisations and individuals across business, public, voluntary and political sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/10/17/47997/talent-managment-special-report-market-overview.html |title=Talent management special report: market overview |publisher=Personneltoday.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2010, 12,000 participants were involved in Common Purpose programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph1&quot;/&gt;

===Chatham House Rule===
Its courses are conducted under the [[Chatham House Rule]] to encourage free discussion amongst participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commonpurpose.co.uk/courses/methods |title=Common Purpose UK - Common Purpose Methods |publisher=Commonpurpose.co.uk |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused some people to raise suspicion about the organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitsnpots1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pitsnpots.co.uk/news/2010/02/common-purpose-truth-not-conspiracy |title=Common Purpose - The Truth, Not The Conspiracy. |publisher=Pits n Pots |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bursary placements===
Common Purpose offers [[bursary]] placements to help bosses of small and medium-sized business get through the [[economic downturn]] by enabling firms to make new contacts and secure more work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/Bursaries-help-bosses/article-497835-detail/article.html |title=Bursaries to help bosses |publisher=Thisisderbyshire.co.uk |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and young people===
Your Turn is a leadership programme for Year 9 students that is conducted in five regions throughout the [[UK]] and challenges young people to think in new ways about their area and their world.&lt;ref name=&quot;teachernet1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/teachingandlearning/resourcematerials/charities/ |title=TeacherNet, Charities |publisher=Teachernet.gov.uk |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHANGEit is a collaboration between Common Purpose and [[Deutsche Bank]]. It has been designed to recognise the achievements and ambitions of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 who want to speak out and create positive change.&lt;ref name=&quot;teachernet1&quot;/&gt;

===Senior executives===
What Next? is a course run by leadership development organisation Common Purpose and the [[Said Business School]] that can help executives identify opportunities to continue to use the experience they have accumulated during their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.info4security.com/story.asp?sectioncode=10&amp;storycode=4123305&amp;c=2 |title=Common Purpose offers help to redundant executives |publisher=Info4security.com |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thought leadership and campaigns===
In January 2010, Common Purpose [[Chief Executive]], [[Julia Middleton]], interviewed 12 well-known leaders from the private, public and voluntary sector, including [[David Bell (publisher)|Sir David Bell]] and [[Dame Suzi Leather]] about the qualities needed for good leadership in challenging times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardianpublic.co.uk/leaders-public-voluntary-sector |title=Good leadership in challenging times: what's the secret? &amp;#124; Public &amp;#124; Public |publisher=Guardianpublic.co.uk |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviews were broadcast on video-sharing website [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/988735/Media-attacks-tested-me-says-Dame-Suzi-Leather/ |title=Media attacks tested me, says Dame Suzi Leather |publisher=Third Sector |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Common Purpose was commissioned by the [[Government Equalities Office]] to conduct an online survey of individuals in leadership positions and produce a report titled “Diversity of Representation in Public Appointments”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/296596_GEO_Diversity_CommonPurpose_acc.pdf |title=Diversity of representation in public appointments |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently Common Purpose and the [[Government Equalities Office]] set up The About Time Public Leaders Courses, designed to support the government’s aim to increase the diversity of public body board members and the pool of talented individuals ready to take up public appointments. The schemes were formally launched in January 2010.

===Projects===
In July 2008, Common Purpose introduced a project in [[Bangalore]], [[India]], which took 50 people from different sectors, e.g. IT and banking, and encouraged them to share local and international knowledge in order to solve problems associated with trading in a recession.&lt;ref name=&quot;indiatimes1&quot;/&gt;

It has also run similar projects in [[Germany]], to highlight the importance of having good facilities for the [[disabled]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indiatimes1&quot;/&gt;

==Related issues==
In May 2008, the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' revealed that Common Purpose had been granted free office space at the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] in Sheffield in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;yorkshirepost1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Waugh |first=Rob |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/Elite-trainer-gets-11year-state.4053633.jp |title=Elite trainer gets 11-year state freebie |publisher=Yorkshire Post |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DCSF spokeswoman said the free office accommodation had been given in line with the policy of the then Education Secretary [[David Blunkett]], a Sheffield MP, who had wanted to build better links with the local community. But [[Philip Davies]], Conservative MP for Shipley, criticised the relationship between Government and Common Purpose as well as the fact it did not put the content of its training in the public domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;yorkshirepost1&quot;/&gt;

In August 2008, conspiracy theories about Common Purpose were mentioned in a [[House of Commons Library]] document entitled 'Eurosceptic Campaigns Alleging the Abolition of Westminster'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN04894|title=Eurosceptic campaigns alleging the abolition of Westminster|date=20 November 2008|author=Vaughne Miller|publisher=House of Commons Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, ''Third Sector'' reported that Common Purpose was to face no further action from the [[Information Commissioner's Office]]. The announcement came following ICO’s ruling in October 2008 that the charity was unlikely to have complied with the provisions in the [[Data Protection Act]] on processing personal data when it compiled a list containing the personal details of people who had made requests under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] relating to its dealings with public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/archive/972807/Common-Purpose-face-no-further-action-Information-Commissioner |title=Common Purpose to face no further action from Information Commissioner |publisher=Third Sector |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
