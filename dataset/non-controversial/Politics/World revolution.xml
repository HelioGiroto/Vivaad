'''World revolution''' is the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of overthrowing [[capitalism]] in all countries through the [[class consciousness|conscious]] revolutionary action of the organized [[working class]]. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where local conditions allowed a [[revolutionary party]] to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a [[workers' state]] based on social ownership of the means of production. In most Marxist schools, such as [[Trotskyism]], the essentially international character of the [[class struggle]] and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of [[socialism in one country]].

The end goal is to achieve [[world socialism]], and later, [[stateless communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1933/teaching/4.htm The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism] by [[Bukharin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm The State and Revolution — Chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communism sidebar}}

The [[October Revolution]] of 1917  in Russia sparked a [[revolutionary wave]] of [[socialist]] and [[communist]] uprisings across Europe, most notably the [[German Revolution]], the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian Revolution]], [[Biennio Rosso]] and the [[Finnish Civil War|revolutionary war in Finland]] with the short lived [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also [[Revolutions of 1917-23]]. 

Particularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that [[capitalism]] would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth's land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the [[Comintern]], founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the [[Russian Civil War]] into an essentially [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide.

{{rquote|right|Revolutions are the locomotives of history.| [[Karl Marx]] &lt;ref&gt;''Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above 1928-1941'' by Robert C. Tucker, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992, ISBN 0-393-30869-3, pg 608&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see ''[[Socialism in one country]]''.

After those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again.
As [[fascism]] grew in [[Europe]] in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the [[Comintern]] opted for a [[Popular Front]] with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of [[World War II]] in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union's [[Western world|Western]] allies.

=== Post World War Two ===

A new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the [[aftermath of World War II]], though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in failed (in the socialist sense) revolution in Germany and a successful one (for seventy years) in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], [[France]], and [[Italy]] had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their activity as leaders of [[anti-fascist]] resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. Communist parties in [[Eastern Europe]], meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, did so under circumstances regarded by some as mere [[show elections]].

Revolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]], the establishment of the [[New Left]] together with the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the militancy of the [[Black Panther Party]] and similar armed/insurrectionary &quot;Liberation Front&quot; groups around the globe, and even a bit of a resurgence in the [[labor movement]] for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but actually imminent; thus, there was a common expression, &quot;[[The East is Red]], and the West is Ready&quot;. However, this [[Far left|radical left]] spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain [[right-wing]], economically [[conservatism|conservative]] ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by [[Thatcherism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Reaganomics]] in the [[United States]]) and also [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|free-market reforms in China]] and [[doi moi|in Vietnam]].

Within [[Marxist theory]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s concept of the [[labor aristocracy]] and his description of [[imperialism]], and{{spaced ndash}}separately, but not necessarily unrelatedly{{spaced ndash}}[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s theories regarding the [[deformed workers' state]], offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups, however, such as the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)]], still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of [[proletarian internationalism]].
