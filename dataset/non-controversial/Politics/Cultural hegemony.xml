      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14905">[[Image:Gramsci.png|thumb|200px| The Marxist intellectual [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937) developed the theory of cultural hegemony in aid to the establishment of a working-class worldview.]]

In [[Marxist philosophy]], '''cultural hegemony''' describes the [[Dominance hierarchy|domination ]] of a culturally diverse society by the [[ruling class]], who manipulate the culture of the society — the [[belief]]s, [[explanation]]s, [[perception]]s, [[Value system|values]], and [[mores]] — so that their ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' becomes the worldview that is imposed and accepted as the cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]; as the universally valid [[dominant ideology]] that justifies the social, political, and economic ''[[status quo]]'' as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] that benefit only the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan; Trombley, Stephen, Editors (1999), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, pp. 387–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;TheColumbia&quot;&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1215.&lt;/ref&gt; As a philosophy term and as a sociology term, ''cultural hegemony'' derived from the Ancient Greek word ''[[hegemony]]'' ('''leadership''' and '''rule'''), the geopolitical method of indirect [[Empire|imperial]] dominance, with which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules subordinate states, by the implied means of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], the threat of the threat of intervention, rather than by direct military force, that is, [[invasion]], [[Military occupation|occupation]], and [[annexation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross Hassig, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest'' (1994), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{marxism}}

===Etymologic===
In [[Ancient Greece]] (8th c. BC – AD 6th c.), ''hegemony'' ('''leadership''') denoted the politico–military dominance of a [[city-state]] upon other city-states, as in the [[League of Corinth|Hellenic League]].&lt;ref name = &quot;TheColumbia&quot; /&gt; In the 19th century, hegemony ('''rule''') denoted the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] and cultural predominance of one country upon other countries, as in the [[European colonialism]] imposed in the Americas, Africa, and Asia.{{Sfn | Bullock | Trombley | 1999 | pp = 387–88}}  In the 20th century, the political-science denotation of hegemony ('''dominance''') expanded to include the ruling-class [[Cultural imperialism|cultural domination]] of a socially [[Social stratification|stratified]] society. By manipulating the [[Dominant ideology|culture]] (values and mores) of the society, the [[ruling class]] can intellectually dominate the other social classes with an imposed [[worldview]] that [[Ideology|ideologically]] justifies the social, political, and economic ''status quo'' as natural and normal, inevitable and perpetual.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheColumbia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Upton, William A. Kretzschmar, Rafal Konopka: ''Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English''. Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.flagrancy.net/timeline.html | title = US Hegemony | publisher = Flagrancy | contribution = Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] proposed that the [[economic recession]]s and practical contradictions of a capitalist economy would provoke the [[working class]] to [[proletarian revolution]], depose [[capitalism]], restructure societal institutions (economic, political, social) per rational, [[socialist]] models, and thus begin the transition to a [[communist]] society.  Therefore, the [[Dialectics|dialectical]] changes to the functioning of the [[economy]] of a society determine its social [[Base and superstructure|superstructures]] (culture and politics), and the composition of its [[Economic class|economic]] and social classes. To that end, Antonio Gramsci proposed a ''strategic distinction'', between a War of Position and a War of Manœuvre. The war of position is an intellectual and cultural struggle wherein the [[anti-capitalist]] revolutionary creates a [[Proletariat|proletarian]] culture whose native value system counters the cultural hegemony of the [[bourgeoisie]]. The proletarian culture will increase [[class consciousness]], teach [[revolution]]ary theory and historical analysis, and thus propagate further revolutionary organisation among the social classes. On winning the war of position, [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders would then have the necessary political power and popular support to begin the political [[maneuver warfare|manœuvre warfare]] of [[revolutionary socialism]].

==Cultural hegemony==
The initial, theoretic application of '''[[Cultural imperialism|cultural domination]]''' was as an analysis of '''economic class''', which Antonio Gramsci developed to comprehend '''social class'''; hence, '''cultural hegemony''' proposes that the prevailing cultural norms of a society, which are imposed by the ruling class ([[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois cultural hegemony]]), must not be perceived as natural and inevitable, but must be recognized as artificial [[social construct]]s ([[institutions]], [[convention (norm)|practices]], [[beliefs]]) that must be investigated to discover their roots as instruments of social-class domination. That such praxis of knowledge is indispensable for the intellectual [[liberty|liberation]] of the proletariat, so that urban workers and peasants can create their own culture, which specifically addresses their social and economic needs as social classes.

In a society, cultural hegemony is neither a monolithic, intellectual praxis, nor a unified system of values, but a complex of [[Social stratification|stratified]] [[social structure]]s, wherein each social and economic class has a societal purpose and an internal class-logic that allows its members to behave in a way that is particular and different from the behaviours of the members of other social classes, whilst co-existing with them as constituents of the society. As a result of their different social purposes, the classes will be able to coalesce into a [[society]] with a greater social mission. In a person (man, woman, child) perceiving the social structures of cultural hegemony, personal [[common sense]] has a dual structural role (personal and public), thus, individual men and women apply personal common sense to cope with daily life, and to explain (to themselves) the small segment of the [[social order]] stratum that they experience as ″life in society″, i.e. the ''status quo''. Publicly, the perceptual limitations of common sense emerge and inhibit individual perception of the greater nature of the systematic socio-economic [[exploitation]] made possible by cultural hegemony. Because of the discrepancy in perceiving the ''status quo'' — the socio-economic hierarchy of bourgeois culture — most men and women concern themselves with their immediate (personal) concerns, rather than (publicly) think about and question the fundamental sources of their social and economic [[oppression]], and consequent social and personal discontents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/019685998601000203 | format = [[PDF]] | title = The Problem of Ideology — Marxism without Guarantees |year=1986 |first=Stuart |last= Hall |authorlink= Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) |journal= Journal of Communication Inquiry | volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=28–44 |url=http://www.ram-wan.net/restrepo/hall/The%20problem%20of%20ideology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the personal level, cultural hegemony is perceptible; although each person in a society lives a meaningful life in his or her social class, to him or her, the discrete classes might appear to have little in common with individual private life. Yet, when perceived as a whole society, the life of each person does contribute to the greater societal hegemony. Although social diversity, economic variety, and political freedom appear to exist — because most people ''see'' different life-circumstances — they are incapable of perceiving the greater hegemonic pattern created when the lives they witness coalesce as a society. The cultural hegemony is manifested in and maintained by an existence of minor, different circumstances that are not always fully perceived by the men and the women living the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Antonio |last=Gramsci |authorlink=Antonio Gramsci |editor-first =Joseph A | editor-last = Buttigieg |title=Prison notebooks |publisher= [[Columbia University Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |year=1992 |pages=233–38 |isbn=0-231-10592-4 |oclc=24009547}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Marx's theory of alienation|''Entfremdung'', Karl Marx's theory of alienation]])

==Gramsci’s intellectual influence==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
[[Image:Rudi.jpg|thumb|right|185px|The German student leader Rudi Dutschke, of the ''68er-Bewegung'', said that changing the bourgeois cultural hegemony of West Germany required a long march through the society’s institutions.]]
Cultural hegemony much influenced [[Eurocommunism]], the [[social sciences]], and the [[activist]] politics of socially [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] politicians. The analytic [[discourse]] of cultural hegemony is important to research and synthesis in [[anthropology]], political science, sociology, and [[cultural studies]]; in [[education]], cultural hegemony developed [[critical pedagogy]].

In 1967, the [[German student movement]] leader [[Rudi Dutschke]] reformulated Gramsci’s philosophy of cultural hegemony with the phrase ''Der lange Marsch durch die Institutionen'' (The long march through the institutions), denoting the war of position, in allusion to the [[Long March]] (1934–35) of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | editor1-first = Joseph A | editor1-last = Buttigieg | edition = English critical | last = Gramsci | title = Prison Notebooks | at = footnote 21 | page = 50 | quote = long march through the institutions&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; This phrase is not Gramsci’s, even though it is ubiquitously attributed to him}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
