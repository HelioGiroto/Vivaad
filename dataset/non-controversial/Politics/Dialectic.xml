'''Dialectic''' (also ''dialectics'' and ''the dialectical method'') is a method of argument for resolving [[disagreement]] that has been central to Indian and European philosophy since antiquity. The word ''dialectic'' originated in [[ancient Greece]], and was made popular by [[Plato]] in the [[Socratic dialogues]]. The dialectical method is [[dialogue]] between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject, who wish to establish the truth of the matter by dialogue, with [[Rationality|reasoned]] arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Republic (Plato)]], 348b&lt;/ref&gt; Dialectics is different from [[debate]], wherein the debaters are  committed to their points of view, and mean to win the debate, either by persuading the opponent, proving their argument correct, or proving the opponent's argument incorrect – thus, either a judge or a jury must decide who wins the debate. Dialectics is also  different from [[rhetoric]], wherein the speaker uses  [[Logos#Aristotle.27s_rhetorical_logos|logos]], [[pathos]], or [[Ethos#Rhetoric|ethos]] to persuade listeners to take their side of the argument.

The [[Sophism|Sophists]] taught ''[[Arete|aretē]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|ἀρετή}}, ''quality'', ''excellence'') as the highest value, and the determinant of one's actions in life. The Sophists taught artistic quality in oratory (motivation via speech) as a manner of demonstrating one's ''aretē''. Oratory was taught as an art form, used to please and to influence other people via excellent speech; nonetheless, the Sophists taught the pupil to seek ''aretē'' in all endeavours, not solely in oratory.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Socrates]] favoured ''truth'' as the highest value, proposing that it could be discovered through reason and logic in discussion: ergo, ''dialectic''. Socrates valued [[rationality]] (appealing to logic, not emotion) as the proper means for persuasion, the discovery of truth, and the determinant for one's actions. To Socrates, ''truth'', not ''aretē'', was the greater good, and each person should, above all else, seek truth to guide one's life. Therefore, Socrates opposed the Sophists and their teaching of rhetoric as art and as emotional oratory requiring neither logic nor proof.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]], 449B: &quot;Socrates: Would you be willing then, Gorgias, to continue the discussion as we are now doing [Dialectic], by way of question and answer, and to put off to another occasion the (emotional) speeches [Rhetoric] that [the Sophist] Polus began?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of dialectical reasoning have emerged throughout history from the [[Greater India|Indosphere]] (Greater India) and [[Western world|the West]] (Europe). These forms include the [[Socratic method]], Hindu, [[Upaya|Buddhist]], Medieval, [[Hegelian dialectic]]s, Marxist, [[pilpul|Talmudic]], and [[Neo-orthodoxy]].

==Principles==

The purpose of the dialectic method of reasoning is resolution of [[disagreement]] through [[Rationality|rational]] discussion, and, ultimately, the search for truth.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, R. C. (2001). ''Argument, inference and dialectic: collected papers on informal logic''. Argumentation library, vol. 4. Dordrecht:Kluwer Academic. pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eemeren, F. H. v. (2003). ''Anyone who has a view: theoretical contributions to the study of argumentation''. Argumentation library, vol. 8. Dordrecht:Kluwer Academic. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; One way to proceed—the [[Socratic method]]—is to show that a given [[hypothesis]] (with other admissions) leads to a [[contradiction]]; thus, forcing the withdrawal of the hypothesis as a candidate for [[truth]] (see [[reductio ad absurdum]]). Another dialectical resolution of disagreement is by denying a [[presupposition]] of the contending thesis and antithesis; thereby, proceeding to ''[[Aufheben|sublation]]'' (transcendence) to ''synthesis'', a third thesis.

It is also possible that the rejection of the participants' presuppositions is resisted, which then might generate a second-order controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[Rose Rosengard Subotnick]] gives this example: &quot;A question posed in a [[Fred Friendly|Fred Friendly Seminar]] entitled ''Hard Drugs, Hard Choices: The Crisis Beyond Our Borders'' [http://www.fredfriendly.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=tv.detail&amp;pid=40] (aired on [[WNET]] on February 26, 1990), illustrates that others, too, seem to find this dynamic enlightening: 'Are our lives so barren because we use drugs? Or do we use drugs because our lives are so barren?' The question is dialectical to the extent that it enables one to grasp the two opposed priorities as simultaneously valid.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichtean]] Dialectics (Hegelian Dialectics) is based upon four concepts:
# Everything is transient and finite, existing in the medium of time.
# Everything is composed of contradictions (opposing forces).
# Gradual changes lead to crises, turning points when one force overcomes its opponent force (quantitative change leads to qualitative change).
# Change is [[Helix|helical]] (spiral), not circular (negation of the negation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Mills|title=Treating attachment pathology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zglsKFJdshMC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=2005|publisher=Jason Aronson|isbn=978-0-7657-0132-9|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''dialectic'' existed in the philosophy of [[Heraclitus]] of [[Ephesus]], who proposed that everything is in constant change, as a result of inner strife and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, C. G. (1913) The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, and history of the Catholic church. New York: The Encyclopedia press, inc. [http://books.google.com/books?id=sH4qAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA160 Page 160]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Ll. Williams, ''Hegel, Heraclitus, and Marx's Dialectic''. Harvester Wheatsheaf 1989. 256 pages. ISBN 0-7450-0527-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denton Jaques Snider, Ancient European Philosophy: The History of Greek Philosophy Psychologically Treated. Sigma publishing co. 1903. 730 pages. Pages 116-119.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the history of the dialectical method is the history of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Cassin, Barbara (ed.), ''Vocabulaire européen des philosophies'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Paris: Le Robert &amp; Seuil, 2004&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, p. 306, trans. M.K. Jensen)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western dialectical forms==

===Classical philosophy===
In [[Classical Greece|classical]] [[philosophy]], dialectic ({{lang-el|διαλεκτική}}) is a form of reasoning based upon dialogue of arguments and counter-arguments, advocating ''[[proposition]]s'' ([[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|theses]]) and ''counter-propositions'' ([[antithesis|antitheses]]). The outcome of such a dialectic might be the refutation of a relevant proposition, or of a synthesis, or a combination of the opposing assertions, or a qualitative improvement of the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J., &amp; O'Grady, J. (1992). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Quotations''. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers. Page 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McTaggart, J. M. E. (1964). A commentary on Hegel's logic. New York: Russell &amp; Russell. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the term &quot;dialectic&quot; owes much of its prestige to its role in the philosophies of [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], in the Greek [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period (4–5 c. BCE). [[Aristotle]] said that it was the pre-Socratic philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] who invented dialectic, of which the dialogues of Plato are the examples of the Socratic dialectical method.&lt;ref&gt;([fr. 65], Diog. IX 25ff and VIII 57)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Socratic dialogue ====
{{Main|Socratic dialogue}}
In Plato's dialogues and other Socratic dialogues, Socrates attempts to examine someone's beliefs, at times even [[first principles]] or [[premise]]s by which we all reason and argue. Socrates typically argues by cross-examining his interlocutor's claims and premises in order to draw out a [[contradiction]] or inconsistency among them. According to Plato, the rational detection of error amounts to finding the proof of the antithesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Vlastos|Vlastos, G.]], [[Myles Burnyeat|Burnyeat, M.]] (Ed.) (1994) Socratic Studies, Cambridge U.P. ISBN 0-521-44735-6 Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, important as this objective is, the principal aim of Socratic activity seems to be to improve the soul of his interlocutors, by freeing them from unrecognized errors.

For example, in the ''[[Euthyphro]]'', Socrates asks [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] to provide a definition of piety. Euthyphro replies that the pious is that which is loved by the gods. But, Socrates also has Euthyphro agreeing that the gods are quarrelsome and their quarrels, like human quarrels, concern objects of love or hatred. Therefore, Socrates reasons, at least one thing exists that certain gods love but other gods hate. Again, Euthyphro agrees. Socrates concludes that if Euthyphro's definition of piety is acceptable, then there must exist at least one thing that is both pious and impious (as it is both loved and hated by the gods)&amp;mdash;which Euthyphro admits is absurd. Thus, Euthyphro is brought to a realization by this dialectical method that his definition of piety is not sufficiently meaningful.

There is another interpretation of the dialectic, as a method of intuition suggested in The Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. (1962) The Open Society and its Enemies, Volume 1, London, Routledge, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Blackburn writes that the dialectic in this sense is used to understand &quot;the total process of enlightenment, whereby the philosopher is educated so as to achieve knowledge of the supreme good, the Form of the Good”.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon.  1996.  The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy.  Oxford: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval philosophy===
Dialectics (also called logic) was one of the three liberal arts taught in [[medieval universities]] as part of the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]. The trivium also included [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, P. (1965). The seven liberal arts; a study in mediæval culture. New York: Russell &amp; Russell. Page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, A., &amp; Walsh, J. J. (1983). Philosophy in the Middle Ages: the Christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub. Co. Page 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer Jerome (2000). &quot;Dialectic&quot;. Routledge. Page 4. ISBN 0-415-22550-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbermann&quot;&gt;Herbermann, C. G. (1913). The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, and history of the Catholic church. New York: The Encyclopedia press, inc. Page 760–764.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based mainly on [[Aristotle]], the first medieval philosopher to work on dialectics was [[Boethius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.es/books?id=dA0YGAD1cQcC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=dialectics+in+Boethius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_HccRhfdjX&amp;sig=-lqZuRDK4jXLpWiN8-X8Rn36F3o&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=KGv0S_L6J4P-8AaZs-zNDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=dialectics%20in%20Boethius&amp;f=false From topic to tale: logic and narrativity in the Middle Ages], by Eugene Vance,p.43-45&lt;/ref&gt; After him, many scholastic philosophers also made use of dialectics in their works, such as [[Abelard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01036b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Peter Abelard |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Sherwood]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.es/books?id=f3uMdwDVvL8C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Dialectic+in+william+of+sherwood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DgQ7rzGOrB&amp;sig=7KAHsosojbyBiA_Fe6KckbL_zlM&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=FGX0S8rTAYL68Aar5oijBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dialectical&amp;f=false William of Sherwood's Introduction to logic], by Norman Kretzmann,p.69-102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garlandus Compotista]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.es/books?id=7mcPcSuUa8EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA198&amp;lpg=RA1-PA198&amp;dq=Garlandus+Compotista+and+Dialectic+in+the+Eleventh+and+Twelfth+Centuries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XkXFFyOASE&amp;sig=bH4YzmizXsgyd2LWo-QjTT5FB4o&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=F2b0S8eiB8H-8AbhrMCyAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Garlandus%20Compotista%20and%20Dialectic%20in%20the%20Eleventh%20and%20Twelfth%20Centuries&amp;f=false A History of Twelfth-Century Western Philosophy], by Peter Dronke,p.198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burley]], Roger Swyneshed and [[William of Ockham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.es/books?id=UnW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=William+of+Ockham+dialectical+materialism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GRVgP3JXdO&amp;sig=KWQjQf8z5s0VMgVf5sqjIkWZgpk&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=Mmn0S4bqHMT38AablKj6Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20of%20Ockham%20dialectical%20materialism&amp;f=false Medieval literary politics: shapes of ideology], by Sheila Delany,p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

This dialectic was formed as follows:
# The Question to be determined
# The principal objections to the question
# An argument in favor of the Question, traditionally a single argument (&quot;On the contrary..&quot;)
# The determination of the Question after weighing the evidence. (&quot;I answer that...&quot;)
# The replies to each objection

===Modern philosophy===
The concept of dialectics was given new life by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (following [[Fichte]]), whose dialectically dynamic model of nature and of history made it, as it were, a fundamental aspect of the nature of reality (instead of regarding the contradictions into which dialectics leads as a sign of the sterility of the dialectical method, as [[Immanuel Kant]] tended to do in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, J. A. (1950). Philosophy of religion. New York: Ronald Press Co. Page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I., Guyer, P., &amp; Wood, A. W. (2003). [http://books.google.com/books?id=7bRychF0y0EC Critique of pure reason]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Page 495.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, the concept of &quot;dialectic&quot; was appropriated by [[Karl Marx]] (see, for example, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', published in 1867) and [[Friedrich Engels]] and retooled in a non-idealist manner, becoming a crucial notion in their philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]]. Thus this concept has played a prominent role on the world stage and in [[History of the world|world history]]. In contemporary [[polemics]], &quot;dialectics&quot; may also refer to an understanding of how we can or should perceive the world ([[epistemology]]); an assertion that the nature of the world outside one's perception is interconnected, contradictory, and dynamic ([[ontology]]); or it can refer to a method of presentation of ideas and conclusions ([[discourse]]). According to Hegel, &quot;dialectic&quot; is the method by which human history unfolds; that is to say, history progresses as a dialectical process.

==== Hegelian dialectic ====
{{Hegelianism}}

Hegelian dialectic, usually presented in a threefold manner, was stated by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] as comprising three dialectical stages of development: a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]], giving rise to its reaction, an [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]], which contradicts or negates the thesis, and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]. Although this model is often named after Hegel, he himself never used that specific formulation. Hegel ascribed that terminology to Kant.&lt;ref&gt;The Accessible Hegel. Michael Allen Fox. Prometheus Books. 2005. p.43. Also see Hegel's preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit, trans. A.V. Miller (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977), secs. 50, 51, p.29. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying on Kant's work, Fichte greatly elaborated on the synthesis model, and popularized it.

On the other hand, Hegel did use a three-valued logical model that is very similar to the antithesis model, but Hegel's most usual terms were: Abstract-Negative-Concrete. Hegel used this writing model as a backbone to accompany his points in many of his works.

The formula, thesis-antithesis-synthesis, does not explain why the thesis requires an Antithesis. However, the formula, abstract-negative-concrete, suggests a flaw, or perhaps an incomplete-ness, in any initial thesis—it is too abstract and lacks the negative of trial, error and experience. For Hegel, the concrete, the synthesis, the absolute, must always pass through the phase of the negative, in the journey to completion, that is, mediation. This is the actual essence of what is popularly called Hegelian Dialectics.

To describe the activity of overcoming the negative, Hegel also often used the term [[Aufheben|''Aufhebung'']], variously translated into English as &quot;sublation&quot; or &quot;overcoming,&quot; to conceive of the working of the dialectic. Roughly, the term indicates preserving the useful portion of an idea, thing, society, etc., while moving beyond its limitations. ([[Jacques Derrida]]'s preferred French translation of the term was ''relever'').&lt;ref&gt;See 'La différance' in Margins of philosophy. Alan Bass, translator. University of Chicago Books. 1982. p. 19, fn 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Science of Logic|''Logic'']], for instance, Hegel describes a dialectic of [[existence]]: first, existence must be posited as pure Being (''Sein''); but pure Being, upon examination, is found to be indistinguishable from Nothing (''Nichts''). When it is realized that what is coming into being is, at the same time, also returning to nothing (in life, for example, one's living is also a dying), both Being and Nothing are united as Becoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hegel |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlbeing.htm#HL1_82 |title=Section in question from Hegel's '&amp;#39;Science of Logic'&amp;#39; |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the Socratic dialectic, Hegel claimed to proceed by making implicit contradictions explicit: each stage of the process is the product of contradictions inherent or implicit in the preceding stage. For Hegel, the whole of history is one tremendous dialectic, major stages of which chart a progression from self-alienation as [[Master-slave dialectic|slavery]] to self-unification and realization as the [[rational state|rational]], [[constitutional state]] of free and equal citizens. The Hegelian dialectic cannot be mechanically applied for any chosen thesis. Critics argue that the selection of any antithesis, other than the logical negation of the thesis, is subjective. Then, if the logical negation is used as the antithesis, there is no rigorous way to derive a synthesis. In practice, when an antithesis is selected to suit the user's subjective purpose, the resulting &quot;contradictions&quot; are [[rhetoric]]al, not logical, and the resulting synthesis is not rigorously defensible against a multitude of other possible syntheses. The problem with the Fichtean &quot;Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis&quot; model is that it implies that contradictions or negations come from outside of things. Hegel's point is that they are inherent in and internal to things. This conception of dialectics derives ultimately from [[Heraclitus]].

Hegel has outlined that the purpose of dialectics is &quot;to study things in their own being and movement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories of understanding&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. Note to §81&lt;/ref&gt;

One important dialectical principle for Hegel is the transition from quantity to quality, which he terms the Measure. The measure is the qualitative quantum, the quantum is the existence of quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §§107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;The identity between quantity and quality, which is found in Measure, is at first only implicit, and not yet explicitly realised. In other words, these two categories, which unite in Measure, each claim an independent authority. On the one hand, the quantitative features of existence may be altered, without affecting its quality. On the other hand, this increase and diminution, immaterial though it be, has its limit, by exceeding which the quality suffers change. [...] But if the quantity present in measure exceeds a certain limit, the quality corresponding to it is also put in abeyance. This however is not a negation of quality altogether, but only of this definite quality, the place of which is at once occupied by another. This process of measure, which appears alternately as a mere change in quantity, and then as a sudden revulsion of quantity into quality, may be envisaged under the figure of a nodal (knotted) line&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §§108-109&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example, Hegel mentions the states of aggregation of water: &quot;Thus the temperature of water is, in the first place, a point of no consequence in respect of its liquidity: still with the increase or diminution of the temperature of the liquid water, there comes a point where this state of cohesion suffers a qualitative change, and the water is converted into steam or ice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §108&lt;/ref&gt; As other examples Hegel mentions the reaching of a point where a single additional grain makes a heap of wheat; or where the bald-tail is produced, if we continue plucking out single hairs.

Another important principle for Hegel is the negation of the negation, which he also terms ''Aufhebung'' (sublation): Something is only what it is in its relation to another, but by the negation of the negation this something incorporates the other into itself. The dialectical movement involves two moments that negate each other, something and its other. As a result of the negation of the negation, &quot;something becomes its other; this other is itself something; therefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on ad infinitum&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §93&lt;/ref&gt; Something in its passage into other only joins with itself, it is self-related.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §95&lt;/ref&gt; In becoming there are two moments:&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1812. Hegel's Science of Logic. London. Allen &amp; Unwin. §§176-179.&lt;/ref&gt; coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be: by sublation, i.e., negation of the negation, being passes over into nothing, it ceases to be, but something new shows up, is coming to be. What is sublated (''aufgehoben'') on the one hand ceases to be and is put to an end, but on the other hand it is preserved and maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1812. Hegel's Science of Logic. London. Allen &amp; Unwin. §185.&lt;/ref&gt; In dialectics, a totality transforms itself; it is self-related, then self-forgetful, relieving the original tension.

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] proposed that G.F. Hegel had rendered philosophy too abstractly [[Idealism|ideal]]:

In contradiction to Hegelian idealism, Karl Marx presented [[Dialectical materialism]] (Marxist dialectics):

{{quote|My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e. the process of thinking, which, under the name of ‘the Idea’, he even transforms into an independent subject, is the [[Demiurge|demiurgos]] of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of ‘the Idea’. With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought. (''Capital'', Afterword, Second German Ed., Moscow, 1970, vol. 1, p. 29).}}

In Marxism, the dialectical method of historical study became intertwined with [[historical materialism]], the school of thought exemplified by the works of Marx, Engels, and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In the USSR, under [[Joseph Stalin]], Marxist dialectics became &quot;diamat&quot; (short for dialectical materialism), a theory emphasizing the primacy of the material way of life, social &quot;praxis,&quot; over all forms of social consciousness and the secondary, dependent character of the &quot;ideal.&quot; The term &quot;dialectical materialism&quot; was coined by the 19th-century social theorist [[Joseph Dietzgen]] who used the theory to explain the nature of [[socialism]] and social development. The original populariser of Marxism in Russia, [[Georgi Plekhanov]] used the terms &quot;dialectical materialism&quot; and &quot;historical materialism&quot; interchangeably. For [[Lenin]], the primary feature of Marx's &quot;dialectical materialism&quot; (Lenin's term) was its application of materialist philosophy to history and social sciences. Lenin's main input in the philosophy of dialectical materialism was his theory of reflection, which presented human consciousness as a dynamic reflection of the objective material world that fully shapes its contents and structure. Later, Stalin's works on the subject established a rigid and formalistic division of Marxist-Leninist theory in the dialectical materialism and historical materialism parts. While the first was supposed to be the key method and theory of the philosophy of nature, the second was the Soviet version of the philosophy of history. 

A dialectical method was fundamental to Marxist politics, e.g., the works of [[Karl Korsch]], [[Georg Lukács]] and certain members of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Soviet academics, notably [[Evald Ilyenkov]] and [[Zaid Orudzhev]], continued pursuing unorthodox philosophic study of Marxist dialectics; likewise in the West, notably the philosopher [[Bertell Ollman]] at  [[New York University]].

Friedrich Engels proposed that Nature is dialectical, thus, in [[Anti-Dühring]] he said that the negation of negation is:

{{quote|A very simple process, which is taking place everywhere and every day, which any child can understand as soon as it is stripped of the veil of mystery in which it was enveloped by the old [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Frederick, (1877) ''Anti-Dühring,''Part I: Philosophy, XIII. Dialectics. Negation of the Negation. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch11.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'', Engels said:

{{quote|Probably the same gentlemen who up to now have decried the transformation of quantity into quality as [[mysticism]] and incomprehensible [[transcendentalism]] will now declare that it is indeed something quite self-evident, trivial, and commonplace, which they have long employed, and so they have been taught nothing new. But to have formulated for the first time in its universally valid form a general law of development of Nature, society, and thought, will always remain an act of historic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch02.htm |title=Engels, Frederick, (1883) '&amp;#39;Dialectics of Nature:'&amp;#39;II. Dialectics |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marxist dialectics is exemplified in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (Capital), which outlines two central theories: (i) surplus value and (ii) the materialist conception of history; Marx explains dialectical materialism:

{{quote|In its rational form, it is a scandal and abomination to [[bourgeoisie|bourgeoisdom]] and its doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension an affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time, also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, (1873) ''Capital'' Vol. I, Afterword to the Second German Edition.
[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Class struggle]] is the central contradiction to be resolved by Marxist dialectics, because of its central role in the social and political lives of a society. Nonetheless, Marx and Marxists developed the concept of class struggle to comprehend the dialectical contradictions between mental and manual labor, and between town and country. Hence, philosophic contradiction is central to the development of dialectics — the progress from quantity to quality, the acceleration of gradual social change; the negation of the initial development of the ''status quo''; the negation of that negation; and the high-level recurrence of features of the original ''status quo''. In the USSR, Progress Publishers issued anthologies of dialectical materialism by Lenin, wherein he also quotes Marx and Engels:

{{quote|As the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development, and the richest in content, Hegelian dialectics was considered by Marx and Engels the greatest achievement of classical German philosophy.... “The great basic thought”, Engels writes, “that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things, apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away... this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that, in its generality, it is now scarcely ever contradicted.

But, to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words, and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation, are two different things.... For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it, except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy, itself, is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain.” Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is “the science of the general laws of motion both of the external world and of human thought”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenin, V.I. page 7-9&quot;&gt;Lenin, V.I., ''On the Question of Dialectics: A Collection'', pp. 7-9. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lenin describes his dialectical understanding of the concept of ''development'':

{{quote|A development that repeats, as it were, stages that have already been passed, but repeats them in a different way, on a higher basis (“the negation of the negation”), a development, so to speak, that proceeds in spirals, not in a straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes, and revolutions; “breaks in continuity”; the transformation of quantity into quality; inner impulses towards development, imparted by the contradiction and conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite laws — these are some of the features of dialectics as a doctrine of development that is richer than the conventional one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenin, V.I. page 7-9&quot;/&gt;}}

==Indian forms of dialectic==

===Indian continental debate: an intra- and inter-Dharmic dialectic===
Anacker (2005: p.&amp;nbsp;20), in the introduction to his translation of seven works by [[Vasubandhu]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 4th c.), a famed [[dialectician]] of the [[Gupta Empire]], contextualizes the prestige of dialectic and cut-throat debate in classical India and makes references to the possibly apocryphal story of the banishment of [[Moheyan]] post-debate with [[Kamalaśīla]] (fl. 713–763):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Philosophical debating was in classical India often a spectator-sport, much as contests of poetry-improvisation were in Germany in its High Middle Ages, and as they still are in the Telegu country today. The king himself was often the judge at these debates, and loss to an opponent could have serious consequences. To take an atrociously extreme example, when the Tamil Śaivite Ñānasambandar Nāyanār defeated the Jain ācāryas in Madurai before the Pāṇḍya King Māravarman Avaniśūlāmani (620-645) this debate is said to have resulted in the impalement of 8000 Jains, an event still celebrated in the Mīnāksi Temple of Madurai today. Usually, the results were not so drastic; they could mean formal recognition by the defeated side of the superiority of the winning party, forced conversions, or, as in the case of the ''[[Council of Lhasa]]'', which was conducted by Indians, banishment of the losers.&lt;ref&gt;Anacker, Stefan (2005, rev. ed.). ''Seven Works of Vasubandhu: The Buddhist Psychological Doctor.'' Delhi, India: Motilal Banarsidass. (First published: 1984; Reprinted: 1986, 1994, 1998; Corrected: 2002; Revised: 2005), p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Brahmin/Vedic/Hindu dialectic ====
{{See also|Hindu philosophy}}
While Western philosophy traces dialectics to ancient Greek thought of [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], the idea of tension between two opposing forces leading to synthesis is much older and present in Hindu Philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ErnestGreer2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Ernest|author2=Brian Greer|author3=Bharath Sriraman|title=Critical issues in mathematics education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AHO9s9DDV5QC&amp;pg=PA327|accessdate=8 July 2011|date=30 June 2009|publisher=IAP|isbn=978-1-60752-039-9|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indian philosophy, for the most part subsumed within the [[Indian religions]], has an ancient tradition of dialectic polemics. The two complements, &quot;[[purusha]]&quot; (the active cause) and the &quot;[[prakriti]]&quot; (the passive nature) brings everything into existence. They follow the &quot;rta&quot;, the [[Dharma]] (Universal Law of Nature).

==== Jain dialectic ====
{{Further|Jain philosophy|Anekantavada|Syadvada}}
Anekantavada and Syadvada are the sophisticated dialectic traditions developed by the Jains to arrive at truth. As per [[Jainism]], the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John M. (July, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Jain doctrine of Anekantavada states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and, as such, they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to the inherent limitations of being human. Only the [[Kevala Jnana|Kevalis]]—the omniscient beings—can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and that all others are capable of knowing only a part of it. Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth. According to Jains, the ultimate principle should always be logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duli&quot;&gt;Duli Chandra Jain (ed.) (1997) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one finds in the [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]], deliberative exhortations on any subject in all its facts, may they be constructive or obstructive, inferential or analytical, enlightening or destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Marilynn (2005) P. 590&lt;/ref&gt;

Syādvāda is a theory of conditioned predication that provides an expression to anekānta by recommending that epithet ''Syād'' be attached to every expression.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjea, Tara (2001) p.77-87&lt;/ref&gt; Syādvāda is not only an extension of Anekānta [[ontology]], but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own force. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term Syād is &quot;perhaps&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot;, but in context of syādvāda, it means &quot;in some ways&quot; or &quot;from a perspective.&quot; As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term &quot;syāt&quot; should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koller|first=John M.|title=Syādvāda as the [[epistemological]] key to the Jaina middle way metaphysics of Anekāntavāda|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=50|issue=3|pages=Pp.400–8|location=Honululu|month=July|year=2000|url =http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=59942245&amp;Fmt=4&amp;clientId=71080&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|issn=00318221|accessdate=2007-10-01}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative view points or propositions, it is known as theory of conditioned predication. These seven propositions also known as [[saptabhangi]] are:&lt;ref name = grimes&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Buddhist dialectic ====
{{See also|Buddhist philosophy}}
Buddhism has developed sophisticated, and sometimes highly institutionalized traditions of dialectics during its long history. [[Nalanda]] University, and later the Gelugpa Buddhism of Tibet, are examples. The historical development and clarification of Buddhist doctrine and [[polemics]], through dialectics and formal debate, is well documented. [[Buddhist]] doctrine was rigorously critiqued (though not ultimately refuted) in the 2nd century by [[Nagarjuna]], whose uncompromisingly logical approach to the realisation of truth, became the basis for the development of a vital stream of Buddhist thought. This dialectical approach of Buddhism, to the elucidation and articulation of an account of the Cosmos as the truth it really is, became known as the Perfection of Wisdom and was later developed by other notable thinkers, such as [[Dignaga]] and [[Dharmakirti]] (between 500 and 700). The dialectical method of truth-seeking is evident throughout the traditions of [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogacara]], and [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]]. [[Trisong Detsen]], and later [[Je Tsongkhapa]], championed the value of dialectic and of formalised training in debate in Tibet.

==Dialectical theology==
[[Neo-orthodoxy]], in Europe also known as theology of crisis and dialectical theology,&lt;ref name=BR1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/topic-409012/neoorthodoxy|title=Original Britinnica online|accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409012/neoorthodoxy#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=neoorthodoxy%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Britannica Encyclopedia (online) |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is an approach to [[theology]] in [[Protestantism]] that was developed in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918). It is characterized as a reaction against doctrines of [[Christianity in the 19th century|19th-century]] [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and a more positive reevaluation of the teachings of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], much of which had been in decline (especially in western Europe) since the late [[Christianity in the 18th century|18th century]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neo-orthodox |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary(online) |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily associated with two [[Swiss]] professors and pastors, [[Karl Barth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/91/N0059100.html |title=American Heritage Dictionary (online) |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1886–1968) and [[Emil Brunner]] (1899–1966),&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BR2/&gt; even though Barth himself expressed his unease in the use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;See Church Dogmatics III/3, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialectical method and dualism==
Another way to understand dialectics is to view it as a method of thinking to overcome formal [[dualism]] and [[Monism|monistic]] [[reductionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Biel, R. and Mu-Jeong Kho (2009) &quot;[http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/regulation/wp/document/RR_serieID_2009-1.pdf The Issue of Energy within a Dialectical Approach to the Regulationist Problematique],&quot; Recherches &amp; Régulation Working Papers, RR Série ID 2009-1, Association Recherche &amp; Régulation: 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, formal dualism regards the opposites as mutually exclusive entities, whilst monism finds each to be an [[epiphenomenon]] of the other. Dialectical thinking rejects both views. The dialectical method requires focus on both at the same time. It looks for a transcendence of the opposites entailing a leap of the imagination to a higher level, which (1) provides justification for rejecting both alternatives as false and/or (2) helps elucidate a real but previously veiled integral relationship between apparent opposites that have been kept apart and regarded as distinct. For example, the [[superposition principle]] of [[quantum physics]] can be explained using the dialectical method of thinking&amp;mdash;likewise the example below from dialectical biology. Such examples showing the relationship of the dialectic method of thinking to the scientific method to a large part negates the criticism of Popper (see text below) that the two are mutually exclusive. The dialectic method also examines false alternatives presented by formal dualism (materialism vs idealism; rationalism vs empiricism; mind vs body, etc.) and looks for ways to transcend the opposites and form synthesis. In the dialectical method, both have something in common, and understanding of the parts requires understanding their relationship with the whole system. The dialectical method thus views the whole of reality as an evolving process.

== Dialectical biology ==
{{Undue|date=September 2010}}
In ''The Dialectical Biologist'' (Harvard U.P. 1985 ISBN 0-674-20281-3), [[Richard Levins]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] sketch a dialectical approach to biology. They see &quot;dialectics&quot; more as a set of questions to ask about biological research, a weapon against dogmatism, than as a set of pre-determined answers. They focus on the (dialectical) relationship between the &quot;whole&quot; (or totality) and the &quot;parts.&quot; &quot;Part makes whole, and whole makes part&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;272). That is, a biological system of some kind consists of a collection of heterogeneous parts. All of these contribute to the character of the whole, as in reductionist thinking. On the other hand, the whole has an existence independent of the parts and feeds back to affect and determine the nature of the parts. This back-and-forth (dialectic) of causation implies a dynamic process.
For example, [[Darwinian evolution]] points to the competition of a variety of species, each with heterogeneous members, within a given environment. This leads to changing species and even to new species arising. A dialectical biologist fully accepts this picture then looks for ways in which the competing creatures (which serve as the internal conflicts in the environment) lead to changes. The changes manifest in the creatures themselves, through the creatures embracing biological adaptations that provide them with advantages, and in the environment itself, as when the action of microbes encourages the erosion of rocks. Further, each species is part of the &quot;environment&quot; of all the others.

== Criticisms ==
Many philosophers have offered critiques of dialectic, and it can even be said that hostility or receptivity to dialectics is one of the things that divides twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy from the so-called &quot;continental&quot; tradition, a divide that only a few contemporary philosophers (among them, [[G.H. von Wright]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]) have ventured to bridge.

It is generally thought dialectics has become central to &quot;Continental&quot; philosophy, while it plays no part in &quot;Anglo-American&quot; philosophy. In other words, on the continent of Europe, dialectics has entered intellectual culture as what might be called a legitimate part of thought and philosophy, whereas in America and Britain, the dialectic plays no discernible part in the intellectual culture, which instead tends toward [[positivism]]. A prime example of the European tradition is [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', which is very different from the works of Popper, whose philosophy was for a time highly influential in the UK where he resided (see below). Sartre states:

:&quot;[[Existentialism]], like [[Marxism]], addresses itself to experience in order to discover there concrete syntheses. It can conceive of these syntheses only within a moving, dialectical totalisation, which is nothing else but history or&amp;mdash;from the strictly cultural point of view adopted here&amp;mdash;'philosophy-becoming-the world'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/critic/sartre1.htm |title=The Search for Method (1st part) Sartre, 1960, in Existentialism from Dostoyevsky to Sartre, transl. Hazel Barnes, Vintage Books |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]] has attacked the dialectic repeatedly. In 1937 he wrote and delivered a paper entitled &quot;What Is Dialectic?&quot; in which he attacked the dialectical method for its willingness &quot;to put up with contradictions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper,''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' [New York: Basic Books, 1962], p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper concluded the essay with these words: &quot;The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that [[philosophy]] should not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical [[Scientific method|methods of science]]&quot; (Ibid., p.&amp;nbsp;335).

In chapter 12 of volume 2 of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1944; 5th rev. ed., 1966) Popper unleashed a famous attack on Hegelian dialectics, in which he held that Hegel's thought (unjustly, in the view of some philosophers, such as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walter Kaufmann |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm |title=kaufmann |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was to some degree responsible for facilitating the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe by encouraging and justifying [[Epistemology#Irrationalism|irrationalism]]. In section 17 of his 1961 &quot;addenda&quot; to ''The Open Society'', entitled &quot;Facts, Standards and Truth: A Further Criticism of Relativism,&quot; Popper refused to moderate his criticism of the Hegelian dialectic, arguing that it &quot;played a major role in the downfall of [[Weimar Republic|the liberal movement in Germany]],... by contributing to [[historicism]] and to an identification of might and right, encouraged [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] modes of thought. &amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [and] undermined and eventually lowered the traditional standards of intellectual responsibility and honesty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper,''The Open Society and Its Enemies'', 5th rev. ed., vol. 2 [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966], p.&amp;nbsp;395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formalism ==

In the past few decades, European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for dialectical logic or [[argument (logic)|argument]]. There had been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''), and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]). One can include the communities of [[informal logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]]. However, building on theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] (see [[John L. Pollock]]), systems have been built that define well-formedness of arguments, rules governing the process of introducing arguments based on fixed assumptions, and rules for shifting burden. Many of these logics appear in the special area of [[artificial intelligence and law]], though the computer scientists' interest in formalizing dialectic originates in a desire to build [[decision support]] and computer-supported collaborative work systems.&lt;ref&gt;See Logical models of argument,
CI Chesñevar, AG Maguitman, R Loui - ACM Computing Surveys, 2000 and Logics for defeasible argumentation,
H Prakken, Handbook of philosophical logic, 2002 for surveys of work in this area.&lt;/ref&gt;
