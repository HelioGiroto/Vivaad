{{About|the political meeting|customs relating to a Constitution|Constitutional convention (political custom)}}
A '''constitutional convention''' is now a gathering for the purpose of writing a new [[constitution]] or revising an existing constitution. A '''general constitutional convention''' is called to create the first constitution of a political unit or to entirely replace an existing constitution. An '''unlimited constitutional convention''' is called to revise an existing constitution to the extent that it deems to be proper, whereas a ''limited constitutional convention'' is restricted to revising only the areas of the current constitution named in the convention's ''call'', the legal mandate establishing the convention.
Examples of constitutional conventions include:

*United States: [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]], which proposed what became the [[Philadelphia Convention]] (1787) – Drafted the [[United States Constitution]] for ratification by the states. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] of the  constitution sets forth a mechanism whereby [[Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution|future constitutional conventions]] can be held. The constitution has been amended several times since the Philadelphia Convention, but never (as of 2011) by this method.
*France: [[National Convention|The National Convention of 1792]] (commonly referred to as ''The Convention'') convened during [[The French Revolution]] on September 20 with the purpose of writing a Republican Constitution following [[August 10 (French Revolution)|the suspension of the French Monarchy]].  The monarchy was officially abolished on September 21 by The Convention.
*[[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63)]], established Missouri's provisional government during the [[American Civil War]]
*Canada: (1864), [[Quebec Conference, 1864]], and [[London Conference of 1866]].
*[[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Australian constitutional convention]]s – 1891, 1897, 1973 and 1998.
*Germany: [[Parlamentarischer Rat]] (Parliamentary Council) (1948) – Drafted the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law of the Federal Republic]] for ratification by the ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]''.
*[[Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention]] (1975–1976) – a failed attempt to find a solution to the status of [[Northern Ireland]].
*[[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] (1989) – produced a plan for Scottish [[devolution]].
*[[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]] (2001) – Drafted the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitution for Europe]] for approval by the [[European Council]] and ratification by the [[List of European Union member states|member state]]s.
*[[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Philippine Constitutional Convention]]
**1935 – to draft a constitution to create the autonomous [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under the U.S. [[Tydings-McDuffie Act]]. The constitution was also used in the 3rd Republic (1946) until the passage of the 1973 constitution. Members were elected through the [[Philippine Constitutional Convention election, 1934]]
**1971 – to draft a revised constitution to replace the old U.S. customed 1935 Philippine constitution. Members were elected through the [[Philippine Constitutional Convention election, 1970]]. The system of government changed from Presidentitial to Parliamentary to Presidentital-Parliamentary (in 1984 amendment). The constitution lasted until the downfall of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1986 and [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed members to draft the 1987 Constitution through a [[Constitutional Commission]].

Constitutional conventions have also been used by constituent states of federations — such as the individual [[U.S. state|state]]s of the United States — to create, replace, or revise [[State constitution (United States)|their own constitutions]]. Though the several states have never held a national constitutional convention for the purpose of proposing amendments, the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment to the US Constitution]] was ratified not by the state legislatures, but by state level conventions after it was passed by Congress, as described as an alternate method of ratification in Article V of the US Constitution.

Several American academics have criticized the [[United States Constitution]] for specific shortcomings and have called for a ''Second Constitutional Convention'',&lt;ref name=twsSEPnn86&gt;{{Cite news
