      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30154">[[File:BritishMandatePalestine1920.svg|thumb|300px|right|The [[British Mandate of Palestine]] included the modern-day territory of [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza]] and [[Jordan]]. After a [[Islam_and_war#Arab_riots_1920-1921|series of riots]] by Islamic Arabs throughout the original mandate in response to the intent of the British that a Jewish state's establishment would be considered, the portion east of the Jordan River was broken off from the mandate and established as an Islamic Arab kingdom in appeasement. Revisionist Zionists therefore claimed the entire original Mandate of Palestine, not only the western portion, as part of the [[Jewish state]]. Consequently, for many years after the establishment of Israel, they did not recognise the existence of Jordan. However by the 1970s, the legitimacy of Jordan was no longer questioned.]]

'''Revisionist Zionism''' is a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] faction within the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement. It is the founding ideology of the non-religious [[right-wing|right]] in [[Israel]], and was the chief ideological competitor to the dominant socialist [[Labor Zionism]]. Revisionism is the precursor of the [[Likud Party]].&lt;ref name=Rynhold-Waxman&gt;Jonathan Rynhold, Dov Waxman, Ideological change and Israel's disengagement from Gaza. In ''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'', March, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology was developed originally by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] who advocated a &quot;revision&quot; of the &quot;practical Zionism&quot; of [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Chaim Weizmann]], which was focused on independent settlement of ''[[Eretz Yisrael]]''. In 1935, after the [[Zionist Executive]] rejected his political program and refused to state that &quot;the aim of Zionism was the establishment of a Jewish state,&quot; Jabotinsky resigned from the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]]. He founded the New Zionist Organization (NZO) to conduct independent political activity for free immigration and the establishment of a Jewish State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jabotinsky.html Ze'ev Jabotinsky]&lt;/ref&gt; Revisionist Zionism was instead centered on a vision of &quot;political Zionism&quot;, which Jabotinsky regarded as following the legacy of [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of modern political Zionism.

In its early years, and under Jabotinsky's leadership, Revisionist Zionism was focused on gaining British aid for settlement. Later, Revisionist groups independent of Jabotinsky's leadership conducted campaigns of violence against the British authorities in [[Palestine]] to drive them out and establish a [[Jewish state]].

==Ideology==
Revisionism was distinguished primarily from other ideologies within Zionism by its territorial maximalism. While not the only group to do so, they insisted upon the Jewish right to sovereignty over the whole territory of [[Eretz Yisrael]] (originally encompassing all of Mandatory Palestine). The British establishment of [[Transjordan]] (modern day state of [[Jordan]]) adversely affected this goal and was a great set-back for the movement. After this and until statehood, Revisionist Zionism became known more for its advocacy of more belligerent, assertive posture and actions against both British and Arab control of the region.

Revisionism's foremost political objective was to maintain the territorial integrity of the historical land of Israel and establish a Jewish state with a Jewish majority on both sides of the River Jordan.  Jewish statehood was always a major ideological goal for Revisionism, but it was not to be gained at the price of partitioning Eretz Yisrael. Jabotinsky and his followers, therefore, consistently rejected proposals to partition Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state. [[Menachem Begin]], Jabotinsky's successor, therefore opposed the 1947 United Nations partition plan. Revisionists considered the subsequent partition of Palestine following the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] to have no legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Rynhold-Waxman/&gt;

During the first two decades after independence, the Revisionist Party, [[Herut]], remained in opposition. The party slowly began to revise its ideology in an effort to change this situation and gain political power. While Begin maintained the Revisionist claim to Jewish sovereignty over all of Eretz Israel; by the late 1950s, control over the East Bank of the Jordan ceased to be an operative element within Revisionist ideology. Following Herut's merger with the Liberal Party in 1965, references to the ideal of Jewish sovereignty over &quot;both banks of the Jordan&quot; appeared less and less frequently. By the 1970s, the legitimacy of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] was no longer questioned. In 1994, the complete practical abandonment of the &quot;both banks&quot; principle was apparent when an overwhelming majority of Likud Knesset Members (MKs) voted in favor of the peace treaty with Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Nadav Shelef, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/israel_studies/v009/9.1shelef.html From 'Both Banks of the Jordan' to the 'Whole Land of Israel': Ideological Change in Revisionist Zionism], ''[[Israel Studies]]'' 9 (Spring 2004): 125–148&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day the [[Six-Day War]] started in June 1967, the Revisionists, as part of the [[Gahal]] faction, joined the [[national unity government]] under Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]]; this resulted in Begin serving in the [[Cabinet of Israel|cabinet]] for the first time. Ben-Gurion's [[Rafi]] party also joined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/history/eng/eng_hist6_s.htm Factional and Government Make-Up of the Sixth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; The war also brought to an end Labor's previous efforts to delegitimize Revisionism, because on the eve of the war, the dominant party felt it had to include the Revisionist opposition in an emergency national unity government. This step not only made the opposition views acceptable in the eyes of the public. It also showed that the dominant party no longer felt that it could monopolize power.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Pennings, Jan-Erik Lane, [http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=uez5TOcnEdAC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=Likud+%221977+election%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HB1KDCOFvD&amp;sig=nG5U9bhnnwvoH0Z9atXOnWhaRmc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b14qSoCBOJzo7AO2uayLCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#PPA144,M1 Comparing party system change], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; This unity arrangement lasted until August 1970, when Begin and Gahal left the government. Some sources indicate the resignation was due to disagreements over the [[Rogers Plan]] and its &quot;in place&quot; cease-fire with Egypt along the [[Suez Canal]],;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Newsweek]]'' May 30, 1977, &quot;The Zealot&quot;, &lt;blockquote&gt; But he quit in 1970 when Prime Minister Golda Meir, under pressure from Washington, renewed a cease-fire with Egypt along the Suez Canal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; other sources, including [[William B. Quandt]], note that Begin left the unity government because the Labor party, by formally accepting [[UN 242]] in mid-1970, had accepted &quot;peace for withdrawal&quot; on all fronts. On August 5, 1970, Begin himself explained before the Knesset why he was resigning. He said, &quot;As far as we are concerned, what do the words 'withdrawal from territories administered since 1967 by Israel' mean other than Judea and Samaria. Not all the territories; but by all opinion, most of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[William B. Quandt]], ''Peace Process, American Diplomacy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict since 1967'', p. 194, ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Israel's capture of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 war, Revisionism's territorial aspirations concentrated on these territories. These areas were far more central to ancient Jewish history than the East Bank of the Jordan and most of the areas within Israel's post-1949 borders. In 1968, Begin defined the &quot;eternal patrimony of our ancestors&quot; as &quot;Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Judea, [and] Shechem [Nablus]&quot; in the West Bank. In 1973, Herut's election platform called for the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza. When Menachem Begin became leader of the broad Likud coalition and, soon Prime Minister, he considerably modified Herut's expansive territorial aims. The party's aspiration to unite all of mandatory Palestine under Jewish rule was scaled down. Instead, Begin spoke of the historic unity of Israel in the West Bank, even hinting that he would make territorial concessions in the Sinai as part of a complete peace settlement.&lt;ref name=PeretzME2day&gt;[[Don Peretz]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=UqfHROAUevsC&amp;dq=%22The+Middle+East+today%22++Don+Peretz&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Middle East today''], p. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt;

When Begin finally came to power in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 election]], his overriding concern as Prime Minister (1977–1983) was to maintain Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Peleg, ''Begin's Foreign Policy 1977–83'' (Greenwood Press, 1987, Westport, CT). Also, Sasson Sofer, ''Begin: an anatomy of leadership'', (Blackwell, 1988, London).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 he declared to a group of Jewish settlers: &quot;I, Menachem, the son of Ze'ev and Hasia Begin, do solemnly swear that as long as I serve the nation as Prime Minister we will not leave any part of Judea, Samaria, [or] the Gaza Strip.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Jerusalem Post'', May 10, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main mechanisms for accomplishing this objective was the establishment of Jewish settlements. Under Labor governments, between 1967 and 1977, the Jewish population of the territories reached 3,200; Labor's limited settlement activity was predicated upon making a future territorial compromise when the majority of the territory would be returned to Arab control. By contrast, the Likud's settlement plan aimed to settle 750,000 Jews all over the territories in order to prevent a territorial compromise. As a result, by 1984, there were about 44,000 settlers outside East Jerusalem.

In the diplomatic arena, Begin pursued his core ideological objective in a relatively pragmatic manner. He held back from annexing the West Bank and Gaza, recognizing that this was not feasible in the short term, due to international opposition.&lt;ref name=Rynhold-Waxman/&gt; He signed the Camp David Accords (1978) with Egypt that referred to the &quot;legitimate rights of the Palestinians&quot; (although Begin insisted that the Hebrew version referred only to &quot;the Arabs of Eretz Yisrael&quot; and not to &quot;Palestinians&quot;). Begin also promoted the idea of autonomy for the Palestinians, albeit only a &quot;personal&quot; autonomy that would not give them control over any territory. But his uncompromising stance in the negotiations over Palestinian autonomy from 1979 to 1981 led to the resignations of the more moderate [[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Ezer Weizman]], Foreign and Defense Ministers, respectively, both of whom left the Likud government.

According to Weizman, the significant concessions Begin made to the Egyptians in the [[Camp David Accords]] and the Egyptian—Israeli peace treaty of the following year were motivated, in part, by his ideological commitment to the eventual annexation of the territories.&lt;ref&gt;Ezer Weizman, ''The Battle for Peace'' (New York: Doubleday, 1981), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the most powerful Arab state from the conflict, reducing international (mainly American) pressure for Israeli concessions on the issue of the territories, and prolonging inconclusive talks on Palestinian autonomy, Begin was buying time for his government's settlement activities in the territories. Begin continued to vow that territory, which was part of historic Eretz Israel in the West Bank and Gaza, would never be returned. His adamant stand on the territory became an obstacle to extending the 1979 peace treaty.&lt;ref name=PeretzME2day/&gt;

The Revisionist ideological stand concerning the territories has continued, although it has moderated somewhat and become more 'pragmatic' in the years since, as discussed below.

==Jabotinsky and Revisionist Zionism==
[[File:Zeev Jabotinsky.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism]]
After [[World War I]], Jabotinsky was elected to the first legislative assembly in the [[Yishuv]], and in 1921 he was elected to the Executive Council of the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] (known as the World Zionist Organization after 1960). He quit the latter group in 1923, however, due to differences of opinion with its chairman, [[Chaim Weizmann]]. In 1925, Jabotinsky formed the [[Hatzohar|Revisionist Zionist Alliance]], in the [[World Zionist Congress]] to advocate his views, which included increased cooperation with Britain on transforming the entire [[Palestine (mandate)|Mandate for Palestine]] on both sides of the [[Jordan River]] into a sovereign Jewish state, loyal to the [[British Empire]]. To this end, Jabotinsky advocated for mass Jewish immigration from Europe and the creation of a second [[Jewish Legion]] to guard a nascent Jewish state at inception. A staunch [[anglophile]], Jabotinsky wished to convince Britain that a Jewish state would be in the best interest of the British Empire, perhaps even an autonomous extension of it in the [[Middle East]].

When, in 1935, the Zionist Organization failed to accept Jabotinsky's program, he and his followers seceded to form the ''New Zionist Organization''. The NZO rejoined the ZO in 1946. The Zionist Organization was roughly composed of [[General Zionists]], who were in the majority, followers of Jabotinsky, who came in a close second, and [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionists]], led by [[David Ben-Gurion]], who comprised a minority yet had much influence where it mattered, in the Yishuv.

Despite its strong representation in the Zionist Organization, Revisionist Zionism had a small presence in the Yishuv, in contrast to Labour Zionism, which was dominant among [[kibbutz]]im and workers, and hence the settlement enterprise. General Zionism was dominant among the [[middle class]], which later aligned itself with the Revisionists. In the Jewish Diaspora, Revisionism was most established in [[Poland]], where its base of operations was organized in various political parties and Zionist Youth groups, such as [[Betar (youth movement)|Betar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wdowiński&quot;&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =David Wdowiński | title =And we are not saved | year =1963 | pages =222 | publisher =Philosophical Library | location =New York | isbn =0802224865 }} Note: Chariton and Lazar were never co-authors of Wdowiński's memoir. Wdowiński is considered the &quot;single author.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s, Revisionist Zionism was divided into three distinct ideological streams: the &quot;Centrists&quot;, the [[Irgun]], and the &quot;Messianists&quot;.

Jabotinsky later argued for a need to establish a base in the Yishuv, and developed a vision to guide the Revisionist movement and the new Jewish society on the economic and social policy centered around the ideal of the Jewish middle class in Europe. Jabotinsky believed that basing the movement on a philosophy contrasting with the socialist oriented Labour Zionists would attract the support of the General Zionists.

In line with this thinking, the Revisionists transplanted into the Yishuv their own youth movement, Betar. They also set up a paramilitary group, [[Irgun]], a labour union, the [[National Labour Federation]], and their own health services. The latter were intended to counteract the increasing hegemony of Labour Zionism over community services via the [[Histadrut]] and address the refusal of the Histadrut to make its services available to Revisionist Party members.

==Irgun: Origin and activities==
{{Main|Irgun}}
The '''[[Irgun]]''' (shorthand for ''Irgun Tsvai Leumi'', Hebrew for &quot;National Military Organization&quot; ארגון צבאי לאומי) had its roots initially in the [[Betar (youth movement)|Betar]] youth movement in Poland, which Jabotinsky founded. By the 1940s, they had transplanted many of its members from Europe and the [[United States]] to Palestine. The movement, now acting autonomously from the [[Hatzohar]] leadership in Poland, decided to organize locally, as its small membership was increasingly overshadowed by Labour Zionists, who were predominantly focused on settling the land. While Jabotinsky continued to lobby the British Empire, the Irgun, under the leadership of people such as [[David Raziel]] and later [[Menachem Begin]], fought politically against the Labour Zionists and militarily against the British for the establishment of a Jewish state, independent of any orders from Jabotinsky.

Acting often in conflict (but at times, also in coordination) with rival clandestine militias such as the ''[[Haganah]]'' and the ''[[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'' (or Stern Group), the Irgun 's efforts would feature prominently in the armed struggles against British and Arab forces alike in the 1930s and 1940s, and ultimately become decisive in the closing events of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. After 1948, members of the Irgun were variously demobilised, or incorporated directly into the nascent [[Israeli Defense Forces]]; and on the political front, Irgunist ideology found a new vehicle of expression in the ''[[Herut]]'' (or &quot;Freedom&quot;) Party.

[[File:SternGang-Doc-Nazi-Collaboration.jpg|thumb|150px|left|German covering letter attached to the January 1941 offer by Lehi. The offer was to &quot;actively take part in the war on Germany's side&quot; in return for German support for &quot;the establishment of the historic Jewish state on a national and totalitarian basis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, 1995, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Lehi (group)}}
The movement called ''[[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'' and nicknamed the &quot;Stern Gang&quot; by the British, was led by [[Avraham Stern|Avraham &quot;Yair&quot; Stern]], until his death. Stern did not join the [[Herut|Revisionist Zionist party]] in university but instead joined another group called &quot;Hulda&quot;. He formed Lehi in 1940 as an offshoot from Irgun, which was initially named ''Irgun Zvai Leumi be-Yisrael'' (National Military Organization in Israel or NMO). Following Stern's death in 1942—killed while already in custody by British police—and the arrest of many of its members, the group went into eclipse until it was reformed as &quot;Lehi&quot; under a triumvirate of [[Israel Eldad]], [[Natan Yellin-Mor]], and [[Yitzhak Shamir]]. Lehi was guided also by spiritual leader [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]]. The Lehi, in particular their members in prison, were encouraged in their struggle by Rabbi [[Aryeh Levin]] a greatly respected Jewish sage of the time. Shamir became the [[Prime Minister of Israel]] forty years later.

Irgun—and, to a lesser extent, Lehi—were influenced by the romantic nationalism of Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. The movement's activities were independent of any diaspora leadership, but were backed by several figures in the diaspora.

While the Irgun stopped its activities against the British during [[World War II]], at least until 1944, Lehi continued [[guerrilla warfare]] against the British authorities. It considered the British rule of Mandatory Palestine to be an illegal [[Military occupation|occupation]], and concentrated its attacks mainly against British targets (unlike the other underground movements, which were also involved in fighting against Arab [[paramilitary]] groups).

In 1940, Lehi proposed intervening in the Second World War on the side of [[Nazi Germany]] to attain their help in expelling Britain from Mandate Palestine and to offer their assistance in &quot;evacuating&quot; the Jews of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shindler&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7VBoVr089GwC&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Colin Shindler|title=The land beyond promise: Israel, Likud and the Zionist dream|publisher=I.B. Tauris|page=22|year=1995|isbn=978-1-86064-774-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1940, Lehi representative [[Naftali Lubenchik]] was sent to [[Beirut]] where he met the German official [[Werner Otto von Hentig]]. ''See [[Lehi (group)#Contact with Nazi Germany]]''

Lehi prisoners captured by the British generally refused to present a defence when brought to trial in British courts. They would only read out statements in which they declared that the court, representing an occupying force, had no jurisdiction over them. For the same reason, Lehi prisoners refused to plead for amnesty, even when it was clear that this would have spared them from the death penalty. In two cases, Lehi men killed themselves in prison to deprive the British of the ability to hang them.{{Citation needed|reason=ref or re-write to more neutral 'rather than being hanged by the British'|date=March 2009}}

Tensions between the Irgun and Lehi simmered until the two groups forged an alliance during the [[Israeli War of Independence]].

==Revisionist Zionism: Ideology==
Ideologically, Revisionism advocated the creation of a Jewish state on both sides of the [[Jordan River]], that is, a state which would include the present-day Israel, as well as [[West Bank]], [[Gaza]] and all or part of the modern state of [[Jordan]]. Jordan was separated from Mandatory Palestine in 1922 in response to Arab resentment of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]]. All three Revisionist streams, including Centrists who advocated a British-style [[liberal democracy]], and the two more militant streams, which would become Irgun and Lehi, supported Jewish settlement on both sides of the [[Jordan River]]; in most cases, they differed only on how this should be achieved. (Some supporters within Labor Zionism, such as [[Mapai]]'s Ben-Gurion also accepted this interpretation for the Jewish homeland.) Jabotinsky wanted to gain the help of Britain in this endeavor, while Lehi and the Irgun, following Jabotinsky's death, wanted to conquer both sides of the river independently of the British. The Irgun stream of Revisionism opposed power-sharing with Arabs. On the topic of &quot;[[Population transfer|transfer]]&quot; (expulsion of the Arabs), Jabotinsky's statements were ambiguous. In some writings he supported the notion, but only as an act of self-defense, in others he argued that Arabs should be included in the [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] society that he was advocating, and in others still, he completely disregarded the potency of Arab resistance to Jewish settlement, and stated that settlement should continue, and the Arabs be ignored.

===National-messianism vs. Jewish nationalism===
Up to 1933, a number of members from the national-messianist wing of Revisionism were inspired by the [[fascist]] movement of [[Benito Mussolini]]. [[Abba Ahimeir]] was attracted to fascism for its staunch [[anti-communism]] and its focus on rebuilding the glory of the past, which national-messianists such as Uri Zvi Greenberg felt had much connection to their view of what the Revisionist movement should be.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Abba Ahimeir's ideology was based in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s monumental study on the [[decline of the West]], but his Zionist orientation caused him to adapt its ultimate conclusions. Achimeir's basic assumption was that liberal bourgeois European culture was degenerate, and deeply eroded from within by an excess of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. Socialism and communism were portrayed as &quot;overcivilized&quot; ideologies. Fascism on the other hand, like Zionism, was a return to the roots of the national culture and the historical past. According to Achimeir, Italian Fascism was not [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] or [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]], whereas communist ideology and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] were intrinsically so.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

He also developed a favorable attitude toward fascist praxis and its psycho-politics, such as the principle of the all-powerful leader, the use of [[propaganda]] to generate a spirit of heroism and duty to the homeland, and the cultivation of youthful vitality (as manifested in the fascist youth movements). Ahimeir joined the Revisionist movement in 1930, but before joining he wrote a regular column entitled &quot;From the Notebook of a Fascist&quot; in the unaffiliated but pro-Revisionist magazine ''[[Doar Hayom]]''. He crafted his pro-fascistic views in these columns, and also wrote an article in 1928 titled &quot;On the Arrival of Our Duce&quot; to celebrate Jabotinsky's visit to Palestine, and propose a new direction for the Revisionist movement, more in line with Achimeir's views. (Segev, Tom, ''The Seventh Million: Israelis and the Holocaust'' p.&amp;nbsp;23.)

When Ahimeir was on trial in 1932 for having disrupted a public lecture at [[Hebrew University]], his lawyer, [[Zvi Eliahu Cohen]], argued &quot;Were it not for Hitler's anti-Semitism, we would not oppose his ideology. Hitler saved Germany.&quot; Tom Segev has remarked, &quot;This was not an unconsidered outburst.&quot; An editorial in the Revisionist newspaper ''[[Hazit Haam]]'' praised Cohen's &quot;brilliant speech.&quot; It continued, that &quot;Social Democrats of all stripes believe that Hitler's movement is an empty shell (but) we believe that there is both a shell and a kernel. The anti-Semitic shell is to be discarded, but not the anti-Marxist kernel. The Revisionists would fight the Nazis only to the extent that they were anti-Semites.&quot; (Segev, Tom, ''The Seventh Million: Israelis and the Holocaust'' p.&amp;nbsp;23).

In 1933, when Hitler came to power, the newspaper, whose editors were Revisionist Party members, praised Nazism as a German national liberation movement and said that Hitler had saved Germany from Communism. Jabotinsky responded by threatening to have the newspaper's editors expelled if they repeated such &quot;kow-towing&quot; to Hitler. (Schechtman, ''Fighter and Prophet'', p.&amp;nbsp;216.)

The national messianist wing differed from the ideological vision of Jabotinsky to the extent that on August 9, 1932, Jabotinsky wrote to tell Abba Ahimeir that his romantic ideas and the zeal of his followers were considered excessive. ''[[Hatzohar]]'', he wrote, was a democratic political movement of a patrician rather than populist or Romantic kind. As a consequence, he argued, the behavior of Ahimeir and his friends threatened Jabotinsky's own movement. He also argued that if Achimeir's views were indeed similar to those which he expressed in his articles and letters, there was no room for the two of them in the same political camp.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Despite his flirt with fascism, Ahimeir was also known for his fight against Nazism, with the most visible example being his climb on the German embassy roof in Jerusalem taking off the swastika flag. In later years, Ahimeir said he was sorry for calling himself a &quot;fascistan&quot; (fascist sympathizer).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Irgun to Likud===
The [[Irgun]] largely followed the Centrists' ideals but with a much more hawkish outlook toward Britain's involvement in the Mandate, and an ardently nationalist vision of society and government. After the establishment of the [[State of Israel]], it was the Irgun wing of the Revisionist Party that formed [[Herut]], which in turn eventually formed the [[Gahal]] party when the Herut and Liberal parties formed a united list called Gush Herut Liberalim (or the Herut-Liberal Bloc). In 1977 the new [[Likud]] Party was formed by a group of parties dominated by the Revisionist Herut/Gahal, became the dominant party in a governing coalition, and remains an important force in Israeli politics until today. In March 2006, the Likud lost many of its seats to the Kadima party. The Likud bounced back in Israel's most recent Knesset elections, garnering 27 seats, although still less than Kadima's 28 seats. However, because right-of-center parties who favored a Likud-led coalition, comprised the majority, Likud was chosen to form the coalition and leads the government today. In the years since the 1977 election, particularly in the last decade, Likud has undergone a number of splits to its right, including the 1998 departure of [[Benny Begin]], son of Herut founder [[Menachem Begin]] (he rejoined Likud in 2008), and in 2005 experienced a split to its left with the departure of [[Ariel Sharon]] and his followers to form [[Kadima]]. Although the party platform has been consistent with Revisionist ideology, most supporters believe that prime ministers from the party have consistently deviated from what many see as their mandate.

The [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] and other parties, such as Lieberman's [[Yisrael Beytenu]] now claim to be the true representatives of Revisionist Zionism, and that Likud has abandoned its ideology, which is by some evidence true, since although historically, does not in complete form adhere to former [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] or [[Irgun]]ist principles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

While the initial core group of Likud leaders such as [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Ministers]] Begin and [[Yitzhak Shamir]] came from Likud's Herut faction, later leaders, such as [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and [[Ariel Sharon]] have come from or moved to the &quot;pragmatic&quot; Revisionist wing.
