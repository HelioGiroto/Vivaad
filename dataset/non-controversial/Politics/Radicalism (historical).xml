For other meanings see also [[radical (disambiguation)|radical]], [[extremism]], [[far-right]] and [[far-left]]. Radicalism as a [[political movement]] should be distinguished from the modern American usage of radical merely to denote political extremes of right or left.''

{{Liberalism sidebar |expanded=all}}
The term '''Radical''' (from the [[Latin]] ''radix'' meaning root) was used during the late 18th century for proponents of the '''Radical Movement'''. Historically, it began in  the [[United Kingdom]] with political support for a &quot;radical reform&quot; of the [[electoral system]] to widen the franchise. Some ''radicals'' sought [[republicanism]], abolition of titles, redistribution of [[property]] and [[freedom of the press]]. Initially identifying itself as a [[far left]] party opposed to the [[right-wing]] parties; the [[Orleanist]]s, the [[Legitimist]]s and the [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]]s in [[France in the nineteenth century]], the [[Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party (historical)|Republican, Radical and Radical‐Socialist Party]] progressively became the most important party of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940).  As historical '''Radicalism''' became absorbed in the development of political [[liberalism]], in the later 19th century in both the United Kingdom and continental [[Europe]] the term Radical came to denote a progressive liberal ideology.

==United Kingdom==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' the first use of the word &quot;Radical&quot; in a political sense is generally ascribed to the English [[British Whig Party|whig]] [[Parliament of England|parliament]]arian [[Charles James Fox]].  In 1797, Fox declared for a &quot;radical reform&quot; of the [[electoral system]]. This led to a general use of the term to identify all supporting the movement for parliamentary reform.  The ''Britannica'' biography of Fox mentions his dismissal from the [[Privy Council]] in 1798 for reaffirming the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people in a public speech. However, the biography does not describe the specifics of Fox's declaration.  Fox was no democrat: he would never have countenanced the notion that property would be safe in a democratic society in which the property-less voters would obviously be in a majority. Fox stated his view as being that property was the true foundation of aristocracy, and a country best prospered whose government was in such hands. These sentiments appear to be at odds with the Radical cause, but at this time parliament operated on shifting patronage rather than party lines, and Fox was noted for inconsistencies.

The word was first used in a political sense in 18th century [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Initially confined to the upper and middle classes, in the early 19th century &quot;popular radicals&quot; brought [[artisan]]s and the &quot;labouring classes&quot; into widespread agitation in the face of harsh government repression. More respectable &quot;Philosophical radicals&quot; followed the [[utilitarian]] philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the &quot;popular radicals&quot;. By the middle of the century [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] joined with others in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], eventually achieving reform of the [[electoral system]].

===Origins===
The Radical movement had its beginnings at a time of tension between the American colonies and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], with the first Radicals, angry at the state of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], drawing on the [[Levellers|Leveller]] tradition and similarly demanding improved parliamentary representation. These earlier concepts of democratic and even egalitarian reform had emerged in the turmoil of the [[English Civil War]] and the brief establishment of the [[republic]]an [[Commonwealth of England]] amongst the vague political grouping known as the [[Levellers]], but with the [[English Restoration]] of the monarchy such ideas had been discredited. Although the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 had increased parliamentary power with a [[constitutional monarchy]] and the [[Act of Union 1707|union of the parliaments]] brought [[England]] and [[Scotland]] together, towards the end of the 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] which itself was dominated by the English aristocracy and by patronage. Candidates for the House of Commons stood as [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] or [[Tory|Tories]], but once elected formed shifting coalitions of interests rather than splitting along party lines. At [[general election]]s the vote was restricted to property owners, in constituencies which were out of date and did not reflect the growing importance of manufacturing towns or shifts of population, so that in many [[rotten borough]]s seats could be bought or were controlled by rich landowners, while major cities remained unrepresented. Discontent with these inequities inspired those individuals who later became known as the &quot;[[Radical Whigs]]&quot;.

[[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]] fostered early interest in reform in the [[London]] area. The &quot;[[Middlesex]] radicals&quot; were led by the politician [[John Wilkes]], an opponent of war with the colonies who started his weekly publication ''[[The North Briton]]'' in 1764 and within two years had been charged with [[seditious libel]] and expelled from the House of Commons. The [[Society for the Defence of the Bill of Rights]] he started in 1769 to support his re‐election developed the belief that every man had the right to vote and &quot;natural reason&quot; enabling him to properly judge political issues. Liberty consisted in frequent elections. For the first time middle‐class radicals obtained the backing of the London &quot;mob&quot;. Middlesex and [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] were among the few parliamentary constituencies with a large and socially diverse electorate including many [[artisan]]s as well as the middle class and aristocracy, and along with the county association of [[Yorkshire]] led by the Reverend [[Christopher Wyvill]] were at the forefront of reform activity. The writings of what became known as the &quot;[[Radical Whigs]]&quot; had an influence on the [[American Revolution]].

[[John Cartwright (political reformer)|Major John Cartwright]] also supported the colonists, even as the [[American Revolutionary War]] began, and in 1776 earned the title of the &quot;Father of Reform&quot; when he published his pamphlet ''Take Your Choice!'' advocating annual parliaments, the secret ballot and manhood [[suffrage]].

In 1780 a draft programme of reform was drawn up by [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Thomas Brand Hollis]], and put forward by a sub‐committee of the electors of Westminster. This included calls for the six points later adopted in the ''People's Charter'' (see [[#Chartists|Chartists]] below).

The [[American Revolutionary War]] ended in humiliating defeat of a policy which King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] had fervently advocated, and in March 1782 the King was forced to appoint an administration led by his opponents which sought to curb Royal patronage. In November 1783 he took his opportunity and used his influence in the [[House of Lords]] to defeat a Bill to reform the [[British East India Company]], dismissed the government and appointed [[William Pitt the Younger]] as his Prime Minister. Pitt had previously called for Parliament to begin to reform itself, but he did not press for long for reforms the King did not like. Proposals Pitt made in April 1785 to redistribute seats from the &quot;[[rotten borough]]s&quot; to London and the counties were defeated in the House of Commons by 248 votes to 174.

===Popular agitation ===
In the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[Thomas Paine]] wrote ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' (1791) as a response to [[Edmund Burke|Burke]]'s [[counterrevolutionary]] essay ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), itself an attack on [[Richard Price]]'s sermon that kicked off the so-called &quot;pamphlet war&quot; known as the [[Revolution Controversy]].  [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], another supporter of Price, soon followed with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.  They encouraged mass support for democratic reform along with rejection of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and all forms of privilege. Different strands of the movement developed, with middle class &quot;reformers&quot; aiming to widen the franchise to represent commercial and industrial interests and towns without parliamentary representation, while &quot;Popular radicals&quot; drawn from the middle class and from [[artisan]]s agitated to assert wider rights including relieving distress. The theoretical basis for electoral reform was provided by &quot;Philosophical radicals&quot; who followed the [[utilitarian]] philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the &quot;popular radicals&quot;.

Popular Radicals were quick to go further than Paine, with [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] schoolmaster [[Thomas Spence]] demanding land nationalisation to redistribute wealth in a penny periodical he called ''Pig's Meat'' in a reference to [[Edmund Burke]]'s phrase &quot;the swinish multitude&quot;. Radical organisations sprang up, such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] of artisans formed in January 1792 under the leadership of the shoemaker [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]] to call for the vote. One such was the [[Scotland|Scottish]] ''[[Friends of the People]]'' society which in October 1793 held a ''British Convention'' in [[Edinburgh]] with delegates from some of the English ''[[London Corresponding Society|corresponding societies]]''. They issued a manifesto demanding universal male suffrage with annual elections and expressing their support for the principles of the French Revolution. The numbers involved in these movements were small, and most wanted reform rather than revolution, but for the first time working men were organising for political change.

The government reacted harshly, imprisoning leading Scottish radicals, temporarily suspending [[habeas corpus]] in England and passing the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795]] which meant that a license was needed for any meeting in a public place consisting of fifty or more people. Throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the government took extensive stern measures against feared domestic unrest. The corresponding societies ended, but some radicals continued in secret, with Irish sympathisers in particular forming secret societies to overturn the government and encourage mutinies. In 1812 [[John Cartwright (political reformer)|Major John Cartwright]] formed the first [[Hampden Club]], named after the [[English Civil War]] Parliamentary leader [[John Hampden]], aiming to bring together middle class moderates and lower class radicals.

After the Napoleonic Wars, the [[Corn laws]] (in force between 1815 and 1846) and bad harvests fostered discontent. The publications of [[William Cobbett]] were influential, and at political meetings speakers like [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]] complained that only three men in a hundred had the vote. Writers like the radicals [[William Hone]] and [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler]] spread dissent with publications such as ''[[The Black Dwarf]]'' in defiance of a series of government acts to curb circulation of political literature. Radical riots in 1816 and 1817 were followed by the [[Peterloo massacre]] of 1819 publicised by [[Richard Carlile]] who then continued to fight for press freedom from prison. The [[Six Acts]] of 1819 limited the right to demonstrate or hold public meetings. In [[Scotland]] agitation over three years culminated in an attempted general strike and abortive workers' uprising crushed by government troops in the &quot;[[Radical War]]&quot; of 1820. Magistrates powers were increased to crush demonstrations by manufacturers and action by radical [[Luddite]]s.

To counter the established [[Church of England]] doctrine that the aristocratic social order was divinely ordained, radicals supported [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[Evolutionism]], a theme proclaimed by street corner agitators as well as some established scientists such as [[Robert Edmund Grant]].

===Political reform ===
Economic conditions improved after 1821 and the [[United Kingdom]] government made economic and criminal law improvements, abandoning policies of repression. In 1823 [[Jeremy Bentham]] co‐founded the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for &quot;philosophical radicals&quot;, setting out the [[utilitarian]] philosophy that right actions were to be measured in proportion to the greatest good they achieved for the greatest number. [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] elected two radicals to Parliament during the 1820s.

The [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] gained power and despite defeats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]] the [[Reform Act 1832]] was put through with the support of public outcry, mass meetings of &quot;political unions&quot; and riots in some cities. This now enfranchised the middle classes, but failed to meet radical demands. The Whigs introduced reforming measures owing much to the ideas of the philosophic radicals, abolishing slavery and in 1834 introducing [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] [[Poor Law]] reforms which were bitterly opposed by &quot;popular radicals&quot; and writers like [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Following the 1832 Reform Act the mainly aristocratic Whigs in the House of Commons were joined by a small number of [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]], as well as an increased number of middle class Whigs. By 1839 they were informally being called &quot;the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]].&quot;

This radicalism is still carried on today in the UK by the [[Liberal Democrats]], campaigning for electoral reform, an elected [[House of Lords]] and fewer constituencies. For instance, at the 2011 party spring conference [[Tim Farron]] said in a speech &quot;I joined the Liberals out of a desperate desire to see Britain run fairly, to see economic policies that served the interests of the people, especially the poorest. I joined a party that was unmistakeably a radical, social liberal, progressive, internationalist, green party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://aliberalhelping.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/my-politician-of-the-year-is-tim-farron&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chartists===
{{Main|Chartism}}
From 1836 working class Radicals unified around the [[Chartism|Chartist]] cause of electoral reform expressed in the ''People's Charter'' drawn up by six members of Parliament and six from the [[London Working Men's Association]] (associated with [[Owenite]] [[Utopian socialism]]), which called for six points: [[Universal suffrage]], equal‐sized [[election|electoral]] districts, [[secret ballot]], an end to property qualification for Parliament, pay for Members of Parliament and Annual Parliaments. Chartists also expressed economic grievances, but their mass demonstrations and petitions to parliament were unsuccessful.

Despite initial disagreements, after their failure their cause was taken up by the middle class [[Anti-Corn Law League]] founded by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]] in 1839 to oppose duties on imported grain which raised the price of food and so helped landowners at the expense of ordinary people.

===Liberal reforms===
The [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] joined with the [[Whigs (UK)|Whigs]] and [[free trade|anti-protectionist]] [[Tory]] [[Peelite]]s to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] by 1859. Demand for parliamentary reform increased by 1864 with agitation from [[John Bright]] and the [[Reform League]].

When the Liberal government led by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] introduced a modest bill for parliamentary reform, it was defeated by both Tories and reform Liberals, forcing the government to resign. The Tories under [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]] took office, and the new government decided to &quot;dish the Whigs&quot; and &quot;take a leap in the dark&quot; to take the credit for the reform. As a minority government they had to accept radical amendments, and Disraeli's [[Reform Act 1867]] almost doubled the electorate, giving the vote even to working men.

The Radicals, having been strenuous in their efforts on behalf of the working classes, earned a deeply loyal following; British trade unionists from 1874 until 1892, upon being elected to Parliament, never considered themselves to be anything other than Radicals, and were labeled [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib-Lab]] candidates. Radical trade unionists formed the basis for what later became the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

==France==
{{Main|Radical Party (France)}}
In the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] it was technically illegal in [[France]] to openly advocate republicanism until [[1848 Revolutions in France|1848]], so [[Republicanism|republicans]] usually called themselves &quot;radicals&quot; and the term ''radical'' came to mean a republican (who, by definition, supported universal manhood [[suffrage]]). From 1869 a faction, led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], calling themselves Radicals claimed to be the true heirs of the French revolutionary tradition and drifted away from the moderate republicanism of [[Léon Gambetta]]. At [[Montmartre]] in 1881 they put forward a programme of broad social reforms. At that time, Radicals located themselves on the [[far-left politics|far left]] of the political board, opposed to the &quot;[[Opportunism|Republican opportunists]]&quot; (Gambetta), the liberal [[Orléanist]]s, the [[Legitimists]] (both monarchist factions) and the [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]]s.

These radicals then formed the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (or Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party, to give it its full name) in 1901, which was the first French [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] modern party. Four years later, the socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) party was formed by the fusion of [[Jean Jaurès]]'s and [[Jules Guesde]]'s rival tendencies; and the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) was created in 1920. The Radical -Socialist Party continued to be the main party of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940), but was discredited after the war due to the role of Radical members of the National Assembly in voting for the establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]. The [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] was established after [[World War II]] to combine the politics of French radicalism with credibility derived from members' activism in the [[French resistance]].

Opposing [[Gaullism]] and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[People's Republican Movement]] (MNR), [[Pierre Mendès-France]] tried to anchor the Radicals to the left wing. Although he managed to put an end to the [[First Indochina War]] through the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]] signed in 1954 with [[North Vietnam]]'s Premier [[Pham Van Dong]], he finally left the party in 1961 to join the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU) which advocated [[workers' self-management]], while the Radical Party split into the more conservative [[Parti radical valoisien|Radical Party &quot;valoisien&quot;]], the legal successor of the Radical Party, and a faction advocating alliance with the left, named the [[Radical Party of the Left]]. The ''Parti radical valoisien'' moved to the [[centre-right]] and affiliated itself first with the pro-[[Giscard d'Estaing]] [[Union for French Democracy]], then with the [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), while the Radical Party of the Left, which claims to be the political heir of the Republican Radicals, has close ties to the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]].

==Serbia &amp; Montenegro==
{{Main|Liberalism and radicalism in Serbia}}
Radicalism had played a pivotal role in the birth and development of parliamentarism and the construction of the modern Serbian state leading to the Yugoslavian unification. The [[People's Radical Party]] formed in 1881 was the strongest political party and was in power in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] more than all others together. The 1888 Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbia that defined it as an independent nation and formalized parliamentary democracy was among the most advanced in the entire world, due to Radical contribution, it's known as ''The Radical Constitution''. In 1902 a crack had occurred in which the [[Independent Radical Party]] left and &quot;the Olde&quot; remained in the party, leading it to its considerable downfall and veering to the into [[conservatism]]. In the Yugoslavian kingdom, the Independent Radicals united with the rest of the Serbian opposition and the liberal and civic groups in the rest of the new country and formed the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Yugoslav Democratic Party]] as the central, while several Republican dissidents formed a Republican Party. The NRS had promoted Serb nationalism and put itself as the defender of Serb national interests. Democrats and Radicals were the dominant political parties, especially since the exclusion of the Communists.

In Montenegro modelled a [[People's Party (Montenegro)|People's Party]] was formed in 1907 as the first political party and remained the largest in the period of country's parliamentary history until the Yugoslavian unification. Later a [[True People's Party]] was formed, which never got widespread popular support and whose bigger part had joined the original NS, but the difference was not ideological, but opposition and support of the Crown and, sometimes, in foreign relations to Serbia (the clubbists were the crown's dissidents and supporters of the people as well as Serbia as a regional power and brotherly ally; the rightists were generally anti-democratic and autocratic monarchist, whereas also distrustful to the Serbian government's acts on the national plan).

==Continental Europe and Latin America==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Democrats 66]] --&gt;
In continental [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]], as, for instance, in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], Radicalism developed as an ideology in the 19th century to indicate those who supported, at least in theory, a [[republic]]an form of government, universal male suffrage, and, particularly, supported [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] policies. In northern and central European countries, like [[Germany]] this current is known as [[:de:Freisinn|Freisinn]] (''Free Mind'' &amp;mdash; [[German Freeminded Party]] from 1884 to 1893, then [[Eugen Richter]]'s [[Freeminded People's Party (Germany)|Freeminded People's Party]] &amp;mdash; and the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland]]). However, by the twentieth century at the latest, radicalism, which did not advocate particularly radical economic policies, had been overtaken as the principal ideology of the left by the growing popularity of [[socialism]], and had become an essentially centrist political movement (as far as &quot;radicalism&quot; survived as a distinct political ideology at all).

==Radicalism and liberalism==
:''See also [[Liberalism]]
In some countries the radical tendency is a variant of liberalism. Sometimes it is less doctrinaire and more moderate; other times it is more extreme. In [[Victorian era]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the Radicals were part of the Liberal coalition, but often rebelled when the more traditional [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] in that coalition resisted democratic reforms. In other countries, these left wing liberals have formed their own radical parties with various names, e.g. in [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]] (the [[Freisinn]]), [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;See for more information the section on ''Liberale und radikale Parteien'' in Klaus von Beyme: Parteien in westlichen Demokratien, München, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare page 255 and further in the Guide to the Political Parties of South America (Pelican Books, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that all radical parties were formed by left wing liberals. In the French political literature it is normal to make a clear separation between liberalism and radicalism in [[France]]. In Serbia both radicalism and liberalism have had their distinctiveness during the 19th century, with the Radical Party being the dominant political party throughout the entire multi-parliamentary period before the unification of Yugoslavia. It had cracked in 1903 when the Independent Radical Party had left, leaving the old People's Radical Party straying far from liberalism and into right-wing nationalism and conservatism. The Independents had created the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]], whereas the Radicals of today are a far-right political group.

But even the French radicals were aligned to the international liberal movement in the first half of the twentieth century (founded on August 29, 1924&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberal-social.org/internacional-liberal Internacional Liberal|Movimento Liberal Social - Liberalismo em Portugal], [[Social Liberal Movement]] official website&lt;/ref&gt; and dissolved in 1934),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europe-politique.eu/internationale-liberale.htm Internationale Libérale], Europe Politique | europe-politique.eu&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Entente Internationale des Partis Radicaux et des Partis Démocratiques similaires''.&lt;ref&gt;See page 1 and further of ''A sense of liberty,'' by Julie Smith, published by the Liberal International in 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
