The '''Maurya Empire''' was a [[Greater India|geographically extensive]] [[Iron Age]] [[historical power]] in [[ancient India]], ruled by the '''Mauryan dynasty''' from 321 to 185 BCE. Originating from the kingdom of [[Magadha]] in the [[Indo-Gangetic plains]] (modern [[Bihar]], eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bengal]]) in the eastern side of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the empire had its capital city at [[Pataliputra]] (modern [[Patna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The Empire was founded in 322 BCE by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], who had overthrown the [[Nanda Dynasty]] and rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western [[India]] taking advantage of the disruptions of local [[power (international)|powers]] in the wake of the withdrawal westward by [[Alexander the Great]]'s Greek and Persian armies. By 320 BCE the empire had fully occupied Northwestern India, defeating and conquering the [[satrap]]s left by Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyfiles.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Rajadhyaksha |first=Abhijit |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesFarEast/India_IronAge_Mauryas01.htm |title=The Mauryas: Chandragupta |publisher=Historyfiles.co.uk |date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an area of 5,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was one of the world's [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] in its time, and the largest ever in the Indian subcontinent. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the [[Himalayas]], and to the east stretching into what is now [[Assam]]. To the west, it conquered beyond modern [[Pakistan]], annexing [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]], south eastern parts of [[Iran]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], including the modern [[Herat Province|Herat]]&lt;ref name=&quot;historyfiles.co.uk&quot;/&gt; and [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]] provinces. The Empire was expanded into India's central and southern regions by the emperors Chandragupta and [[Bindusara]], but it excluded a small portion of unexplored tribal and forested regions near [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Orissa]]), until it was conquered by [[Ashoka]]. Its decline began 60 years after Ashoka's rule ended, and it dissolved in 185 BCE with the foundation of the [[Sunga Dynasty]] in Magadha.

Under [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]], the Mauryan Empire conquered the trans-[[Indus]] region, which was under [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Macedonian]] rule. Chandragupta then defeated the invasion led by [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]], a Greek general from Alexander's army. Under Chandragupta and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture and economic activities, all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. 

After the [[Kalinga War]], the Empire experienced half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of [[Jainism]] increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of [[Buddhism]] has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of India. Ashoka sponsored the spreading of Buddhist ideals into [[Sri Lanka]], Southeast Asia, West Asia and Mediterranean Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyfiles.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The population of the empire has been estimated to be about 50-60 million making the Mauryan Empire one of the most populous empires of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=mauryan+empire+50+million+population&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pxYLToTYLYPKrAe3g8C0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mauryan%20empire%2050%20million%20population&amp;f=false |title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra - Roger Boesche - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4jQOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=mauryan+empire+60+million+population&amp;dq=mauryan+empire+60+million+population&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ExcLTsX6Oc_OrQfk3pnLDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ |title=Encyclopedia of population - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBPW). The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' and the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] are the primary sources of written records of Mauryan times. The [[Lion Capital of Asoka]] at [[Sarnath]] has been made the national [[emblem]] of India.

==Early history==

===Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya===
{{Main|Chanakya|Chandragupta Maurya}}
{{See also|List of Mauryan rulers}}
The Maurya Empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya, with help from [[Chanakya]], a [[Brahmin]] teacher at [[Takshashila]]. According to several legends, Chanakya traveled to [[Magadha]], a kingdom that was large and militarily powerful and feared by its neighbors, but was insulted by its king [[Dhana Nanda]], of the [[Nanda Dynasty]]. Chanakya swore revenge and vowed to destroy the Nanda Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Namita2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Namita Sanjay Sugandhi | title=Between the Patterns of History: Rethinking Mauryan Imperial Interaction in the Southern Deccan | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8bdULPF4gNYC&amp;pg=PA88 | accessdate=2012-06-06 | year=2008 | publisher=ProQuest | isbn=978-0-549-74441-2 | pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the conquering armies of [[Alexander the Great]] refused to cross the [[Beas River]] and advance further eastward, deterred by the prospect of battling Magadha. Alexander returned to [[Babylon]] and re-deployed most of his troops west of the [[Indus River|Indus]] river. Soon after Alexander died in [[Babylon]] in 323 BCE, his empire fragmented, and local kings declared their independence, leaving several smaller disunited satraps.

The Greek generals [[Eudemus (general)|Eudemus]], and [[Peithon, son of Agenor|Peithon]], ruled until around 316 BCE, when Chandragupta Maurya (with the help of Chanakya, who was now his advisor) utterly defeated the Macedonians and consolidated the region under the control of his new seat of power in Magadha.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyfiles.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Chandragupta Maurya's rise to power is shrouded in mystery and controversy. On the one hand, a number of ancient Indian accounts, such as the drama ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' (''Poem of Rakshasa'' – ''Rakshasa'' was the prime minister of Magadha) by Visakhadatta, describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the Nanda family. A [[kshatriya]] tribe known as the [[Maurya]]'s are referred to in the earliest Buddhist texts, [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]. However, any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence. Chandragupta first emerges in Greek accounts as &quot;Sandrokottos&quot;. As a young man he is said to have met Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;:&quot;Androcottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth.&quot; Plutarch 62-3 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&amp;layout=&amp;loc=62.1 Plutarch 62-3]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have met the Nanda king, angered him, and made a narrow escape.&lt;ref&gt;:&quot;He was of humble origin, but was pushing to acquiring the throne by the superior power of the mind. When after having offensed the king of Nanda by his insolence, he was comdemned to death by the king, he was saved by the speed of his own feet... He gathered bandits and invited Indian to a change of rule.&quot; Justin XV.4.15 &quot;Fuit hic humili quidem genere natus, sed ad regni potestatem maiestate numinis inpulsus. Quippe cum procacitate sua Nandrum regem offendisset, interfici a rege iussus salutem pedum ceieritate quaesierat. (Ex qua fatigatione cum somno captus iaceret, leo ingentis formae ad dormientem accessit sudoremque profluentem lingua ei detersit expergefactumque blande reliquit. Hoc prodigio primum ad spem regni inpulsus) contractis latronibus Indos ad nouitatem regni sollicitauit.&quot; [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte15.html Justin XV.4.15]&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya's original intentions were to train a guerilla army under Chandragupta's command. The Mudrarakshasa of Visakhadutta as well as the Jaina work Parisishtaparvan talk of Chandragupta's alliance with the Himalayan king Parvatka, sometimes identified with Porus (Sir John Marshall &quot;Taxila&quot;, p18, and al.).&lt;ref&gt;

They were located in Herat/Aria according to Dr Moti Chandra and were an earlier branch of the Hunas (See: Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mahābhārata: Upāyana Parva, 1945, p 66, Dr Moti Chandra; Also: Studies in the Geography of Ancient and Medieval India, 1971, p 33, Dr D. C.

===Conquest of Magadha===
{{Main|Chandragupta Maurya|Nanda Dynasty|Magadha}}
Chanakya encouraged Chandragupta Maurya and his army to take over the throne of Magadha. Using his intelligence network, Chandragupta gathered many young men from across Magadha and other provinces, men upset over the corrupt and oppressive rule of king Dhana, plus resources necessary for his army to fight a long series of battles. These men included the former general of Taxila, other accomplished students of Chanakya, the representative of King Porus of Kakayee, his son Malayketu, and the rulers of small states.

Preparing to invade Pataliputra, Maurya hatched a plan. A battle was announced and the Magadhan army was drawn from the city to a distant battlefield to engage Maurya's forces. Maurya's general and spies meanwhile bribed the corrupt general of Nanda. He also managed to create an atmosphere of civil war in the kingdom, which culminated in the death of the heir to the throne. Chanakya managed to win over popular sentiment. Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Magadha dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha. Rakshasa became Chandragupta's chief advisor, and Chanakya assumed the position of an elder statesman.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Chandragupta Maurya==
{{Main|Chandragupta Maurya}}
Chandragupta campaigned against the Macedonians when [[Seleucus I]]  Nicator, in the process of creating the [[Seleucid Empire]] out of the eastern conquests of Alexander the Great, tried to reconquer the northwestern parts of India in 305 BCE. Seleucus failed ([[Seleucid–Mauryan war]]), but the two rulers finally concluded a peace treaty: a marital treaty ([[Epigamia]]) was concluded, in which the Greeks offered their Princess for alliance and help from him.  Chandragupta snatched  the satrapies of [[Paropamisade]] ([[Kambojas|Kamboja]] and [[Gandhara]]), [[Arachosia]] ([[Kandhahar]]) and [[Gedrosia]] ([[Baluchistan (region)|Balochistan]]), and [[Seleucus I]] received 500 [[war elephants]] that were to have a decisive role in his victory against western [[Hellenistic]] kings at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301 BCE. Diplomatic relations were established and several Greeks, such as the historian [[Megasthenes]], [[Deimakos]] and [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]] resided at the Mauryan court.

Chandragupta established a strong centralized state with a complex administration at Pataliputra, which, according to Megasthenes, was ''&quot;surrounded by a wooden wall pierced by 64 gates and 570 towers— (and) rivaled the splendors of contemporaneous [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] sites such as [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]].&quot;'' Chandragupta's son [[Bindusara]] extended the rule of the Mauryan empire towards southern India. He also had a Greek ambassador at his court, named [[Deimachus]] ([[Strabo]] 1–70).

Megasthenes describes a disciplined multitude under Chandragupta, who live simply, honestly, and do not know writing:
:&quot;The Indians all live frugally, especially when in camp. They dislike a great undisciplined multitude, and consequently they observe good order. Theft is of very rare occurrence. Megasthenes says that those who were in the camp of Sandrakottos, wherein lay 400,000 men, found that the thefts reported on any one day did not exceed the value of two hundred drachmae, and this among a people who have no written laws, but are ignorant of writing, and must therefore in all the business of life trust to memory. They live, nevertheless, happily enough, being simple in their manners and frugal. They never drink wine except at sacrifices. Their beverage is a liquor composed from rice instead of barley, and their food is principally a rice-pottage.&quot; Strabo XV. i. 53–56, quoting Megasthenes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm Source:Megasthenes fragment XXVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bindusara==
{{Main|Bindusara}}
Bindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and his queen Durdhara. During his reign, the empire expanded southwards.  According to the ''Rajavalikatha'' a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. According to a legend mentioned in the [[Jain]] texts, Chandragupta's [[Guru]] and advisor [[Chanakya]] used to feed the emperor with small doses of poison to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts by the enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day, Chandragupta not knowing about poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife queen Durdhara who was 7 days away from delivery. The queen not immune to the poison collapsed and died within few minutes. Chanakya entered the room the very time she collapsed, and in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took the baby out, by that time a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head due to which child got a permanent blueish spot (a &quot;[[bindu]]&quot;) on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named &quot;Bindusara&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bindusara, just 22 year-old, inherited a large empire that consisted of what is now, Northern, Central and Eastern parts of [[India]] along with parts of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]]. Bindusara extended this empire to the southern part of India, as far as what is now known as [[Karnataka]]. He brought sixteen states under the Mauryan Empire and thus  conquered almost all of the Indian peninsula (he is said to have conquered the 'land between the two seas' - the peninsular region between the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]]). Bindusara didn't conquer the friendly [[Dravidian race|Dravidian]] kingdoms of the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]], ruled by King [[Ilamcetcenni]], the [[Pandyas]], and [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]]. Apart from these southern states, [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (the modern Orissa) was the only kingdom in India that didn't form the part of Bindusara's empire. It was later conquered by his son [[Ashoka]], who served as the viceroy of [[Ujjaini]] during his father's reign.

Bindusara's life has not been documented as well as that of his father Chandragupta or of his son Ashoka. Chanakya continued to serve as prime minister during his reign. According to the mediaeval Tibetan scholar Taranatha who visited India, Chanakya helped Bindusara &quot;to destroy the nobles and kings of the sixteen kingdoms and thus to become absolute master of the territory between the eastern and western oceans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;P.109 ''A brief history of India'' by Alain Daniélou, Kenneth Hurry&lt;/ref&gt; During his rule, the citizens of [[Taxila]] revolted twice. The reason for the first revolt was the [[maladministration]] of [[Suseema]], his eldest son. The reason for the second revolt is unknown, but Bindusara could not suppress it in his lifetime. It was crushed by Ashoka after Bindusara's death.

Ambassadors from the [[Seleucid Empire]] (such as [[Deimachus]]) and [[Egypt]] visited his courts. He maintained good relations with the Hellenic World. 

Unlike his father Chandragupta (who was a follower of [[Jainism]]), Bindusara believed in the [[Ajivika]] sect. Bindusara's guru Pingalavatsa (alias Janasana) was a Brahmin&lt;ref&gt;P. 138 and P. 146 ''History and doctrines of the Ājīvikas: a vanished Indian religion'' by Arthur Llewellyn Basham&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ajivika sect. Bindusara's wife, Queen Subhadrangi (alias Queen Aggamahesi) was a Brahmin&lt;ref&gt;P. 24 ''Buddhism in comparative light'' by Anukul Chandra Banerjee&lt;/ref&gt; also of the Ajivika sect from Champa (present Bhagalpur district). Bindusara is accredited with giving several grants to Brahmin monasteries (''Brahmana-bhatto'').&lt;ref&gt;P. 171 ''Asoka and his inscriptions, Volume 1'' by Beni Madhab Barua, Ishwar Nath Topa&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bindusara died in 272 BCE (some records say 268 BCE) and was succeeded by his son [[Ashoka the Great]].

==Ashoka the Great==

{{Main|Ashoka the Great}}

Chandragupta's grandson i.e., Bindusara's son was Ashokavardhan Maurya who was also known as Ashoka or Ashoka The Great (ruled 273- 232 BCE).

As a young prince, Ashoka was a brilliant commander who crushed revolts in Ujjain and Taxila. As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (1842 CE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of [[Buddhism]], and renounced war and violence.

Ashoka implemented principles of ''[[ahimsa]]'' by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labor and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40 years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.

The [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as [[Afghanistan]] and as far south as Andhra ([[Nellore District]]), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and one in both Greek and [[Aramaic]]. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, [[Kambojas]], and [[Gandhara]]s as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world at the time such as ''Amtiyoko'' ([[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]), ''Tulamaya'' ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]), ''Amtikini'' ([[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]]), ''Maka'' ([[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]]) and ''Alikasudaro'' ([[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism. The Edicts also accurately locate their territory &quot;600 yojanas away&quot; (a yojanas being about 7 miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000 miles).&lt;ref&gt;[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, translation S. Dhammika.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the West, it went as far as [[Kandahar]] (where the Edicts were written in Greek and [[Aramaic]]), and bordered the contemporary Hellenistic metropolis of [[Ai Khanoum]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:MauryanRingstone.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Mauryan ringstone, with standing goddess. Northwest Pakistan. 3rd century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]
The Empire was divided into four provinces, which one of the four, look like a giant crescents. with the imperial capital at [[Pataliputra]]. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are [[Tosali]] (in the east), [[Ujjain]] (in the west), [[Suvarnagiri]] (in the south), and [[Taxila]] (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the ''Kumara'' (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The ''kumara'' was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his ''Mantriparishad'' (Council of Ministers).

Historians theorize that the organization of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by [[Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]]: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been the largest standing army of its time{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, and 9,000 war elephants. A vast [[espionage]] system collected intelligence for both internal and external security purposes. Having renounced offensive warfare and expansionism, Ashoka nevertheless continued to maintain this large army, to protect the Empire and instill stability and peace across West and South Asia.

==Economy==
[[File:MauryanCoin.JPG|left|thumb|Silver punch mark coin of the '''Mauryan empire''', with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.]]
For the first time in South Asia, political unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the ''Arthashastra''. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to newfound political unity and internal peace.

[[File:MauryanCastCopperCoinLate3rdCenturyBCE.jpg|thumb|left|Mauryan cast copper coin. Late 3rd century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]
Under the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The [[Khyber Pass]], on the modern boundary of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the [[Malay peninsula]] into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The Empire was enriched further with an exchange of scientific knowledge and technology with Europe and West Asia. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.

In many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to [[corporation]]s. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] [[University of Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Economic history of India]].)

==Religion==

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism]] was the major religion at the time of inception of the empire{{fact|date=November 2012}}, Hindu priests and ministers used to be an important part of the emperor's court, e.g. [[Chanakya]]. James Hastings writes that they are devotees of Narayana ([[Vishnu]]), although Shilanka speaking of the Ekandandins in another connection identifies them as Shaivas (devotees of [[Shiva]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;P. 266 ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 1'' By James Hastings&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar James Hastings identifies the name &quot;Mankhaliputta&quot; or &quot;Mankhali&quot; with the ''bamboo staff''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Scholar Jitendra N. Banerjea compares them to the [[Pasupata]]s [[Shaivism|Shaivas]].&lt;ref&gt;P. 92 ''Paurānic and Tāntric Religion: Early Phase'' By Jitendra Nath Banerjea&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, Charpentier, believes that the Ajivikas worshiped Shiva before Makkhali Goshala.&lt;ref&gt;P. 212 ''Age of the Nandas and Mauryas'' By K. A. Nilakanta Sastri&lt;/ref&gt; As Chanakya wrote in his text ''Chanakya Niti'', &quot;Humbly bowing down before the almighty Lord Sri Vishnu, the Lord of the three worlds, I recite maxims of the science of political ethics (niti) selected from the various satras (scriptures)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduism.co.za/chanakya.htm Chanakya at Hinduism.co.za]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after embracing Buddhism, [[Ashoka]] retained the membership of Hindu Brahmana priests and ministers in his court. Mauryan society began embracing the philosophy of ''[[ahimsa]]'', and given the increased prosperity and improved law enforcement, crime and internal conflicts reduced dramatically. Also greatly discouraged was the [[caste system]] and orthodox discrimination, as Mauryans began to absorb the ideals and values of Jain and Buddhist teachings along with traditional [[Vedic| Vedic Hindu]] teachings.

===Buddhism===
Ashoka initially practiced Hinduism but later embraced [[Buddhism]]; following the [[Kalinga War]], he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the ''Arthashastra'' on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son [[Mahinda]] and daughter [[Sanghamitta]] to [[Sri Lanka]], whose king [[Tissa (King)|Tissa]] was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to [[West Asia]], [[Greece]] and [[South East Asia]], and commissioned the construction of monasteries, schools and publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India i.e. [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]], and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[North Asia]] including [[Siberia]]. Ashoka helped convene the [[Buddhist Councils|Third Buddhist Council]] of India and South Asia's Buddhist orders, near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan empire &lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya embraced [[Jainism]] after retiring. At an older age, Chandragupta renounced his throne and material possessions to join a wandering group of Jain monks. Chandragupta was a disciple of [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]]. It is said that in his last days, he observed the rigorous but self-purifying Jain ritual of [[santhara]] i.e. fast unto death, at [[Shravana Belgola]] in [[Karnataka]]. However, his successor, Emperor Bindusara, was a follower of a Hindu ascetic movement, [[Ājīvika]] and distanced himself from Jain and Buddhist movements. [[Samprati]], the grandson of [[Ashoka]] also embraced Jainism. Samrat Samprati was influenced by the teachings of Jain monk [[Arya Suhasti Suri]] and he is known to have built 125,000 [[derasar]]s across India. Some of them are still found in towns of Ahmedabad, Viramgam, Ujjain &amp; Palitana. It is also said that just like Ashoka, Samprati sent messengers &amp; preachers to Greece, Persia &amp; middle-east for the spread of Jainism. But to date no research has been done in this area.
Thus, Jainism became a vital force under the Mauryan Rule. [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] and [[Samprati]] are credited for the spread of Jainism in [[South India]]. Lakhs of temples &amp; stupas were erected during their reign. But due to lack of royal patronage &amp; its strict principles, along with the rise of [[Shankaracharya]] and [[Ramanuja]], Jainism, once the major religion of southern India, began to decline.

==Architectural remains==
{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka}}

Architectural remains of the Maurya period are rather few. Remains of a [[hypostyle]] building with about 80 columns of a height of about 10 meters have been found in [[Kumhrar]], 5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Patna]] Railway station, and is one of the very few sites that has been connected to the rule of the Mauryas. The style is rather reminiscent of Persian Achaemenid architecture.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique&quot;, p23&lt;/ref&gt;

The grottoes of [[Barabar Caves]], are another example of Mauryan architecture, especially the decorated front of the Lomas Rishi grotto. These were offered by the Mauryas to the Buddhist sect of the Ājīvikas.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique&quot;, p22&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread example of Maurya architecture are the Pillars of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==Natural history in the times of the Mauryas==
[[File:Yakshini.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yakshini]], 3rd century BCE]]

The protection of animals in India became serious business by the time of the Maurya dynasty; being the first empire to provide a unified political entity in India, the attitude of the Mauryas towards forests, its denizens and fauna in general is of interest.

The Mauryas firstly looked at forests as a resource. For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of [[Alexander]]'s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWH4&quot;&gt;Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|On the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The Office of the Chief Elephant Forrester should with the help of guards protect the elephants in any terrain. The slaying of an elephant is punishable by death..|[[Arthashastra]]}}

The Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers, for skins. Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.

The Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or ''aranyaca'' to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWH5&quot;&gt;Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history to advocate conservation measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king's example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:&lt;ref name=&quot;IWH5&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|Our king killed very few animals.|[[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict on Fifth Pillar]]}}

However, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWH5&quot;/&gt;

==Contacts with the Hellenistic world==
[[File:MauryanStatuette2ndCenturyBCE.jpg|thumb|Mauryan Statuette, 2nd Century BCE.]]

===Foundation of the Empire===
Relations with the Hellenistic world may have started from the very beginning of the Maurya Empire. [[Plutarch]] reports that Chandragupta Maurya met with [[Alexander the Great]], probably around [[Taxila]] in the northwest:

:&quot;Sandrocottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth&quot;. Plutarch 62-3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243&amp;layout=&amp;loc=62.1 Plutarch 62-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconquest of the Northwest (c. 310 BCE)===
Chandragupta ultimately occupied Northwestern India, in the territories formerly ruled by the Greeks, where he fought the satraps (described as &quot;Prefects&quot; in Western sources) left in place after Alexander (Justin), among whom may have been [[Eudemus (general)|Eudemus]], ruler in the western Punjab until his departure in 317 BCE or [[Peithon, son of Agenor]], ruler of the Greek colonies along the Indus until his departure for [[Babylon]] in 316 BCE.

:&quot;India, after the death of Alexander, had assassinated his prefects, as if shaking the burden of servitude. The author of this liberation was Sandracottos, but he had transformed liberation in servitude after victory, since, after taking the throne, he himself oppressed the very people he has liberated from foreign domination&quot; Justin XV.4.12–13&lt;ref&gt;&quot;(Transitum deinde in Indiam fecit), quae post mortem Alexandri, ueluti ceruicibus iugo seruitutis excusso, praefectos eius occiderat. Auctor libertatis Sandrocottus fuerat, sed titulum libertatis post uictoriam in seruitutem uerterat ; 14 siquidem occupato regno populum quem ab externa dominatione uindicauerat ipse seruitio premebat.&quot; [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/trad15.html Justin XV.4.12–13]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;Later, as he was preparing war against the prefects of Alexander, a huge wild elephant went to him and took him on his back as if tame, and he became a remarkable fighter and war leader. Having thus acquired royal power, Sandracottos possessed India at the time Seleucos was preparing future glory.&quot; Justin XV.4.19&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Molienti deinde bellum aduersus praefectos Alexandri elephantus ferus infinitae magnitudinis ultro se obtulit et ueluti domita mansuetudine eum tergo excepit duxque belli et proeliator insignis fuit. Sic adquisito regno Sandrocottus ea tempestate, qua Seleucus futurae magnitudinis fundamenta iaciebat, Indiam possidebat.&quot; [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/trad15.html Justin XV.4.19]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict and alliance with Seleucus (305 BCE)===
[[File:SeleucosCoin.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Silver coin of [[Seleucus I Nicator]], who fought Chandragupta Maurya, and later made an alliance with him.]]
[[Seleucus I Nicator]], the Macedonian [[satrap]] of the [[Asia]]n portion of Alexander's former empire, conquered and put under his own authority eastern territories as far as Bactria and the Indus ([[Appian]], History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55), until in 305 BCE he entered in a confrontation with Chandragupta:

:&quot;Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, Tapouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia after that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus&quot;. [[Appian]], History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55&lt;ref name=&quot;livius.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_11.html Appian, History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no accounts of the conflict remain, it is clear that Seleucus fared poorly against the Indian Emperor as he failed in conquering any territory, and in fact, was forced to surrender much that was already his. Regardless, Seleucus and Chandragupta ultimately reached a settlement and through a treaty sealed in 305 BCE, Seleucus, according to Strabo, ceded a number of territories to Chandragupta, including southern [[Afghanistan]] and parts of [[Iran|Persia]].

Accordingly, Seleucus obtained five hundred war elephants, a military asset which would play a decisive role at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301 BCE.

====Marital alliance====

It is generally thought that Chandragupta married [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus's]] daughter, or a Greek [[Seleucid Empire|Macedonian]] [[princess]], a gift from Seleucus to formalize an alliance.  In a return gesture, Chandragupta sent 500 [[war elephant]]s,&lt;ref name=Majumdar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient India, (Kachroo ,p.196)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Imperial Gazetteer of India, (Hunter,p.167)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The evolution of man and society, (Darlington ,p.223)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Tarn (1940). &quot;Two Notes on Seleucid History: 1. Seleucus' 500 Elephants, 2. Tarmita&quot;, ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''60''', p. 84-94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partha Sarathi Bose (2003). ''Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy''. Gotham Books. ISBN 1-59240-053-1.&lt;/ref&gt; a military asset which would play a decisive role at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 302 BCE.  In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, [[Megasthenes]], to Chandragupta, and later [[Deimakos]] to his son [[Bindusara]], at the Mauryan court at [[Pataliputra]] (modern [[Patna]] in [[Bihar state]]). Later [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the ruler of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and contemporary of [[Ashoka the Great]], is also recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] as having sent an ambassador named [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]] to the Mauryan court.&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de&quot;&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.21 Pliny the Elder, &quot;The Natural History&quot;, Chap. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholarship asserts that Chandragupta received vast territory west of the Indus, including the [[Hindu Kush]], modern day [[Afghanistan]], and the [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Arthur Smith|Vincent A. Smith]] (1998). ''Asoka''. Asian Educational Services.

{{cquote|&quot;He (Seleucus) crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Maurya], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship.&quot; | [[Appian]]|''History of Rome'', The Syrian Wars [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_11.html 55]}}

The treaty on &quot;[[Epigamia]]&quot; implies lawful marriage between Greeks and Indians was recognized at the State level, although it is unclear whether it occurred among dynastic rulers or common people, or both{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. .

====Exchange of ambassadors====
Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, [[Megasthenes]], to Chandragupta, and later [[Deimakos]] to his son [[Bindusara]], at the Mauryan court at [[Pataliputra]] (Modern [[Patna]] in [[Bihar state]]). Later [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the ruler of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and contemporary of Ashoka, is also recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] as having sent an ambassador named [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]] to the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] court.&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de&quot;/&gt;

====Exchange of presents====
Classical sources have also recorded that following their treaty, Chandragupta and Seleucus exchanged presents, such as when Chandragupta sent various [[aphrodisiac]]s to Seleucus:
:&quot;And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of wondrous efficacy in such matters [as to make people more amorous]. And Phylarchus confirms him, by reference to some of the presents which Sandrakottus, the king of the Indians, sent to Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love&quot; [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], &quot;[[The deipnosophists]]&quot; Book I, chapter 32&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature000701860036&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide Ath. Deip. I.32]&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Bindusara]] 'Amitraghata' (Slayer of Enemies) also is recorded in Classical sources as having exchanged present with [[Antiochus I]]:
:&quot;But dried figs were so very much sought after by all men (for really, as [[Aristophanes]] says, &quot;There's really nothing nicer than dried figs&quot;), that even Amitrochates, the king of the Indians, wrote to [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus]], entreating him (it is [[Hegesander]] who tells this story) to buy and send him some sweet wine, and some dried figs, and a [[sophist]]; and that Antiochus wrote to him in answer, &quot;The dry figs and the sweet wine we will send you; but it is not lawful for a sophist to be sold in Greece&quot; [[Athenaeus]], &quot;[[Deipnosophistae]]&quot; XIV.67&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=goto&amp;id=Literature.AthV3&amp;isize=M&amp;page=1044 Athenaeus, &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; XIV.67]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek population in India===
Greek population apparently remained in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under Ashoka's rule. In his [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, some of them written in Greek, Ashoka describes that Greek population within his realm converted to Buddhism:
:&quot;Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the [[Andhra]]s and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]]&quot;. [[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]] (S. Dhammika).

[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|right|Bilingual edict ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by king Ashoka, from [[Kandahar]]. [[Kabul]] Museum. (Click image for translation).]]
Fragments of Edict 13 have been found in Greek, and a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic has been discovered in [[Kandahar]]. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word [[Eusebeia]] (&quot;[[Piety]]&quot;) as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous &quot;[[Dharma]]&quot; of his other Edicts written in [[Prakrit]]:
:&quot;Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (''εὐσέβεια'', [[Eusebeia]]) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting. And if some (were) intemperate, they have ceased from their intemperance as was in their power; and obedient to their father and mother and to the elders, in opposition to the past also in the future, by so acting on every occasion, they will live better and more happily&quot;. (Trans. by G.P. Carratelli [http://www.afghanan.net/afghanistan/mauryans.htm])

===Buddhist missions to the West (c. 250 BCE)===
[[File:Asokanpillar.jpg|thumb|200px|Front view of the single lion capital in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].]]
Also, in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], Ashoka mentions the Hellenistic kings of the period as a recipient of his [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] proselytism, although no Western historical record of this event remain:
:&quot;The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400–9,600 km) away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]]).&quot; ([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).

Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of [[herbal medicine]], for men and animals, in their territories:
:&quot;Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's [Ashoka's] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, the Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as [[Tamraparni]] and where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals. Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available, I have had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animals&quot;. [[Edicts of Ashoka|2nd Rock Edict]]

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pāli|Pali]] sources as leading Greek (&quot;[[Yona]]&quot;) Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the Mahavamsa [http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chapters.html Click chapter XII]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Subhagsena and Antiochos III (206 BCE)===
[[Sophagasenus]] was an Indian [[Mauryan]] ruler of the 3rd century BCE, described in ancient Greek sources, and named Subhagsena or Subhashsena in [[Prakrit]]. His name is mentioned in the list of Mauryan princes{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, and also in the list of the Yadava dynasty, as a descendant of Pradyumna. He may have been a grandson of [[Ashoka]], or [[Kunala]], the son of Ashoka. He ruled an area south of the [[Hindu Kush]], possibly in [[Gandhara]]. [[Antiochos III]], the [[Seleucid]] king, after having made peace with [[Euthydemus II|Euthydemus]] in [[Bactria]], went to India in 206 BCE and is said to have renewed his friendship with the Indian king there:

:&quot;He (Antiochus) crossed the Caucasus and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him&quot;.

==Decline==
Ashoka was followed for 50 years by a succession of weaker kings. [[Brihadrata]], the last ruler of the [[Mauryan dynasty]], held territories that had shrunk considerably from the time of emperor [[Ashoka]], although he still upheld the Buddhist faith.

===Sunga coup (185 BCE)===
[[Brihadrata]] was assassinated in 185 BCE during a military parade, by the commander-in-chief of his guard, the [[Brahmin]] general [[Pusyamitra Sunga]], who then took over the throne and established the [[Sunga dynasty]]. Buddhist records such as the [[Asokavadana]] write that the assassination of Brhadrata and the rise of the Sunga empire led to a wave of persecution for [[Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Ashokavadana]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Sir John Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Marshall, &quot;A Guide to Sanchi&quot;, Eastern Book House, 1990, ISBN 81-85204-32-2, pg.38&lt;/ref&gt; Pusyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Sunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Lamotte: History of Indian Buddhism, Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romila Thapar]],&lt;ref&gt;Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200&lt;/ref&gt; among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favor of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.

===Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BCE)===
{{Main|Indo-Greek kingdom}}
The fall of the Mauryas left the [[Khyber Pass]] unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The [[Greco-Bactrian]] king, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and Pakistan around 180 BCE, forming the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings [[Menander I|Menander]] became a famous figure of Buddhism, he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of [[Sialkot]]. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the [[Sunga]]s, [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Kalinga (India)|Kalingas]] are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed [[Indo-Scythians]], brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70 BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and Gujarat.

===Reasons===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
The decline of the Maurya Dynasty was rather rapid after the death of Ashoka/Asoka. One obvious reason for it was the succession of weak kings. Another immediate cause was the partition of the Empire into two. Had not the partition taken place, the Greek invasions could have been held back giving a chance to the Mauryas to re-establish some degree of their previous power.
Regarding the decline much has been written. Haraprasad Sastri contends that the revolt by Pushyamitra was the result of brahminical reaction against the pro-Buddhist policies of Ashoka and pro-Jaina policies of his successors. Basing themselves on this thesis, some maintain the view that brahminical reaction was responsible for the decline because of the following reasons.
#Prohibition of the slaughter of animals displeased the Brahmins as animal sacrifices were esteemed by them.
#The book Divyavadana refers to the persecution of Buddhists by Pushyamitra Sunga.
#Asoka's claim that he exposed the Budheveas (Brahmins) as false gods shows that Ashoka was not well disposed towards Brahmins.
#The capture of power by Pushyamitra Sunga shows the triumph of Brahmins.
All of these four points can be easily refuted.
#Asoka's compassion towards animals was not an overnight decision. Repulsion of animal sacrifices grew over a long period of time. Even Brahmins gave it up.
#The book Divyavadana cannot be relied upon since it was during the time of Pushyamitra Sunga that the Sanchi and Barhut stupas were completed. The impression of the persecution of Buddhism was probably created by Menander's invasion, since he was a Buddhist.
#The word 'budheva' is misinterpreted because this word is to be taken in the context of some other phrase. Viewed like this, the word has nothing to do with brahminism.
#The victory of Pushyamitra Sunga clearly shows that the last of the Mauryas was an incompetent ruler since he was overthrown in the very presence of his army, and this had nothing to do with brahminical reaction against Asoka's patronage of Buddhism. Moreover, the very fact that a Brahmin was the commander in chief of the Mauryan ruler proves that the Mauryas and the Brahmins were on good terms.

After all, the distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism in India was purely sectarian and never more than the difference between saivism and vaishnavism. The exclusiveness of religious doctrines is a Semitic conception, which was unknown to India for a long time. Buddha himself was looked upon in his lifetime and afterwards as a Hindu saint and avatar and his followers were but another sect in the great Aryan tradition. Ashoka was a Buddhist in the same way as Harsha was a Budhist, or Kumarapala was a Jain. But in the view of the people of the day he was a Hindu monarch following one of the recognized sects. His own inscriptions bear ample withness to the fact. While his doctrines follow the middle path, his gifts are to the brahmibns, sramansa (Buddhist priests) and others equally. His own name of adoption is Devanam Priya, the beloved of the gods. Which gods? Surely the gods of the Aryan religion. Buddhism had no gods of its own. The idea that Ashoka was a kind of Buddhist Constantine declearing himself against paganism is a complete misreading of India conditions. Asoka was essentially a Hindu, as indeed was the founder of the sect to which he belonged.

Raychaudhury too rebuts the arguments of Sastri. The empire had shrunk considerably and there was no revolution. Killing the Mauryan King while he was reviewing the army points to a palace coup d'état not a revolution. The organization were ready to accept any one who could promise a more efficient organisation. Also if Pushyamitra was really a representative of brahminical reaction he neighbouting kings would have definitely given him assistance.

The argument that the empire became effete because of Asokan policies is also very thin. All the evidence suggests that Asoka was a stern monarch although his reign witnessed only a single campaign. He was shrewd enough in retaining Kalinga although he expressed his remorse. Well he was wordly-wise to enslave and-and-half lakh sudras of Kalinga and bring them to the Magadha region to cut forests and cultivate land. More than this his tours of the empire were not only meant for the sake of piety but also for keeping an eye on the centrifugal tendencies of the empire. Which addressing the tribal people Asoka expressed his willingness to for given. More draconian was Ashoka's message to the forest tribes who were warned of the power which he possessed. This view of Raychoudhury on the pacifism of the State cannot be substantiated.

Apart from these two major writers there is a third view as expressed by kosambi. He based his arguments that unnccessary measures were taken up to increase tax and the punch-marked coins of the period show evidence of debasement. This contention too cannot be up held. It is quite possible that debased coins began to circulate during the period of the later Mauryas. On the other hand the debasement may also indicate that there was an increased demand for silver in relation to goods leading to the silver content of the coins being reduced. More important point is the fact that the material remains of the post-Asokan era do not suggest any pressure on the economy. Instead the economy prospered as shown by archaeological evidence at Hastinapura and Sisupalqarh. The reign of Asoka was an asset to the economy. The unification of the country under single efficient administration the organization and increase in communications meant the development of trade as well as an opening of many new commercial interest. In the post - Asokan period surplus wealth was used by the rising commercial classes to decorate religious buildings. The sculpture at Barhut and Sanchi and the Deccan caves was the contribution of this new bourgeoisie.

Still another view regarding of the decline of Mauryas was that the coup of Pushyamitra was a peoples' revolt against Mauryans oppression and a rejection of the Maurya adoption of foreign ideas, as far interest in Mauryan Art.

This argument is based on the view that Sunga art (Sculpture at Barhut and Sanchi) is more earthy and in the folk tradition that Maruyan art. This is more stretching the argument too far. The character of Sunga art changed because it served a different purpose and its donors belonged to different social classes. Also, Sunga art conformed more to the folk traditions because Buddhism itself had incorporated large elements of popular cults and because the donors of this art, many of whom may have been artisans, were culturally more in the mainstream of folk tradition.

One more reasoning to support the popular revolt theory is based on Asoka's ban on the samajas. Asoka did ban festive meetings and discouraged eating of meat. These too might have entagonised the population but it is doubtful whether these prohibitions were strictly enforced. The above argument (people's revolt) also means that Asoka's policy was continued by his successors also, an assumption not confirmed by historical data. Further more, it is unlikely that there was sufficient national consciousness among the varied people of the Mauryan empire. It is also argued by these theorists that Asokan policy in all its details was continued by the later Mauryas, which is not a historical fact.

Still another argument that is advanced in favour of the idea of revolt against the Mauryas is that the land tax under the Mauryas was one-quarter, which was very burden some to the cultivator. But historical evidence shows something else. The land tax varied from region to region according to the fertility of the soil and the availability of water. The figure of one quarter stated by Magasthenes probably referred only to the fertile and well-watered regions around Pataliputra.

Thus the decline of the Mauryan empire cannot be satisfactorily explained by referring to Military inactivity, Brahmin resentment, popular uprising or economic pressure. The causes of the decline were more fundamental. The organization of administration and the concept of the State were such that they could be sustained by only by kings of considerably personal ability. After the death of Asoka there was definitely a weakening at the center particularly after the division of the empire, which inevitably led to the breaking of provinces from the Mauryan rule.

Also, it should be borne in mind that all the officials owed their loyalty to the king and not to the State. This meant that a change of king could result in change of officials leading to the demoralization of the officers. Mauryas had no system of ensuring the continuation of well-planned bureaucracy.

The next important weakness of the Mauryan Empire was its extreme centralization and the virtual monopoly of all powers by the king. There was a total absence of any advisory institution representing public opinion. That is why the Mauryas depended greatly on the espionage system. Added to this lack of representative institutions there was no distinction between the executive and the judiciary of the government. An incapable king may use the officers either for purposes of oppression or fail to use it for good purpose. And as the successors of Asoka happened to be weak, the empire inevitably declined.

Added to these two factors, there is no conception of national unity of political consciousness. It is clear from the fact that even the resistance against the Greeks as the hated miecchas was not an organized one. The only resistance was that of the local rulers who were afraid of losing their newly acquired territory. It is significant that when Porus was fighting Alexander, or when Subhagasena was paying tribute to Antiochus, they were doing so as isolated rulers in the northwest of India. They had no support from Pataliputra, nor are they even mentioned in any Indian sources as offering resistance to the hated Yavanas. Even the heroic Porus, who, enemy though he was, won the admiration of the Greeks, is left unrecorded in Indian sources.

Another associated point of great importance is the fact that the Mauryan Empire which was highly centralized and autocratic was the first and last one of its kind. If the Mauryan Empire did not survive for long, it could be because of the failure of the successors of Asoka to hold on to the principles that could make success of such an empire. Further, the Mauryan empire and the philosophy of the empire was not in tune with the spirit of the time because Aryanism and brahminism was very much there. According to the Brahmin or Aryan philosophy, the king was only an upholder of dharma, but never the crucial or architecture factor influencing the whole of life. In other words, the sentiment of the people towards the political factor, that is the State was never established in India. Such being the reality, when the successors of Asoka failed to make use of the institution and the thinking that was needed to make a success of a centralized political authority. The Mauryan Empire declined without anyone's regret.

Other factors of importance that contributed to the decline and lack of national unity were the ownership of land and inequality of economic levels. Land could frequently change hands. Fertility wise the region of the Ganges was more prosperous than northern Deccan. Mauryan administration was not fully tuned to meet the existing disparities in economic activity. Had the southern region been more developed, the empire could have witnessed economic homogeneity.

Also the people of the sub-continent were not of uniform cultural level. The sophisticated cities and the trade centers were a great contrast to the isolated village communities. All these differences naturally led to the economic and political structures being different from region to region. It is also a fact that even the languages spoken were varied. The history of a sub-continent and their casual relationships. The causes of the decline of the Mauryan empire must, in large part, be attributed to top heavy administration where authority was entirely in the hands of a few persons while national consciousness was unknown.
