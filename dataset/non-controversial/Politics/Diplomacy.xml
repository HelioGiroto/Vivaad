[[File:UN HQ 157652121 5b5979da9e2.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[United Nations]], with its [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] in [[New York City]], is the largest international diplomatic organization.]]

'''Diplomacy''' (from Latin ''diploma'', meaning an official document, which in turn derives from the Greek {{lang|grc|δίπλωμα}}, meaning a folded paper/document) is the art and practice of conducting [[negotiation]]s between representatives of groups or states. It usually refers to international diplomacy, the conduct of [[international relations]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ron&quot;&gt;Ronald Peter Barston, ''Modern diplomacy'', Pearson Education, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; through the intercession of professional diplomats with regard to issues of peace-making, trade, [[war]], [[economics]], [[culture]], [[Environmental policy|environment]] and [[human rights]]. International [[Treaty|treaties]] are usually negotiated by diplomats prior to endorsement by national [[politician]]s. In an informal or social sense, diplomacy is the employment of tact to gain [[strategy|strategic advantage]] or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge, one set of tools being the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner.

The scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], dealing with the study of old documents, derives its name from the same source, but its modern meaning is quite distinct from the activity of diplomacy.

====Ancient China====
{{Further|Foreign relations of Imperial China}}

One of the earliest realists in [[international relations theory]] was the 6th century BC military strategist [[Sun Tzu]] (d. 496 BC), author of ''[[The Art of War]]''. He lived during a time in which rival states were starting to pay less attention to traditional respects of tutelage to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1050&amp;ndash;256 BC) figurehead monarchs while each vied for power and total conquest. However, a great deal of diplomacy in establishing allies, bartering land, and signing peace treaties was necessary for each warring state, and the idealized role of the &quot;persuader/diplomat&quot; developed.&lt;ref&gt;

From the [[Battle of Baideng]] (200 BC) to the [[Battle of Mayi]] (133 BC), the [[Han Dynasty]] was forced to [[Heqin|uphold a marriage alliance]] and pay an exorbitant amount of tribute (in silk, cloth, grain, and other foodstuffs) to the powerful northern nomadic [[Xiongnu]] that had been consolidated by [[Modu Shanyu]]. After the Xiongnu sent word to [[Emperor Wen of Han]] (r. 180&amp;ndash;157) that they controlled areas stretching from [[Manchuria]] to the [[Tarim Basin]] oasis city-states, a treaty was drafted in 162 BC proclaiming that everything north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] belong to nomads' lands, while everything south of it would be reserved for [[Han Chinese]]. The treaty was renewed no less than nine times, but did not restrain some Xiongnu ''[[tuqi]]'' from raiding Han borders. That was until the far-flung campaigns of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141&amp;ndash;87 BC) which shattered the unity of the Xiongnu and allowed Han to conquer the [[Western Regions]]; under Wu, in 104 BC the Han armies ventured as far [[Fergana]] in [[Central Asia]] to battle the [[Yuezhi]] who had conquered [[Hellenistic|Hellenistic Greek areas]].

[[File:Zhigongtu full.jpg|thumb|590px|''[[Portraits of Periodical Offering]]'', a 6th-century Chinese painting portraying various emissaries; ambassadors depicted in the painting ranging from those of [[Hephthalites]], [[Persia]] to [[Langkasuka]], [[Baekje]](part of the modern Korea), [[Qiuci]], and Wo ([[Japan]]).]]

The [[Korea]]ns and [[Japan]]ese during the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907 AD) looked to the Chinese capital of [[Chang'an]] as the hub of civilization and emulated its central bureaucracy as the model of governance. The Japanese sent frequent embassies to China in this period, although they halted these trips in 894 when the Tang seemed on the brink of collapse. After the devastating [[An Shi Rebellion]] from 755 to 763, the Tang Dynasty was in no position to reconquer [[Central Asia]] and the [[Tarim Basin]]. After several conflicts with the [[History of Tibet#Tibetan Empire|Tibetan Empire]] spanning several different decades, the Tang finally made a truce and signed a peace treaty with them in 841.

In the 11th century during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279), there were cunning ambassadors such as [[Shen Kuo]] and [[Su Song]] who achieved diplomatic success with the [[Liao Dynasty]], the often hostile [[Khitan people|Khitan]] neighbor to the north. Both diplomats secured the rightful borders of the Song Dynasty through knowledge of [[cartography]] and dredging up old court archives. There was also a triad  of warfare and diplomacy between these two states and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia Dynasty]] to the northwest of Song China (centered in modern-day [[Shaanxi]]). After warring with the [[Lý Dynasty]] of [[Vietnam]] from 1075 to 1077, Song and Lý [[History of the Song Dynasty#Relations with Lý of Vietnam and border conflict|made a peace agreement in 1082]] to exchange the respective lands they had captured from each other during the war.

Long before the Tang and Song dynasties, the Chinese had sent envoys into [[Central Asia]], [[India]], and [[Persia]], starting with [[Zhang Qian]] in the 2nd century BC. Another notable event in Chinese diplomacy was the Chinese embassy mission of [[Zhou Daguan]] to the [[Khmer Empire]] of [[Cambodia]] in the 13th century. Chinese diplomacy  was a necessity in the distinctive period of [[Chinese exploration]]. Since the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD), the Chinese also became heavily invested in sending diplomatic envoys abroad on [[Sailing|maritime]] missions into the [[Indian Ocean]], to India, Persia, [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]]. Chinese maritime activity was increased dramatically during the commercialized period of the Song Dynasty, with new nautical technologies, many more private ship owners, and an increasing amount of economic investors in overseas ventures.

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1294) the Mongols created something similar to today's diplomatic passport called paiza. The paiza were in three different types (golden, silver, and copper) depending on the envoy's level of importance. With the paiza, there came authority that the envoy can ask for food, transport, place to stay from any city, village, or clan within the empire with no difficulties.

From the 17th century the [[Qing Dynasty]] concluded a series of treaties with [[Czarist]] [[Russia]], beginning with the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] in the year 1689. This was followed up by the [[Aigun Treaty]] and the [[Convention of Peking]] in the mid-19th century.

As European power spread around the world in the 18th and 19th centuries so too did its diplomatic model, and Asian countries adopted European diplomatic systems.

====Ancient India====
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Rama and Lakshmana Receive Envoys Page from a Dispersed Ramayana Series.jpg|thumb|Rama and Lakshmana Receive Envoys, Page from a Dispersed Ramayana Series, ca. 1634.]]
[[History of India|Ancient India]], with its kingdoms and dynasties, had a long tradition of diplomacy. The oldest treatise on statecraft and diplomacy, ''[[Arthashastra]]'', is attributed to [[Kautilya]] (also known as [[Chanakya]]){{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, who was the principal adviser to [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya dynasty]] who ruled in the 3rd century BC, (whose capital was [[Patliputra]], today's [[Patna]], the chief city of [[Bihar]] state). ''Arthashastra'' is a complete work on the art of kingship, with long chapters on taxation and on the raising and maintenance  of armies. It also incorporates a theory of diplomacy, of how in a situation of mutually contesting kingdoms, the wise king build alliances and tries to checkmate his adversaries. The envoys sent at the time to the courts of other kingdoms tended to reside for extended periods of time, and ''Arthashastra'' contains advice on the deportment of the envoy, including the trenchant suggestion that 'he should sleep alone'. The highest morality for the king is that his kingdom should prosper. It is also good to note that Lord [[Krishna]], in the epic [[Mahabharata]], acted as a divine diplomat and statesman between the [[Kuru]] and [[Pandava]] dynasties.

====Modern Asia====
[[File:Indian Diplomatic Personnel.jpg|thumb|Diplomatic Personnel]]
Diplomatic relations within the [[Early Modern]] era of [[Asia]] were depicted as an environment of prestige and Status. It was maintained that one must be of noble [[ancestry]] in order to represent an autonomous state within the international arena. Therefore the position of [[diplomat]] was often revered as an element of the elitist class within Asia. A state's ability to practice diplomacy has been one of the underlying defining characteristics of an autonomous state. It is this practice that has been employed since the conception of the first city-states within the international spectrum. Diplomats in Asia were originally sent only for the purpose of [[negotiation]]. They would be required to immediately return after their task was completed. The majority of diplomats initially constituted the relatives of the ruling family. A high rank was bestowed upon them in order to present a sense of legitimacy with regards to their presence. [[Italy]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[China]] were the first real states that perpetuated environments of diplomacy. During the early modern era diplomacy evolved to become a crucial element of international relations within the [[Mediterranean]] and Asia.

===Europe===
====Ancient roots====

The ability to practice diplomacy is one of the defining elements of a state, diplomacy has been practiced since the inception of civilization. In Europe, diplomacy begins with the first [[city-states]] formed in [[ancient Greece]]. Diplomats were sent only for specific negotiations, and would return immediately after their mission concluded. Diplomats were usually relatives of the ruling family or of very high rank in order to give them legitimacy when they sought to negotiate with the other state.

The origins of diplomacy are in the strategic and competitive exchange of impressive gifts, which may be traced to the [[Bronze Age]] and recognized as an aspect of Homeric guest-friendship.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus''(1954; 1978) ch. &quot;Wealth and Labour&quot;; on archaic gift-giving in general, Marcel Mauss, Ian Cunnison, tr. ''The Gift'', 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus diplomacy and [[trade]] have been inexorably linked from the outset. &quot;In the framework of diplomatic relations it was customary for Byzantine emperors and Muslim rulers, especially the 'Abbāsids and the Fātimids, as well as for Muslim rulers between themselves, to exchange precious gifts, with which they attempted to impress or surpass their counterparts,&quot; remarks David Jacoby, in the context of the economics of silk in cultural exchange among Byzantium, Islam and the Latin West:&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, &quot;Silk Economics and Cross-Cultural Artistic Interaction: Byzantium, the Muslim World, and the Christian West&quot;, ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''58''' (2004:197–240) p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; merchants accompanied emissaries, who often traveled on commercial ships. At a later date, it will be recalled that the English adventurer and trader [[Anthony Sherley]] convinced the Persian ruler to send the first [[Persian embassy to Europe (1599–1602)]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Proxenos}}

The Greek City States on some occasions sent envoys to each other in order to negotiate specific issues, such as war and peace or commercial relations, but did not have diplomatic representatives regularly posted in each other's territory. However, some of the functions given to modern diplomatic representatives were in Classical Greece filled by a [[proxenos]], who was a citizen of the host city having a particular relations of friendship with another city – a relationship often hereditary in a particular family.

====Ancient Rome====
{{main|Byzantine diplomacy}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}

====Modern Europe====
In Europe, early modern diplomacy's origins&lt;ref&gt;Historical discontinuity between diplomatic practice of the ancient and medieval worlds and modern diplomacy has been questioned; see, for instance, Pierre Chaplais, ''English Diplomatic Practice in the Middle Ages'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003), p. 1 [http://books.google.com/books?id=pR58WnXzh-wC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22study+of+English+diplomatic+practice%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; are often traced to the states of [[Northern Italy]] in the early [[Renaissance]], with the first embassies being established in the 13th century. [[Milan]] played a leading role, especially under [[Francesco Sforza]] who established permanent embassies to the other city states of Northern Italy. [[Tuscany]] and [[Venice]] were also flourishing centres of diplomacy from the 14th century onwards. It was in the [[Italian Peninsula]] that many of the traditions of modern diplomacy began, such as the presentation of an ambassador's credentials to the [[head of state]].

From Italy the practice was spread to other [[Europe]]an regions. Milan was the first to send a representative to the court of [[France]] in 1455. However, Milan refused to host French representatives fearing espionage and that the French representatives would intervene in its internal affairs. As foreign powers such as France and [[Spain]] became increasingly involved in Italian politics the need to accept emissaries was recognized. Soon the major European powers were exchanging representatives. Spain was the first to send a permanent representative; it appointed an ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's|Court of]] [[England]] in 1487. By the late 16th century, permanent missions became customary. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]], however, did not regularly send permanent legates, as they could not represent the interests of all the [[Germany|German]] princes (who were in theory all subordinate to the Emperor, but in practice each independent).

During that period the rules of modern diplomacy were further developed. The top rank of representatives was an [[ambassador]]. At that time an ambassador was a nobleman, the rank of the noble assigned varying with the prestige of the country he was delegated to. Strict standards developed for ambassadors, requiring they have large residences, host lavish parties, and play an important role in the court life of their host nation. In [[Rome]], the most prized posting for a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] ambassador, the French and Spanish representatives would have a retinue of up to a hundred. Even in smaller posts, ambassadors were very expensive. Smaller states would send and receive [[Envoy (title)|envoy]]s, who were a rung below ambassador. Somewhere between the two was the position of [[minister plenipotentiary]].

Diplomacy was a complex affair, even more so than now.  The ambassadors from each state were ranked by complex levels of precedence that were much disputed. States were normally ranked by the title of the sovereign; for Catholic nations the emissary from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was paramount, then those from the [[Monarchy|kingdoms]], then those from [[Duchy|duchies]] and [[Principality|principalities]]. Representatives from [[republic]]s were ranked the lowest (which often angered the leaders of the numerous German, Scandinavian and Italian republics). Determining precedence between two kingdoms depended on a number of factors that often fluctuated, leading to near-constant squabbling.

[[File:Talleyrand-perigord.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[France|French]] diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] is considered one of the most skilled diplomats of all time.]]

Ambassadors, nobles with little foreign experience and no expectation of a career in diplomacy, needed to be supported by large embassy staff.  These professionals would be sent on longer assignments and would be far more knowledgeable than the higher-ranking officials about the host country. Embassy staff would include a wide range of employees, including some dedicated to [[espionage]]. The need for skilled individuals to staff embassies was met by the graduates of universities, and this led to a great increase in the study of [[international law]], [[modern languages]], and history at universities throughout Europe.

At the same time, permanent foreign ministries began to be established in almost all European states to coordinate embassies and their staffs. These ministries were still far from their modern form, and many of them had extraneous internal responsibilities. Britain had two departments with frequently overlapping powers until 1782. They were also far smaller than they are currently. France, which boasted the largest foreign affairs department, had only some 70 full-time employees in the 1780s.

The elements of modern diplomacy slowly spread to [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]], arriving by the early 18th century. The entire edifice would be greatly disrupted by the [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent years of warfare.  The revolution would see commoners take over the diplomacy of the French state, and of those conquered by revolutionary armies. Ranks of precedence were abolished. [[Napoleon]] also refused to acknowledge diplomatic immunity, imprisoning several British diplomats accused of scheming against France.

After the fall of Napoleon, the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 established an international system of [[diplomatic rank]]. Disputes on precedence among nations (and therefore the appropriate diplomatic ranks used) persisted for over a century until after [[World War II]], when the rank of [[ambassador]] became the norm. In between that time, figures such as the German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] were renowned for international diplomacy.

====Ancient Egypt, Canaan, and Hittite Empire====

Some of the earliest                                                                                           known diplomatic records are the [[Amarna letters]] written between the pharaohs of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] and the [[Amurru]] rulers of [[Canaan]] during the 14th century BC. Following the [[Battle of Kadesh]] in ''c''. 1274 BC during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth dynasty]], the pharaoh of Egypt and ruler of the [[Hittite Empire]] created one of the first known international peace treaties which survives in [[:File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Trattato di Qadesh fra ittiti ed egizi (1269 a.C.) - Foto G.

Egyptian monuments and great works of art still astound us today. We will reveal another surprising aspect of Egyptian life--their weapons of war, and their great might on the battlefield. A common perception of the Egyptians is of a cultured civilization, yet there is fascinating evidence which reveals they were also a war faring people, who developed advanced weapon making techniques. Some of these techniques would be used for the very first time in history and some of the battles they fought were on a truly massive scale.

==== Ottoman Empire ====
{{Further|Foreign relations of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Antoine de Favray 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[France|French]] ambassador in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dress, painted by Antoine de Favray, 1766, [[Pera Museum]], [[Istanbul]].]]
Relations with the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (known to Italian states as the [[Sublime Porte]]) were particularly important to Italian states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman, Daniel pp. 61&quot;&gt;Goffman, Daniel. &quot;Negotiating with the Renaissance State: The Ottoman Empire and the New Diplomacy.&quot; In The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire. Eds. Virginia Aksan and Daniel Goffman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 61–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maritime republics]] of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] depended less and less upon their nautical capabilities, and more and more upon the perpetuation of good relations with the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman, Daniel pp. 61&quot;/&gt; Interactions between various merchants, diplomats, and religious men between the Italian and Ottoman empires helped inaugurate and create new forms of diplomacy and [[public policy|statecraft]]. Eventually the primary purpose of a diplomat, which was originally a negotiator, evolved into a persona that represented an autonomous state in all aspects of political affairs. It became evident that all other [[sovereigns]] felt the need to accommodate themselves diplomatically, due to the emergence of the powerful political environment of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman, Daniel pp. 61&quot;/&gt; One could come to the conclusion that the atmosphere of diplomacy within the early modern period revolved around a foundation of conformity to Ottoman culture.

== Diplomatic immunity ==
{{unsourced-section|date=July 2012}}
{{Main|Diplomatic immunity}}

The sanctity of diplomats has long been observed. This sanctity has come to be known as [[diplomatic immunity]]. While there have been a number of cases where diplomats have been killed, this is normally viewed as a great breach of honour. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often wreak horrific vengeance against any state that violated these rights.

Diplomatic rights were established in the mid-17th century in Europe and have spread throughout the world. These rights were formalized by the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which protects diplomats from being persecuted or [[prosecute]]d while on a diplomatic mission. If a diplomat does commit a serious crime while in a host country he may be declared as [[persona non grata]] (unwanted person). Such diplomats are then often tried for the crime in their homeland.

Diplomatic communications are also viewed as sacrosanct, and diplomats have long been allowed to carry documents across borders without being searched. The mechanism for this is the so-called &quot;[[diplomatic bag]]&quot; (or, in some countries, the &quot;diplomatic pouch&quot;). While radio and digital communication have become more standard for embassies, diplomatic pouches are still quite common and some countries, including the United States, declare entire shipping containers as diplomatic pouches to bring sensitive material (often building supplies) into a country.

In times of hostility, diplomats are often withdrawn for reasons of personal safety, as well as in some cases when the host country is friendly but there is a perceived threat from internal dissidents. Ambassadors and other diplomats are sometimes recalled temporarily by their home countries as a way to express displeasure with the host country. In both cases, lower-level employees still remain to actually do the business of diplomacy.

== Diplomacy and espionage ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Diplomacy is closely linked to espionage or gathering of intelligence. Embassies are bases for both diplomats and spies, and some diplomats are essentially openly acknowledged spies. For instance, the job of [[military attaché]]s includes learning as much as possible about the military of the nation to which they are assigned.  They do not try to hide this role and, as such, are only invited to events allowed by their hosts, such as military parades or [[air show]]s. There are also deep-cover spies operating in many embassies. These individuals are given fake positions at the embassy, but their main task is to illegally gather intelligence, usually by coordinating spy rings of locals or other spies. For the most part, spies operating out of embassies gather little intelligence themselves and their identities tend to be known by the opposition. If discovered, these diplomats can be expelled from an embassy, but for the most part [[counter-intelligence]] agencies prefer to keep these agents ''in situ'' and under close monitoring.

The information gathered by spies plays an increasingly important role in diplomacy. Arms-control treaties would be impossible without the power of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and agents to monitor compliance. Information gleaned from espionage is useful in almost all forms of diplomacy, everything from trade agreements to border disputes.

==Diplomatic resolution of problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Various processes and procedures have evolved over time for handling diplomatic issues and disputes.

===Arbitration and mediations===
Nations sometimes resort to international arbitration when faced with a specific question or point of contention in need of resolution. For most of history, there were no official or formal procedures for such proceedings. They were generally accepted to abide by general principles and protocols related to [[international law]] and justice.

Sometimes these took the form of formal arbitrations and mediations. In such cases a commission of diplomats might be convened to hear all sides of an issue, and to come some sort of ruling based on international law.

In the modern era, much of this work is often carried out by the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]], or other formal commissions, agencies and tribunals, working under the [[United Nations]]. Below are some examples.
* [[Hay-Herbert Treaty]] Enacted after the United States and Britain submitted a dispute to international mediation about the US-Canadian border.

===Conferences===

Other times, resolutions were sought through the convening of international conferences. In such cases, there are fewer ground rules, and fewer formal applications of international law. However, participants are expected to guide themselves through principles of international fairness, logic, and protocol.

Some examples of these formal conferences are:
* [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) – After [[Napoleon]] was defeated, there were many diplomatic questions waiting to be resolved. This included the shape of the map of [[Europe]], the disposition of political and [[nationalism|nationalist]] claims of various ethnic groups and nationalities wishing to have some political autonomy, and the resolution of various claims by various European powers.
* The [[Congress of Berlin]] (June 13 – July 13, 1878) was a meeting of the European Great Powers' and the Ottoman Empire's leading statesmen in Berlin in 1878. In the wake of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], 1877–78, the meeting's aim was to reorganize conditions in the Balkans.

===Negotiations===

Sometimes nations convene official negotiation processes to settle an issue or dispute between several nations which are parties to a dispute. These are similar to the conferences mentioned above, as there are technically no established rules or procedures. However, there are general principles and precedents which help define a course for such proceedings.

Some examples are
* [[Camp David accord]] Convened in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter of the United States, at Camp David to reach an agreement between Prime Minister Mechaem Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. After weeks of negotiation, agreement was reached and the accords were signed, later leading directly to the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]] of 1979.
* [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] Enacted after President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] brought together the delegates from [[Russia]] and [[Japan]], to settle the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Roosevelt's personal intervention settled the conflict, and caused him to win the [[Nobel peace prize]].

== Diplomatic recognition ==

[[Diplomatic recognition]] is an important factor in determining whether a nation is an independent state. Receiving recognition is often difficult, even for countries which are fully sovereign. For many decades after its becoming independent, even many of the closest allies of the [[Dutch Republic]] refused to grant it full recognition.{{cn|date=August 2012}} Today there are [[List of unrecognized countries|a number]] of independent entities without widespread diplomatic recognition, most notably the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (ROC)/Taiwan]] on [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan Island]].  Since the 1970s, most nations have stopped officially recognizing the ROC's existence on Taiwan, at the insistence of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Currently, the United States and other nations maintain informal relations through ''[[de facto]]'' embassies, with names such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]]. Similarly, Taiwan's de facto embassies abroad are known by names such as the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]. This was not always the case, with the US maintaining official diplomatic ties with the ROC, recognizing it as the sole and legitimate government of &quot;all of China&quot; until 1979, when these relations were broken off as a condition for establishing official relations with PR China.

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] has its own diplomatic service, however Palestinian representatives in most Western countries are not accorded diplomatic immunity, and their missions are referred to as Delegations General.

Other unrecognized regions which claim independence include [[Abkhazia]], [[Transnistria]], [[Somaliland]], [[South Ossetia]], [[Nagorno Karabakh]], and the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]. Lacking the economic and political importance of Taiwan, these nations tend to be much more diplomatically isolated.

Though used as a factor in judging sovereignty, Article 3 of the [[Montevideo Convention]] states, &quot;The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by other states.&quot;{{cn|date=August 2012}}

== Informal diplomacy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Informal diplomacy (sometimes called [[Track II diplomacy]]) has been used for centuries to communicate between powers. Most diplomats work to recruit figures in other nations who might be able to give informal access to a country's leadership. In some situations, such as between the [[United States]] and the People's Republic of China a large amount of diplomacy is done through semi-formal channels using [[Interlocutor (politics)|interlocutors]] such as academic members of [[thinktank]]s. This occurs in situations where governments wish to express intentions or to suggest methods of resolving a diplomatic situation, but do not wish to express a formal position.

Track II diplomacy is a specific kind of informal diplomacy, in which non-officials (academic scholars, retired civil and military officials, public figures, social activists) engage in dialogue, with the aim of conflict resolution, or confidence-building. Sometimes governments may fund such Track II exchanges. Sometimes the exchanges may have no connection at all with governments, or may even act in defiance of governments; such exchanges are called Track III.

On some occasion a former holder of an official position continues to carry out an informal diplomatic activity after retirement. In some cases, governments welcome such activity, for example as a means of establishing an initial  contact with a hostile state of group without being formally committed. In other cases, however, such informal diplomats seek to promote a political agenda different from that of the government currently in power. Such informal diplomacy is practiced by former US Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Bill Clinton]] and by the former [[Israel]]i diplomat and minister [[Yossi Beilin]] (see [[Geneva Initiative]]).

== Small state diplomacy ==
Small state diplomacy is receiving increasing attention in diplomatic studies and [[international relations]]. Small states are particularly affected by developments which are determined beyond their borders such as [[climate change]], [[water security]] and shifts in the [[global economy]]. Diplomacy is the main vehicle by which small states are able to ensure that their goals are addressed in the global arena. These factors mean that small states have strong incentives to support international cooperation. But with limited resources at their disposal, conducting effective diplomacy poses unique challenges for small states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
