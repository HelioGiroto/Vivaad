{{Politics of Northern Ireland}}
'''Direct rule''' was the term given, during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, to the administration of [[Northern Ireland]] directly from [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], seat of [[United Kingdom]] government.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The most recent period of direct rule came to an end on 8 May 2007 when power was restored to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] following April elections and a power-sharing agreement among major parties.

Although everyday matters under direct rule were handled by government departments within Northern Ireland itself, major policy was determined by the [[British Government|British Government's]] [[Northern Ireland Office]], under the direction of the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]]; and legislation was introduced, amended, or repealed by means of [[Order in Council]] (effectively, [[rule by decree]]). Direct Rule did not mean that the people of Northern Ireland had no [[democracy|democratic]] say in how they were governed; like other parts of the United Kingdom they elected (and still elect) [[member of parliament|members of parliament]] to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to which the Northern Ireland Office is responsible. But it did result in the existence of an administration specific to Northern Ireland which did not have a specifically Northern Irish mandate.

The system of Direct Rule was originally introduced on 28 March 1972 under the terms of the UK's [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972]], which also suspended the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] (&quot;Stormont&quot;).

The British Government sought to establish a [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in 1973 (under the [[Sunningdale Agreement]]; this was brought down by [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] action), in 1982 (this time boycotted by [[Nationalist]]s), and more recently under the terms of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. Each time, the intention in principle was that the Assembly would take over the political governance of Northern Ireland, and that direct rule would thus come to an end.  The results of the Good Friday Agreement were the most successful at achieving this; however, the Assembly was nevertheless suspended (and direct rule re-imposed) for over three months starting in February 2000,&lt;ref name=suspend2000&gt;{{cite press release

Both unionists and nationalists frequently objected to direct rule, since the system gives the people of Northern Ireland relatively little democratic say over their own governance.  However, some unionists accepted and were content to go along with the system since it seemed to show the province as an integral part of the UK; while some nationalists accepted direct rule if only because they believed that politicians in London are less hostile to Northern Ireland's Catholic community than a government elected by the local Protestant majority. {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
