'''International Relations''' ('''IR''') (occasionally referred to as '''[[International Studies]]''' ('''IS'''), although the two terms are not perfectly synonymous) is the study of relationships between countries, including the roles of [[Sovereign state|states]], [[international organization|inter-governmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[international nongovernmental organization]]s (INGOs), [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs). It is both an [[academic]] and [[Policy|public policy]] field, and can be either [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] or [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] as it both seeks to analyze as well as formulate the [[foreign policy]] of particular states. It is often considered a branch of [[political science]] (especially after 1988 [[4-digit UNESCO Nomenclature|UNESCO nomenclature]]), but an important sector of [[academia]] prefer to treat it as an interdisciplinary field of study. Aspects of international relations have been studied for thousands of years, since the time of [[Thucydides]], but IR became a separate and definable discipline in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Encyclopedia: international relations&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from political science, IR draws upon such diverse fields as [[economics]], [[history]], [[international law]], [[philosophy]], [[area studies|geography]], [[social work]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[criminology]], [[psychology]], [[gender studies]], and [[cultural studies]] / [[culturology]]. It involves a diverse range of issues including but not limited to: [[globalization]], [[Sovereign state|state sovereignty]], [[international security]], [[ecological]] [[sustainability]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[nationalism]], [[economic development]], [[global finance]], [[terrorism]], [[organized crime]], [[human security]], [[foreign interventionism]] and [[human rights]].

==History==
The history of international relations can be traced thousands of years ago; Barry Buzan and Richard Little, for example, consider the interaction of ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-states, starting in 3,500 [[Anno Domini|BC]], as the first fully-fledged international system.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Buzan, Richard Little. International Systems in World History: Remaking the Study of International Relations. published 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:French Spanish and Polish fashion.jpg|thumb|The official portraits of King [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] dressed according to [[Kingdom of France|French]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and Polish fashion reflects the complex politics of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]

The history of international relations based on [[sovereign states]] is often traced back to the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, a stepping stone in the development of the modern state system. Prior to this, the European medieval organization of political authority was based on a vaguely hierarchical religious order. Contrary to popular belief, Westphalia still embodied layered systems of sovereignty, especially within the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Beaulac: “The Westphalian Model in defining International Law: Challenging the Myth”, ''Australian Journal of Legal History'' Vol. 9 (2004), http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2004/9.html; Krasner, Stephen D.: “Westphalia and all that” in Judith Goldstein &amp; Robert Keohane (eds): ''Ideas and Foreign Policy'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1993), pp.235-264&lt;/ref&gt;  More than the Peace of Westphalia, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 is thought to reflect an emerging norm that sovereigns had no internal equals within a defined territory and no external superiors as the ultimate authority within the territory's sovereign borders.

The centuries of roughly 1500 to 1789 saw the rise of the independent, sovereign [[Sovereign state|states]], the institutionalization of [[diplomacy]] and armies.  The [[French Revolution]] added to this the new idea that not princes or an oligarchy, but the citizenry of a state, defined as the nation, should be defined as sovereign.  Such a state in which the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a [[nation-state]] (as opposed to a monarchy, or a religious state).  The term [[republic]] increasingly became its synonym.  An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely if ever fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only.  The same claim to sovereignty was made for both forms of nation-state.  (It is worth noting that in Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.)  

The particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via [[colonialism]] and the &quot;standards of civilization&quot;. The contemporary international system was finally established through [[decolonization]] during the [[Cold War]]. However, this is somewhat over-simplified. While the nation-state system is considered &quot;modern&quot;, many states have not incorporated the system and are termed &quot;pre-modern&quot;.

Further, a handful of states have moved beyond insistence on full sovereignty, and can be considered &quot;post-modern&quot;. The ability of contemporary IR discourse to explain the relations of these different types of states is disputed. &quot;Levels of analysis&quot; is a way of looking at the international system, which includes the individual level, the domestic state as a unit, the international level of transnational and intergovernmental affairs, and the global level.

What is explicitly recognized as International Relations theory was not developed until after [[World War I]], and is dealt with in more detail below. IR theory, however, has a long tradition of drawing on the work of other [[social science]]s. The use of capitalizations of the &quot;I&quot; and &quot;R&quot; in International Relations aims to distinguish the academic discipline of International Relations from the phenomena of international relations. Many cite [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (6th century BC), [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' (5th century BC), [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'' and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' providing further elaboration.

Similarly, [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]] draws upon the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], with the work of the former often being cited as the first elaboration of [[democratic peace theory]]. Though contemporary human rights is considerably different than the type of rights envisioned under [[natural law]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[John Locke]] offered the first accounts of universal entitlement to certain rights on the basis of common humanity. In the twentieth century, in addition to contemporary theories of liberal internationalism, [[Marxism]] has been a foundation of international relations.

===Study of IR===
[[File:UN Members Flags2.JPG|thumb|Flags of the member states of the [[United Nations]]]]
Initially, international relations as a distinct field of study was almost entirely [[Great Britain|British]]-centered. IR only emerged as a formal academic ‘discipline’ in 1918 with the founding of the first ‘chair’ (professorship) in IR - the Woodrow Wilson Chair at Aberystwyth, University of Wales (now [[Aberystwyth University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/ Department of International Politics, Aberystwyth University&lt;/ref&gt;), from an endowment given by [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|David Davies]], became the first academic position dedicated to IR. This was rapidly followed by establishment of IR at US universities and Geneva, Switzerland. In the early 1920s, the [[London School of Economics]]' department of International Relations was founded at the behest of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Philip Noel-Baker]], and was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. Furthermore, the International History department at LSE, developed as primarily focused on the history of IR in the [[early modern]], colonial and [[Cold War]] periods.

The first university entirely dedicated to the study of IR was the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] (now the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]), which was founded in 1927 to form diplomats associated to the [[League of Nations]], established in Geneva some years before. The Graduate Institute of International Studies offered one of the first [[Ph.D.]] degrees in international relations. [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] is the oldest international relations faculty in the United States, founded in 1919. The [[Committee on International Relations (University of Chicago)|Committee on International Relations]] at the [[University of Chicago]] was the first to offer a graduate degree, in 1928.

==Theory==
{{Main|International relations theory}}

===Epistemology and IR theory===
{{International relations theory}}
IR theories can be roughly divided into one of two [[epistemology|epistemological]] camps: &quot;positivist&quot; and &quot;post-positivist&quot;. Positivist theories aim to replicate the methods of the natural sciences by analysing the impact of material forces. They typically focus on features of international relations such as state interactions, size of military forces, balance of powers etc. Post-positivist epistemology rejects the idea that the social world can be studied in an objective and value-free way. It rejects the central ideas of neo-realism/liberalism, such as [[rational choice theory]], on the grounds that the scientific method cannot be applied to the social world and that a 'science' of IR is impossible.

A key difference between the two positions is that while positivist theories, such as neo-realism, offer causal explanations (such as why and how power is exercised), post-positivist theories focus instead on constitutive questions, for instance what is meant by 'power'; what makes it up, how it is experienced and how it is reproduced. Often, post-positivist theories explicitly promote a normative approach to IR, by considering ethics. This is something which has often been ignored under 'traditional' IR as positivist theories make a distinction between 'facts' and normative judgments, or 'values'.

During the late 1980s and the 1990s, debate between positivists and post-positivists became the dominant debate and has been described as constituting the Third &quot;Great Debate&quot; (Lapid 1989).

===Positivist Theories===
====Realism====
'''[[Realism (international relations)|Realism]]''' focuses on state security and power above all else. Early realists such as [[E.H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]] argued that states are self-interested, power-seeking rational actors, who seek to maximize their security and chances of survival. Cooperation between states is a way to maximize each individual state's security (as opposed to more idealistic reasons). Similarly, any act of war must be based on self-interest, rather than on idealism. Many realists saw [[World War II]] as the vindication of their theory.

It should be noted that classical writers such as [[Thucydides]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], are often cited as &quot;founding fathers&quot; of realism by contemporary self-described realists. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, while their work may support realist doctrine, it is not likely that they would have classified themselves as realists (in this sense o
Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in human nature. To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, persons will challenge them only at the risk of failure.
Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion-between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking.

The placement of Realism under positivism is far from unproblematic however. E.H. Carr's 'What is History' was a deliberate critique of positivism, and Hans Morgenthau's aim in 'Scientific Man vs Power Politics' - as the title implies - was to demolish any conception that international politics/power politics can be studied scientifically.

====Liberalism/idealism/Liberal Internationalism====
'''[[Liberal international relations theory]]''' arose after World War I in response to the inability of states to control and limit war in their international relations. Early adherents include [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Norman Angell]], who argued vigorously that states mutually gained from cooperation and that war was so destructive as to be essentially futile.

Liberalism was not recognized as a coherent theory as such until it was collectively and derisively termed idealism by [[Edward Hallet Carr|E. H. Carr]]. A new version of &quot;idealism&quot; that focused on [[human rights]] as the basis of the legitimacy of international law was advanced by [[Hans Köchler]].

{{See|liberal internationalism}}

====Neoliberalism====
'''[[neoliberalism in international relations|Neoliberalism]]''' seeks to update liberalism by accepting the neorealist presumption that states are the key actors in international relations, but still maintains that non-state actors (NSAs) and [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs) matter. Proponents such as [[Maria Chattha]] argue that states will cooperate irrespective of [[relative gains]], and are thus concerned with [[absolute gains]]. This also means that nations are, in essence, free to make their own choices as to how they will go about conducting policy without any international organizations blocking a nation's right to sovereignty.

Neoliberalism also contains an economic theory that is based on the use of open and free markets with little, if any, government intervention to prevent monopolies and other conglomerates from forming. The growing interdependence throughout and after the Cold War through international institutions led to neo-liberalism being defined as [[institutionalism]], this new part of the theory being fronted by [[Robert Keohane]] and also [[Joseph Nye]].

{{See|complex interdependence}}

====Regime Theory====
'''[[Regime theory]]''' is derived from the liberal tradition that argues that international institutions or regimes affect the behavior of states (or other international actors). It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of international cooperation.

While [[realism (international relations)|realism]] predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights and collective security among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition of regimes comes from [[Stephen Krasner]]. Krasner defines regimes as &quot;institutions possessing norms, decision rules, and procedures which facilitate a convergence of expectations.&quot;{{Cite quote| date= May 2012}}

Not all approaches to regime theory, however are liberal or neoliberal; some [[realism (international relations)|realist]] scholars like Joseph Greico have developed hybrid theories which take a realist based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation ''never'' happens, just that it is not the norm; it is a difference of degree).

===Post-positivist/reflectivist theories===
====International society theory (the English school)====
'''[[English school of international relations theory|International society theory]]''', also called the '''English School''', focuses on the shared norms and values of states and how they regulate international relations. Examples of such norms include diplomacy, order, and [[public international law|international law]]. Unlike neo-realism, it is not necessarily positivist. Theorists have focused particularly on humanitarian intervention, and are subdivided between solidarists, who tend to advocate it more, and pluralists, who place greater value in order and sovereignty. Nicholas Wheeler is a prominent solidarist, while [[Hedley Bull]] and Robert H. Jackson are perhaps the best known pluralists.

====Social Constructivism====
[[Constructivist epistemology#Social constructivism in sociology|Social Constructivism]] encompasses a broad range of theories that aim to address questions of [[ontology]], such as the [[Structure and agency]] debate, as well as questions of [[epistemology]], such as the &quot;material/ideational&quot; debate that concerns the relative role of material forces versus ideas. Constructivism is not a theory of IR in the manner of neo-realism, but is instead a [[social theory]] which is used to better explain the actions taken by states and other major actors as well as the identities that guide these states and actors.

[[Constructivism in international relations|Constructivism in IR]] can be divided into what Hopf (1998) calls 'conventional' and 'critical' constructivism. Common to all varieties of constructivism is an interest in the role that ideational forces play. The most famous constructivist scholar, [[Alexander Wendt]] noted in a 1992 article in [[International Organization]] (later followed up by a book, ''Social Theory of International Politics'' (1999)), that &quot;anarchy is what states make of it&quot;. By this he means that the anarchical structure that neo-realists claim governs state interaction is in fact a phenomenon that is socially constructed and reproduced by states.

For example, if the system is dominated by states that see anarchy as a life or death situation (what Wendt terms a &quot;Hobbesian&quot; anarchy) then the system will be characterised by warfare. If on the other hand anarchy is seen as restricted (a &quot;Lockean&quot; anarchy) then a more peaceful system will exist. Anarchy in this view is constituted by state interaction, rather than accepted as a natural and immutable feature of international life as viewed by neo-realist IR scholars.

====Critical Theory====
{{Main|Critical international relations theory}}

'''[[Critical international relations theory]]''' is the application of '[[critical theory]]' to international relations. Proponents such as [[Andrew Linklater]], [[Robert W. Cox]] and [[Ken Booth (academic)|Ken Booth]] focus on the need for human [[freedom (political)|emancipation]] from States. Hence, it is &quot;critical&quot; of mainstream IR theories that tend to be state-centric.

====Marxism====
[[Marxism|Marxist]] and Neo-Marxist theories of IR reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. It makes the assumption that the economy trumps other concerns; allowing for the elevation of class as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. Thus, the period of colonialism brought in sources for raw materials and captive markets for exports, while decolonialization brought new opportunities in the form of dependence.

Linked in with Marxist theories is [[dependency theory]] and the [[Core-periphery|Core-Periphery Model]], which argue that developed countries, in their pursuit of power, appropriate developing states through international banking, security and trade agreements and unions on a formal level, and do so through the interaction of political &amp; financial advisors, missionaries, relief aid workers, and multinational corporations on the informal level, in order to integrate them into the capitalist system, strategically appropriating under-valued natural resources and labor hours and fostering economic &amp; political dependence.

Marxist theories receive little attention in the United States where no significant Socialist party has flourished. It is more common in parts of Europe and is one of the more important theoretic contributions of Latin American academia to the study of global networks.

===Leadership Theories===
====Interest Group perspective====
Interest Group theory posits that the driving force behind state behavior is sub-state interest groups. Examples of interest groups include political lobbyists, the military, and the corporate sector. Group theory argues that although these interest groups are constitutive of the state, they are also causal forces in the exercise of state power.

====Strategic Perspective====
Strategic Perspective is a theoretical approach that views individuals as choosing their actions by taking into account the anticipated actions and responses of others with the intention of maximizing their own welfare.

====Inherent bad faith model in international relations and political psychology====
{{See|Bad faith|inherent bad faith model}}
The &quot;[[inherent bad faith model]]&quot; of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]’ beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;The “Inherent Bad Fatih Model” Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger, Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, Political Psychology, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref&gt;''“…the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent...&quot;'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt; A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are [[John Foster Dulles]]’ position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel’s initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;“…the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent”, The handbook of social psychology, Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poststructuralist theories==
Poststructuralist theories of IR developed in the 1980s from postmodernist studies in political science. Post-structuralism explores the deconstruction of concepts traditionally not problematic in IR, such as 'power' and 'agency' and examines how the construction of these concepts shapes international relations. The examination of 'narratives' plays an important part in poststructuralist analysis, for example feminist poststructuralist work has examined the role that 'women' play in global society and how they are constructed in war as 'innocent' and 'civilians'.

Examples of post-positivist research include:
*[[Feminism in international relations|Feminism]]s (&quot;gendering&quot; war)
*[[Postcolonialism]] (challenges the euro-centrism of IR)
*[[Post-realism]] (focuses on IR theory as scientific and political rhetoric)

==Concepts in international relations==
===Conjuncture===
In decision making in international relations, the concept of [[Conjuncture (international relations)]], together with freedom of action and equality are important elements. Decision makers must take into account the set of international conditions in taking initiatives that would create different types of responses.

===Systemic level concepts===
International relations is often viewed in terms of '''levels of analysis'''. The '''systemic level''' concepts are those broad concepts that define and shape an international milieu, characterised by [[Anarchy in international relations|Anarchy]].

====Power====
[[File:Powers in international relations 2.png|right|thumb|300px|Darkest blue countries most often considered to be [[superpower]]s, dark blue countries most often considered to be [[great powers]], pale blue countries most often considered to be [[middle powers]], and palest blue countries also sometimes considered to be middle powers.&lt;ref name=Chapnick&gt;Adam Chapnick, [http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/pols369/readings/chapnick_middle.pdf The Middle Power].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The concept of '''[[power in international relations]]''' can be described as the degree of resources, capabilities, and influence in international affairs. It is often divided up into the concepts of [[hard power]] and [[soft power]], hard power relating primarily to coercive power, such as the use of force, and soft power commonly covering [[economics]], [[diplomacy]] and [[culture|cultural]] influence. However, there is no clear dividing line between the two forms of power.

=====Polarity=====
'''[[Polarity (power)|Polarity]]''' in International Relations refers to the arrangement of power within the international system. The concept arose from '''bipolarity''' during the [[Cold War]], with the international system dominated by the conflict between two [[superpower]]s, and has been applied retrospectively by theorists. However, the term bipolar was notably used by Stalin who said he saw the international system as a bipolar one with two opposing powerbases and ideologies. Consequently, the international system prior to 1945 can be described as '''multi-polar''', with power being shared among [[Great powers]].

[[File:Imperialism2.png|thumb|right|300px|Empires of the world in 1910.]]

The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 had led to what some would call unipolarity, with the [[United States]] as a sole superpower. However, due to [[People's Republic of China|China's]] continued rapid economic growth (in 2010 it became the world's second largest economy), combined with the respectable international position they hold within political spheres and the power that the Chinese Government exerts over their people (consisting of the largest population in the world), there is debate over whether China is now a superpower or a possible candidate in the future.

Several theories of international relations draw upon the idea of [[polarity (power)|polarity]]. &lt;br/&gt;
The '''[[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]''' was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the [[First World War]], the thought being that by balancing power blocs it would create stability and prevent war. Theories of the balance of power gained prominence again during the [[Cold War]], being a central mechanism of [[Kenneth Waltz|Kenneth Waltz's]] Neorealism. Here, the concepts of balancing (rising in power to counter another) and bandwagonning (siding with another) are developed.

'''[[Hegemonic stability theory]]''' (developed by Robert Gilpin) also draws upon the idea of Polarity, specifically the state of unipolarity. [[Hegemony]] is the preponderance of power at one pole in the international system, and the theory argues this is a stable configuration because of mutual gains by both the dominant power and others in the international system. This is contrary to many Neorealist arguments, particularly made by [[Kenneth Waltz]], stating that the end of the [[Cold War]] and the state of unipolarity is an unstable configuration that will inevitably change.

This can be expressed in '''[[Power transition theory]]''', which states that it is likely that a [[great power]] would challenge a hegemon after a certain period, resulting in a major war. It suggests that while hegemony can control the occurrence of wars, it also results in the creation of one. Its main proponent, [[A.F.K. Organski]], argued this based on the occurrence of previous wars during British, Portuguese and Dutch hegemony.

====Interdependence====
Many advocate that the current international system is characterized by growing interdependence; the mutual responsibility and dependency on others. Advocates of this point to growing [[globalization]], particularly with international economic interaction. The role of international institutions, and widespread acceptance of a number of operating principles in the international system, reinforces ideas that relations are characterized by interdependence.

====Dependency====
[[File:ISAF soldier looking for enemy positions in Kunar Province of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[NATO]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] in [[Afghanistan]].]]

'''[[Dependency theory]]''' is a theory most commonly associated with [[Marxism]], stating that a set of '''Core''' states exploit a set of weaker '''Periphery''' states for their prosperity. Various versions of the theory suggest that this is either an inevitability (standard dependency theory), or use the theory to highlight the necessity for change (Neo-Marxist).

====Systemic tools of international relations====
*'''[[Diplomacy]]''' is the practice of communication and '''negotiation''' between representatives of states. To some extent, all other tools of international relations can be considered the failure of diplomacy. Keeping in mind, the use of other tools are part of the communication and negotiation inherent within diplomacy. Sanctions, force, and adjusting trade regulations, while not typically considered part of diplomacy, are actually valuable tools in the interest of leverage and placement in negotiations.
*'''[[International sanctions|Sanctions]]''' are usually a first resort after the failure of diplomacy, and are one of the main tools used to enforce treaties. They can take the form of diplomatic or economic sanctions and involve the cutting of ties and imposition of barriers to communication or trade.
*'''[[War]]''', the use of force, is often thought of as the ultimate tool of international relations. A widely accepted definition is that given by [[Clausewitz]], with war being &quot;the continuation of politics by other means&quot;. There is a growing study into 'new wars' involving actors other than states. The study of war in International Relations is covered by the disciplines of '[[War Studies]]' and '[[Strategic studies]]'.
*The '''mobilization of international shame''' can also be thought of as a tool of International Relations. This is attempting to alter states' actions through '[[name and shame|naming and shaming]]' at the international level. This is mostly done by the large human rights NGOs such as Amnesty International (for instance when it called Guantanamo Bay a &quot;Gulag&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL10/014/2005/en&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or Human Rights Watch. A prominent use of was the UN Commission on Human Rights 1235 procedure, which publicly exposes state's human rights violations. The current [[Human Rights Council]] has yet to use this Mechanism
*The allotment of '''economic and/or diplomatic benefits'''. An example of this is the [[European Union]]'s enlargement policy. Candidate countries are allowed entry into the EU only after the fulfillment of the [[Copenhagen criteria]].

As a '''level of analysis''' the unit level is often referred to as the state level, as it locates its explanation at the level of the state, rather than the international system.

===Regime type===
It is often considered that a state's form of government can dictate the way that a state interacts with others in the international system.

'''[[Democratic Peace Theory]]''' is a theory that suggests that the nature of [[democracy]] means that democratic countries will not go to war with each other. The justifications for this are that democracies externalise their norms and only go to war for just causes, and that democracy encourages mutual trust and respect.

'''[[Communism]]''' justifies a world revolution, which similarly would lead to peaceful coexistence, based on a proletarian global society.
the power politics is also considered

===Revisionism/Status quo===
States can be classified by whether they accept the international status quo, or are revisionist, i.e. want change. Revisionist states seek to fundamentally change the rules and practices of international relations, feeling disadvantaged by the status quo. They see the international system as a largely western creation which serves to reinforce current realities. [[Japan]] is an example of a state that has gone from being a revisionist state to one that is satisfied with the status quo, because the status quo is now beneficial to it.

===Religion===
It is often considered {{By whom| date= May 2012}} that [[religion]] can have an effect on the way a state acts within the international system. Religion is visible as an organising principle particularly for Islamic states, whereas secularism sits at the other end of the spectrum, with the separation of state and religion being responsible for the [[Liberal international relations theory]].

==Individual or sub-unit level concepts==
The level beneath the unit (state) level can be useful both for explaining factors in International Relations that other theories fail to explain, and for moving away from a state-centric view of international relations.
*'''Psychological factors in International Relations''' - Evaluating psychological factors in international relations comes from the understanding that a state is not a 'black box' as proposed by [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], and that there may be other influences on foreign policy decisions. Examining the role of personalities in the decision making process can have some [[explanatory power]], as can the role of misperception between various actors. A prominent application of sub-unit level psychological factors in international relations is the concept of [[Groupthink]], another is the propensity of policymakers to think in terms of analogies.
*'''Bureaucratic politics''' - Looks at the role of the [[bureaucracy]] in decision making, and sees decisions as a result of bureaucratic in-fighting, and as having been shaped by various constraints.
*'''Religious, Ethnic, and secessionist groups''' - Viewing these aspects of the sub-unit level has explanatory power with regards to [[ethnic conflict]]s, [[religious wars]], transnational [[diaspora]] ([[diaspora politics]]) and other actors which do not consider themselves to fit with the defined state boundaries. This is particularly useful in the context of the pre-modern world of weak states.
*'''Science, Technology and International Relations'''- How science and technology impact the global health, business, environment, technology, and development.
* '''[[International political economy]]''', and economic factors in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Eg, [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006. [[Donald Markwell]], ''Keynes and International Economic and Political Relations'', Trinity Paper 33, Trinity College, University of Melbourne. [http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/publications/trinity_papers/paper33]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[International political culturology]]''' – Looks at how culture and cultural variables impact in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturology.com/definition/ [[Fabrice Rivault]], (1999) ''Culturologie Politique Internationale : Une approche systémique et matérialiste de la culture et du système social global'', McGill Dissertation, Montréal, publiée par Culturology Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-21/chapter-1.htm Xintian, Yu (2005) “Cultural Factors In International Relations”, Chinese Philosophical Studies.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xintian, Yu (2009),&quot;Combining Research on Cultural Theory and International Relations&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutions in international relations==
[[File:The United Nations Building.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] at the [[United Nations headquarters]] in [[New York City]].]]

International institutions form a vital part of contemporary International Relations. Much interaction at the system level is governed by them, and they outlaw some traditional institutions and practices of International Relations, such as the use of [[war]] (except in self-defence).

As humanity enters the [[Planetary phase of civilization]], some scientists and political theorists{{Who|date=September 2010}} see a global hierarchy of institutions replacing the existing system of sovereign nation-states as the primary political community. They argue that nations are an [[imagined community]] that cannot resolve such modern challenges as the “[[Dogville]]” effect (strangers in a homogeneous community), the legal and political status of stateless people and refugees, and the need to address worldwide concerns like [[climate change]] and [[pandemics]].

Futurist [[Paul Raskin]] has hypothesized that a new, more legitimate form of [[global politics]] could be based on “constrained pluralism.” This principle guides the formation of institutions based on three characteristics: [[Irreducibility (philosophy)|irreducibility]], where some issues must be adjudicated at the global level; [[subsidiarity]], which limits the scope of global authority to truly global issues while smaller-scope issues are regulated at lower levels; and [[heterogeneity]], which allows for diverse forms of local and regional institutions as long as they meet global obligations.
