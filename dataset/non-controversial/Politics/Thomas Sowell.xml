'''Thomas Sowell''' (born June 30, 1930) is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]], [[Social criticism|social theorist]],  political philosopher, and author. A [[National Humanities Medal]] winner, he advocates [[laissez-faire]] economics and writes from a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] perspective. He is currently the [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and [[Milton Friedman]] Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the [[Hoover Institution]], [[Stanford University]]. He is considered a leading representative of the [[Chicago school of economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry D. Nachman, [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/a-conflict-of-visions-by-thomas-sowell/ &quot;A Conflict of Visions, by Thomas Sowell&quot;], ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', March 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell was born in [[North Carolina]], but grew up in [[Harlem]], [[New York]]. He dropped out of high school, and served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Korean War]]. He received a bachelor's degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1958 and a master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1959. In 1968, he earned his [[Doctorate|doctorate degree]] in Economics from the [[University of Chicago]].

Sowell has served on the faculties of several universities, including [[Cornell University]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and worked for think tanks such as the [[Urban Institute]]. Since 1980 he has worked at the [[Hoover Institution]]. He is the author of more than 30 books.

==Biography==
Sowell was born in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. His father died shortly before he was born, and his mother, a [[housemaid]], already had four children. A great-aunt and her two grown daughters adopted Sowell and raised him.&lt;ref name=&quot;courage&quot;/&gt; In his autobiography, ''A Personal Odyssey,'' he said his childhood encounters with white people were so limited that he did not believe blond was really a hair color.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, ''A Personal Odyssey'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; When Sowell was nine, his family moved from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] to Harlem, [[New York City]]. He attended [[Stuyvesant High School]], the first in his family to study beyond the sixth grade. However, he was forced to drop out at age 17 because of financial difficulties and problems in his home.&lt;ref name=&quot;courage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Graglia|first=Nino A.|title=Profile in courage|url=http://www-hoover.stanford.edu/pubaffairs/newsletter/01winter/review.html|work=Hoover Institution Newsletter|publisher=Hoover Institution|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050909080051/http://www-hoover.stanford.edu/pubaffairs/newsletter/01winter/review.html|archivedate=September 9, 2005|date=Winter 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at a number of jobs, including at a machine shop and as a delivery man for [[Western Union]],&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, ''A Personal Odyssey'', pp. 47, 58, 59, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and tried out for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=nordlinger20110203&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordlinger|first=Jay|title=Brains and Nerve|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/258804/brains-and-nerve-jay-nordlinger|publisher=National Review|accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sowell was [[Conscription|drafted]] in 1951, during the [[Korean War]], and was assigned to the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Because of his experience in [[photography]], he became a Marine Corps photographer; he also trained Marines in .45-caliber pistol proficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;courage&quot;/&gt;

After his discharge, Sowell worked a civil service job in [[Washington, D.C.]] and attended night classes at [[Howard University]], admitted on the basis of his General Education certificate. His high scores on the [[College Board]] exams and recommendations by two professors helped him gain admission to Harvard University, where he graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1958 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;courage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Curriculum vita|url=http://www.tsowell.com/cv.html|work=TSowell.com|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Master's degree|Master of Arts]] from Columbia University the following year, and a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from the University of Chicago in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV&quot;/&gt;

Sowell had initially chosen Columbia University to study under [[George Stigler]] (who would later receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]]). When he learned that Stigler had moved to the University of Chicago, he followed him there.&lt;ref name=CharlieRoseSowell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=QFWuR_JxANE |title=Charlie Rose - September 15, 1995 |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell has taught economics at Howard University, [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], Cornell, [[Brandeis University]], [[Amherst College]], and [[UCLA]]. Since 1980 he has been a Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at [[Stanford University]], where he holds a fellowship named after [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and Milton Friedman, his mentor.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoover bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Sowell |url=http://www.hoover.org/fellows/9767|publisher=Hoover Institution|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Sowell testified in favor of federal appeals court judge [[Robert Bork]] during the hearings for [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|Bork's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court]]. In his testimony, Sowell said that Bork was &quot;the most highly qualified nominee of this generation&quot; and that [[judicial activism]], a concept that Bork opposed, &quot;has not been beneficial to minorities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=Legal Establishment Divided Over Bork Nomination|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/26/us/the-bork-hearings-legal-establishment-divided-over-bork-nomination.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=November 18, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 26, 1987}} [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Day9Pa Video of Sowell's testimony at C-SPAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell has stated that he was a [[Marxist]] “during the decade of my 20s&quot;; one of his earliest professional publications was a sympathetic examination of Marxist thought vs. Marxist-Leninist practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (1963). “Karl Marx and the Freedom of the Individual,” ''Ethics'' 73:2, p 120.&lt;/ref&gt; His experience working as a federal government intern during the summer of 1960 caused him to reject Marxian economics in favor of [[free market]] economic theory. During his work, Sowell discovered an association between the rise of mandated minimum wages for workers in the sugar industry of [[Puerto Rico]] and the rise of [[unemployment]] in that industry. Studying the patterns led Sowell to theorize that the government employees who administered the minimum wage law cared more about their own jobs than the plight of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elizabeth |first=Mary |url=http://www.salon.com/books/int/1999/11/10/sowell/ |title=Black and right |publisher=Salon.com |date=1999-11-10 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Sowell is both a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[columnist]] and an [[academic]] economist.

Besides scholarly writing, Sowell has written books, articles, and syndicated columns for a general audience in such publications as ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and major newspapers. He is a regular contributor to GOPUSA, a conservative web and email newsletter run by Endeavor Media Group, LLC. He primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to [[capitalism]].  Sowell, whose autobiography describes his serious study of Brady McGarry, opposes [[Marxism]], providing a critique in his book ''Marxism: Philosophy and Economics''.

Sowell also writes on racial topics and is a critic of [[affirmative action]] and race based quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20030108.shtml |title='&amp;#39;Townhall.com'&amp;#39; |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20030109.shtml |title='&amp;#39;Townhall.com'&amp;#39; |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; While often described as a [[Black conservatism in the United States|black conservative]], he prefers not to be labeled, and considers himself more [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] than conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Sawhill R. (1999) [http://www.salon.com/books/int/1999/11/10/sowell/index.html “Black and right: Thomas Sowell talks about the arrogance of liberal elites and the loneliness of the black conservative.”] ''Salon.com''. Accessed May 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another departure from economics, Sowell wrote ''The [[Einstein Syndrome]]: Bright Children Who Talk Late'', a follow-up to his ''Late-Talking Children''.  This book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children, frequently misdiagnosed with [[autism]] or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]. He includes the research of—among others—Professor Stephen Camarata, Ph.D., of [[Vanderbilt University]] and Professor [[Steven Pinker]], Ph.D., of Harvard University in this overview of a poorly understood developmental trait.  It is a trait which he says affected many historical figures. He includes famous late-talkers such as physicists [[Albert Einstein]], [[Edward Teller]] and [[Richard Feynman]]; mathematician [[Julia Robinson]]; and musicians [[Arthur Rubenstein]] and [[Clara Schumann]]. The book and its contributing researchers make a case for the theory that some children develop unevenly (asynchronous development) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the [[brain]].  This may temporarily “rob resources” from neighboring functions such as language development. The book contradicts [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]’s speculation that Einstein may have had [[Asperger syndrome]] (see also [[people speculated to have been autistic]]).

Themes of Sowell’s writing range from social policy on race, ethnic groups, education and decision-making, to classical and Marxist economics, to the problems of children perceived as having disabilities.

In ''Intelligence and Ethnicity'', Sowell argues that IQ gaps are hardly startling or unusual between, or within, ethnic groups. He notes that the roughly 15-point gap in contemporary black–white IQ scores is similar to that between the national average and the scores of particular ethnic white groups in years past.

Sowell has also written a trilogy of books on ideologies and political positions, including ''[[A Conflict of Visions]]'' where he speaks about the origins of political strife, [[The Vision of the Anointed]], where he compares the conservative/libertarian and liberal/progressive worldviews,''The Quest for Cosmic Justice'', where, like in many of his other writings, he outlines his thesis of the need for intellectuals, politicians and leaders to fix and perfect the world in utopian, and ultimately he posits, disastrous fashions. Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'', where he discusses what he argues to be the blind hubris and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas, building on his earlier work.

Sowell takes strong issue with the notion of government as a helper or savior of minorities, arguing that the historical record shows quite the opposite.

Sowell also challenges the notion that black progress is due to progressive government programs or policies, in ''The Economics and Politics of Race,'' (1983), ''Ethnic America'' (1981), ''Affirmative Action Around the World'' (2004), and other books.
He claims that many problems identified with blacks in modern society are hardly unique in terms of American ethnic groups, nor in terms of a rural proletariat swept by disruption as it became urbanized, discussed in his book ''Black Rednecks and White Liberals''.

In ''Affirmative Action Around the World''&lt;ref name=&quot;hoover1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sowell |first=Thomas |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/8108 |title=Affirmative Action around the World &amp;#124; Hoover Institution |publisher=Hoover.org |date=2004-10-30 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sowell holds that affirmative action covers most of the American population, particularly women, and has long since ceased to be directed towards blacks.

Sowell opposes the [[Federal Reserve]], and pointing out that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation. This was stated during an interview with Peter Robinson during an episode of the Hoover Institution-produced show [[Uncommon Knowledge]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://itmakessenseblog.com/2011/01/13/thomas-sowell-federal-reserve-a-cancer/&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed on an episode of [[Freedom Watch|FreedomWatch]] with [[Andrew Napolitano|Judge Andrew Napolitano]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovguide.com/video/thomas-sowell-makes-the-case-to-end-the-fed-on-judge-napolitanos-freedom-watch-922ca39ce10036ba0e119b7246ba94c0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columns===
Sowell has a nationally syndicated column distributed by [[Creators Syndicate]] that appears in various newspapers, as well as online on websites such as [[Townhall.com|Townhall]], [[WorldNetDaily]], [[American Family Association|OneNewsNow]] and the ''[[Jewish World Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell.html |title=Thomas Sowell |publisher=Jewishworldreview.com |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell comments on issues he considers to be problematic in modern-day society, which include [[liberal media bias]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041012.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell, Conservative, Political News |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; judicial activism (while staunchly defending [[originalism]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsowell.com/judicial.htm |title=Judicial Activism Reconsidered |publisher=Tsowell.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041109.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell, Conservative, Political News |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041110.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell, Conservative, Political News |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassf |title=Conservative Columnists and Political Commentary |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20050914.shtml |title=Thomas Sowell, Conservative, Political News |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[partial birth abortion]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sowell |first=Thomas |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2004/06/04/partial_truth_abortion |title=Thomas Sowell : 'Partial truth' abortion |publisher=Townhall.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[minimum wage]]; [[socialized medicine|socializing health care]]; government undermining of familial autonomy; affirmative action; government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=getAbstract International Book Award|url=http://www.getabstract.com/pages/0/web/BookAward.jsp|publisher=getAbstract|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bureaucracy]]; militancy in [[U.S. foreign policy]]; the U.S. [[war on drugs]], and [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/250190/cult-multiculturalism-thomas-sowell&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell in a Townhall editorial, &quot;The Bush Legacy,&quot; assessed President [[George W. Bush]], deeming him &quot;a mixed bag,&quot; but &quot;an honorable man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Townhall.com|author=Thomas Sowell|title=The Bush Legacy|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2009/01/16/the_bush_legacy|date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell also favors [[decriminalization]] of all drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (1987); ''Compassion versus guilt, and other essays''; ISBN 0-688-07114-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, a column fiercely critical of &quot;Obama's America&quot; and falsely attributed to Sowell was circulated on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.knoxnews.com/editor/2011/11/thomas-sowell-letter-to-knoxvi.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
===Awards===
In 1990, he won the [[Francis Boyer Award]], presented by the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. In 1998 he received the [[Sydney Hook]] Award from the [[National Association of Scholars]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Nelson Black (2004). &quot;Freefall of the American university&quot;. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] ''[[WND Books]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Sowell was awarded the National Humanities Medal for prolific scholarship melding [[history]], economics, and [[political science]]. In 2003, he was awarded the [[Bradley Foundation#Bradley Prize|Bradley Prize]] for intellectual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Sowell |url=http://www.hoover.org/bios/sowell.html |title=Hoover Institution - Fellows - Thomas Sowell |publisher=Hoover.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he was given a [[Lysander Spooner]] Award for his book [[Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-130062/Hoover-Fellow-Thomas-Sowell-Receives.html &quot;Hoover Fellow Thomas Sowell Receives Lysander Spooner Award for Applied Economics&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[getAbstract]] awarded his book ''Economic Facts and Fallacies'' with its International Book Award.

===Controversies===
Sowell compared President [[Barack Obama]]'s actions to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s in a June 2010 editorial for ''[[Investor's Business Daily]]'' titled &quot;Is U.S. Now On Slippery Slope To Tyranny?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/537967/201006211813/Is-US-Now-On-Slippery-Slope-To-Tyranny-.aspx Is U.S. Now On Slippery Slope To Tyranny?] ''Investor Business Daily''.&lt;/ref&gt; Sowell described the role of uninformed citizens (&quot;[[useful idiots]]&quot;) in the rise of Hitler and [[Vladimir Lenin]], arguing that the U.S. was on a &quot;slippery slope to tyranny&quot; because citizens were not thinking about the issues.  The example he gave was the creation of a relief fund for the [[BP oil spill]], which he said gave the President an unconstitutional &quot;authority to extract vast sums of money from a private enterprise and distribute it as he sees fit to whomever he deems worthy of compensation.&quot;  This comparison was criticized by liberal groups such as [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/blog/201006220002 Sowell falsely claims Obama essentially &quot;confiscated&quot; $20 billion from BP and compares Obama to Hitler&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Democratic National Committee]], who said that the article would be considered &quot;ridiculous if it weren't so vile,&quot; noting that &quot;it deserves to be marginalized.&quot;&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/39030.html &quot;Sarah Palin praises column linking Obama, Hitler&quot;], [[Politico]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some conservatives endorsed Sowell's comparison.  [[Sarah Palin]] recommended it to her Twitter followers, prompting the President of [[People for the American Way]], Michael B. Keegan, to ask whether Palin &quot;agree[d] with Sowell that President Obama's work to hold BP accountable for the worst oil spill in American history can be compared to the actions of Hitler?&quot;&lt;ref name=Politico /&gt; Republican Representative [[Louie Gohmert]] of [[Texas's 1st congressional district]] recommended the column on the floor of the [[United States House of Representatives]] shortly after the publication of the article.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/rep_louie_gohmert_endorses_bp.html Texas Rep. Gohmert endorses 'BP fund as Nazi enabling act' argument]&quot;, ''The Washington Post'': Right Now.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
''[[The Economist]]'' magazine praised Sowell's books ''[[Affirmative Action Around the World]]'' as &quot;terse, well argued and utterly convincing&quot; and &quot;crammed with striking anecdotes and statistics&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Advantages for the advantaged|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2765848|work=The Economist|date=June 19, 2004|volume=371|issue=8380|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Economic Facts and Fallacies'': &quot;Mr Sowell marshals his arguments with admirable clarity and authority. There is not a chapter in which he does not produce a statistic that both surprises and overturns received wisdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A black and white case|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10424269|work=The Economist|accessdate=July 22, 2011|date=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing Sowell's 1984 book ''Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?'', University of Chicago sociologist [[William Julius Wilson]] said that Sowell did not explore &quot;reasonable alternative explanations and hypotheses&quot; in his critiques of affirmative action. For instance, regarding Sowell's theory that women are underrepresented in fields like law and engineering because of the heavy responsibilities of marriage such as childrearing and other household work: &quot;A plausible alternative to Mr. Sowell's hypothesis on women's pay differentials and occupational segregation is that women are virtually excluded from many desirable positions and therefore crowd into obtainable occupations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 1984&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=William Julius|title=Hurting the Disadvantaged|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/24/books/hurting-the-disadvantaged.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=January 5, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 24, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sowell since then has written on affirmative action in an international context to address such criticisms in two books (Preferential Policies, Affirmative Action Around the World) and has written about pay differentials and occupational segregation in ''Economic Facts and Fallacies''.

[[Patricia Roberts Harris]], who was an official in the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] Administration, once said that Sowell and [[Walter E. Williams]] &quot;don't know what poverty is.&quot; Sowell called her position &quot;a pathetic sign of intellectual bankruptcy,&quot; saying that he &quot;was almost 9 years old before [he] lived in a home with [hot] running water&quot; and that she &quot;was a campus social leader in an 'exclusive sorority' - meaning that it was for middle-class (light-skinned) women&quot; while he worked full-time and went to [the same college] at night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
