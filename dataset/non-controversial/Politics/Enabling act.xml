An '''enabling act''' is a piece of [[legislation]] by which a [[legislative body]] grants an entity which depends on it for authorization or [[legitimacy (law)|legitimacy]] the power to take certain actions. For example, enabling acts often establish [[government agencies]] to carry out specific government policies in a modern nation. The effects of enabling acts from different times and places vary widely.

==In Germany==
The German word for an enabling act is ''Ermächtigungsgesetz''. It usually refers to the [[Enabling Act of 1933|enabling act of March 23, 1933]], which became a cornerstone of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s seizure of power.

=== Acts of 1914-1927 ===
The first enabling act is dated from August 4, 1914 just after the outbreak of World War I. With the vote of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] (the parliament) agreed to give the government certain powers to take the necessary economic measures during the war. Such enabling acts were also common in other countries. The Reichstag had to be informed, and had the right to abolish a decree based on the enabling act. This ensured that the government used its rights with care and only in rare cases was a decree abolished. The parliament retained its right to make law.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Rudolf Huber: ''Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789''. Vol. V: Weltkrieg, Revolution und Reichserneuerung. Verlag W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart et al. 1978, p. 37, 62-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919&amp;ndash;1933), there were several enabling acts: three in 1919, one in 1920 and one in 1921, three in 1923, one in 1926 and one in 1927. The enabling act on 24 February 1923, originally limited until June 1 but extended until October 31, empowered the cabinet to resist the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Constitutional Dictatorship: Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies | first= Clinton Lawrence | last= Rossiter | year= 1948 | page= 45 | publisher= Transaction Publishers | isbn= 978-0-7658-0975-9 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=rsWXgBcTmbwC&amp;pg=PA45 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an enabling act on 13 October 1923 and an enabling act on 8 December 1923 that would last until the dissolution of the Reichstag on 13 March 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Constitutional Failure: Carl Schmitt in Weimar | first= Ellen | last= Kennedy | year= 2004 | page= 150 | publisher= [[Duke University Press]] | isbn= 978-0-8223-3243-5 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=fqYzPDDIrJMC&amp;pg=PA150 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of them had a temporal limit but only vague thematic limits. On the basis of these acts, a vast number of decrees were signed with enormous importance for social and economic life, the judicial system, and taxes. For example, the reform of German currency, the establishment of a single, national railway system and unemployment pay were settled via such decrees (Vollmacht-Verordnungen).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Rudolf Huber: ''Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789''. Vol. VI: Die Weimarer Reichsverfassung. Verlag W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart et al. 1981, p. 438-449.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emminger Reform]] of 4 January 1924 abolished the [[jury]] as [[trier of fact]] and replaced it with a mixed system of [[judge]]s and [[lay judge]]s in [[judiciary of Germany|Germany's judiciary]] which still exists today.

These enabling acts were unconstitutional, as the Weimar constitution did not provide the possibility that one organ (parliament) would transfer its rights to another one (government). But constitutional experts accepted them because they came into existence with a two-thirds majority, the same majority as for constitutional changes. The government had success in gathering those majorities by threatening to call for presidential dictatorial decrees (usually called ''Notverordnungen''), otherwise. In March 1924, the Reichstag wanted to discuss an abolition of decrees (which was granted by the enabling act of February that year). [[Ebert, Friedrich|President Friedrich Ebert]] dismissed parliament to avoid discussion and abolishments.

In later years, since the radicalization of the nationalists (DNVP) in 1928 and the rise of national socialism from 1930, governments failed to gather two-thirds majorities. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning (1930–1932) worked with presidential decrees which replaced most of ordinary legislature, eventually.

The enabling acts had set a poor and dangerous example. But for the government, they had the advantage that they appeared less unconstitutional and dictatorial compared to presidential decrees. Parliament could prefer those acts because they were valid only for a limited time and included mostly a kind of cooperation (e.g., via a special house committee).

=== Enabling act of 1933 ===
The German word ''Ermächtigungsgesetz'' usually refers to the [[Enabling Act of 1933|enabling act of March 23, 1933]], officially ''Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich'' (&quot;Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the State&quot;). It became a cornerstone of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s seizure of power. Unlike, for example, the Wilhelm Marx enabling act of December 1923, Hitler's act
* was limited to four years, not several months
* enabled government not only to create decrees, but even laws and treaties with other countries
* these laws could deviate from the constitution
* there were no thematic limits
* neither any house committee nor the [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] (the common organ of the German regional states) had the right to control, or to abolish these laws
In comparison to the situation of the 1920s, Hitler's [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and his coalition partner [[German National People's Party]] did have a parliamentary majority since the general elections of March 3, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Eilers: ''Ermächtigungsgesetz und militärischer Ausnahmezustand zur Zeit des ersten Kabinetts von Reichskanzler Wilhelm Marx 1923/1924'', PhD thesis Cologne 1987, Cologne 1988, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Those elections and then the voting in the Reichstag were already overshadowed by national socialist terror. On March 23, only the Social Democrat delegates voted against, the Communists were imprisoned, while the Centre and moderate right parties voted yes in order to prevent &quot;worse&quot;.

The enabling act of 1933 was renewed by a purely Nazi Reichstag in 1937 and 1939. In 1941 and 1943 it was renewed by decree, in 1943 without temporal limit. Although it states that it is valid only for the duration of the current Hitler government of 1933, it remained even after severe exchanges of ministers. In any case, Hitler called the cabinet together only very rarely after the first months of 1933-the last cabinet meeting happened in 1937. He preferred to &quot;govern&quot; via decrees and personal orders.

=== Federal Republic ===
In the Federal Republic of Germany, with its 1949 constitution, there have been no enabling acts. The constitution states that it can be only changed by an explicit alteration of the phrasing.

==In the United Kingdom==

After the First World War, an enabling act gave a considerable measure of self-government to the Church of England.

In the 1930s, both Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] and [[Clement Attlee]] advocated an enabling act to allow a future [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government to pass [[socialism|socialist]] legislation which would not be amended by normal parliamentary procedures and the [[House of Lords]]. According to Cripps, his &quot;Planning and Enabling Act&quot; would not be able to be repealed, and the orders made by the government using the act would not be allowed discussion in [[United Kingdom Parliament|Parliament]].

Cripps also suggested measures against the [[British monarchy|monarchy]], but quickly dropped the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/hbtu/chapter_15.html|title=Road to Wigan Pier|accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 [[Oswald Mosley]] advocated a government of national unity drawn from &quot;the professions, from science, from the unions and the managers, from businessmen, the housewives, from the services, from the universities, and even from the best of the politicians&quot;. This coalition would be a &quot;hard centre&quot; oriented one which would also get Parliament to pass an Enabling Act in order to stop what Mosley described as &quot;time-wasting obstructionism of present procedure&quot;. He also claimed that Parliament would always retain the power to dismiss his government by vote of [[censure]] if its policies failed or if it attempted to &quot;override basic British freedoms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oswaldmosley.com/misc_documents/ombfe.htm|title=Oswald Mosley, Briton, Fascist, European|accessdate=29 April 2008
|publisher=OswaldMosley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006 the highly controversial yet little-publicised [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill]] was introduced to Parliament. This Bill, if enacted into law, would have enabled Government ministers to amend or repeal any legislation (including the L&amp;RR Bill itself), subject to vague and highly subjective restraints, by decree and without recourse to Parliament. The Bill was variously described as the ''Abolition of Parliament Bill''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2049791,00.html Who wants the Abolition of Parliament Bill?] The Times, 21 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;...of first-class constitutional significance... [and would] markedly alter the respective and long standing roles of minister and Parliament in the legislative process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Finkelstein |title=How I woke up to a nightmare plot to steal centuries of law and liberty |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2040625,00.html|work=[[The Times]] |date=15 February 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2007 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill is, in essence, an Enabling Act in all but name.

After some amendment by the government and Lords, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill received [[Royal Assent]] on 8 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/regulation/news/2006/061109.asp Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill receives Royal Assent], Press release CAB066/06 from the [[Cabinet Office]], 8 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments included removing its ability to modify itself or the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]; most of the other modifications were much more subjectively defined.

==In the United States==
The term &quot;enabling act&quot; in [[United States law]] is usually in relation to the formation of a new [[U.S. state]]: legislation is passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorizing the people of a [[United States territory|territory]] to frame a [[constitution]]; this act also lays down the requirements that must be met as a prerequisite to statehood.  These Acts have usually been titled &quot;An Enabling Act for a State of (Name)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/slg/statehood.phtml?format=enabling Official Name and Status History of the several States and U.S. Territories], TheGreenPapers.com (listed)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be in relation to the formation of an agency or department.  The [[Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act]] is the enabling Act for the US [[Food and Drug Administration]].

Enabling acts of the United States include:
*[[Enabling Act of 1802]], for the formation of [[Ohio]] from the [[Northwest Territory]]
*[[Enabling Act of 1889]], for the formation of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Montana]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]
*[[Oklahoma Enabling Act | Enabling Act of 1906]] for the formation of [[Oklahoma]] from [[Oklahoma Territory]] and [[Indian Territory]]
*[[Enabling Act of 1910]], for the admission of [[Arizona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/const/enabling.pdf|title=Enabling Act|accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/lcsdocs/163941.pdf Piecemal Amendment of the Constitution of New Mexico 1911 to 2006] Seventeenth Revision, January 2007, New Mexico Legislative Council Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Venezuela==
In [[Venezuela]], enabling laws allowing the President to [[rule by decree]] in selected matters were granted to [[Rómulo Betancourt]] (1959),&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1998:146-7)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] (1974),&lt;ref name=&quot;polar&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fpolar.org.ve/Encarte/fasciculo24/fasc2402.html|title=Historia de Venezuela en Imágenes.

In mid-2000 a similar law enabled [[Hugo Chávez]] to legislate on issues related to the economy, reorganization of government ministries, and crime for one year.  Chávez did not take advantage of this act until shortly before its expiration, when he passed 49 decrees in rapid succession, many of them highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/articles.php?artno=1529|title=Land for People not for Profit in Venezuela|accessdate=29 April 2008|publisher=venezuelanalysis.com|date=23 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2004/07/22/en_pol_art_22A477445.shtml|title=Attorney General's Office admits that Venezuelan government exceeded its authority in enacting Enabling Law|accessdate=29 April 2008|publisher=eluniversal.com|date=22 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/wha/8229.htm|title=Venezuela|accessdate=29 April 2008|publisher=[[U.S Department of State]]|date=4 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a new enabling act granted President Chávez powers for 18 months, giving the president the ability to rule by decree over certain economic, social, territorial, defense, and scientific matters as well as control over transportation, regulations for popular participation, and rules for governing state institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC20070119&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6277379.stm|title=Rule by decree passed for Chavez |accessdate=19 January 2007|publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
