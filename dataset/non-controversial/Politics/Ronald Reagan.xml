'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|ɒ|n|əl|d|_|ˈ|w|ɪ|l|s|ən|_|ˈ|r|eɪ|ɡ|ən}}; February 6, 1911&amp;nbsp;– June 5, 2004) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|40th President of the United States]] (1981–89). Prior to that, he was the [[List of Governors of California|33rd]] [[Governor of California]] (1967–75), and a radio, film and television actor.

Born in [[Tampico, Illinois]], and raised in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]], Reagan was educated at [[Eureka College]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]] and [[sociology]]. After graduating, Reagan moved first to [[Iowa]] to work as a radio broadcaster and then, in 1937, to Los Angeles where he began a career as an actor, first in films and later television. Some of his most notable films include ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]'' (1940), ''[[Kings Row]]'' (1942), and ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'' (1951). Reagan served as President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and later as a spokesman for [[General Electric]] (GE); his start in politics occurred during his work for GE. Originally a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], his positions began shifting rightward in the 1950s, and he switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1962. After delivering [[A Time for Choosing|a rousing speech]] in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|two years later]] and [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|again in 1970]]. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] as well as [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], but won both the nomination and general election in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], defeating incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]].

As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed &quot;[[Reaganomics]]&quot;, advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government spending. In his first term he survived [[Reagan assassination attempt|an assassination attempt]], took a hard line against labor unions, and ordered an [[invasion of Grenada]]. He was re-elected in a [[United States presidential election, 1984|landslide in 1984]], proclaiming that it was &quot;[[Morning in America]]&quot;. His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the [[Cold War]], the [[1986 bombing of Libya]], and the revelation of the [[Iran-Contra affair]]. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an &quot;[[evil empire]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gingrich, Newt|authorlink=Newt Gingrich|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/evil-empire|title=The Evil Empire|publisher=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|date=Spring/Summer 2008|volume=58|issue=4|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of [[détente]] by ordering a massive military buildup in an [[arms race]] with the USSR. Reagan negotiated with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], culminating in the [[INF Treaty]] and the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals.

Reagan left office in 1989. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] earlier in the year; he [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died ten years later]] at the age of 93. A [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] icon, he ranks highly in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents]] and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the American [[political right]].

==Early life==
[[File:Ronald Reagan in Dixon, Illinois, 1920s.jpg|thumb|upright|Ronald Reagan as a teenager in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]], Illinois]]
Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in an apartment on the second floor of a [[Ronald Reagan Birthplace|commercial building]] in [[Tampico, Illinois]] on February 6, 1911, to [[Jack Reagan]] and [[Nelle Wilson Reagan]].&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; Reagan's father was a salesman and a storyteller, the grandson of [[Irish Catholic]] immigrants from [[County Tipperary]]&lt;ref&gt;Terry Golway, ''Ronald Reagan's America'' (2008) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother had [[Scottish people|Scots]] and English ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Kengor, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan had one sibling, his older brother, [[Neil Reagan|Neil]]
(1908–1996), who became an advertising executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Neil Reagan, 88, Ad Executive And Jovial Brother of President|author=Lynette Holloway|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/us/neil-reagan-88-ad-executive-and-jovial-brother-of-president.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 13, 1996|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, Reagan's father nicknamed his son &quot;Dutch&quot;, due to his &quot;fat little Dutchman&quot;-like appearance, and his &quot;Dutchboy&quot; haircut;&lt;ref name=&quot;RRfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/facts.html|title=Ronald Reagan Facts|accessdate=June 9, 2007|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRfacts&quot;/&gt; Reagan's family briefly lived in several towns and cities in Illinois, including [[Monmouth, Illinois|Monmouth]], [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]] and [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3637552-418/reagan-university-president-park-building.html|title=Is Ronald Reagan's Chicago boyhood home doomed?|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=June 12, 2012|author=Janssen, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1919, when they returned to Tampico and lived above the [[H.C. Pitney Variety Store]].&lt;ref name=nrhp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/201351.pdf|title= Main Street Historic District, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form|date=April 1, 1982|agency=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|accessdate=July 27, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070807213939/http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/201351.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his election as president, residing in the upstairs White House private quarters, Reagan would quip that he was &quot;living above the store again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/06/06/reagan_all_american_dies_at_93/|title=Reagan, all-American, dies at 93|date=June 6, 2004|author=Schribman, David|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Kengor]], author of ''God and Ronald Reagan'', Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people, which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother, Nelle,&lt;ref name=&quot;pk 16&quot;&gt;Kengor, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Disciples of Christ]] faith,&lt;ref name=&quot;pk 16&quot;/&gt; which he was baptized into in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Lewis, Warren and Rollmann, Hans|title=Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2005|isbn=1-59752-416-6|pages=181–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the time, Reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination, and recalled a time in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]] when the local inn would not allow [[black people]] to stay there. Reagan brought them back to his house, where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;Kengor, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920, the Reagans moved to Dixon;&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2001), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; the midwestern &quot;small universe&quot; had a lasting impression on Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Dixon High School (Illinois)|Dixon High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/spring/schoolhouse.html|title=School House to White House: The Education of the Presidents|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed interests in acting, sports, and storytelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn bio&quot;/&gt; His first job was as a lifeguard at the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] in Lowell Park, near Dixon, in 1927.

He developed a reputation as a jack of all trades, excelling in campus politics, sports and theater. He was a member of the football team,  captain of the swim team and was elected student body president. As student president, Reagan led a student revolt against the college president after he tried to cut back the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2003), p. 25; Reagan (1990) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and film===
[[File:26YearOld Ronald Reagan in Hollywood 1937.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2:13|Trailer from ''Love is on the Air'' starring Reagan, 1937]]
After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan drove himself to Iowa, where he auditioned for a job at many small-town radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt; The [[University of Iowa]] hired him to broadcast home football games for the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Hawkeyes]]. He was paid $10 per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt; Soon after, a staff announcer's job opened at radio station [[WOC (AM)|WOC]] in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], and Reagan was hired, now earning $100 per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt; Aided by his persuasive voice,&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt; he moved to [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] radio in [[Des Moines]] as an announcer for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball games.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games that the station received by wire.&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt;

While traveling with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven-year contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/a_hero.asp|title=Biography &gt; A Hero from the Heartland|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071031092212/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/a_hero.asp|archivedate=October 31, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the &quot;[[B movie|B film]]&quot; unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers &quot;didn't want them good, they wanted them Thursday&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt; While sometimes overshadowed by other actors, Reagan's screen performances did receive many good reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Kings Row (1942)-trailer.ogv|thumb|left|thumbtime=1:36|Reagan in ''[[Kings Row]]'', which gave a brief boost to his career, in 1942. Trailer from the film.]]
His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie ''[[Love Is on the Air]]'', and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|title=Ronald Reagan &gt; Hollywood Years|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|accessdate=March 28, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312120428/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|archivedate=March 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Dark Victory]]''. Before the film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' in 1940, he played the role of [[George Gipp|George &quot;The Gipper&quot; Gipp]] in the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname &quot;the Gipper&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon15&quot;&gt;Cannon (2001), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8208562|title=CUPID'S INFLUENCE ON THE FILM BOX-OFFICE.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1956)]]|location=Melbourne, Vic.|date=4 October 1941|accessdate=24 April 2012|page=7 Supplement: The Argus Week-end Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942's ''[[Kings Row]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Rest of Me&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reagan|first=Ronald|title=Where's the Rest of Me?|year=1965|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York|isbn=0-283-98771-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he recites the line, &quot;Where's the rest of me?&quot;, later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Many film critics considered ''Kings Row'' to be his best movie,&lt;ref name='TCMarticle'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=17922|title=Kings Row|accessdate=March 24, 2009|last=Wood|first=Brett|work=TCM website|publisher=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the film was condemned by ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 3, 1942|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E2DE143BE33BBC4B53DFB4668389659EDE|title=The Screen; 'Kings Row,' With Ann Sheridan and Claude Rains, a Heavy, Rambling Film, Has Its First Showing Here at the Astor|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2003), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Reagan called ''Kings Row'' the film that &quot;made me a star&quot;,&lt;ref name='Friedrich'&gt;{{Cite book|last =Friedrich|first =Otto|title =City of nets: a portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s|publisher=University of California Press (reprint)|year =1997|pages =86–89|url =http://books.google.com/?id=1Y9uZw7YNK8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=city+of+nets|isbn =978-0-520-20949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was unable to capitalize on his success because he was ordered to active duty with the U.S. Army at San Francisco two months after its release, and never regained &quot;star&quot; status in motion pictures.&lt;ref name='Friedrich'/&gt; In the post-war era, after being separated from almost four years of World War II stateside service with the 1st Motion Picture Unit in December 1945, Reagan co-starred in such films as, ''[[The Voice of the Turtle (film)|The Voice of the Turtle]]'', ''[[John Loves Mary]]'', ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', ''[[Cattle Queen of Montana]]'', ''[[Tennessee's Partner]]'', ''[[Hellcats of the Navy]]'' and ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (his final film) in a 1964 remake.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/|title=Ronald Reagan|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his film career, his mother often answered much of his fan mail.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, et. al. (2003), p. 836&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
After completing fourteen home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/usar-history.htm|title=U.S. Army Reserve – History|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Global Security.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on April 29, 1937, as a [[Private (rank)#United States|private]] assigned to Troop B, 322nd [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] at [[Des Moines, Iowa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reagan in the Military&quot;/&gt; He was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|second lieutenant]] in the Officers Reserve Corps of the cavalry on May 25, 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACR Homepage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irwin.army.mil/Units/11TH+Armored+Cavalry+Regiment/11thACR/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070701172746/http://www.irwin.army.mil/Units/11TH+Armored+Cavalry+Regiment/11thACR/|archivedate=July 1, 2007|publisher=11th Armored Cavalry Regiment|title=History of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment|accessdate=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time on April 18, 1942.

==Early political career==
Reagan began his political career as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. However, in the early 1950s, as his relationship with Republican actress Nancy Davis grew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/870/000022804/|title=Nancy Reagan|publisher=Nndb.com|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/109910|title=An American Life: The Autobiography by Ronald Reagan|publisher=LibraryThing|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he shifted to the right and, while remaining a Democrat, endorsed the presidential candidacies of [[Dwight D.

Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, &quot;we will awake to find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRdLpem-AAs|title=Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JohnL|url=http://texasbestgrok.mu.nu/archives/038360.php|title=Operation Coffee Cup|publisher=TexasBestGrok|date=July 23, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rapaport, June 21, 2009, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/18/INME187IB0.DTL How AMA 'Coffeecup' gave Reagan a boost].

Reagan endorsed the campaign of conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964. Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech delivered on October 27, 1964: &quot;The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs-tfc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/40_reagan/psources/ps_choose64.html|title=A Time for Choosing|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said, &quot;You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right.

In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: &quot;to send the welfare bums back to work&quot;, and, in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment [[Free Speech Movement|student protests]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], &quot;to clean up the mess at Berkeley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kahn, Jeffery|publisher=UC Berkeley News|date=June 8, 2004|title=Ronald Reagan launched political career using the Berkeley campus as a target|accessdate=March 30, 2007|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/06/08_reagan.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected, defeating two-term governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown]], and was sworn in on January 2, 1967.

Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. On May 15, 1969, during the [[People's Park#15 May 1969 – &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;|People's Park protests]] at UC Berkeley, Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests, in an incident that became known as &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;, resulting in the death of student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html|accessdate=December 9, 2007|date=February 16, 1970|title=Postscript to People's Park|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan then called out 2,200 [[United States National Guard|state National Guard]] troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon50&quot;&gt;Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; A year after &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;, Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying, &quot;If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with.

Democratic California state senator [[Anthony Beilenson]] introduced the &quot;Therapeutic Abortion Act&quot;, in an effort to reduce the number of &quot;back-room abortions&quot; performed in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon50&quot;/&gt; The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon51&quot;&gt;Cannon (2001), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon51&quot;/&gt; Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and stated that had he been more experienced as governor, it would not have been signed. After he recognized what he called the &quot;consequences&quot; of the bill, he announced that he was [[pro-life]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon51&quot;/&gt; He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald.

Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/13/local/me-history13 Recall Idea Got Its Start in L.A. in 1898], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 13, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating &quot;Big Daddy&quot; [[Jesse Unruh]]. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment, which he strongly supported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rest of Me&quot;/&gt; His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[California v. Anderson|People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when [[Aaron Mitchell (murderer)|Aaron Mitchell]]'s sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin|San Quentin's]] gas chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412–418|publisher=|month=May|year=1967|doi=10.2307/3479351|jstor=3479351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Reagan, as Governor, signed the ''Family Law Act'' which was the first [[no fault divorce#United States history|no fault divorce]] legislation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;1969 Cal. Stats. chapter 1608, page 3313&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending &quot;the welfare bums back to work&quot;, he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by Democratic [[California Secretary of State]] [[Jerry Brown]] on January 6, 1975.

==1976 presidential campaign==

[[File:1976 Republican National Convention.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan on the podium with Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention after narrowly losing the presidential nomination.]]

In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the [[American Conservative Union]] which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|title=Biography of Gerald R. Ford|publisher=The White House|accessdate=March 29, 2007}} Ford considered himself a &quot;a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool internationalist in foreign affairs&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]] of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=September 24, 1979|accessdate=May 10, 2008|title=Candidate Reagan is Born Again|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947391-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;1976 Results&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061006023552/http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archivedate=October 6, 2006|title=1976 New Hampshire presidential Primary, February 24, 1976 Republican Results|publisher=New Hampshire Political Library|accessdate=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all ninety-six delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including [[Ernest Angelo]], the mayor of [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Ray Barnhart]] of [[Houston]], whom President Reagan tapped in 1981 as director of the [[Federal Highway Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hathorn Billy|year =2010|title =Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96–0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976|journal=[[West Texas Historical Association]] Yearbook|volume =86|pages =77–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the GOP [[1976 Republican National Convention|convention]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of Pennsylvania as his [[running mate]] if nominated. Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.&lt;ref name=&quot;1976 Results&quot;/&gt; Ford would go on to lose the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 Presidential election]] to the Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]].

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a [[faithless elector]] in the November election from the state of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1976|title=Electoral College Box Scores 1789–1996|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Admin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Ford had won over Democratic challenger [[Jimmy Carter]].

Reagan won the election, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.). Reagan received 50.7% of the popular vote while Carter took 41%, and Independent [[John B.

During the presidential campaign, questions were raised by reporters on Reagan's stance on the [[Briggs Initiative]], also known as Proposition 6, a ballot initiative in Reagan's home state of California where he was governor, which would have banned gays, lesbians, and supporters of [[LGBT rights]] from working in public schools in California. His opposition to the initiative was instrumental in its landslide defeat by Californian voters. Reagan published an editorial in which he stated &quot;homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles...&quot; and that prevailing scientific opinion was that a child's sexual orientation cannot be influenced by someone else.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald-Examiner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last =Reagan|first =Ronald|title =Editorial: Two Ill-advised California Trends|page =A19|work =Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|date =November 1, 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan implemented policies based on [[supply-side economics]] and advocated a [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Karaagac, John|title=Ronald Reagan and Conservative Reformism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZFhGnjKqjgAC&amp;pg=PA113|isbn=0-7391-0296-6|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2000|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking to stimulate the economy with large, across-the-board [[tax cuts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon99&quot;&gt;Cannon (2001) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, pp. 146–48&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported returning the U.S. to some sort of [[gold standard]], and successfully urged Congress to establish the U.S. Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented. Citing the economic theories of [[Arthur Laffer]], Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as the [[Laffer curve]]. Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of &quot;[[peace through strength]]&quot; (also described as &quot;firm but fair&quot;) resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;apsr&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bartels, Larry M.|title=Constituency Opinion and Congressional Policy Making: The Reagan Defense Build Up|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=June 1, 1991|volume=85|issue=2|pages=457–474|doi=10.2307/1963169|issn=0003-0554|first=L.

Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, [[Al Angrisani]], was a primary architect of the bill. The [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, further reduced the top rate  to 28%, raised the bottom bracket from 11% to 15%, and, cut the number of tax brackets to 4. 

Conversely, Congress passed and Reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]] (TEFRA), [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 1984]] (DEFRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200310290853.asp Bruce Bartlett on Tax Increases &amp; Reagan on NRO Financial].

During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the US intelligence community to ensure America's economic strength. The program, [[Project Socrates]], developed and demonstrated the means required for the US to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation. To ensure that the US acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new Federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nation-wide basis. However, Reagan's term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as &quot;industrial policy&quot;, had it terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first =Gene|last =Koprowski|title =Tech Intelligence Revival?

American peacekeeping forces in [[Beirut]], a part of [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|a multinational force]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] who had been earlier deployed by Reagan, were attacked on October 23, 1983. The [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Beirut barracks bombing]] resulted in the deaths of 241 American servicemen and the wounding of more than 60 others by a suicide truck bomber. Reagan sent a White House team to the site four days later, led by his Vice President, George H.W. Bush.

====1984 presidential campaign====

[[File:ElectoralCollege1984.svg|thumb|1984 presidential electoral votes by state. Reagan (red) won every state except for Mondale's home state of [[Minnesota]] (and Washington, D.C.)]]

Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in [[Dallas]], Texas, on a wave of positive feeling. He proclaimed that it was &quot;[[Morning in America|morning again in America]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;agpi&quot;/&gt; regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], among other things. He became the first American president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sok.se/inenglish/losangeles1984.4.18ea16851076df63622800011008.html|title=Los Angeles 1984|publisher=Swedish Olympic Committee|accessdate=March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp|title=The Debate: Mondale vs. Reagan|work=National Review|date=October 4, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070416191912/http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt;|archivedate=April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/newshour/84_1stprez-analysis.html|title=Reaction to first Mondale/Reagan debate|publisher=PBS|date=October 8, 1984|accessdate=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, &quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign.

That November, Reagan was re-elected, winning 49 of 50 states.&lt;ref name=&quot;84 results&quot;/&gt; The president's overwhelming victory saw Mondale carry only his home state of Minnesota (by 3800 votes) and the District of Columbia.

===Second term, 1985–1989===
[[File:President Reagan being sworn in for second term in the rotunda at the U.S. Capitol 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan is sworn in for a second term as president in the Capitol Rotunda]]
Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] the following day. January 21 was one of the [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|coldest days on record]] in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, moving [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[James Baker]] to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary [[Donald Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer, Chief of Staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver, Jr., &quot;Briefing&quot;|work=[[The New York Times]], June 5, 1982|accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

In 1985, Reagan visited a German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]] to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of the [[Waffen-SS]]. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves &quot;victims&quot;, a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of [[the Holocaust]]; [[Pat Buchanan]], Reagan's Director of Communications, argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Pat|authorlink =Pat Buchanan|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|title=Pat Buchanan's Response to Norman Podhoretz's OP-ED|publisher=The Internet Brigade|year=1999|accessdate=September 3, 2007|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070927193354/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|archivedate =September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl. He ultimately attended the ceremony where two military generals laid a wreath.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

====War on Drugs====
{{Main|War on Drugs}}
Midway into his second term, Reagan declared more militant policies in the War on Drugs. He said that &quot;drugs were menacing our society&quot; and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Lamar, Jacob V., Jr|title=Rolling Out the Big Guns|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 22, 1986|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html|accessdate=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/crime09.htm|title=The Drug War as Race War|accessdate=April 11, 2007|author=Randall, Vernellia R.|date=April 18, 2006|publisher=The University of Dayton School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya bombing====
{{Main|1986 Bombing of Libya}}
Relations between Libya and the U.S. under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|Gulf of Sidra incident]] in 1981; by 1982, Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was considered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]],&lt;ref name=iokp; /&gt; part of a group known as the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;&lt;ref name=iokp;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925697,00.htm|title=Libya: Fury in the Isolation Ward|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 23, 1982|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also labeled as &quot;our international public enemy number one&quot; by a CIA official.&lt;ref name=iokp; /&gt; These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, when a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothèque, resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs-libya&quot;/&gt; Stating that there was &quot;irrefutable proof&quot; that Libya had directed the &quot;terrorist bombing&quot;, Reagan authorized the use of force against the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs-libya&quot;/&gt; In the late evening of April 15, 1986, the U.S. launched a series of [[air strike]]s on ground targets in Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs-libya&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/el_dorado_canyon.htm|title=Operation El Dorado Canyon|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|date=April 25, 2005|accessdate=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;4-15&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_3975000/3975455.stm|title=1986:US Launches air-strike on Libya|accessdate=April 19, 2008|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=[[BBC News Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] allowed the US Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the attack, on the justification that the UK was supporting America's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.&lt;ref name=&quot;4-15&quot; /&gt; The attack was designed to halt Gaddafi's &quot;ability to export terrorism&quot;, offering him &quot;incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs-libya&quot;/&gt; The president addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]] after the attacks had commenced, stating, &quot;When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;4-15&quot;/&gt; The attack was condemned by many countries. By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 41/38 which &quot;condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on 15 April 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r038.htm A/RES/41/38 November 20 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration====
Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Graham, Otis|date=January 27, 2003|url=http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html|title=Ronald Reagan's Big Mistake|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, &quot;The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society.

President Reagan professed ignorance of the plot's existence. He appointed two Republicans and one Democrat ([[John Tower]], [[Brent Scowcroft]] and [[Edmund Muskie]], known as the &quot;Tower Commission&quot;) to investigate the scandal.

By the early 1980s, many people in the US perceived that the USSR military capabilities were gaining on that of the United States. Previously, the U.S. had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed.&lt;ref name=&quot;us-ussr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/EM27.cfm|title=New Evidence of Moscow's Military Threat|accessdate=May 13, 2007|author=Hamm, Manfred R.|date=June 23, 1983|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm|title=Reagan and the Russians|date=February, 1994|work=The Atlantic|author=Lebow, Richard Ned and Janice Gross Stein|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; their large military expenses, in combination with [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivized agriculture]] and inefficient [[planned economy|planned manufacturing]], were a heavy burden for the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaidar&quot;/&gt; At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iet.ru/files/persona/gaidar/un_en.htm|title=Public Expectations and Trust towards the Government: Post-Revolution Stabilization and its Discontents|accessdate=March 15, 2008|author=Gaidar, Yegor}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in a drop of oil prices in 1985 to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaidar&quot;/&gt; These factors gradually brought the Soviet economy to a stagnant state during [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]'s tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaidar&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gaidar, Yegor|title=Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2007|isbn=5-8243-0759-8|language=Russian|pages=190–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan recognized the change in the direction of the Soviet leadership with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and shifted to diplomacy, with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knopf&quot;/&gt; Reagan's personal mission was to achieve &quot;a world free of nuclear weapons&quot;, which he regarded as &quot;totally irrational, totally inhumane, good for nothing but killing, possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization&quot;.&lt;ref name=huff-giu&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/07/giulianis-obama-nuke-crit_n_528439.html Giuliani's Obama-Nuke Critique Defies And Ignores Reagan], Huffington Post 04- 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy], Heritage.org, July 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS9510/&gt; He was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with General Secretary Gorbachev.&lt;ref name=HS9510&gt;&quot;Hyvästi, ydinpommi,&quot; [[Helsingin Sanomat]] 2010-09-05, pp. D1-D2&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev and Reagan held [[List of Soviet Union–United States summits#Cold War (1985–1991)|four summit conferences]] between 1985 and 1988: the [[Geneva Summit (1985)|first]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], the [[Reykjavík Summit|second]] in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], the third in Washington, D.C., and the fourth in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/world/toward-the-summit-previous-reagan-gorbachev-summits.html|title=Toward The Summit; Previous Reagan-Gorbachev Summits|accessdate=January 26, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 29, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this would lead to reform and the end of Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1982reagan1.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: Ronald Reagan: Evil Empire Speech, June 8, 1982|accessdate=November 15, 2007|publisher=Fordham University|month=May|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at the [[Berlin Wall]] on June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further, saying:

[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev signing.jpg|thumb|left|Gorbachev and Reagan sign the [[INF Treaty]] at the White House in 1987]]
Prior to Gorbachev visiting Washington, D.C., for the third summit in 1987, the Soviet leader announced his intention to pursue significant arms agreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;gorby concessions&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/02/world/gorbachev-offer-2-other-arms-hints.html?pagewanted=all|title=Gorbachev Offer 2: Other Arms Hints|date=March 2, 1987|accessdate=March 17, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Keller, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the U.S. on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;gorby concessions&quot;/&gt; He and Reagan signed the [[INF Treaty|Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty]] at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/inf1.html#treaty|title=INF Treaty|accessdate=May 28, 2007|publisher=US State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or [[START I]]; Reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets. A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. &quot;No&quot;, he replied, &quot;I was talking about another time, another era.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Talbott, Strobe|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 5, 1991|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973554-5,00.html|title=The Summit Goodfellas|accessdate=January 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Gorbachev's request, Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 713&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, ''[[An American Life]]'', Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for Gorbachev.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 720&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1989, the [[Berlin Wall]] was [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|torn down]], the Cold War was officially declared over at the [[Malta Summit]] on December 3, 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm|title=1989: Malta summit ends Cold War|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=December 3, 1984|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.

Early in his presidency, Reagan started wearing a custom, technologically advanced [[hearing aid]], first in his right ear&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=June 13, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Reagan Begins to Wear a Hearing Aid in Public|author=Weisman, Steven R|date=September 8, 1983|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/us/reagan-begins-to-wear-a-hearing-aid-in-public.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in his left as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=UPI|accessdate=June 13, 2008|date=March 21, 1985|title=Reagan Begins Using A Second Hearing Aid|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/21/us/reagan-begins-using-a-second-hearing-aid.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small, audio-amplifying device boosted their sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-08-09-austin-hearing-aid_x.htm|title=He amplifies hearing aids|accessdate=June 13, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Friess, Steve|date=August 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] to remove cancerous [[Polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from his [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. He relinquished presidential power to the Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], which he specifically avoided invoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/812.html|title=What is the 25th Amendment and When Has It Been Invoked?|publisher=History News Network|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bumgarner, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day.&lt;ref&gt;Bumgarner, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/us/irritated-skin-is-removed-from-side-of-reagan-s-nose.html|title='Irritated Skin' is Removed from Side of Reagan's Nose|accessdate=June 13, 2008|author=Boyd, Gerald M|date=August 2, 1985|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, additional skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/weekinreview/balancing-the-budget-and-politics-more-cancer-on-reagan-s-nose.html|title=Balancing the Budget and Politics; More Cancer on Reagan's Nose|accessdate=June 13, 2008|date=October 13, 1987|author=Herron, Caroline Rand and Michael Wright|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1987, Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged [[prostate]] which caused further worries about his health.

===Judiciary===
{{Main|Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidates|Ronald Reagan judicial appointments}}
During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, if given the opportunity, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice [[Potter Stewart]]. In his second term, Reagan elevated [[William Rehnquist]] to succeed [[Warren Burger]] as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], and named [[Antonin Scalia]] to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist [[Robert Bork]] to the high court in 1987. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Washington; Kennedy And Bork|accessdate=April 28, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/opinion/washington-kennedy-and-bork.html|author=Reston, James|date=July 5, 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Greenhouse, Linda|title=Bork's Nomination Is Rejected, 58–42; Reagan 'Saddened'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/bork-s-nomination-is-rejected-58-42-reagan-saddened.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 1987|accessdate=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan then nominated [[Douglas H.

Reagan also nominated [[Vaughn R.

==Legacy==
[[File:Ronald Reagan with cowboy hat 12-0071M edit.jpg|thumb|Ronald Reagan in 1976 at his home at [[Rancho del Cielo]]]]
Since Reagan left office in 1989, substantial debate has occurred among scholars, historians, and the general public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reaganomics,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, pp. 635–38&lt;/ref&gt; foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War after Reagan's eight years in office,&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; and a restoration of American pride and morale.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon746&quot;/&gt; Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in huge budget deficits,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon128&quot;/&gt; a wider [[Wealth inequality in the United States|gap in wealth]], and an increase in [[homelessness]]&lt;ref name =&quot;DreierNation&quot;&gt;[http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2011/042011/04032011/605895/printer_friendly Don't add Reagan's Face to Mount Rushmore] by Dr. Peter Dreier, ''[[The Nation]]'', April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Iran-Contra affair lowered American credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilman, Larry|url=http://www.espionageinfo.com/Int-Ke/Iran-Contra-Affair.html|title=Iran-Contra Affair|publisher=Advameg|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ongoing debates, Reagan has ranked among the most popular of all modern U.S. presidents in public opinion polls.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc polls&quot;/&gt;

Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policy makers and journalists differ as well. [[Edwin Feulner]], President of [[The Heritage Foundation]], said that Reagan &quot;helped create a safer, freer world&quot; and said of his economic policies: &quot;He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feulner, Edwin J., PhD|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Mark Weisbrot]], co-Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], contended that Reagan's &quot;economic policies were mostly a failure&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weisbrot, Mark|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Howard Kurtz]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Reagan was &quot;a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html|title=Reagan: The Retake|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics. Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus,&lt;ref&gt;David Henry in ''Journal of American History'' December 2009 v. 96#3 p. 934&lt;/ref&gt; as summarized by British historian M. J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American self-respect, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Heale, M.J. in Cheryl Hudson and Gareth Davies, eds.

He was notable amongst post–World War II presidents as being convinced that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knopf&quot;/&gt; a conviction that was vindicated by [[Gennadi Gerasimov]], the Foreign Ministry spokesman under Gorbachev, who said that Star Wars was &quot;very successful blackmail. ...

As a sitting president, Reagan did not have the highest approval ratings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html?printVersion=true|title=How the Presidents Stack Up|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=September 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 [[Rasmussen Reports]] poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by United Kingdom newspaper ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/02/19/politics/main273106.shtml|title=Reagan Tops Presidential Poll|publisher=CBS|accessdate=September 7, 2007|date=February 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/wh-hstry.htm|title=Presidents and History|publisher=Polling Report|accessdate=March 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/post_war_presidents_jfk_ike_reagan_most_popular|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011174301/http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/post_war_presidents_jfk_ike_reagan_most_popular|archivedate=October 11, 2007|title=Post-War Presidents: JFK, Ike, Reagan Most Popular|accessdate=November 10, 2008|publisher=Rasmussen Reports }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Siena College]] survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lw.siena.edu/sri/results/2002/02AugPresidentsSurvey.htm|title=Presidential Survey|accessdate=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5048771.ece|title=The top ten – The Times US presidential rankings|date=October 31, 2008|work=The Times|location=UK|accessdate=January 12, 2009|first=Nico|last=Hines}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual ''[[C-SPAN]] Survey of Presidential Leaders'' ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president.
