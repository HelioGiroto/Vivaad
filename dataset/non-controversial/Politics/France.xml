[[Metropolitan France]] extends from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[English Channel]] and the [[North Sea]], and from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. From its shape, it is often referred to in French as ''{{lang|fr|l’Hexagone}}'' (&quot;The [[Hexagon]]&quot;).

France is the largest country in Western Europe and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. It possesses the second-largest [[exclusive economic zone]] in the world.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of France}}

The name &quot;France&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Francia}}'', which means &quot;country of the [[Franks]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/DF_history.shtml |title=History of France |publisher=Discoverfrance.net |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word ''frankon'' which translates as ''javelin'' or ''lance'' as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a [[francisca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Blair |first2=Claude |last1=Tarassuk |first1=Leonid |url=http://books.google.com/?id=UJbyPwAACAAJ |year=1982 |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Arms and Weapons: the most comprehensive reference work ever published on arms and armor from prehistoric times to the present with over 1,250 illustrations |page=186 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0-671-42257-X |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], Frank means ''free'' as opposed to [[Slavery|slave]].

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory of France}}
[[File:Lascaux2.jpg|thumb|left|One of the paintings of [[Lascaux]] which represents a horse ([[Dordogne]], approximately 18,000 BC).]]
The oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1,800,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean Carpentier 1987 p.17&quot;&gt;Jean Carpentier (dir.), François Lebrun (dir.), Alain Tranoy, Élisabeth Carpentier et Jean-Marie Mayeur (préface de Jacques Le Goff), Histoire de France, Points Seuil, coll. « Histoire », Paris, 2000 (1re éd. 1987), p. 17 ISBN 2-02-010879-8&lt;/ref&gt; Men were then confronted by a hard and variable climate, marked by several glacial eras which modified their framework of life and led them to a [[nomad]]ic life of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters-gatherers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean Carpentier 1987 p.17&quot;/&gt; France counts a large number of decorated caves from the [[upper Paleolithic]] era, including one of the most famous and best preserved: [[Lascaux]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean Carpentier 1987 p.17&quot;/&gt; ([[Dordogne]], approximately 18,000 BC).

At the end of the [[Last glacial period]] (10,000 BC), the climate softened&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean Carpentier 1987 p.17&quot;/&gt; and from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the [[Neolithic]] era and its inhabitants became [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]]. After a strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially with the work of gold, copper and bronze, and later with iron.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, pp. 20–24&lt;/ref&gt; France counts numerous [[megalith]]ic sites from the Neolithic period, including the exceptionally dense [[Carnac stones]] site ([[Morbihan]], approximately 3,300 BC).

===Gaul===
{{main|Gaul|Roman Gaul}}

In 600 BC, [[Ionia]]n [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|Greeks]], originating from [[Phocaea]], founded the [[Greek colonies|colony of Massalia]] (present-day [[Marseille]]), on the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], making it the oldest city of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge ancient history&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA754 |title=The Cambridge ancient history|page=754 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=23 January 2011|isbn=978-0-521-08691-2|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orrieux&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b8cA8hymTw8C&amp;pg=PA62 |title=A history of ancient Greece|author=Claude Orrieux |page=62 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 1999|accessdate=23 January 2011|isbn=978-0-631-20309-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated some parts of the current territory of France, but this occupation spread in the rest of France only between the 5th and 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gaule -59.png|thumb|right|Gallic tribes before the [[Gallic Wars|Roman conquest]] (58 [[Anno Domini|BC]] to 51 BC). Note that [[Gallia Narbonensis|Southern Gaul]] was already under Roman control (yellow) in 59 BC.]]
[[File:271 Maison carr e NIM 1016.jpg|thumb|The [[Maison Carrée]] was a temple of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] city of Nemausus (present-day [[Nîmes]]) and is one of the best preserved vestiges of the [[Roman Empire]].]]
The concept of [[Gaul]] emerged at that time; it corresponds to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the [[Rhine]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the Mediterranean Sea. The borders of modern France are approximately the same as those of ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by [[Celts|Celt]]ic ''Gauls''. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman influences. However, around 390 BC, the Gallic [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]] and his troops made their way to Italy through the [[Alps]], defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of the Allia]], and besieged and [[ransom]]ed Rome.

The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened and encouraged several subdued Italian tribes to rebel. One by one, over the course of the next 50 years, these tribes were defeated and brought back under Roman dominion. The Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC, when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome. But the Romans and the Gauls would maintain an adversarial relationship for the next several centuries and the Gauls would remain a threat in [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italia]].

Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region ''{{lang|la|Provincia Romana}}'' (&quot;Roman Province&quot;), which over time evolved into the name [[Provence]] in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZEIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 |title=Life magazine, 13&amp;nbsp;July 1953, p. 76 |publisher=Google Books |date=13 July 1953 |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brennus' siege of Rome was still remembered by Romans, when [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, p.44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaul was divided by [[Augustus]] into Roman provinces, the principal ones being [[Gallia Narbonensis]] in the south, [[Gallia Aquitania]] in the south-west, [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] in the center and [[Gallia Belgica]] in the north.&lt;ref name=c53&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities were founded during the [[Roman Gaul|Gallo-Roman period]], including Lugdunum (present-day [[Lyon]]), which is considered to be the capital of the Gauls.&lt;ref name=c53/&gt; These cities were built in the traditional Roman style, with a [[Roman Forum|forum]], a theatre, a [[circus]], an [[amphitheatre]] and [[thermal bath]]s. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted [[Romance languages|Roman]] speech ([[Latin]], from which the French language evolved) and Roman culture. The [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] merged with the [[Celtic polytheism|Gallic paganism]] into the same [[syncretism]].

Around the 3rd century AD, Roman Gaul underwent a serious crisis with its &quot;[[limes]]&quot; (fortified borders protecting the Empire) crossed on several occasions by [[Barbarian]]s.&lt;ref name=c77&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crisis of the Third Century|weakness of the central imperial power]], at this time, led Gallo-Roman leaders to proclaim the independence of the short-lived [[Gallic Empire]],&lt;ref name=c77/&gt; which ended with the [[Battle of Châlons (274)|Battle of Châlons]] in 274, which saw Gaul reincorporated in the Roman Empire.

Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, pp. 79–82&lt;/ref&gt; In 312, the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantin I]] converted to Christianity. Christians, persecuted until then, multiplied across the entire Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; But, from the second half of the 4th century, the [[Migration Period|Barbarian Invasions]] started again,&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], such as the [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Alans]] crossed the Rhine and settled in Gaul, Spain and other parts of the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapsing Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier et al 2000, pp. 84–88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|Frankish expansion from the early [[Clovis I]]' kingdom (481) to the divisions of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's Empire]] (843/870).]]

At the end of the [[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]] period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms ([[Francia#Origins|Early Francia]] (North), [[Alamannia]] (North-East), [[Burgundians|Burgundia]] (East), [[Septimania]] (South), [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Aquitania]] (South East)) and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the [[Domain of Soissons|Kingdom of Syagrius]] (West). Simultaneously, [[Britons (historical)|Celtic Britons]], fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]] of ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]'', settled the western part of [[Armorica]] (far West of Gaul). As a result, the Armorican [[List of peninsulas|peninsula]] was renamed [[Brittany]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]] was revived and independent [[petty kingdom]]s arose in this region.

The pagan [[Franks]], from whom the ancient name of &quot;Francie&quot; was derived, originally settled the northern part of [[Gaul]], but under [[Clovis I]] conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central Gaul. In 498, Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than [[Arianism]]; thus France was given the title &quot;Eldest daughter of the Church&quot; (''{{lang-fr|La fille aînée de l’Église}}'') by the papacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html |title=Faith of the Eldest Daughter – Can France retain her Catholic heritage? |publisher=Wf-f.org |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French kings would be called &quot;the Most Christian Kings of France&quot; (''{{lang|und|Rex Christianissimus}}'').

[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|With Clovis' conversion to Catholicism in 498, the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish monarchy]], [[Elective monarchy|elective]] and [[Secularism|secular]] until then, became [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].]]

The Franks embraced the Christian [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman heritage]] and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed ''[[Francia]]'' (&quot;Land of the Franks&quot;). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]], except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where [[Germanic languages]] emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]], but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Reims|Rheims]]. The last Merovingian kings, sometimes referred as ''[[Roi fainéant|Rois fainéants]]'' (&quot;lazy kings&quot;), [[Power behind the throne|effectively lost power]] to their [[Mayor of the Palace|mayors of the palace]]. One mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated a [[Islamic invasion of Gaul|Muslim invasion]] force from [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, [[Pepin the Short]], eventually seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Pepin's son, [[Charlemagne]], reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe.

The efficient administration of this immense empire was ensured by high-level civil servants, carrying the, then non-hereditary, titles of [[count]]s (in charge of a County), [[Marquess|marquis]] (in charge of a [[March (territory)|March]]), [[duke]]s (military commanders), etc.

Charlemagne's son, [[Louis the Pious|Louis I]] (emperor 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the [[Treaty of Verdun]], the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with [[East Francia]] going to [[Louis the German]], [[Middle Francia]] to [[Lothair I]], and [[West Francia]] to [[Charles the Bald]]. Western Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor, to modern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/treaty-of-verdun.htm |title=Treaty of Verdun |publisher=History.howstuffworks.com |date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]], France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, the [[William the Conqueror|Duke of Normandy]] added &quot;King of England&quot; to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of [[Normandy]]) and the equal of (as king of England) to the king of France.

[[File:Francois Dubois 001.jpg|thumb|left|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (1572) was the climax of the [[French Wars of Religion]], which were brought to an end by the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598).]]

The [[French Renaissance]] saw a long set of wars, known as the [[Great Italian Wars]], between the Kingdom of France and the powerful [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It also saw the first standardization of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. French explorers, such as [[Jacques Cartier]] or [[Samuel de Champlain]], claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the [[French colonial empire#First French colonial empire|First French colonial empire]].

The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of [[Huguenot]]s were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516821/Massacre-of-Saint-Bartholomews-Day |title=Massacre of Saint Bartholomew’s Day |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wars of Religion were ended by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]'s [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Henry IV was later murdered by a [[François Ravaillac|Catholic fanatic]] and [[Huguenot rebellions]] persisted until the 18th century.

Under [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], the energetic actions of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] reinforced the centralization of the state, the royal power and French dominance in Europe, foreshadowing the reign of Louis XIV. During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]], a period of trouble known as the [[Fronde]] occurred in France, which was at that time [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|at war with Spain]]. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and [[sovereign court]]s as a reaction to the [[Absolutism (European history)|rise of royal power]] in France.
[[File:Louis le Grand; Rigaud Hyacinthe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the &quot;sun king&quot; was the [[Absolute monarchy in France|absolute monarch of France]] and made France the leading European power.]]

The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into [[courtier]]s at the [[Palace of Versailles]], Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power of the time. At this time, France possessed the largest population in Europe (see [[Demographics of France]]) and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Language and Diplomacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2004/language-and-diplomacy/ |title=Language and Diplomacy |publisher=Nakedtranslations.com |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revoked the Edict of Nantes]], forcing thousands of Huguenots to exile.

Under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], France lost [[New France]] and most of its [[French India|Indian possessions]] after its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], which ended in 1763. Its [[Metropolitan France|continental territory]] kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] (1766) and [[Corsica]] (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions, and his debauchery discredited the monarchy and arguably led to the French Revolution 15 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/louis_xv.shtml |title=BBC History : Louis XV (1710–1774) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.qmul.ac.uk/cdhjones/documents/gn_pdf.pdf |title=Scholarly bibliography by Colin Jones (2002) |format=PDF |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], Louis XV's grandson, actively [[France in the American Revolutionary War|supported the Americans]], who were seeking their [[American Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]] (realized in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]]). The example of the [[American Revolution]] and the financial crisis which followed France's involvement in the war were two of the many contributing factors to the French Revolution.

Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|discovery of oxygen]] (1778) and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]] (1783), were achieved by French scientists in the 18th century. Famous French explorers, such as [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]] and [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]], took part in the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration|voyages of scientific exploration]] through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[rationalism|reason]] is advocated as the primary source for [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[authority]], undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was the starting event of the [[French Revolution]].]]

After the [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, the absolute monarchy was abolished and France became a [[Kingdom of France (1791–1792)|constitutional monarchy]]. Through the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], France established fundamental rights for French citizens and all men without exception. The Declaration affirms &quot;the natural and imprescriptible rights of man&quot; to &quot;liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression&quot;. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges (such as exemptions from taxation) and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process. Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. The Declaration also asserted the principles of popular sovereignty, in contrast to the divine right of kings that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, eliminating the privileges of the nobility and clergy.

While Louis XVI, as a [[Kingdom of France (1791–1792)|constitutional king]], enjoyed broad popularity among the population, his disastrous [[flight to Varennes]] seemed to justify the rumors that the king tied his hopes of political salvation to the dubious prospects of foreign invasion. The credibility of the king was deeply undermined and the [[Abolished monarchy|abolition of the monarchy]] and the establishment of a republic became an ever increasing possibility.

As European [[Declaration of Pillnitz|monarchies gathered]] against the new régime, to restore the French absolute monarchy, the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duke of Brunswick]], commanding general of the Austro–Prussian Army, issued [[Brunswick Manifesto (1792)|a Manifesto]], in which he threatened the destruction of Paris if any harm should come to the king or his family. The foreign threat exacerbated France's political turmoil and deepened the passion and sense of urgency among the various factions and [[War of the First Coalition|war was declared against Austria]] the 20 April 1792. [[Riot|Mob violence]]s occurred during the [[10 August (French Revolution)|insurrection of the 10 August 1792]]&lt;ref&gt;Censer, Jack R. and Hunt, Lynn.

[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (and later his wife [[Marie Antoinette]]) was [[Trial of Louis XVI|convicted]] of [[treason]] and [[Execution of Louis XVI|guillotined]] in 1793. Facing increasing pressures from European monarchies, internal guerrilla wars and [[Counter-revolutionary|counterrevolution]]s (like the [[War in the Vendée]] or the [[Chouannerie]]), the [[National Convention|young Republic]] fell into the [[Reign of Terror]]. Between 1793 and 1794, 16,000 to 40,000 persons were executed. In Western France, the civil war between the ''Bleus'' (the &quot;Blues&quot;, supporters of the Revolution) and the ''Blancs'' (the &quot;Whites&quot;, supporters of the Monarchy) last from 1793 to 1796 and cost around 450,000 lives (200,000 ''Patriotes'' and 250,000 ''Vendéens'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Furthermore, the French Republic extended greatly its boundaries and established &quot;[[French client republic|Sister Republics]]&quot; in the surrounding countries. As the threat of a foreign invasion receded and that France became mostly pacified, the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] put an end to the Terror and to [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]'s dictature.

As a continuation of [[French Revolutionary Wars|the wars]] sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of [[Napoleonic Wars|European Coalitions]] declared wars to Napoleon's French Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe, while members of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms. These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the [[Metric system]], the [[Napoleonic Code]] or the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. After the catastrophic [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]], Napoleon was finally [[War of the Sixth Coalition|defeated]] and the Bourbon monarchy [[Bourbon Restoration#First Restoration (1814)|restored]].

Only months later, France faced a new [[Algerian War|conflict in Algeria]].

In 1958, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], which contained a strengthened Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seacoast.sunderland.ac.uk/~os0tmc/contem/fifth.htm From Fourth to Fifth Republic] – [[University of Sunderland]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter role, Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war. The Algerian War was concluded with [[Évian Accords|peace negotiations]] in 1962 that led to Algerian independence. France granted independence progressively to its colonies, the last one being [[Vanuatu]] in 1980. A vestige of the colonial empire are the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|French overseas departments and territories]].

In the wake of a [[Protests of 1968|worldwide series of protests]], the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 revolt]], although a political failure for the protesters, had an enormous social impact. In France, it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal.

France has been at the forefront of the European Union member states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to create a more unified and capable European Union political, defence, and security apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051025215249/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/anglais/speeches_and_documents/2004/declaration_by_the_franco-german_defence_and_security_council.1096.html|archivedate=25 October 2005|title=Declaration by the Franco-German Defense and Security Council |publisher=Elysee.fr |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of France}} 
[[File:France cities.png|thumb|right|A relief map of Metropolitan France, showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants.]]

[[Metropolitan France]] is situated mostly between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]] ([[Dunkirk]] is just north of 51°), and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6° W]] and [[10th meridian east|10° E]], on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern [[temperateness|temperate]] zone

From southwest to northeast, France shares borders with Spain, Andorra, Monaco, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium. France also borders Suriname to its west and Brazil to its east and south, by way of the overseas region of French Guiana, which is considered an integral part of the republic (like Alaska and Hawaii are to the United States, or Kaliningrad is to Russia). Corsica and the French mainland form Metropolitan France; Guadeloupe, Martinique, Réunion, and Mayotte form, with French Guiana, the overseas regions. These two integral groupings, along with several overseas collectivities and one territory comprise the French Republic. The collectivity of Saint Martin borders Sint Maarten, a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; however, since, Saint Martin is significantly autonomous of the French government, this is not considered an international border.

The European territory of France covers {{convert|547030|km2|sqmi|0}},&lt;ref name= France/&gt; having the largest area among [[European Union]] members.&lt;ref name = superficy&gt;[http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france/index_en.htm France] on Europa Official Site&lt;/ref&gt; France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the [[Alps]] in the south-east, the [[Massif Central]] in the south-central and [[Pyrenees]] in the south-west.

France also has extensive river systems such as the [[Seine]], the [[Loire (river)|Loire]], the [[Garonne]], and the [[Rhone]], which divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the [[Camargue]]. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast.

France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding [[Adélie Land]]), is {{convert|674843|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, 0.45% of the total land area on Earth.

In the south-east a [[Mediterranean climate]] prevails. In the west, the climate is predominantly [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] with a high level of rainfall, mild winters and cool to warm summers. Inland the climate becomes more [[continental climate|continental]] with hot, stormy summers, colder winters and less rain. The [[climate of the Alps]] and other mountainous regions is mainly [[alpine climate|alpine]], with the number of days with temperatures below freezing over 150 per year and snow cover lasting for up to six months.

France was one of the first countries to create a Ministry of the Environment, in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-ca.org/kid/pages_en/eco6.htm Protection of the Environment] on the [http://www.ambafrance-ca.org/spip.php?rubrique2 Official Site of the French Ambassy in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; Although France is one of the most industrialised and developed countries, it is ranked [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|only seventeenth]] by carbon dioxide emissions, behind such less populous nations as Canada, Saudi Arabia or Australia. This situation results from the French government's decision to invest in [[nuclear power]] in 1974 (after the [[1973 oil crisis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf40.html |title=Nuclear Power in France |publisher=World-nuclear.org |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which now accounts for 78% of France's electricity production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_profile_of_France |title=Energy profile of France |publisher=Eoearth.org |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explains why France pollutes less than comparable countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/co2-la-france-moins-pollueuse-grace-au-nucleaire.N133933 CO2 : la France mois pollueuse grâce au nucléaire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.ambafrance-cn.org/L-energie-nucleaire-en-France.html L'énergie nucléaire en France] – Ambassade française en Chine&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of France|Regions of France|Departments of France}}
{{See also|Metropolitan Area (France)|List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants (2006 census)}}

France is divided into 27 administrative [[Regions of France|regions]].&lt;ref name= France/&gt; 22 are in [[metropolitan France]] (21 are on the continental part of metropolitan France; one is the territorial collectivity of [[Corsica]]), and five are [[overseas region]]s. The regions are further subdivided into 101 [[Departments of France|departments]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfrenchproperty.com/departments/departments.php |title=Departments of France |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Myfrenchproperty.com |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are numbered (mainly alphabetically). This number is used in postal codes and vehicle number plates amongst others.

The 101 departments are subdivided into 341 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]] which are, in turn, subdivided into 4,051 [[Cantons of France|cantons]]. These cantons are then divided into 36,697 [[Communes of France|communes]], which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. There also exist 2,588 [[Communes in France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] entities grouping 33,414 of the 36,697 communes (i.e. 91.1% of all the communes). Three communes, Paris, Lyon and Marseille are also subdivided into 45 [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]].

The regions, departments and communes are all known as [[territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]], meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were also territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and definitely abolished by the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946.

=== Overseas regions and territories ===
{{Main|Overseas departments and territories of France}}

Among the 101 departments of France, five ([[French Guiana]], Guadeloupe, [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], and [[Réunion]]) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs) and are an integral part of France (and the European Union) and thus enjoy a status similar to metropolitan departments.

In addition to the 27 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic also has five [[overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]] ([[French Polynesia]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]), one ''[[sui generis]]'' collectivity ([[New Caledonia]]), one [[overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] ([[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean ([[Clipperton Island]]).

Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007).

The French Republic is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic with strong democratic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Democracy Web : Comparative studies in Freedom – France [http://www.democracyweb.org/limits/france.php] (retrieved : 2012/02/01)&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by [[referendum]] on 28 September 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3305,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html France: Fifth Republic] – [http://flagspot.net/flags/index.html Flags of the World]&lt;/ref&gt; It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament. The executive branch itself has two leaders: the [[President of France|President of the Republic]], currently [[François Hollande]], who is [[head of state]] and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/quinquennat/chronologie.shtml Le quinquennat : le référendum du 24 Septembre 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Government, led by the president-appointed [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], currently [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]].

The French [[Parliament of France|parliament]] is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature comprising a [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] (''Assemblée Nationale'') and a [[Senate of France|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081205055025/http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/synthetic_files/file_4.asp The National Assembly and the Senate – General Characteristics of the Parliament].

Official Site of the National Assembly&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly has the power to dismiss the cabinet, and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110615001205/http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/election_senateurs.html The senatorial elections]. Official Site of the Senate]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.politique.net/2007081801-le-role-du-senat.htm Le role du Sénat]&lt;/ref&gt; The government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament.

French politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred around the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]], and the other right-wing, centred previously around the [[Rally for the Republic|Rassemblement pour la République (RPR)]] and now its successor the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union for a Popular Movement (UMP)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} {{cite book |title=La France vers le bipartisme ? : La présidentialisation du PS et de l'UMP|last=Grunberg |first=Gérard |year=2007 |isbn=2-7246-1010-5|url=http://www.pressesdesciencespo.fr/fr/livre/?GCOI=27246100617740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive branch is currently composed mostly of the Socialist Party.

In April and May 2012, France held a [[French presidential election, 2012|presidential election]] in which the winner [[François Hollande]] had opposed [[austerity]] measures, promising to eliminate France's budget deficit by 2017 by canceling recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases; and building additional public housing for the poor. In June, Hollande's [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] won a supermajority in [[French legislative election, 2012|legislative elections]] capable of amending the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] and enabling the immediate enactment of the promised reforms. French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows,&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg (2012) [http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GFRN10:IND French government bond interest rates] (graph)&lt;/ref&gt; less than 50 [[basis point]]s above German government bond rates.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg (2012) [http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GDBR10:IND German government bond interest rates] (graph)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law ===
{{Main|Law of France}}

France uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal]] system;&lt;ref name=France/&gt; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]). Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]] (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], wrote about the management of prisons: :''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.''
That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]

French law is divided into two principal areas: [[private law]] and [[public law]]. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and [[criminal law]]. Public law includes, in particular, [[administrative law]] and [[constitutional law]]. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law and administrative law.

France does not recognize [[religious law]], nor does it recognize religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, &quot;offenses against [[Decency|public decency]]&quot; (''contraires aux bonnes mœurs'') or [[breach of the peace|disturbing public order]] (''trouble à l'ordre public'') have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.

Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' laws are prohibited) ; and to be applicable, laws must be officially published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]''.

France is tolerant of the [[Gay community|LGBT community]]. Since 1999, [[Pacte civil de solidarité|civil unions]] for homosexual couples are permitted, although [[same-sex marriage]] is illegal in France. Laws sentencing racism, [[sexism]] or [[antisemitism]] are old and important, for instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20101205103557/http://www.ambafrance-dz.org/ambassade/IMG/Lutte_racisme_et_antisemitisme.pdf La lutte contre le racisme et l'antisémintisme en France]. AmbaFrance&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[French ban on face covering|France passed a law banning face veils]] in public, including those worn by Muslim women. [[Amnesty International]] has condemned the law as a violation of [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=France votes to ban full-face veils|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/france-votes-ban-full-face-veils-2010-07-13|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September two Muslim women were fined for wearing the [[niqab]] (an Islamic face-covering veil), though they appealed the fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burka ban: French women fined for wearing full-face veil|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8781241/Burka-ban-French-women-fined-for-wearing-full-face-veil.html|publisher=[[Telegraph]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Armed Forces (''Armées françaises'') are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the [[President of France|president]] as supreme commander.  They consist of the [[French Army]] (''Armée de Terre''), [[French Navy]] (''Marine Nationale''), the [[French Air Force]] (''Armée de l'Air'') and the auxiliary paramilitary force, the [[National Gendarmerie]] (''Gendarmerie nationale'') and are among the [[List of countries by number of troops|largest armed forces]] in the world.  While administratively a part of the French armed forces, and therefore under the purview of the [[Minister of Defense (France)|Ministry of Defence]], the Gendarmerie is operationally attached to the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]. The gendarmerie is a military police force which serves for the most part as a rural and general purpose police force. It encompasses the counter terrorist units of the [[Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie]] (''Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale'') and the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (''Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale''). One of the French intelligence units, the [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (''Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure'') reports to the Ministry of Defence. The other, the [[Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur|Central Directorate of Interior Intelligence]] (''Direction Centrale du Renseignement Intérieur''), reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national [[conscription]] since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/service-civil/fin-service-militaire-obligatoire.shtml La fin du service militaire obligatoire] – La documentation française&lt;/ref&gt; 

France is a [[Big Five (United Nations)|permanent member of the Security Council of the UN]], and a [[List of states with nuclear weapons#Five nuclear-weapon states under the NPT|recognised nuclear state]] since 1960. France has signed and ratified the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT)&lt;ref name=&quot;status&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctbto.org/the-treaty/status-of-signature-and-ratification/ |title=Status of signature and ratification: CTBTO Preparatory Commission |work=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acceeded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. France's annual military expenditure in 2011 was US$62.5&amp;nbsp;billion, or 2.3% of its GDP making it the [[List of countries by military expenditures|fifth biggest military spender in the world]] after the United States, China, Russia and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIPRI Yearbook 2012&quot;/&gt;

French nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as “''[[Force de Frappe]]''”), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four [[Triomphant class submarine|''Triomphant'']] class submarines equipped with [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée|''ASMP'']] medium-range [[Air-to-surface missile|air-to-ground missile]]s with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Centre de Documentation et de Recherche sur la Paix et les Conflits, [http://obsarm.org/obsnuc/puissances-mondiales/france-forces.html ''Etat des forces nucléaires françaises au 15 août 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; of which around 50 are deployed by the Air Force using the [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000N]] long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard|Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM)]] attack aircraft which operate from the nuclear powered [[aircraft carrier]] [[French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]. The new [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale F3]] aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ''ASMP-A'' missile with a nuclear warhead.

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Carcassonne-vignes-2.jpg|thumb|[[French wine|Vineyards]] near [[Carcassonne]].]]

France has historically been an important producer of agricultural products.&lt;ref name = agriculture&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/France-AGRICULTURE.html France – Agriculture] – Encyclopedia of the Nations&lt;/ref&gt; Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and [[Common agricultural policy|EU subsidies]] have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/economy_6815/overview-of-the-french-economy_6831/key-figures-of-the-french-economy_1402.html#sommaire_1 |publisher=[[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs]]|title=Key figures of the French economy|quote=France is the world’s fifth largest exporter of goods (mainly durables).

[[Rosé|Rosé wines]] are primarily consumed within the country, but [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] and [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] wines are major exports, being known worldwide.

Shorter working hours and the reluctance to reform the labour market are mentioned as weak spots of the French economy in the view of the [[Right-wing politics|right]], when the [[Left-wing politics|left]] mentions the lack of government policies fostering social justice.

[[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economists]] have different answers to the unemployment issue, and their theories led to the [[35-hour workweek]] law in the 2000s (decade), which turned out to be a failure in reducing unemployment.

[[File:Mont Saint-Michel France.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mont Saint-Michel]] is one of the most visited sites of France]]

France has 37 sites inscribed in [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|UNESCO's World Heritage List]] and features cities of high cultural interest (Paris being the foremost, but also [[Toulouse]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lyon]], and others), beaches and seaside resorts, [[ski]] resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity ([[Ecotourism|green tourism]]). Small and picturesque French villages of quality heritage (such as [[Collonges-la-Rouge]] or [[Locronan]]) are promoted through the association ''[[Les Plus Beaux Villages de France]]'' (litt. &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages of France&quot;). The &quot;[[Remarkable Gardens of France|Remarkable Gardens]]&quot; label is a list of the over two hundred gardens classified by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]]. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and [[park]]s. France also attracts many religious pilgrims on their [[Way of St. James|way to St. James]], or to [[Lourdes]], a town in the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]] that hosts a few million visitors a year.

France, and especially Paris, have some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]], which is the [[List of most visited art museums in the world|most visited art museum in the world]], but also the [[Musée d'Orsay]], mostly devoted to [[impressionism]], and [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Beaubourg]], dedicated to [[Contemporary art]].

According to Article 2 of the Constitution, the official language of France is French,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20110604145028/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/constitution/constitution2.htm#titre2 La Constitution- La Constitution du 4 Octobre 1958] – Légifrance&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Romance language]] derived from [[Latin]]. Since 1635, the [[Académie française]] is France's official authority on the usage, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal power.

The French government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as [[La Francophonie]]. The perceived threat from [[anglicisation]] has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, 8 in the French metropolitan territory of continental Europe and 69 in the French [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territories]].

From the 17th century to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a [[lingua franca]] among the educated classes of Europe.&lt;ref name=exception&gt;Joffre Agnes [http://www.franceinlondon.com/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declining-Culture--london-language.html ls the French obsession with &quot;cultural exception&quot; declining?].

As a result of France's extensive [[French colonial empire|colonial ambitions]] between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to America, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, and the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intstudy.com/articles/practicalfrench.htm |title=The International Education Site |publisher=Intstudy.com |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (Southeast Asia), while creoles, and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the [[West Indies]] and the South Pacific ([[French Polynesia]]). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa.

It is estimated that between 300 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about-france.com/french/french-language.htm |title=French: one of the world's main languages |publisher=About-france.com |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 500 million&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/francophonie/francophonie.htm Qu'est-ce que la Francophonie ?] – [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]&lt;/ref&gt; people worldwide can speak French, either as a [[mother tongue]] or a [[second language]].

France is a secular country, and freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of ''[[laïcité]]'', a strict [[separation of Church and State]] under which public life is kept completely secular. France was [[History of Roman Catholicism in France|historically]] regarded as the “eldest daughter” of the Roman Catholic Church. The [[French Revolution]] saw a radical shift in the status of the Church with the launch of a brutal [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|de-Christianization campaign]]. After the back and forth of Catholic royal and secular republican governments over the 19th century, ''laïcité'' was established with the [[Jules Ferry laws]] of the 1880s and the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |title=France |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French government does not keep statistics on religious adherence, nor on ethnicity or on political affiliation. However, some unofficial survey estimates exist.

Roman Catholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practiced today as it once was. A survey by the Catholic newspaper ''[[La Croix]]'' found that whilst in 1965, 81% of the French declared themselves to be Catholics, in 2009 this proportion was 64%. Moreover, whilst 27% of the French went to Mass once a week or more in 1952, only 4.5% did so in 2006; 15.2% attended Mass at least once a month.&lt;ref name=catho&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.la-croix.com/Religion/S-informer/Actualite/La-France-reste-catholique-mais-moins-pratiquante-_NG_-2009-12-29-570979 La France reste catholique mais moins pratiquante] – La Croix. 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey found that [[Protestantism|Protestants]] accounted for 3% of the population, an increase from previous surveys, and 5% adhered to other religions, with the remaining 28% stating that they had no religion.&lt;ref name=catho/&gt; Evangelical Christianity may be the fastest growing religion in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2012/0712/In-a-France-suspicious-of-religion-evangelicalism-s-message-strikes-a-chord Robert Marquand, 12 July 2012, &quot;In a France suspicious of religion, evangelicalism's message strikes a chord&quot;, ''Christian Science Monitor''.

According to the most recent but in 2010 somewhat outdated [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005,&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|title=Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 – page 11|accessdate=5 May 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 34% of French citizens responded that “they believe there is a god”, whereas 27% answered that “they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force” and 33% that “they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force”. One other study shows 32% of people in France declaring themselves to be [[atheists]], and another 32% declaring themselves “sceptical about the existence of God but not an atheist”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131 Religious Views and Beliefs Vary Greatly by Country], Financial Times/Harris Poll, December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the number of [[Islam in France|Muslims in France]] vary widely. According to the more than one decade old 1999 French census returns, there were 3.7&amp;nbsp;million people of “possible Muslim faith” in France (6.3% of the total population). In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of Muslims to be between five and six million (8–10%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/apr/23/france.islam France to train imams in 'French Islam'], The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51552.htm |title=France – International Religious Freedom Report 2005 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[Jews in France|Jewish community in France]] numbers around 600,000 according to the [[World Jewish Congress]] and is the largest in Europe. However, both the North American Jewish Data bank and the Vitual Jew Library put the estimates closer to 480,000 {{as of|lc=y|2010}}.

Since 1905 the French government has followed the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'', in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like that of military chaplains and the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]] in [[Alsace-Moselle]]). Instead, it merely recognises ''religious organisations'', according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organizations should refrain from intervening in policy-making. Religions founded in France include [[Raelism]].&lt;ref&gt;Joy of Sects - Page 166, Sam Jordison - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain bodies of beliefs such as [[Scientology]], [[Children of God (New Religious Movement)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], or the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] are considered [[cult]]s (&quot;''[[sect#Corresponding words in other European languages|sectes]]''&quot; in French),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |title=Commission d’enquête sur les sectes |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore do not have the same status as religions in France.

Nowadays, the schooling system in France is centralized, and is composed of three stages, primary education, secondary education, and higher education.

France has been a center of cultural creation for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still recognized in the world for its rich cultural tradition.

The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting [[Monument historique|historical monuments]]. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a [[cultural exception]] to defend audiovisual products made in the country.

France receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 [[List of museums in France|museums]] welcoming more than 50&amp;nbsp;million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, &quot;Cultura statistics&quot;, [http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/culture/deps/2008/pdf/minichiffrescles2010-en.pdf Key figures]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency [[Centre des monuments nationaux]], which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments.

The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many [[List of castles in France|castles]], or ''[[château]]x'' in French) and religious buildings ([[List of cathedrals in France|cathedrals]], [[List of basilicas in France|basilicas]], churches, etc.), but also statutes, memorials and [[Gardens of France|gardens]].

=== Art ===
{{Main|French art}}
[[File:Claude Monet 023.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]] founded the [[Impressionist]] movement (''Femme avec un parasol'', 1886, [[Musée d'Orsay]]).]]

The origins of French art were very much influenced by [[Flemish art]] and by [[Italian art]] at the time of the Renaissance. [[Jean Fouquet]], the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting [[School of Fontainebleau]] was directly inspired by Italian painters such as [[Primaticcio]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]], who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of [[Baroque era]], [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], lived in Italy. The 17th century was the period where French painting became proeminent and individualized itself through classicism. Louis XIV's prime minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] founded in 1648 the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-in-activity [[French Academy in Rome]] to have direct relations with Italian artists.

[[File:LE PENSEUR - Museo Rodin- PARIS.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Thinker|Le Penseur]]'' by [[Auguste Rodin]] (1902), [[Musée Rodin]], Paris.]]

French artists developed the [[rococo]] style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of court-endorsed artists [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as [[Napoleon]] favoured artists of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic style]] as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and the highly influential [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] defined the style known as [[Academism]]. At this time France had become a center of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first [[Romanticism]] with [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] with [[Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-François Millet]], a style that eventually evolved into [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]].

In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting like [[Impressionism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], Claude Monet, [[Auguste Renoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/guide-to-impressionism/guide-to-impressionism |title=Guide to Impressionism |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second generation of impressionist-style painters [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Georges Seurat]] were also at the avant-guarde of artistic evolutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/063/article_34792.asp Le néo-impressionnisme de Seurat à Paul Klee] 15 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[fauvism|fauvist artists]] [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]].&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Art (United States), [http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/fauve/index.shtm The Fauves (dossier)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/culturefr/articles/098/article_63189.asp Vlaminck, version fauve], 25 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 20th century, Cubism was developed by [[Georges Braque]] and Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso]], living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned [[Musée du Louvre]], such as [[Mona Lisa]], also known as La Joconde. While the [[Louvre Palace]] has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station [[Gare d'Orsay]], in a major reorganization of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).&lt;ref&gt;Musée d'Orsay (official website), History of the museum – [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-museum/home.html From station to museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-collections/painting.html |title=History of the painting collection |publisher=Musee-orsay.fr |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern works are presented in the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], which moved in 1976 to the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]. These three state-owned museums welcome close to 17&amp;nbsp;million people a year.&lt;ref name=sites&gt;{{fr}} Ministry of Tourism, [http://www.tourisme.gouv.fr/stat_etudes/memento/2009/sites.pdf Sites touristiques en France] page 2 &quot;Palmarès des 30 premiers sites culturels (entrées comptabilisées)&quot; [Ranking of 30 most visited cultural sites in France]&lt;/ref&gt; Other national museums hosting paintings include the [[Grand Palais]] (1,3&amp;nbsp;million visitors in 2008), but there are also many museums owned by cities, the most visited being the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] (0,8&amp;nbsp;million entries in 2008), which hosts contemporary works.&lt;ref name=sites/&gt;

Outside Paris, all the large cities have a Museum of Fine Arts with a section dedicated to European and French painting. Some of the finest collections are in [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon|Lyon]], [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Lille]], [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen|Rouen]], [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon|Dijon]], [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rennes|Rennes]] and [[Museum of Grenoble|Grenoble]].

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|French architecture}}
[[File:Sainte chapelle - Upper level.jpg|thumb|[[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis']] [[Sainte Chapelle]] represents the French impact on religious architecture.]]

Technically speaking, there is no standard type of &quot;French&quot; architecture, although that has not always been true. [[Gothic architecture]]'s old name was ''French architecture'' (or Opus Francigenum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/opus-francigenum-art |title=Opus Francigenum |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “Gothic” appeared later as a stylistic insult and was widely adopted. The Gothic architecture was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justfrance.org/france/architecture/001.asp |title=The Gothic Period |publisher=Justfrance.org |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and [[basilicas]], the first of these being the [[Saint Denis Basilica]] (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are [[Cathedral of Chartres|Notre-Dame de Chartres]] and [[Amiens Cathedral|Notre-Dame d'Amiens]]. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: [[Notre-Dame de Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.cathedrale-reims.culture.fr/histoire.html Histoire et Architecture] – [http://www.cathedrale-reims.culture.fr/ Site officiel de la Cathedrale de Notre-Dame de Reims]&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the [[Palais des Papes]] in Avignon.

During the Middle Ages, fortified [[castle]]s were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers against their rivals. When [[Philip II of France|King Philip II]] took [[Rouen]] from [[John of England|King John]], for example, he demolished the ducal castle to build a bigger one. Fortified cities were also common; most French castles did not survive the passage of time. This is why [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart's]] [[Château Gaillard]] was demolished, as well as the [[Château de Lusignan]]. Some French castles that survived are [[Chinon (castle)|Chinon]], [[Château d'Angers]], the massive [[Château de Vincennes]] and the so-called [[Cathar castles]].

Before the appearance of this architecture, France had been using [[Romanesque architecture]] like most of Western Europe (with the exception of the Iberian Peninsula, which now consists of Spain and [[Portugal]], which used Mooresque architecture). Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the [[Basilique de Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint Sernin Basilica]] in [[Toulouse, France|Toulouse]] (largest romanesque church in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeupclose.com/article/toulouses-saint-sernin-largest-romanesque-church-in-europe/ |title=Toulouse’s Saint Sernin, Largest Romanesque Church in Europe |publisher=Europeupclose.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the remains of the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac Abbey]] (largely destroyed during the Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars).

The end of the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the [[French Renaissance]] and several artists from [[Italy]] and Spain were invited to the French court; many residential palaces, inspired by the Italians, were built, but mainly in the [[Loire Valley]]. Such residential castles were the [[Château de Chambord]], the [[Château de Chenonceau]], or the [[Château d'Amboise]]. Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, [[Baroque Architecture]] replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Claude Lébedel – Les Splendeurs du Baroque en France: ''Histoire et splendeurs du baroque en France'' page 9: “Si en allant plus loin, on prononce les mots ‘art baroque en France’, on provoque alors le plus souvent une moue interrogative, parfois seulement étonnée, parfois franchement réprobatrice: Mais voyons, l'art baroque n'existe pas en France!”&lt;/ref&gt;

In the secular domain, the [[Palace of Versailles]] has many [[baroque era|baroque]] features. [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at [[Les Invalides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jLmFbEdqBDUC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Mansart+influential&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=influential&amp;f=false |title=Architecture and the Politics of Gender in Early Modern Europe |first=Helen|last= Hills|page=86 |isbn=9780754603092|publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the [[Place Stanislas]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. On the military architectural side, [[Vauban]] designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1283 |title=Fortifications of Vauban |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/ |title=Official site of the UNESCO |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Revolution, the [[Republicanism|Republicans]] favoured [[Neoclassicism]] although neoclassicism was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such building as the [[Panthéon, Paris|Parisian Pantheon]] or the [[Capitole de Toulouse]]. Built during the French Empire the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and [[Église de la Madeleine|Sainte Marie-Madeleine]] represent this trend the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Paris: City Guide |year= 2008 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=1-74059-850-4|page= 48 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=OtabdzMdbboC&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Napoleon III]], a new wave of [[urbanism]] and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the [[neo-baroque]] [[Palais Garnier]] were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. The architecture associated to this era is named [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] in English, the term being taken from the [[Second French Empire]]. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]. In the late 19th century, [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed many bridges, such as [[Garabit viaduct]], and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower.

In the 20th century, [[Swiss]] Architect [[Le Corbusier]] designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The [[Louvre Pyramid]] is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters, or 121 feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html Des gratte-ciel à Paris : qu'en pensez-vous ?] – [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]]&lt;/ref&gt; France's largest financial district is [[La Defense]], where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html In the heart of the main European Business area] – NCI Business Center&lt;/ref&gt; Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the [[Millau Viaduct]]. Some famous modern French architects include [[Jean Nouvel]] or [[Paul Andreu]].

Clockwise from top left: [[Molière]] is the most played author in the [[Comédie-Française]];&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.comedie-francaise.fr/histoire-et-patrimoine?id=525 Auteurs et répertoires] – Official site of the Comédie Française&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Hugo]] is one of the most important French novelists and poets, and is sometimes seen as the greatest French writer of all time.&lt;ref name = victor&gt;{{fr}} {{PDF|[http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/images/30/extrait_75.pdf Victor Hugo est le plus grand écrivain français]|19.0&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th century poet, writer, and translator [[Charles Baudelaire]]; 20th century philosopher and novelist [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. ]]

The earliest French literature dates from the [[Middle Age]]s, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'' and ''[[Lancelot-Grail]]''. Other authors are known, for example [[Chrétien de Troyes]] and [[William IX of Aquitaine|Duke William IX of Aquitaine]], who wrote in [[Occitan]].

Much mediaeval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the [[Matter of France]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and the various [[chansons de geste]]. The ''[[Roman de Renart]]'', written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the mediaeval character [[Reynard]] ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing.

An important 16th century writer was [[François Rabelais]], whose novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' has remained famous and appreciated until now. [[Michel de Montaigne]] was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', created the literary genre of the essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |title=Montaigne |publisher=Humanistictexts.org |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[French poetry]] during that century was embodied by [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]]. Both writers founded the [[La Pléiade]] literary movement.

During the 17th century, [[Madame de La Fayette]] published anonymously ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'', a novel that is considered to be one of the very first [[psychological novel]]s of all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiodramareviews.com/id438.html |title=La Princesse de Cleves by Madame de Lafayette, adapted by Jo Clifford |publisher=Radiodramareviews.com |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean de La Fontaine]] is one of the most famous [[fabulist]] of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching [[wisdom]] and [[common sense]] to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Jean_de_La_Fontaine |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090618002516/http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Jean_de_La_Fontaine |archivedate=18 June 2009 |title=Jean de la Fontaine |publisher=Newworldencyclopedia.org |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Racine]], whose incredible mastery of the [[alexandrine]] and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as ''[[Phèdre]]'' or ''[[Britannicus]]''. He is, along with [[Pierre Corneille]] (''[[Le Cid]]'') and Molière, considered as one of the three great dramatists of the France's [[Louis XIV of France#Patronage o the arts|golden age]]. Molière, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the [[Western literature]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Author of some of the finest comedies in the history of the theater.&quot; Hartnoll, Phyllis (ed.). The Oxford Companion to the Theatre, 1983, Oxford University Press, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; wrote [[Molière#List of major works|dozens of plays]], including ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', ''[[L'Avare]]'', ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', and ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]''. His plays have been so popular around the world that French language is sometimes dubbed as &quot;the language of Molière&quot; (''la langue de Molière''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Randall |first=Colin |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1475046/France-looks-to-the-law-to-save-the-language-of-Moliere.html |title=France looks to the law to save the language of Molière |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just like English is considered as &quot;the language of [[Shakespeare]]&quot;.

French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Denis Diderot]]'s best-known works are ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' and ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]''. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, philosophy) and to present them to the people, in order to fight ignorance and [[obscurantism]]. During that same century, [[Charles Perrault]] was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including ''[[Puss in Boots]]'', ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Bluebeard]]''. At the turn of the 18th to 19th century [[symbolist poetry]] was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://users.skynet.be/litterature/symbolisme/symbolismefrancais.htm Le symbolisme français]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as &quot;the greatest French writer of all times&quot;&lt;ref name = victor/&gt; for excelling in all [[literary genre]]s. The preface of his play ''[[Cromwell (play)|Cromwell]]'' is considered to be the manifesto of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]]. ''[[:fr:Les Contemplations|Les Contemplations]]'' and ''[[La Légende des siècles]]'' are considered as &quot;poetic masterpieces&quot;,&lt;ref name = hugo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/victor-hugo-criticism/hugo-victor |title=Victor Hugo 1802–1885 |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, [[Dante]] and [[Homer]].&lt;ref name = hugo/&gt; His novel ''[[Les Misérables]]'' is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/100_novel.html |title=All-Time 100 Best Novels List |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' has remained immensely popular.

Other major authors of that century include [[Alexandre Dumas]] (''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte-Cristo]]''), [[Jules Verne]] (''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''), [[Émile Zola]] (''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]''), [[Honoré de Balzac]] (''[[La Comédie humaine]]''), [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Stendhal]] (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]''), whose works are amongst the most well known in France and the world.

The [[Prix Goncourt]] is a French literary prize first awarded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.academie-goncourt.fr/?article=1229174089 La première Académie Goncourt]&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.academie-goncourt.fr/?

=== Philosophy ===
{{main|French philosophy}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[René Descartes]], founder of modern philosophy.]]
[[Modern philosophy]] began in France in the 16th century with the philosophy of [[René Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. Descartes revitalised [[Western philosophy]] that had been on the decline after the Greek and Roman eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/hist-2.htm |title=The Beginning of Modern Sciences |publisher=Friesian.com |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as [[Spinoza]], [[Leibniz]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].

During the 18th century, French philosophers produced one of the most important works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', [[Baron de Montesquieu]] theorized the principle of [[separation of powers]], that has been implemented in all [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] since [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|it was first applied in the United States]]. In ''[[Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique|The Social Contract]]'', [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] openly criticized the European [[Divine right monarchy|divine right monarchies]] and strongly affirmed the principle of the [[sovereignty of the people]]. [[Voltaire]] came to embody the Enlightenment with his criticisms of Church dogma and French institutions and his defence of civil liberties such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.

In the early 20th century, French [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualist]] thinkers such as [[Maine de Biran]], [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Louis Lavelle]], influenced Anglo-Saxon thought, including the Americans [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], and the Englishman [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. In the late 20th century, [[postmodern philosophy]] began in France, with notable [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] thinkers including [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. Postmodern philosophy can also be seen as a critique of traditional western thought and incredulity toward [[metanarratives]], influenced heavily by [[structuralism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]].

[[Image:Ariane4.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ariane 4]] launched from [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] (1988)]]

France has been since the [[Middle Ages]] a major focus of knowledge and discoveries. The [[University of Paris]], founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities of the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;André Thuilier, Histoire de l’université de Paris et de la Sorbonne, Paris, Nouvelle librairie de France, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] defined a [[Rationalism|method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge]], while [[Blaise Pascal]] became famous for his work on [[probability]] and [[fluid mechanics]]. They were both key figures of the [[Scientific revolution]] which erupted in Europe during this period. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] was founded by [[Louis XIV]] to encourage and protect the spirit of [[French people|French]] [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest [[academy of sciences|academies of sciences]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was marked by the work of biologist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] and chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]], who discovered the role of [[oxygen]] in [[combustion]], while [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] published the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' which aimed to give access to &quot;useful knowledge&quot; to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Peter, A social history of knowledge: from Gutenberg to Diderot, Malden: Blackwell Publishers Inc., 2000, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Industrial Revolution]], the 19th century saw spectacular scientifical developments in France with scientists such as [[Augustin Fresnel]], founder of modern [[optics]], [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] who laid the foundations of [[thermodynamics]], or [[Louis Pasteur]], a pioneer of [[microbiology]].

Although the musical creation in France dates back to the Middle Ages, it knew its golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed several musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[François Couperin]], [[Michel-Richard Delalande]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Marin Marais]], all of them composers at the court. After the death of the &quot;Roi Soleil&quot;, French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers.

French classical music knew a revival in the 19th and 20th century, at the end of the romantic movement, at first with opera composers [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Georges Bizet]], [[Gabriel Fauré]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Édouard Lalo]], [[Jules Massenet]] and [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]. This period was a golden age for operas, being popular in the country the [[opéra bouffon]], the [[opera-ballet]] and the [[opéra comique]] genres. Later came precursors of modern classical music [[Érik Satie]], [[Francis Poulenc]], and above all [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]], who invented new musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huizenga |first=Tom |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4957580 |title=Debussy's 'La Mer' Marks 100th Birthday |publisher=Npr.org |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92338564 |title=Debussy's Musical Game of Deception |publisher=Npr.org |date=12 July 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.co.uk/music/composers/c-g/claude-debussy/ |title=Biography of Claude Debussy |publisher=Classicfm.co.uk |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.co.uk/music/composers/n-r/maurice-ravel/ |title=Biography of Maurice Ravel |publisher=Classicfm.co.uk |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, at the middle of the 20th century, [[Maurice Ohana]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] contributed to the evolutions of [[contemporary classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boulez |first=Pierre |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126668117 |title=Composer-Conductor Pierre Boulez At 85 |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, [[French popular music|French pop music]], known as ''[[chanson française]]'', has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are [[Édith Piaf]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Léo Ferré]], [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]].

Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, it is however the Western country (out of the United States) where the share of the American films in the total film revenues is the smallest, at 50.1%, to compare with 77.3% of Germany and 69.4% of Japan.&lt;ref name = erudit&gt;{{fr}} Damien Rousselière [http://www.erudit.org/revue/hphi/2005/v15/n2/801295ar.pdf Cinéma et diversité culturelle: le cinéma indépendant face à la mondialisation des industries culturelles].

=== Fashion ===
{{main|French fashion}}
[[File:Channel headquarters bordercropped.jpg|thumb|[[Chanel]]'s headquarters on the [[Place Vendôme]], Paris.]]

Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern &quot;haute couture&quot; originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression [[Haute couture]] is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.

The association of France with fashion and style ({{lang-fr|link=no|la mode}}) dates largely to the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 181. DeJean, chapters 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion ({{lang-fr|link=no|couture or haute couture}}) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great [[couturier]] houses such as Chanel, [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]], and [[Givenchy]].

In the 1960s, the elitist &quot;Haute couture&quot; came under criticism from France's [[May 1968 in France|youth culture]]. In 1966, the designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a [[prêt-à-porter]] (&quot;ready to wear&quot;) line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by [[Sonia Rykiel]], [[Thierry Mugler]], [[Claude Montana]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and [[Christian Lacroix]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as [[LVMH]].

=== Media ===
{{Main|Telecommunications in France}}

Compared to other developed countries, the French do not spend much time reading newspapers, due to the popularity of broadcast media. Best-selling daily national newspapers in France are ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[Le Figaro]]'', with around 300.000 copies sold daily, but also ''[[L'Équipe]]'', dedicated to sports coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} OJD, &quot;Observatoire de la Presse&quot;, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_PQN/ Presse Quotidienne Nationale]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'', ''[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]]'' and ''Direct Plus'' distributed at more than 650.000 copies respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} OJD, [http://www.ojd.com/pgi/section/ Presse Gratuite d'Information].

The most influential news magazine are left-wing ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', centrist ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' and right-wing ''[[Le Point]]'' (more than 400.000 copies),&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Observatoire de la Presse, [http://observatoire.ojd.com/report/visu/obs/20/do/GP_NEWS/ Presse News]&lt;/ref&gt; but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women’s magazines, among them ''[[Marie Claire]]'' and ''[[ELLE]]'', which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers ''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'' and ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', as well as ''[[Paris Match]]''. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a [[Newspaper crisis|severe crisis]] in the past decade. In 2008, the government have launched a major initiative to help the sector reform to be financially independent,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/3125110/Nicolas-Sarkozy-French-media-faces-death-without-reform.html Nicolas Sarkozy: French media faces 'death' without reform] 2 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French government portal, [http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/lancement-des-etats-generaux-de-la-presse Lancement des états généraux de la presse] 2 October 2008 [Launching of General State of written media]&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2009 it had to give 600.000 euros to help the print media cope with the [[Global financial crisis of 2008-2009|economic crisis]], in addition to existing subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angelique Chrisafis in Paris |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jan/23/sarkozy-pledges-state-aid-to-newspapers |title=Sarkozy pledges €600m to newspapers |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, after years of centralized monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency [[ORTF]] was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations&lt;ref&gt;Radio France, &quot;L'entreprise&quot;, [http://web.archive.org/web/20110722004341/http://www.radiofrance.fr/lentreprise/reperes/statuts/ Repères].

It was only in 1981 when the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio.&lt;ref name=mediapol/&gt; French television was partly liberalized in the next two decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service [[Télévision Numérique Terrestre]] introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.

The four existing national channels are now owned by state-owned consortium [[France Télévisions]], while public broadcasting group [[Radio France]] run five national radio stations. Among these public media are [[Radio France Internationale]], which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel [[TV5 Monde]]. In 2006, the government created global news channel [[France 24]]. Long-established TV channels [[TF1]] (privatized in 1987), [[France 2]] and [[France 3]] have the highest shares, while radio stations [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]], [[Europe 1]] and state-owned [[France Inter]] are the least listened to.

A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the [[Gallic rooster]]. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both &quot;[[rooster]]&quot; and &quot;inhabitant of Gaul&quot;.
