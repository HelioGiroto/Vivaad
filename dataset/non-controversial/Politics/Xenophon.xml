[[File:xenophon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Xenophon, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]]]]
'''Xenophon''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ξενοφῶν}}, ''Xenophōn''; c. 430 &amp;ndash; 354 BC), son of Gryllus, of the [[deme]] Erchia of [[Classical_Athens|Athens]], also known as '''Xenophon of Athens''', was a Greek [[historian]], [[soldier]], [[mercenary]], [[philosopher]] and a contemporary and admirer of [[Socrates]].  He is known for his writings on the history of his own times, the 4th century BC, preserving the sayings of Socrates, and descriptions of life in [[ancient Greece]] and the [[Persian Empire]].

==Life and writings==
===Early years===
Xenophon's birth date is uncertain, but most scholars agree that he was born around 430 BC near the city of [[Classical_Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650658/Xenophon |title=Xenophon |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon was born into the ranks of the upper classes, thus granting him access to certain privileges of the [[aristocracy]] of ancient [[Attica]]. While a young man, Xenophon participated in the expedition led by [[Cyrus the Younger]] against his older brother, king [[Artaxerxes II]] of [[history of Iran|Persia]], in 401 BC.  Xenophon writes that he had asked the veteran [[Socrates]] for advice on whether to go with Cyrus, and that Socrates referred him to the divinely inspired [[Delphic oracle]]. Xenophon's query to the [[oracle]], however, was not whether or not to accept Cyrus' invitation, but &quot;to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he might best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with good fortune&quot;. The oracle answered his question and told him to which gods to pray and sacrifice. When Xenophon returned to Athens and told Socrates of the oracle's advice, [[Socrates]] chastised him for asking so disingenuous a question.
[[File:Persian Empire, 490 BC.png|thumb|400px|Route of Xenophon and the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]]]]

Under the pretext of fighting [[Tissaphernes]], the Persian [[satrap]] of [[Ionia]], Cyrus assembled a massive army composed of native Persian soldiers, but also a large number of Greeks. Prior to waging war against [[Artaxerxes II|Artaxerxes]], Cyrus proposed that the enemy was the [[Pisidia]]ns, and so the Greeks were unaware that they were to battle against the larger army of King Artaxerxes II. At   [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] the soldiers became aware of Cyrus's plans to depose the king, and as a result, refused to continue. However, [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]], a [[Spartan]] general, convinced the Greeks to continue with the expedition. The army of Cyrus met the army of Artaxerxes II in the [[Battle of Cunaxa]]. Despite effective fighting by the Greeks, Cyrus was killed in the battle.  Shortly thereafter, Clearchus was invited to a peace conference, where, alongside four other generals and many captains, he was betrayed and executed.  The [[mercenaries]], known as the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]], found themselves without leadership far from the sea, deep in hostile territory near the heart of [[Mesopotamia]]. They elected new leaders, including Xenophon himself, and fought their way north through hostile [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Medes]] to [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] on the coast of the [[Black Sea]]. They then made their way westward back to Greece. Once there, they helped [[Seuthes II]] make himself king of [[Thrace]], before being recruited into the army of the [[Sparta]]n general [[Thibron]].

Xenophon's book ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' (&quot;The Expedition&quot; or &quot;The March Up Country&quot;) is his record of the entire expedition against the Persians and the journey home. The ''Anabasis'' was used as a field guide by [[Alexander the Great]] during the early phases of his expedition into Persia.

===Exile and death===
Xenophon was later exiled from Athens, most likely because he fought under the Spartan king [[Agesilaus II]] against Athens at [[Battle of Coronea (394 BC)|Coronea]]. However, there may have been contributory causes, such as his support for Socrates, as well as the fact that he had taken service with the Persians. The [[Sparta]]ns gave him property at [[Scillus]], near [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] in Elis, where he composed the ''Anabasis''.  However, because his son Gryllus fought and died for Athens at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] while Xenophon was still alive, Xenophon's [[banishment]] may have been revoked.  Xenophon died in either [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] or Athens.  His date of death is uncertain; historians only know that he survived his patron [[Agesilaus II]], for whom he wrote an [[encomium]]. Xenophon had a fond love of Athens but didn't believe in its political morals, which leads some to believe that he was an [[oligarchy|oligarch]].

===Legacy===
[[Diogenes Laertius]] states that Xenophon was sometimes known as the &quot;Attic Muse&quot; for the sweetness of his [[diction]]. Xenophon is often cited for promoting sympathetic [[equestrianism|training]] and humane treatment of horses in his &quot;[[On Horsemanship (Xenophon)|On Horsemanship]]&quot;.

Xenophon's standing as a political philosopher has been defended in recent times by [[Leo Strauss]], who devoted a considerable part of his philosophic analysis to the works of Xenophon, returning to the high judgment of Xenophon as a thinker expressed by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], [[Winckelmann]], [[Machiavelli]], and [[John Adams]].

[[Clive Ponting|Ponting]] cites Xenophon as one of the first thinkers to argue that the ordered world must have been conceived by a god or gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot;&gt;Ponting, C. ''A Green History of the World:  The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilisations'' p. 142, Penguin:  New York&lt;/ref&gt;  Xenophon's ''Memorabilia'' poses the argument that all animals are &quot;only produced and nourished for the sake of humans&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;ponting&quot;/&gt; Though he spent much of his life in Athens, Xenophon's involvement in Spartan politics (he was a close associate of King Agesilaus II) has led to him being closely associated with the city.

==List of works==
Xenophon's writings, especially the ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', are often read by beginning students of the [[Greek language]]. His ''[[Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hellenica]]'' is a major primary source for events in Greece from 411 to 362 BC, and is considered to be the continuation of the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' by [[Thucydides]], going so far as to begin with the phrase &quot;Following these events...&quot;. The Hellenica recounts the last seven years of the Peloponnesian war, as well as its aftermath. His Socratic writings, preserved complete, along with the dialogues of [[Plato]], are the only surviving representatives of the genre of [[Sokratikoi logoi]].

* ''[[Cyropaedia (Xenophon)|Cyropaedia]]'' (also: The Education of Cyrus)
* ''[[Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hellenica]]''
* ''[[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]]''

===Socratic works and dialogues===
* ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]''
* ''[[Oeconomicus (Xenophon)|Oeconomicus]]''
* ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]''
* ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology]]''
* ''[[Hiero (Xenophon)|Hiero]]''

===Short treatises===
* ''[[On Horsemanship]]''
* ''[[Hipparchicus|The Cavalry General]]''
* ''[[Cynegeticus|Hunting with Dogs]]''
* ''[[Ways and Means (Xenophon)|Ways and Means]]''
* ''Constitution of Sparta''

In addition, a short treatise on the [[Constitution of Athens (Pseudo-Xenophon)|Constitution of Athens]] exists that was once thought to be by Xenophon, but which was probably written when Xenophon was about five years old. The work is found in manuscripts among the short works of Xenophon, as though he had written it also.  The author, often called in English the &quot;[[Old Oligarch]]&quot;, detests the democracy of Athens and the poorer classes, but he argues that the [[Pericles|Periclean]] institutions are well designed for their deplorable purposes.
