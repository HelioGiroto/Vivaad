      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10118">'''Free migration''' or '''open immigration''' is the position that people should be able to migrate to whatever country they choose, free of substantial barriers. Although the two are not the same issue, free migration is similar in spirit to the concept of [[free trade]], and both are advocated by [[free market]] economists on the grounds that [[economics]] is not a [[zero-sum game]] and that free markets are, in their opinion, the best way to create a fairer and balanced economic system, thereby increasing the overall economic benefits to all concerned parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Khadria The movement of people and goods is linked], Binod Khadria, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[libertarians]], [[liberals]], [[socialists]], and [[anarchism|Anarchists]] advocate open immigration, notwithstanding other noteworthy differences among these political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertarian.co.uk/freelife/fl019.pdf Immigration Control: What about the workers?], Paul Marks, Free Life No. 19, Page 12, November, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; From a Human Rights perspective, free migration may be seen to complement Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]]: (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=PecoudMigration Antoine PÃ©coud and Paul de Guchteneire (Eds): ''MIGRATION WITHOUT BORDERS, Essays on the Free Movement of People ''(Berghahn Books, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against free immigration are usually cultural or security related. Some arguments are nationalistic or what some critics claim to be &quot;[[xenophobia]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Krikorian Borders are the line between 'us' and 'them'], Mark Krikorian, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or ones similar to arguments against free trade; for example, [[protectionism]]. Specifically, an influx of cheap labor could easily deflate wages for workers who are already established in a particular labor market, and have a negative impact on the standard of living for the more established workers. Other critics of free immigration are concerned that it would be unfair to current homeowners if an influx of new residents greatly brought down the property values and attractiveness of living in that location, or, alternatively, increased the demand to live in the city so much that the home owner would not be able to keep up with increased taxes from higher property values. However, free market economists believe that competition is the essence of a healthy economic system, and that any short-term negative impact on individual economic factors that is caused by free immigration is more than justified by the prospects of long-term growth for the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fff.org/freedom/0691b.asp In Defense of Free Migration], Richard M. Ebeling, The Future of Freedom Foundation, June 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments include the general impact on the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[infrastructure]], [[population density]], governmental costs, [[immigrant criminality]], incompatible culture of immigrants and overall [[quality of life]] decrease.

War-related chaos can lead to the breakdown of borders and allow for ''de facto'' free immigration. The natural attempts to flee strife, or escape a conquering enemy, can quickly lead to millions of [[refugees]]. Even where border controls are in place they can be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people. Once settled into [[refugee camp]]s, these reluctant [[immigrants]] may take decades to be either repatriated back or naturalized into their new country. This has been the situation with the [[Palestinian refugees#Jordan|Palestinians in Jordan]]. During the [[Cold War]], a migration paradox arose in which some of the [[communist state]]s forbid emigration, while the &quot;[[Free World]]&quot; would freely accept the [[defector]]s. This policy persists for [[Cuba]]ns&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration-usa.com/cuban_refugee.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], who are both allowed particular forms of free immigration to the [[United States]] based on their automatic refugee status.

Until the 20th century, the United States and [[Canada]] had policies that allowed for almost completely open immigration for Europeans. In the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], the [[United States Congress]] adopted strict immigration controls, especially on those coming from outside western Europe. These rules were later relaxed in the [[US Immigration Act of 1965|1965 Immigration Reform Act]]. Open immigration is now allowed within the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/s17000.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Nordic Council]], the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) (with exceptions and restrictions) and in some bilateral agreements, such the [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] between New Zealand and Australia.
