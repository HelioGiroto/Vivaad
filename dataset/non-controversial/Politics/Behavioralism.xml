{{distinguish2|the learning theory, [[behaviourism]]}}
'''Behavioralism''' (or '''behaviouralism''') is an approach in [[political science]], which emerged in the 1930s in the United States. It represents a sharp break from previous political science. This is because it emphasized an objective, quantified approach to explain and predict political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=58|last=Guy|quote=Behaviouralism emphasized the systematic understanding of all identifiable manifestations of political behaviour. But it also meant the application of rigorous scientific and statistical methods to standardize testing and to attempt value free inquiry of the world of politics... For the behaviouralist, the role of political science is primarily to gather and analyze facts as rigorously and objectively as possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Petro|page=6|quote=Behavioralists generally felt that politics should be studied much in the same way hard sciences are studied.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences]], modeled after the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guy|page=58|quote=The term behaviouralism was recognized as part of a larger scientific movement occurring simultaneously in ''all'' of the social sciences, now referred to as the behavioural sciences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that behavioralism tries to explain behavior with an unbiased, neutral point of view.

Behavioralism seeks to examine the behavior, actions, and acts of ''individuals'' – rather than the characteristics of institutions such as legislatures, executives, and judiciaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walton|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and groups in different social settings and explain this behavior as it relates to the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walton|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Following the [[Second World War]] through until the 1960s, behavioralism was a source of controversy. It was the site of discussion between traditionalist and new emerging approaches to political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eulau|page=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of behavioralism is often attributed to the work of [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Charles Merriam]], who emphasized the importance of examining political behavior of individuals and groups rather than only considering how they abide by legal or formal rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grigsby15&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Grigsby | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioralism as a political approach ==
Prior to the &quot;behavioralist revolution&quot;, political science being a science at all was disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahl|page=763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics saw the study of politics as being primarily qualitative and normative, and claimed that it lacked a scientific method necessary to be deemed a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guy|page=57|quote=On the basis of the philosophical approach, traditionalists prescribe normative solutions to political problems. In their view, no political inquiry into social problems can remain neutral or completely free of normative judgements or prescriptions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Behavioralists used strict methodology and empirical research to validate their study as a [[social science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=58|last=Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioralist approach was innovative because it changed the attitude of the purpose of inquiry. It moved toward research that was supported by verifiable facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=48|last=Kegley}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its rise in popularity in the 1960s and 70s, behavioralism challenged the realist and liberal approaches, which the behavioralists called &quot;traditionalism&quot;, and other studies of political behavior that was not based on fact. 

To understand political behavior, behavioralism uses the following methods: sampling, interviewing, scoring and scaling and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Petro|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Behavioralism studies how individuals behave in group positions realistically rather than how they should behave. For example, a study of the [[United States Congress]] might include a consideration of how members of Congress behave in their positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grigsby15&quot; /&gt; The subject of interest is the how Congress becomes an &quot;arena of actions&quot; and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grigsby15&quot; /&gt;

== Meaning of behavioralism ==
[[David Easton]] was the first to differentiate behavioralism from [[behaviorism]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last=Easton| first=David|year=1953|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s, behaviorism itself was referred to as a behavioral science and later referred to as behaviorism. However, Easton sought to differentiate between the two disciplines:&lt;ref name=&quot;Berndtson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|title=Behavioralism: Origins of the Concept|last=Berndtson|accessdate=2009-04-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090514010256/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm| archivedate= 14 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behavioralism was not a clearly defined movement for those who were thought to be behavioralists. It was more clearly definable by those who were opposed to it, because they were describing it in terms of the things within the newer trends that they found objectionable. So some would define behavioralism as an attempt to apply the methods of natural sciences to human behavior. Others would define it as an excessive emphasis upon quantification. Others as individualistic reductionism. From the inside, the practitioners were of different minds as what it was that constituted behavioralism. [...] And few of us were in agreement.&lt;ref&gt;David Easton in Baer et al. (eds), 1991 : 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this in mind, behavioralism resisted a single definition. [[Dwight Waldo]] emphasized that behavioralism itself is unclear, calling it &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;obscure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldo|year=1975|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easton agreed, stating, &quot;every man puts his own emphasis and thereby becomes his own behavioralist&quot; and attempts to completely define behavioralism are fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Easton|year=1962|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, behavioralism was a political, not a scientific concept. Moreover, since behavioralism is not a research tradition, but a political movement, definitions of behavioralism follow what behavioralists wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berndtson&quot; /&gt; Therefore, most introductions to the subject emphasize value-free research. This is evidenced by Easton's eight &quot;intellectual foundation stones&quot; of behavioralism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.jccc.net/bwright1/Introreview2.htm|title=Introduction to Political Science. Exam 2 Study guide|accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Riemer50&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Riemer |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Regularities'' - The generalization and explanation of regularities.
# ''Commitment to Verification'' - The ability to verify ones generalizations.
# ''Techniques'' - An experimental attitude toward techniques.
# ''Quantification'' - Express results as numbers where possible or meaningful.
# ''Values'' - Keeping ethical assessment and empirical explanations distinct.
# ''Systemization'' - Considering the importance of theory in research.
# ''Pure Science'' - Deferring to pure science rather than applied science.
# ''Integration'' - Integrating social sciences and value.

Subsequently, much of the behavioralist approach has been challenged by the emergence of [[postpositivism]] in political (particularly international relations) theory.

== Objectivity and value-neutrality ==
According to David Easton, behavioralism sought to be &quot;analytic, not substantive, general rather than particular, and explanatory rather than ethical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riemer |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the theory seeks to evaluate political behavior without &quot;introducing any ethical evaluations&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riemer |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodger Beehler cites this as &quot;their insistence on distinguishing between facts and values.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beehler1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|page=91|last=Beehler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The approach has come under fire from both conservatives and radicals for the purported value-neutrality. Conservatives see the distinction between values and facts as a way of undermining the possibility of [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beehler1&quot; /&gt;  Neal Riemer believes behavioralism dismisses &quot;the task of ethical recommendation&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Riemer51&quot; /&gt; because behavioralists believe &quot;truth or falsity of values (democracy, equality, and freedom, etc.) cannot be established scientifically and are beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Somit|pages=176–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Bay believed behavioralism was a pseudopolitical science and that it did not represent &quot;genuine&quot; political research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riemer51&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Riemer |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bay objected to empirical consideration taking precedence over normative and moral examination of politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riemer51&quot; /&gt;

Behavioralism initially represented a movement away from &quot;[[naive empiricism]]&quot;, but has been criticized as an approach has been criticized for &quot;naive scientism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=116|last=Gilman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, radical critics believe that the separation of fact from value makes the empirical study of politics impossible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beehler1&quot; /&gt;
