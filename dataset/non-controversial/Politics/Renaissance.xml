[[File:David von Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', by [[Michelangelo]] ([[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze#The Accademi Gallery|The Accademia Gallery]], [[Florence]]) is an example of high Renaissance art]]

The '''Renaissance''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|r|ɨ|ˈ|n|eɪ|s|ən|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|ɨ|s|ɑː|n|s}}, {{IPA-fr|ʁənɛsɑ̃ːs}}, {{lang-fr|Renaissance}}, Original {{lang-it|Rinascimento}}, from ''rinascere'' &quot;to be reborn&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: &quot;Renaissance&quot; |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[cultural movement]] that spanned the period roughly from the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. Though availability of paper and the invention of [[Movable_type#Metal_movable_type_in_Europe|metal movable type]] sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe. As a cultural movement, it encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, which contemporaries credited to [[Petrarch]], the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform. In politics the Renaissance contributed the development of the conventions of diplomacy, and in science an increased reliance on observation. Historians often argue this intellectual transformation was a bridge between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Modern era]]. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term &quot;[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science and Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' Retrieved May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' Retrieved May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a consensus that the Renaissance began in [[Florence]], Italy, in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time; its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the [[Medici]];&lt;ref name=&quot;strathern&quot;&gt;Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. ISBN 5-85050-852-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] at the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref name=Britannica1&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Har, Michael H. ''History of Libraries in the Western World'', Scarecrow Press Incorporate, 1999, ISBN 0-8108-3724-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;Norwich, John Julius, ''A Short History of Byzantium'', 1997, Knopf, ISBN 0-679-45088-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance has a long and complex [[historiography]], and in line with general scepticism of discrete [[periodization]]s, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the &quot;Renaissance&quot; and individual culture heroes as &quot;Renaissance men&quot;, questioning the usefulness of ''Renaissance'' as a term and as a historical delineation.&lt;ref name = &quot;brotton&quot;/&gt; The art historian Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of ''Renaissance''
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the [[Italian Renaissance]] has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—  historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science— but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by [[Art history|historians of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'' 1969:38; Panofsky's chapter &quot;'Renaissance— self-definition or self-deception?&quot; succinctly introduces the historiographical debate, with copious footnotes to the literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural &quot;advance&quot; from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and [[nostalgia]] for the [[classical age]],&lt;ref name=&quot;huizinga&quot;&gt;[[Johan Huizinga|Huizanga, Johan]], ''[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919, trans. 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; while social and economic historians of the ''[[longue durée]]'' especially have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras,&lt;ref name=&quot;starn&quot; /&gt; linked, as Panofsky himself observed, &quot;by a thousand ties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky 1969:6.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--not mainstream:Indeed, some have called for an end to the use of the term, which they see as a product of [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]] – the use of [[history]] to validate and glorify modern ideals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REN/IDEA.HTM The Idea of the Renaissance]'', Richard Hooker, Washington State University Website (Retrieved on May 2) {{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; 

The word ''Renaissance'' has also been extended to other historical and [[cultural movement]]s, such as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] and the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].

==Overview==
{{Renaissance}}
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] shows clearly the effect writers of Antiquity had on Renaissance thinkers. Based on the specifications in [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' (1st century BC), Leonardo tried to draw the perfectly proportioned man.]] 
The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [[early modern period]]. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry-humanities&quot;&gt;Perry, M. [http://college.hmco.com/humanities/perry/humanities/1e/students/summaries/ch13.html Humanities in the Western Tradition], Ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance humanist]]s such as [[Poggio Bracciolini]] sought out in Europe's monastic libraries the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], while the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in [[ancient Greek]], many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It is in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts. In the revival of [[neo-Platonism]] Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life.&lt;ref name=&quot;openuni&quot;&gt;Open University, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/religion.htm Looking at the Renaissance: Religious Context in the Renaissance]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Erasmus]], would help pave the way for the [[Protestant Reformation]].

Well after the first artistic return to classicism had been exemplified in the sculpture of [[Nicola Pisano]], Florentine painters led by [[Masaccio]] strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render [[Linear perspective|perspective]] and light more naturally. [[Political philosophy|Political philosophers]], most famously [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism [[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the famous text ''&quot;De hominis dignitate&quot;'' ([[Oration on the Dignity of Man]], 1486), which consists of a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use [[vernacular]] languages; combined with the introduction of [[Moveable type|printing]], this would allow many more people access to books, especially the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Open University, [http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/economic.htm#urban ''Looking at the Renaissance: Urban economy and government''] (Retrieved May 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the [[secular]] and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought. Some scholars, such as [[Rodney Stark]],&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', Random House, NY: 2005&lt;/ref&gt; play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the [[Italian city states]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution which preceded and financed the Renaissance.

==Origins==
[[File:Firenze.PalVecchio05.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Florence]], the center of Renaissance]]
{{main|Italian Renaissance}}
Many argue that the ideas that characterized the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th century [[Florence]], in particular with the writings of [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321) and [[Francesco Petrarca]] (1304–1374), as well as the painting of [[Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337).&lt;ref&gt;See below, under &quot;Sources&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the [[Florence Cathedral]] (Ghiberti won).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Paul Robert, ''The Feud that sparked the Renaissance: How Brunelleschi and Ghiberti Changed the Art World'' (New York, Perennial-Harper Collins, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, [[Donatello]], and [[Masaccio]] for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.

During the Renaissance, money and art went hand in hand. Artists depended totally on patrons while the patrons needed money to sustain geniuses. Wealth was brought to Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the [[Crusades]], increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic Society&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Severy | first = Merle |coauthors = Thomas B Allen, Ross Bennett, Jules B Billard, Russell Bourne, Edward Lanoutte, David F Robinson, Verla Lee Smith| title = The Renaissance – Maker of Modern Man| publisher = National Geographic Society| year = 1970| isbn = 0-87044-091-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelet defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin and Greek phases of Renaissance humanism===
[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Coluccio Salutati]]]] 

In stark contrast to the [[High Middle Ages]], when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;For information on this earlier, very different approach to a different set of ancient texts (scientific texts rather than cultural texts) see [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], and [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt; Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as [[Petrarch]], [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406), [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]] (1364–1437) and [[Poggio Bracciolini]] (1380–1459 AD) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as [[Cicero]], [[Livy]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 113–123.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century, the bulk of such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was now under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 123, 130–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the case of those Latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, maths and philosophy had been studied since the [[High Middle Ages]] in Western Europe and in the medieval Islamic world (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists, [[Demosthenes]] and [[Thucydides]] and so forth), were not studied in either the Latin or medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. One of the greatest achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity. This movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts back into the Western European curriculum is usually dated to [[Coluccio Salutati]]'s invitation to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar [[Manuel Chrysoloras]] (c.1355–1415) to Florence to teach Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 119, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and political structures in Italy===
[[File:Italy 1494 v2.png|thumb|A political map of the Italian [[Peninsula]] circa 1494]]
The unique political structures of late [[Middle Ages]] [[Italy]] have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a [[Nation-state|political entity]] in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller [[Italian city-states|city states]] and territories: the [[Kingdom of Naples]] controlled the south, the [[Republic of Florence]] and the [[Papal States]] at the center, the [[Milan]]ese and the [[Genoa|Genoese]] to the north and west respectively, and the [[Venice|Venetians]] to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy was one of the most [[urbanization|urbanised]] areas in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kirshner, Julius, ''Family and Marriage: A socio-legal perspective'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=x9grA0fWpDMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=italy+urban+population+15th+century&amp;sig=7QjemnDKllytG-1qNFygZFmlUD0 ''Italy in the Age of the Renaissance: 1300–1550''], ed. John M. Najemy (Oxford University Press, 2004) p.89 (Retrieved on 10 05 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Revival of Antiquity', [http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/3-2.html ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]'' (trans. by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian and political philosopher [[Quentin Skinner]] points out that [[Otto of Freising]] (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from Feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle Allegory of Good and Bad Government in Siena by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] (painted 1338–1340) whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as [[Matteo Palmieri]]'s (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but &quot;the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Even cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the [[Republic of Florence]] at this time, were also notable for their merchant [[Republics]], especially the [[Republic of Venice]]. Although in practice these were [[oligarchy|oligarchical]], and bore little resemblance to a modern [[democracy]], they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', New York, Random House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, J. and Romano, D., ''Venice Reconsidered'', Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.&lt;ref name=&quot;burckhardt-republics&quot;&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Republics: Venice and Florence'', ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/1-7.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]'', translated by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. [[Merchants]] brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly [[the Levant]]. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine [[Venetian glass|glass]], while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.&lt;ref name=&quot;burckhardt-republics&quot; /&gt;

===Black Death/Plague===
[[File:Plaguet03.jpg|thumb|200px|Plague 1497-1499]]
One theory that has been advanced is that the devastation caused by the [[Black Death]] in [[Florence]], which hit [[Europe]] between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on [[spirituality]] and the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman]] (1978) ''A Distant Mirror'', Knopf ISBN 0-394-40026-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the [[Patron#Arts|sponsorship]] of religious works of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/blackdeath.html The End of Europe's Middle Ages: The Black Death] University of Calgary website. (Retrieved on April 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;brotton&quot;&gt;Brotton, J., ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 2006 ISBN 0-19-280163-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.&lt;ref&gt;Netzley, Patricia D. ''Life During the Renaissance.''San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demographic decline due to the plague had some economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, p. 217). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Landholders faced a great loss but for ordinary men and women, it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also found that lands were more abundant, and that most of them inherited property from their dead relatives.

The spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases such as typhus and syphilis target the immune system and left young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Renaissance And Reformation France&quot; Mack P. Holt pg.30,39,69,166&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Black Death caused greater upheaval to Florence's social and political structure than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hatty|first=Suzanne|title=Disordered Body: Epidemic Disease and Cultural Transformation|work=ebscohost|location=State University of New York|page=89|date=ebook|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural conditions in Florence===
[[File:Lorenzo de' Medici-ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lorenzo de' Medici]], ruler of [[Florence]] and patron of arts]]
It has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in [[Florence]], and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life which may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the [[Medici]], a [[banking|banking family]] and later [[royal house|ducal ruling house]], in patronizing and stimulating the arts. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from Florence's leading artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;strathern&quot; /&gt; Works by [[Neri di Bicci]], Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci and [[Filippino Lippi]] had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the [[Augustinians]] order in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Carocci, I dintorni di Firenze, Vol. II, Galletti e Cocci, Firenze, 1907, pagg. 336-337&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance was certainly underway before Lorenzo came to power; indeed, before the Medici family itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society. Some historians have postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a result of luck, i.e. because &quot;[[Great man theory|Great Men]]&quot; were born there by chance.&lt;ref name=&quot;burckhardt-individual&quot;&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Development of the Individual'', ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]'', translated by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Da Vinci, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in [[Tuscany]]. Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these &quot;Great Men&quot; were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, J., ''Individualism and the cult of creative personality'', ''The Italian Renaissance'', New York, 1990 p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Humanism===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}
In some ways [[Renaissance humanism|Humanism]] was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval [[scholasticism|scholastic]] mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, humanists would study ancient texts in the original, and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of 'Studia Humanitatis', that being the study of five humanities: [[poetry]], [[grammar]], [[history]], [[moral philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]]. Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on &quot;a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., &quot;The spread of Italian humanism&quot;, in ''The Impact of Humanism on Western Europe'', ed. A. Goodman and A. MacKay, London, 1990, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, humanists asserted &quot;the genius of man&amp;nbsp;... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;As asserted by Gianozzo Manetti in ''On the Dignity and Excellence of Man'', cited in Clare, J., ''Italian Renaissance''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. 065.jpg|thumb|170px|''[[Portrait of Sir Thomas More (Holbein)|Portrait of Sir Thomas More]]'', 1527]]
Humanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Thomas More]] revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers, and applied them in critiques of contemporary government. [[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote what is often considered the ''manifesto'' of the Renaissance, a vibrant defence of thinking, the [[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]. [[Matteo Palmieri]] (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work ''Della vita civile'' (&quot;On Civic Life&quot;; printed 1528) which advocated [[civic humanism]], and his influence in refining the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan vernacular]] to the same level as Latin. Palmieri's written works drawn on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially [[Cicero]], who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also [[Quintilian]]. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work ''La città di vita'', but an earlier work ''Della vita civile'' (On Civic Life) is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.

The humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body. This transcending belief can be done with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation.&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 245–246). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology was referred to as il uomo universal, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. The education during Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history. It was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.

===Art===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting|Renaissance painting|Renaissance architecture|l2=Renaissance painting}}
[[File:God2-Sistine Chapel.png|thumb|The ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' by [[Michelangelo]]]]

The Renaissance marks the period of European history at the close of the Middle Ages and the rise of the Modern world.
It represents a cultural rebirth from the 14th through the middle of the 17th centuries.
Early Renaissance, mostly in Italy, bridges the art period during the fifteenth century, between the Middle Ages and the High Renaissance in Italy.
It is generally known that Renaissance matured in Northern Europe later, in 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/renaissance/earlyrenaiss.htm |title=Early Renaissance – Early Renaissance Art |publisher=Huntfor.com |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. [[Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.&lt;ref&gt;Clare, John D. &amp; Millen, Alan, ''Italian Renaissance'', London, 1994, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of perspective was part of a wider trend towards realism in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Stork, David G. ''[http://sirl.stanford.edu/~bob/teaching/pdf/arth202/Stork_SciAm04.pdf Optics and Realism in Renaissance Art]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, painters also developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[human anatomy]]. Underlying these changes in artistic method, was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature, and to unravel the axioms of [[aesthetics]], with the works of Leonardo, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]] representing artistic pinnacles that were to be much imitated by other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio, ''Lives of the Artists'', translated by George Bull, Penguin Classics, 1965, ISBN 0-14-044164-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists include [[Sandro Botticelli]], working for the Medici in Florence, [[Donatello]] another Florentine and [[Titian]] in Venice, among others.

Concurrently, in the [[Netherlands]], a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed, the work of [[Hugo van der Goes]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] having particular influence on the development of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of [[oil paint]] and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. (see ''[[Renaissance in the Netherlands]]''). Later, the work of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/bio/b/bruegel/pieter_e/biograph.html Peter Brueghel Biography]'', Web Gallery of Art (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - Self-Portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] |[[Leonardo da Vinci]] ''[[Self-portrait]],'' his [[Mona Lisa]], [[The Last Supper]] and [[Vitruvian Man]] are examples of Renaissance art]]

In architecture, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings, and with rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer [[Vitruvius]] and the flourishing discipline of [[mathematics]], formulated the Renaissance style which emulated and improved on classical forms. Brunelleschi's major feat of engineering was the building of the dome of [[Duomo of Florence|Florence Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, Richard, ''[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/arts/Architec/RenaissanceArchitecture/ArchitectureandPublicSpace/ArchitectureandPublicSpace.htm Architecture and Public Space]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The first building to demonstrate this is claimed to be the church of St. Andrew built by Alberti in [[Mantua]]. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], combining the skills of [[Bramante]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] and [[Carlo Maderno|Maderno]].
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|[[Mona Lisa]]|thumb|upright|[[Mona Lisa]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a masterpiece of Renaissance and world art]]

The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of [[pilasters]]. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and [[entablatures]] as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Filippo Brunelleschi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings|last=Saalman|first=Howard|publisher=Zwemmer|year=1993|isbn=0-271-01067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arches, semi-circular or (in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the [[Gothic style|Gothic]] vault which is frequently rectangular.

The Renaissance artists were not pagans although they admired antiquity and they also kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past. Nicola Pisano (c. 1220–c. 1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the Bible. The Annunciation by Nicola Pisano, from the Baptistry at Pisa, demonstrates that classical models influenced Italian art before the Renaissance took root as a literary movement &lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 250–251). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:1543,AndreasVesalius'Fabrica,BaseOfTheBrain.jpg|thumb|upright|right|1543' [[Vesalius]]' studies inspired interest in [[human anatomy]].]]
[[File:Galilee.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galileo Galilei]]. Portrait in [[crayon]] by Renaissance sculptor [[Leone Leoni]]]]

The rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of [[printing]] democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of ideas. In the first period of [[Italian Renaissance]], humanists favoured the study of [[humanities]] over [[natural philosophy]] or [[applied mathematics]]. And their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] views of the universe. 

Even though, around 1450, the writings of [[Nicholas of Cusa|Nicholas Cusanus]] were anticipating [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]' [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] world-view, it was made in a philosophical fashion. Science and art were very much intermingled in the early Renaissance, with [[polymath]] artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. He set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics; he devised principles of research method that led to Fritjof Capra classifying him as &quot;father of modern science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof, ''The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Great Genius of the Renaissance'', New York, Doubleday, 2007. Exhaustive 2007 study by Fritjof Capra shows that Leonardo was a much greater scientist than previously thought, and not just an inventor. In science theory and in conducting actual science practice, Leonardo was innovative. In Capra's detailed assessment of many surviving manuscripts Leonardo's science is more in tune with holistic non-mechanistic and non-reductive approaches to science which are becoming popular today.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1492 the &quot;[[Age of Discovery|discovery]]&quot; of the &quot;[[New World]]&quot; by [[Christopher Columbus]] challenged the classical world-view, as the works of [[Ptolemy]] (geography) and [[Galen]] (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations: a suitable environment was created to question scientific doctrine. As the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] clashed, the [[Northern Renaissance]] showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.

Some have seen this as a &quot;[[scientific revolution]]&quot;, heralding the beginning of the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, Herbert, ''The Origins of Modern Science, 1300–1800'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, Steven. ''The Scientific Revolution'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there is general agreement that the Renaissance saw significant changes in the way the universe was viewed and the methods sought to explain natural phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;short-science&quot;&gt;Brotton, J., &quot;Science and Philosophy&quot;, ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2006 ISBN 0-19-280163-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally held to have begun in 1543, when were first printed the books ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Workings of the Human Body'') by [[Andreas Vesalius]], which gave a new confidence to the role of [[dissection]], observation, and [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic]] view of anatomy.,&lt;ref name=&quot;short-science&quot; /&gt; and also ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'', by the [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. The famous thesis of Copernicus' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun. Significant scientific advances were made during this time by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Scientific Revolution&quot; in ''[[Encarta]]''. 2007. [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_701509067/Scientific_Revolution.html.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

One important development was not any specific discovery, but rather the further development of the ''process'' for discovery, the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=&quot;short-science&quot; /&gt; It focused on [[Empiricism|empirical evidence]], the importance of [[mathematics]], and discarded Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Francis Bacon]]&lt;ref&gt;
Van Doren, Charles (1991) ''A History of Knowledge'' Ballantine, New York, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Tzmou_a0CCMC&amp;pg=PA211 pp. 211–212], ISBN 0-345-37316-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Peter (2000) ''A Social History of Knowledge: From Gutenberg to Diderot'' Polity Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fbGuxIsGjwsC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40], ISBN 0-7456-2484-7&lt;/ref&gt;
The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[biology]], and [[anatomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ben-David wrote:

{{quote|Rapid accumulation of knowledge, which has characterized the development of science since the 17th century, had never occurred before that time.

===Religion===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}
[[File:Alexander VI - Pinturicchio detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander VI]], a [[Borgia]] Pope infamous for his corruption]]
[[File:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' and ''[[Solomon]] adored by the [[Queen of Sheba]]'' from the ''[[Farnese Hours]]'' by [[Giulio Clovio]] marks [[Italian Renaissance#Renaissance end|the end of the Italian Renaissance]] of [[illuminated manuscript]] together with the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''.]]
The new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a [[Christian]] backdrop, especially in the [[Northern Renaissance]]. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;openuni&quot;&gt;Open University article on ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/religion.htm Religious Context in the Renaissance]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary [[theology]], particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God.&lt;ref name=&quot;openuni&quot; /&gt; Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including [[Erasmus]], [[Zwingli]], [[Thomas More]], [[Martin Luther]], and [[John Calvin]].

The Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The late [[Middle Ages]] saw a period of political intrigue surrounding the [[Papacy]], culminating in the [[Western Schism]], in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13539a.htm Western Schism]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; While the schism was resolved by the [[Council of Constance]] (1414), the 15th century saw a resulting reform movement known as [[Conciliarism]], which sought to limit the pope's power. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of [[Pope Alexander VI]], who was accused variously of [[simony]], [[nepotism]] and fathering four [[illegitimate]] children whilst Pope, whom he married off to gain more power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01289a.htm Alexander VI]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther proposed reform to the Church, often based on humanist [[textual criticism]] of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;openuni&quot; /&gt; It was Luther who in October 1517 published the [[95 Theses]], challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to its sale of [[indulgences]]. The 95 Theses led to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in [[Western Europe]]. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.

In an era following the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]] and prevalent with uncertainties in the Catholic Church following the Protestant Reformation, [[Pope Paul III]] came to the papal throne (1534–1549), to whom [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] dedicated ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) and who became the grandfather of [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)]], who had paintings by [[Titian]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]], and an important collection of drawings and who commissioned the masterpiece of [[Giulio Clovio]], arguably the last major [[illuminated manuscript]], the ''[[Farnese Hours]]''.

===Self-awareness===
By the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as, ''modi antichi'' (in the antique manner) or ''alle romana et alla antica'' (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe their work. In the 1330s [[Petrarch]] referred to pre-Christian times as ''antiqua'' (ancient) and to the Christian period as ''nova'' (new).&lt;ref name=mommsen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore |authorlink =Theodor Mommsen |title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–242 |publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942| doi = 10.2307/2856364|jstor = 2856364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;
[[Leonardo Bruni]] was the first to use tripartite [[periodization]] in his ''History of the Florentine People'' (1442).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hankins&quot;&gt;Leonardo Bruni, James Hankins, ''History of the Florentine people'', Volume 1, Books 1–4 (2001), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. [[Flavio Biondo]] used a similar framework in ''Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire'' (1439–1453). 

Humanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named for the first time the &quot;[[Middle Ages]]&quot;. The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas'' (middle times).&lt;ref name=&quot;Albrow&quot;&gt;Albrow, Martin, ''The Global Age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), Stanford University Press, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwmdxMMjOd4C&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205] ISBN 0-8047-2870-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Vite de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani]]'' (The Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568).&lt;ref name=&quot;panofsky&quot;&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]]. ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', New York: Harper and Row, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Open University Guide to the Renaissance, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance/defining.htm Defining the Renaissance]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]], and [[Arnolfo di Cambio]]; the second phase contains [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], and [[Donatello]]; the third centers on [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and culminates with [[Michelangelo]]. It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, Philip. ''Style in the Art Theory of Early Modern Italy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001) ISBN 0-521-78069-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread==
In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread with great speed from its birthplace in Florence, first to the rest of Italy, and soon to the rest of Europe. The invention of the [[printing press]] allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.

===Northern Europe===
{{main|Northern Renaissance}}
 [[File:Thetriumphofdeath.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' (c. 1562) reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed the plague which devastated medieval Europe.]]
The Renaissance as it occurred in Northern Europe has been termed the &quot;Northern Renaissance&quot;. While Renaissance ideas were moving north from Italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in [[Renaissance music|music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;musical-quarterly&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Láng, Paul Henry|jstor=738699|title=The So Called Netherlands Schools|journal=The Musical Quarterly|volume=25|issue= 1|year=1939|pages=48–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music of the 15th century [[Burgundian School]] defined the beginning of the Renaissance in that art and the [[polyphony]] of the [[Franco-Flemish School|Netherlanders]], as it moved with the musicians themselves into Italy, formed the core of what was the first true international style in [[music]] since the standardization of [[Gregorian Chant]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;musical-quarterly&quot; /&gt; The culmination of the Netherlandish school was in the music of the Italian [[composer]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]. At the end of the 16th century Italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], which spread northward into Germany around 1600.

The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. [[Italian Renaissance]] artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. At first, Northern Renaissance artists remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Later on, the works of [[Pieter Bruegel]] influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that [[Flemish Primitives|Flemish]] brothers [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] perfected the [[oil painting]] technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/optg/hd_optg.htm Painting in Oil in the Low Countries and Its Spread to Southern Europe]'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] website. (Retrieved April 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of [[Dante Alighieri]] on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Celenza, Christopher (2004), ''The Lost Italian Renaissance: Humanists, Historians, and Latin's Legacy''. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the technology of the German invention of movable type printing boosted the Renaissance, in [[Northern Europe]] as elsewhere; with Venice becoming a world center of printing.

===Portugal===

Although Italian Renaissance had a modest impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was influential in broadening the European worldview,&lt;ref name=JCBL&gt;{{cite web|last=University|first=Brown, The John Carter Brown Library|title=Portuguese Overseas Travels and European Readers|url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/Portugal/Overseas.html|work=Portugal and Renaissance Europe|publisher=JCB Exhibitions|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]], [[Lisbon]] flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology including [[Pedro Nunes]], [[João de Castro]], [[Abraham Zacuto]] and [[Martin Behaim]]. Cartographers [[Pedro Reinel]], [[Lopo Homem]], [[Esteban Gómez]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]] made crucial advances to help mapping the world. Apothecary [[Tomé Pires]] and physicians [[Garcia de Orta]] and [[Cristóbal Acosta]] collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist [[Carolus Clusius]].

In architecture, the huge profits of the [[spice trade]] financed a sumptuous composite style in the first decades of the 16th century, the [[Manueline]], incorporating maritime elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergin|first=Speake, Jennifer and Thomas G.|title=Encyclopedia of the Renaissance and the Reformation|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0-8160-5451-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VOb4hIp7EE8C&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main painters being [[Nuno Gonçalves]], [[Gregório Lopes]] and [[Vasco Fernandes]].

===Spain===
{{main|Spanish Renaissance}}
The Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese Crown]] and the city of [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]. Indeed, many of the early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], including [[Ausiàs March]] and [[Joanot Martorell]]. In the [[Kingdom of Castile]], the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets starting with [[Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana|the Marquis of Santillana]], who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as [[Jorge Manrique]], [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[Juan del Encina]], [[Juan Boscán Almogáver]] and [[Garcilaso de la Vega]], kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s [[masterpiece]] [[Don Quixote]] is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher [[Juan Luis Vives]], grammarian [[Antonio de Nebrija]] or natural historian [[Pedro Mexía|Pedro de Mexía]].

Later Spanish Renaissance tended towards religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as [[Luis Ponce de León|fray Luis de León]], [[Teresa of Ávila]] and [[John of the Cross]], and treated issues related to the exploration of the [[New World]], with chroniclers and writers such as [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] or [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], giving rise to a body of work, now known as [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. The late Renaissance in Spain also saw the rise of artists such as [[El Greco]], and composers such as [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] and [[Antonio de Cabezón]].

===England===
{{main|English Renaissance}}
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]]|&quot;What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving
how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension
how like a god!&quot; — from [[William Shakespeare]]'s'' [[Hamlet]]''.]]
In England, the [[Elizabethan era]] marked the beginning of the [[English Renaissance]] with the work of writers [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Thomas More]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[John Milton]], as well as great artists, architects (such as [[Inigo Jones]] who introduced Italianate architecture to England), and composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]], [[John Taverner]], and [[William Byrd]].

===France===
{{main|French Renaissance}}
In 1495 the [[Italian Renaissance]] arrived in France, imported by King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the Church's inability to offer assistance against the [[Black Death]]. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] imported Italian art and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as [[François Rabelais]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Joachim du Bellay]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]], painters such as [[Jean Clouet]] and musicians such as [[Jean Mouton]] also borrowed from the spirit of the Italian Renaissance.

In 1533, a fourteen-year-old [[Catherine de' Medici|Caterina de' Medici]] (1519–1589), born in Florence to Lorenzo II de' Medici and Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, married [[Henry II of France|Henry]], second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude. Though she became famous and infamous for her role in France's religious wars, she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences and music (including the origins of [[ballet]]) to the French court from her native Florence.

===Germany===
{{main|German Renaissance}}
In the second half of the 15th century, the spirit of the age spread to [[Germany]] and the [[Low Countries]], where the development of the printing press (ca. 1450) and early Renaissance artists such as the painters [[Jan van Eyck]] (1395–1441) and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1450–1516) and the composers [[Johannes Ockeghem]] (1410–1497), [[Jacob Obrecht]] (1457–1505) and [[Josquin des Prez]] (1455–1521), predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country [[humanism]] became closely linked to the turmoil of the Protestant Reformation, and the art and writing of the [[German Renaissance]] frequently reflected this dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=560776|year=1965|title=The Religious Renaissance of the German Humanists|author=Strauss, Gerald|journal=English Historical Review|volume=80|issue=314|page=156|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] of [[Habsburg]] (Ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], later known as &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; ([[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Cologne]] 1512).

===Hungary===
After Italy, Hungary was the first European country where the renaissance appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Title: Hungary (4th edition)Authors: Zoltán Halász / András Balla (photo) / Zsuzsa Béres (translation) Published by Corvina, in 1998 ISBN 963-13-4129-1, 963-13-4727-3&lt;/ref&gt; The new Italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the [[Florentine]] humanist center, so a direct connection with [[Florence]] evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to [[Buda]], helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them [[Vitéz János]], archbishop of [[Esztergom]], one of the founders of Hungarian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazione-delbianco.org/inglese/relaz00_01/mester.htm |title=the influences of the florentine renaissance in hungary |publisher=Fondazione-delbianco.org |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the long reign of emperor [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]] the [[History of Buda Castle|Royal Castle of Buda]] became probably the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] palace of the late [[Middle Ages]]. King [[Matthias Corvinus]] (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further explanded it.&lt;ref&gt;History section: Miklós Horler: Budapest műemlékei I, Bp: 1955, pp. 259–307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Post-war reconstruction: László Gerő: A helyreállított budai vár, Bp, 1980, pp. 11–60.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the marriage in 1476 of king Matthias to [[Beatrice of Naples]], [[Buda]] became one of the most important artistic centres of the Renaissance north of the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;czigany&quot;&gt;Czigány, Lóránt, ''A History of Hungarian Literature'', &quot;[http://mek.oszk.hu/02000/02042/html/5.html The Renaissance in Hungary]&quot; (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important humanists living in Matthias' court were [[Antonio Bonfini]] and the famous Hungarian poet [[Janus Pannonius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;czigany&quot; /&gt; [[András Hess]] set up a printing press in Buda in 1472.

His library was second only in size to the Vatican Library. (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and religious materials.)&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tanner, The Raven King: Matthias Corvinus and the Fate of his Lost Library (New Haven: Yale U.P., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king.

An early Italian humanist who came to [[Poland]] in the mid-15th century was [[Filip Callimachus]]. Many Italian artists came to Poland with [[Bona Sforza]] of Milan, when she married King [[Zygmunt I of Poland]] in 1518.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.poland.gov.pl/Bona,Sforza,%281494,%E2%80%93,1557%29,1958.html Bona Sforza (1494–1557)]. poland.gov.pl (Retrieved April 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet/historia/historiatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en#narodziny re-establishment] of [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1364.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and is widely considered to have been the Golden Age of [[Polish culture]]. Ruled by the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385-1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] (from 1569 known as the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the [[Polish Brethren]]), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (''[[szlachta]]'') who gained dominance in the new political system of [[Golden Liberty]].

===Russia===
Renaissance trends from Italy and Central Europe influenced Russia in many ways, though this influence was rather limited due to the large distances between Russia and the main European cultural centers, on one hand, and the strong adherence of Russians to their [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox traditions]] and [[Third Rome|Byzantine legacy]], on the other hand.

Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced [[Renaissance architecture]] to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of the [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

[[File:Palais à facettes.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palace of Facets]] on the [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]].]]
In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal [[Terem Palace]] within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] being the architect of the first three floors. Aloisio da Milano, as well as the other Italian architects, also greatly contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banqueting hall of the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the [[Metropolitan Peter]] in [[Vysokopetrovsky Monastery]], another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called ''octagon-on-tetragon'' architectural form in the [[Moscow Baroque]] of the late 17th century.

[[File:Karp Zolotaryov Theotokos Late 17th century.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Theotokos]] and [[Jesus|The Child]]'', the late 17th century [[Russian icons|Russian icon]] by [[Karp Zolotaryov]], with a notably realistic depiction of faces and clothing.]]
Between the early 16th and the late 17th centuries, however, an original tradition of stone [[tented roof]] architecture had been developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some researches call that style 'Russian Gothic' and compare it with the European [[Gothic architecture]] of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced the invention of the stone [[tented roof]] (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called [[Petrok Maly]] may have been an author of the Ascension Church in [[Kolomenskoye]], one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century the influence of [[Renaissance painting]] resulted in [[Russian icons]] becoming slightly more realistic, while still following most of the old icon painting [[Aesthetic canon|canon]]s, as seen in the works of [[Bogdan Saltanov]], [[Simon Ushakov]], [[Gury Nikitin]], [[Karp Zolotaryov]] and other [[Russian artists]] of the era. Gradually the new type of secular portrait painting appeared, called ''parsúna'' (from &quot;persona&quot; – person), which was transitional style between abstract iconographics and real paintings.

In the mid 16th century Russians adopted [[printing]] from Central Europe, with [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] being the first known Russian printer. In the 17th century printing became widespread, and [[woodcut]]s became especially popular. That led to the development of a special form of [[folk art]] known as [[lubok]] printing, which persisted in Russia well into the 19th century.

A number of technologies of Renaissance period was adopted by Russians from Europe rather early, and perfected subsequently to became a part of strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as [[cannon]] [[casting]] adopted at least in the 15th century. The [[Tsar Cannon]], which is the [[List of largest cannon by caliber|world's largest bombard by caliber]], is the masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by [[Andrey Chokhov]], and is notable also by its rich [[relief]] decoration. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by [[Italians]], resulted in the development of [[vodka]], the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 the [[Genoa|Genoese]] ambassadors brought the first ''aqua vitae'' (&quot;the living water&quot;) to [[Moscow]] and presented it to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Duke]] [[Dmitry Donskoy]]. The Genoese likely got this beverage with the help of the [[alchemist]]s of [[Provance]], who used the [[Arab]]-invented [[distillation apparatus]] to convert [[grape]] [[must]] into [[alcohol]]. A [[Moscow|Moscovite]] monk called [[Isidore (inventor)|Isidore]] used this technology to produce the first original [[Russian vodka]] c. 1430.&lt;ref name=&quot;pohlebkin_history&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Historiography==

===Conception===
The term was first used retrospectively by the Italian [[artist]] and [[critic]] [[Giorgio Vasari]] (1511–1574) in his book ''The Lives of the Artists'' (published 1550). In the book Vasari was attempting to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of [[gothic art]]: the arts had fallen into decay with the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] and only the [[Tuscana|Tuscan]] artists, beginning with [[Cimabue]] (1240–1301) and [[Giotto]] (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. According to Vasari, antique art was central to the rebirth of Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/defining.htm |title=Defining the Renaissance, Open University |publisher=Open.ac.uk |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until the 19th century that the [[French language|French]] word ''Renaissance'' achieved popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of Roman models that began in the late-13th century. The Renaissance was first defined&lt;ref name=mur&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The Art of the Renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 9. ISBN 978-0-500-20008-7&lt;/ref&gt; by French [[historian]] [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874), in his 1855 work, ''Histoire de France''. For Michelet, the Renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture. He asserted that it spanned the period from [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Copernicus to [[Galileo]]; that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michelet, Jules. ''History of France'', trans. G. H. Smith (New York: D. Appleton, 1847)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Michelet distinguished between what he called, &quot;the bizarre and monstrous&quot; quality of the Middle Ages and the [[democracy|democratic]] values that he, as a vocal [[Republicanism|Republican]], chose to see in its character.&lt;ref name=&quot;brotton&quot; /&gt; A French nationalist, Michelet also sought to claim the Renaissance as a French movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;brotton&quot; /&gt;

The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) in his ''Die Cultur der Renaissance in Italien'' (1860), by contrast, defined the Renaissance as the period between [[Giotto]] and [[Michelangelo]] in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of [[individualism|individuality]], which had been stifled in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob. ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/burckhardt.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]'' (trans. S.G.C Middlemore, London, 1878)&lt;/ref&gt; His book was widely read and was influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter, ''Style in History'', New York: Basic Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of history in seeing the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;starn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Starn, Randolph|jstor=2650779|title= Renaissance Redux|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=103|issue=1 |page=124|year=1998|pages=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even a coherent cultural movement. Randolph Starn, Historian at the [[University of California Berkeley]], stated:
{{quote|&quot;Rather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the Renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places. It would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;starn&quot; /&gt;}}

===Debates about progress===
{{see also|Continuity thesis}}
[[File:Francois Dubois 001.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], an event in the [[French Wars of Religion]], by [[François Dubois]]]]

There is debate about the extent to which the Renaissance improved on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards the [[modern age]]. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.&lt;ref name=&quot;burckhardt-individual&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|
In the Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness – that which was turned within as that which was turned without – lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil. The veil was woven of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Burckhardt |first=Jacob |authorlink=Jacob Burckhardt |url=http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html |title=The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy|accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Jacob Burckhardt|''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy}}

On the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period – poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example – seem to have worsened in this era which saw the rise of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian politics]], the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], the corrupt [[Borgia]] Popes, and the intensified [[witch-hunt]]s of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the &quot;[[golden age]]&quot; imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Savonarola]]'s popularity is a prime example of the manifestation of such concerns. Other examples include [[Philip II of Spain]]'s censorship of Florentine paintings, noted by Edward L. Goldberg, &quot;Spanish Values and Tuscan Painting&quot;, ''Renaissance Quarterly'' (1998) p.914&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;panofsky&quot; /&gt; Some [[Historical materialism|Marxist historians]] prefer to describe the Renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from [[feudalism]] towards [[capitalism]], resulting in a [[bourgeois]] class with leisure time to devote to the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hull.ac.uk/renforum/v2no2/siar.htm Renaissance Forum] at [[Hull University]], Autumn 1997 (Retrieved on 10 05 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johan Huizinga]] (1872–1945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the [[High Middle Ages]], destroying much that was important.&lt;ref name=&quot;huizinga&quot; /&gt; The [[Latin|Latin language]], for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep [[economic recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lopez, Robert S., and Miskimin, Harry A.|title=The Economic Depression of the Renaissance|journal=Economic History Review|jstor=2591885|volume= 14 |year=1962|pages=408–26|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1962.tb00059.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[George Sarton]] and [[Lynn Thorndike]] have both argued that [[Science|scientific]] progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Lynn Thorndike|author=Thorndike, Lynn|year=1943|title=Some Remarks on the Question of the Originality of the Renaissance|pages=49–74|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|jstor=2707236|volume= 4|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2707236|last2=Johnson|first2=F. R.|last3=Kristeller|first3=P. O.|last4=Lockwood|first4=D. P.|last5=Thorndike|first5=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Joan Kelly]] argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly-Gadol, Joan. &quot;Did Women Have a Renaissance?&quot; ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History.''

Some historians have begun to consider the word ''Renaissance'' to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive &quot;[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]&quot; (Middle Ages). Many historians now prefer to use the term &quot;[[Early Modern Europe|Early Modern]]&quot; for this period, a more neutral designation that highlights the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, S. ''Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Osborne, Roger |title=Civilization: a new history of the Western world|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oFZ3M8N73b0C&amp;pg=PA180|accessdate=December 10, 2011|date=November 1, 2006|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-933648-19-4|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Renaissances==
The term ''Renaissance'' has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Charles H. Haskins]] (1870–1937), for example, made a case for a [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Charles Homer, ''The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1927 ISBN 0-674-76075-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have argued for a [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 8th and 9th centuries, and still later for an [[Ottonian Renaissance]] in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, Jean, ''L'Empire carolingien'' (English: ''The Carolingian Renaissance'', translated by James Emmons, New York: G. Braziller, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Other periods of cultural rebirth have also been termed &quot;renaissances&quot;, such as the [[Bengal Renaissance]], [[al-Nahda]] or the [[Harlem Renaissance]].
