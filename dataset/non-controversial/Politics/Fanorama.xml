'''''Fanorama''''' (also known as ''Fanorama Society'' and ''Fanorama Cabal'') is a [[Rhode Island]]-based [[zine]] and zine-distro produced by journalist/activist REB (Richard E. Bump).&lt;ref&gt; [http://books.google.com/books?id=Nt1lAAAAMAAJ Everything I have is blue: short fiction by working class men about more-or-less gay life] Wendell Ricketts, Suspect Thoughts Press, 2005; Original from the University of Michigan, ISBN 0-9746388-9-7, ISBN 978-0-9746388-9-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.efanzines.com/SFC/SteamEngineTime/SET09.pdf Steam Engine Time 9] S Campbell, C Chauvin, B Foster, B Gillespie.&lt;/ref&gt; According to their website it is the &quot;grand-daddy of the [[queer]] zine scene&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.freewebs.com/fanorama/index.htm Fanorama Zine &amp; Distro:History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://qzap.org/v5/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;catid=16&amp;Itemid=23 The Queer Zine Archive Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1992, ''Fanorama'' emerged as part of the [[queercore]] movement, largely inspired by the zine ''[[J.D.s]]'' (edited by [[G.B. Jones]] and [[Bruce LaBruce]]), and the [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] scene from which ''J.D.s'' came.  Initially a punk-edged collage of [[gay porn]] and commentary, REB soon added a strong, anti-assimilationist political voice to the mix, turning the zine into an artful version of the weekly &quot;Queerbeat&quot; column he contributed to Rhode Island's alternative arts newspaper, ''[[The NicePaper]]''.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.io.com/~larrybob/qze15.html Queer Zine Explosion 15]&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''Fanorama'' tag line at the time became, &quot;For those who want a little smut with their politics, or a little politics with their smut.&quot;

''Fanorama'' began to generate controversy, particularly as it addressed [[racism]] and [[sexism]] in the gay mainstream establishment; one detractor in the media called REB a &quot;kiddie pornographer-turned-moral watchdog&quot;.  During this period, REB was instrumental in leading protests against a local gay bar over a management-led racist incident - a battle which would take center stage in the gay politics of Rhode Island for the better part of a year.  Despite what he began to call his &quot;infamy,&quot; REB's popularity as a personality grew, and he was invited to emcee a mid-1990s Rhode Island [[Gay Pride]] celebration; though accepting the position, he would take its organizers to task in later years for the increasing commercialism of the event.

Over the course of its publication, ''Fanorama'' ran interviews and photo essays with such queer counter-culture heroes as comic book artist [[Robert Kirby (comics artist)|Robert Kirby]], punk rockers [[Pansy Division]], filmmaker and zine editor [[Scott Treleaven]], and Tommy Ace of the controversial [[AIDS]] humor zine, ''[[Diseased Pariah News]]''. It has been dubbed &quot;the Grandaddy of Queerzines&quot; by [[Factsheet 5]].  After publishing an issue in which REB mourned his break-up with future [[Juha]] frontman Collin Clay,  ''Fanorama'' took a turn towards [[Neopaganism|pagan]] spirituality, influenced greatly by his work with the [[Radical Faeries]].

The current incarnation of ''Fanorama'' is essentially as a prisoners' rights magazine influenced initially by the stories prisoners sent to its letters to the editor section.&lt;ref&gt; [http://home.comcast.net/~philadelphiawriters/articles/08_2004/zinefest.htm Not Your Routine Zine Scene: Awesome Fest at Rotunda, Fire and CODE Zined-Up] John Lloyd, P.A.W. Prints, Volume 2 Issue 4; July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It still retains pornography and spiritual angles. The relationships REB developed with prisoners over time were also the impetus for ''Fanorama'' to become a publisher of prisoner-authored works.&lt;ref&gt; [http://archive.prisonactivist.org/?q=taxonomy_menu/9/59/90 Prison Activist Resource Center:lgbt prisoners]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://diy.boxcarbooks.org/images/d/d5/Lockedoutsuso2006.pdf Locked Out] Summer Solstice 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to its constituency expanding from its queer following to include an [[anarcho-punk]]/activist readership, particularly since having caught the attention of ''[[Maximum Rocknroll]]'' and ''[[Punk Planet]],'' and more recently gaining the praises of headbanger favorite, ''[[Metal Maniacs]]''.  REB told ''Punk Planet'' in 2005: &quot;After doing my zine for over 12 years, after publishing and distributing countless inmate-produced publications, after corresponding with literally hundreds of prisoners, the only folks who ever made me feel 'unsafe' were folks in the free world.&quot;

The film division of ''Fanorama'' has included  REB's documentary ''Queer Rage'' (chronicling events leading up to and coming out of a riot at the RI State House) and art films ''Nocturne In E Flat'', ''Jerk Off '94'', ''Waltz of the Flowers'', and ''13 Boys''.  Shot mostly on Super-8 film or video, they have been screened at queer indie film festivals across the United States and Canada.  REB also facilitates workshops and is a speaker on the issues of zine making, queer rights, and prisoners' rights.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.uri.edu/news/releases/html/03-0311.html URI to host symposium, daylong workshop on gay &amp; lesbian issues, April 3, 4, &amp; 5] University of Rhode Island (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Excerpts from ''Fanorama'' have been published in the gay-oriented encyclopedia ''Out In All Directions'' (Warner Books), ''That's Revolting: Queer Strategies For Resisting Assimilation'', edited by [[Matt Bernstein Sycamore]] (Suspect Thoughts), and ''Afterwords: Real Sex From Gay Men's Diaries''.

In 2007, REB was part of a collective that opened The Akron Earthworm, an underground live music venue and art gallery in Akron, Ohio. In 2008, after The Earthworm closed, REB founded [http://www.hellvillerecords.org Hellville Records]. In October 2008, Fanorama was featured in a comprehensive retrospective of queer zines at The NY Art Book Fair held at Phillips de Pury &amp; Company. In August 2012, he debuted a new film, ''Rituels Queer''. He is currently completing on a 20th. anniversary issue of Fanorama featuring original photography.
