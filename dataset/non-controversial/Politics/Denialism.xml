Several motivations for denialism have been proposed, including religious beliefs and self-interest, or as a psychological defense mechanism against disturbing ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/science/2158/abominable_no_men.html |title=Abominable 'No' Men |publisher=Fortean Times UK  |date=September 2009 |author=David Hambling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;denial_ind_guardian&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2006/sep/19/ethicalliving.g2  The denial industry] [[George Monbiot]].

==Orthodoxy and heterodoxy==
Anthropologist Didier Fassin distinguishes between ''[[denial]]'', defined as &quot;the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied&quot;, and ''denialism'', which he defines as &quot;an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fassin-115&gt;Didier Fassin, ''When bodies remember: experiences and politics of AIDS in South Africa'', Volume 15 of California series in public, University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 978-0-520-25027-7. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jn9yoyuEV1YC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;f=false p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals or groups who reject propositions on which a [[scientific consensus|scientific]] or [[mainstream|scholarly consensus]] exists can engage in ''denialism'' when they use [[rhetoric]]al tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none.&lt;ref name=McKee&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Rick Stoff quotes Chris Hoofnagle, a senior staff attorney at the Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic and senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, at the University of California-Berkeley Boalt Hall School of Law:
{{quote|Then there are those who engage in denialist tactics because they are protecting some 'overvalued idea' which is critical to their identity. Since legitimate dialogue is not a valid option for those who are interested in protecting bigoted or unreasonable ideas from scientific facts, their only recourse is to use these types of rhetorical tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stoff | first = Rick | authorlink = Rick Stoff | year = 2007 | month = June | title = 'Denialism' and muddying the waters | journal = [[St. Louis Journalism Review]] | volume = 37 | issue = 296 | pages = 21–33, 2p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a newspaper article in 2003 [[Edwin Cameron]], a senior South African judge who had AIDS, described the tactics used by those who deny the Holocaust and those who deny that the AIDS pandemic is predominantly due to infection with HIV. He states that &quot;For denialists, the facts are unacceptable. They engage in radical controversion, for ideological purposes, of facts that, by and large, are accepted by almost all experts and lay persons as having been established on the basis of overwhelming evidence&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cameron-2004&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/apic-90503.html The dead hand of denialism] [[Edwin Cameron]]. Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg), April 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this they employ &quot;distortions, half-truths, misrepresentation of their opponents' positions and expedient shifts of premises and logic.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cameron-2004/&gt;  Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to &quot;make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics&quot;,&lt;ref name=Cameron-2004/&gt; as scientific studies of many areas rely on probability analysis of sets of data, and in historical studies the precise numbers of victims and other facts may not be available in the primary sources.

Such &quot;recourse to data debates and pseudo-scientific 'evidence'&quot; has also been noted as a common feature of several types of denialism in a 2009 article published in the journal ''Globalization and Health''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chazan M, Brklacich M, Whiteside A |title=Rethinking the conceptual terrain of AIDS scholarship: lessons from comparing 27 years of AIDS and climate change research |journal=Global Health |volume=5 |issue= |pages=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19807923 |pmc=2764568 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-5-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area which British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] mentioned as part of his analysis of the [[David Irving|David Irving's]] work which he presented for the defence when Irving sued  [[Deborah Lipstadt]] for libel:
{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not wilfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name=Evans-Pgrph-6-20&gt;[[Richard J.

| quote       = AIDS denialism is one of several incarnations of denialism. All denialism is defined by rhetorical tactics designed to give the impression of a legitimate debate among experts when in fact there is none. Holocaust deniers claim that historians disagree about the evidence for Nazi mass gassings and systematic murder of Jews. Global warming denialists say that climatologists are torn by the evidence about climate change. 9/11 &quot;Truth Seekers&quot;, as clever a piece of branding as &quot;pro-life&quot;, say the collapse of the Twin Towers resulted from controlled demolition. Vaccine hysterics tell us that the science is split on whether vaccinations cause autism. And AIDS denialists say that scientists are in disagreement about whether HIV causes AIDS.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a process that operates by employing one or more of the following five tactics in order to maintain the appearance of legitimate controversy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/mar/10/climate-change-denier |title=Climate change deniers: failsafe tips on how to spot them |publisher=''The Guardian'' |author=Mark Hoofnagle |date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Conspiracy theories]] — Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in &quot;a conspiracy to suppress the truth&quot;.
#[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] — Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea, or using outdated, flawed, and discredited papers in order to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research.
#[[False attribution|False experts]] — Paying an expert in the field, or another field, to lend supporting evidence or credibility.
#[[Moving the goalpost]] — Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other (often unfulfillable) piece of evidence.
#Other [[logical fallacies]] — Usually one or more of [[false analogy]], [[appeal to consequences]], [[straw man]], or [[red herring]].

Tara Smith of the [[University of Iowa]] also stated that moving goalposts, conspiracy theories and cherry-picking evidence are general characteristics of denialist arguments, but went on to note that these groups spend the &quot;majority of their efforts critiquing the mainstream theory&quot; in an apparent belief that if they manage to discredit the mainstream view, their own &quot;unproven ideas will fill the void&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=310459&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The fanaticism of denial that must be exposed |publisher=''Times Higher Education'' |author=Tara Smith |date=14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prescriptive and polemic==
If one party to a debate accuses the other of ''denialism'' they are framing the debate, because denialism is prescriptive: it carries implications that there is a truth that the other side denies, and [[polemic]] because the accuser usually goes on to explain how the other party is denying the asserted truth and as such the other party is in the wrong, which leads to an implied accusation that if the accused party persist with the denial despite the evidence their motives must be base.&lt;ref name=Fassin-115/&gt;

Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at Exeter University, has suggested that this is a new use for the word denial and it may have its origins in an old sense of &quot;deny&quot;, akin to &quot;disown&quot;, (as in the [[Apostle Peter]] denying Christ), but that its more immediate antecedence is from the Freudian sense of deny as a refusal to accept a painful or humiliating truth. He writes that &quot;An accusation of 'denial' is serious, suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self-deception. The thing being denied is, by implication, so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity, malice or wilful blindness.&quot; He suggests that, by the introduction of the ''denier'' tag into further areas of historical and scientific debate, &quot;One of the great achievements of the Enlightenment—the liberation of historical and scientific enquiry from dogma—is quietly being reversed&quot;, and that this should worry liberal-minded people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first=Edward |last=Skidelsky |date=27 January 2010 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/01/words-that-think-for-us-3/ |title=Words that think for us: The tyranny of denial |publisher=Prospect Publishing | accessdate=10 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use==
===AIDS denialism===
{{main|AIDS denialism}}

AIDS denialism is the denial that the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chigwedere P, Essex M |title=AIDS denialism and public health practice |journal=AIDS Behav |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=237–47 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20058063 |doi=10.1007/s10461-009-9654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS denialism has been described as being &quot;among the most vocal anti-science denial movements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kalichman SC, Eaton L, Cherry C |title=&quot;There is no Proof that HIV Causes AIDS&quot;: AIDS Denialism Beliefs among People Living with HIV/AIDS |journal=J Behav Med |volume= 33|issue= 6|pages= 432–40|year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20571892 |doi=10.1007/s10865-010-9275-7 |pmc=3015095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some denialists reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that the virus exists but say that it is a harmless [[passenger virus]] and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of [[recreational drug use]], malnutrition, poor sanitation, and side effects of [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral medication]], rather than infection with HIV. However, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive&lt;ref name=iomreport&gt;{{cite web | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=771&amp;page=2 | title = Confronting AIDS: Update 1988 | publisher = [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] | year = 1988 | quote = …the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=niaid&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/howhivcausesaids/pages/hivcausesaids.aspx | title = The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS | accessdate = 2010-10-08 | publisher = [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease]] | date = 2010-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[scientific community]] rejects and ignores AIDS-denialist claims as based on faulty reasoning, [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]], and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data.&lt;ref name=&quot;denying_science&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Denying science |journal=Nat.

===Holocaust denialism===
The term has been used with &quot;[[Holocaust denialism]]&quot; as &quot;the refusal to accept an [[empiricism|empirically]] verifiable reality. It is an essentially [[Emotional|irrational]] action that withholds validation of a historical experience or event.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea, ''A Cross Too Heavy: Eugenio Pacelli, Politics and the Jews of Europe 1917-1943'', Rosenberg Publishing, 2008.
