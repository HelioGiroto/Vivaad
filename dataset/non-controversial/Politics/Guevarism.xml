'''Guevarism''' is a theory of [[communist revolution]] and a [[military strategy]] of [[guerrilla warfare]] associated with [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara|Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara]], one of the leading figures of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. During the [[Cold War]], the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] clashed in a series of [[proxy war]]s, especially in the [[developing nations]] of the [[Third World]], including many [[decolonization]] struggles.

==Overview==
After the 1959 triumph of the Cuban [[insurrection]] led by a militant &quot;[[foco]]&quot; under [[Fidel Castro]], his [[Argentina]]-born, [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] and [[Marxist-Leninist]] colleague Guevara parlayed his [[ideology]] and experiences into a model for emulation (and at times, direct military intervention) around the globe. While exporting one such &quot;focalist&quot; revolution to [[Bolivia]], leading an armed [[vanguard party]] there in October 1967, Guevara was captured and executed, becoming a martyr to both the [[World Communist Movement]] and the [[New Left]].

His ideology promotes exporting revolution to any country whose leader is supported by the United States and has fallen out of favor with its citizens. Guevara talks about how constant guerrilla warfare taking place in non-urban areas can overcome leaders. He introduces three points that are representative of his ideology as a whole: that the people can win with proper organization against a nation's army; that the conditions that make a revolution possible can be put in place by the popular forces; and that the popular forces always have an advantage in a non urban setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Guevara had a particularly keen interest in guerrilla warfare, with a dedication to ''foco'' techniques, also known as &quot;focalism&quot; (or &quot;''foquismo''&quot; in Spanish): [[vanguardism]] by small armed units, frequently in place of established [[communist parties]], initially launching attacks from rural areas to mobilize unrest into a [[popular front]] against a sitting regime. Despite differences in approach--emphasizing guerrilla leadership and audacious raids that engender general uprising, rather than consolidating political power in military strongholds before expanding to new ones--Che Guevara took great inspiration from the [[Maoist]] notion of &quot;[[protracted people's war]]&quot; and sympathized with [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Republic of China]] in the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. This controversy may partly explain his departure from Castro's pro-Soviet Cuba in the mid-1960s. Guevara also drew direct parallels with his contemporary [[communist]] comrades in the [[Viet Cong]], exhorting a multi-front guerrilla strategy to create &quot;two, three, many [[Vietnam]]s.&quot;

In Guevara's final years, after leaving Cuba, he advised communist [[paramilitary]] movements in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]], including a young [[Laurent Kabila]], future ruler of [[Zaire]]/[[DR Congo]]. Finally, while leading a small ''foco'' band of guerrilla [[cadres]] in Bolivia, Che Guevara was captured and killed. His death, and the short-term failure of his Guevarist tactics, may have interrupted the component guerrilla wars within the larger Cold War for a time, and even temporarily discouraged Soviet and Cuban sponsorship for ''foquismo''.

The emerging communist movements and other [[fellow traveler]] radicalism of the time, however, either switched to [[urban guerrilla warfare]] before the end of the 1960s, and/or soon revived the rural-based strategies of both Maoism and Guevarism, tendencies that escalated worldwide throughout the 1970s, by and large with the support from the [[communist states]] and the [[Soviet empire]] in general and Cuba's Castro regime in particular.

Another proponent of Guevarism was the [[France|French]] intellectual [[Régis Debray]], who could be seen as attempting to establish a coherent, unitary theoretical framework on these grounds. Debray has since broken with this.

==Criticism==
It was criticized from a revolutionary anarchist perspective by [[Abraham Guillén]], one of the leading tacticians of [[urban guerrilla warfare]] in [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]. Guillen claimed that cities are a better ground for the guerrilla than the countryside (Guillen was a veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]]). He criticized Guevarist movements of national liberation (like the Uruguayan [[Tupamaros]], one of the many groups that he helped as a military advisor) for trying to impose a [[dictatorship]] instead of self-management.
