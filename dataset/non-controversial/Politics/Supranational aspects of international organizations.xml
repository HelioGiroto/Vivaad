      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34013">Many '''[[international organizations]]''' also have '''[[Supranationalism|supranational]] aspects''', meaning that decisions can be made by the organization as a whole that are binding on member states that disagree.

Etzioni writes that supranationality can be thought of as &quot;a composite of several elements.&quot;  These elements can be present alone or all together.  The three elements of supranationality are defined as follows:

#Making of significant decisions by a body that is not made of national representatives and that does not receive instructions from national governments.  (Though such a body is frequently elected by national authorities or their constituents. Frequently such a body is made up of officials acting in an individual capacity.)
#The subjects or participants (national governments or individuals) are legally obligated to comply with the decisions of the body.
#Individuals or other private parties may interact directly with the body and/or have legal obligations as stated above.

==Examples of Supranational Elements==

This means that any other state party having declared compulsory jurisdiction as well may bring the state party before the Court for an alleged violation of international law.
