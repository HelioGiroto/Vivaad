The '''Jamil Hussein controversy''' was an instance where bloggers disputed the fact checking of the mainstream media.

In an [[Associated Press]] (AP) article dated November 25, 2006, it was reported that &quot;rampaging militiamen burned and blew up four mosques&quot; in the [[Hurriya]] neighborhood of [[Baghdad]] and that six [[Sunni]]s had been dragged out of prayers and burned alive.&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;Associated Press. [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,231877,00.html &quot;Iraqi Insurgents Gun Down 21 Shiite; 58 Insurgents Killed&quot;] [[Fox News]], November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The AP report was attributed to &quot;Jamil Hussein&quot;, identified as a captain in the Iraqi police. In the words of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the attacks &quot; ... illustrated Iraqi security forces' inability to rein in violence, at a time when U.S. leaders want them to take greater responsibility for the country's security, a vital benchmark for any strategy to withdraw U.S. troops.&quot;&lt;ref name=Raghavan&gt;Raghavan, Sudarsan.[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112401317_pf.html &quot;In Iraq, Reprisals Embolden Militias&quot;] [[Washington Post]], November 24, 2006. page A1&lt;/ref&gt;

Following up on the report, the [[Multinational Force Iraq]] claimed that an Iraqi Army patrol investigating the area found only one mosque had been burned and that the patrol had been unable to confirm media reports that six Sunni civilians had been burned to death.&quot;.&lt;ref name=MNF1&gt;Multinational Force. [http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7540&amp;Itemid=21 &quot;One Mosque Burned in Hurriya&quot;] Multi-National Corps - Iraq, Public Affairs Office, Press Release No. 20061125-09, November 24 and November 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jamil Hussein was called upon to substantiate his claims, the [[Interior Ministry]] initially denied that he was a member of the [[Multinational Force Iraq]].  Attempts to locate and identify Hussein failed, and it was later suggested by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[blog]]gers, including [[Michelle Malkin]], that he did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Michelle.[http://michellemalkin.com/2006/11/30/rumors-and-reporting-in-iraq/ &quot;Rumors and reporting in Iraq&quot;], MichelleMalkin.com, November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, the [[Interior Ministry]] recognized Hussein as an active member of the [[Multinational Force Iraq]].

Malkin has issued a correction for her denial of Hussein's existence &lt;ref name=MM6641&gt;Malkin, Michelle.[http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006641.htm &quot;Corrections&quot;], MichelleMalkin.com, January 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but contests AP claims of destroyed mosques and civilians burned alive. Malkin visited Iraq and verified that only one mosque had suffered significant damage. She further stated that the AP's only corroborating witness had recanted and that no one since has found any evidence of the claim about people being burned alive.&lt;ref name=mmnypost&gt;Malkin, Michelle.

==Background==

An [[Associated Press]] (AP) report published November 25, 2006 by [[Fox News]] and other media outlets,&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt; reported, in part, that on November 24, 2006:

{{quote|...rampaging militiamen burned and blew up four mosques and torched several homes in the capital's mostly [[Shia]] neighborhood of Hurriyah, police said. Iraqi soldiers at a nearby army post failed to intervene in the assault by suspected members of the Shiite [[Mahdi Army]] militia or subsequent attacks that killed a total of 25 Sunnis, including women and children, said police Capt. Jamil Hussein.}}

A story in the ''Washington Post'', published on November 25, 2006, seemed to confirm the reports that multiple mosques had been attacked on the 24th.&lt;ref  name=Raghavan/&gt;  

An Iraqi army patrol of the area on November 25, 2006, discovered, however, that &quot; ... only one mosque had been burned in the neighborhood ...  (t)he patrol was also unable to confirm media reports that six Sunni civilians were allegedly dragged out of Friday prayers and burned to death.  Neither Baghdad police nor Coalition forces have reports of any such incident.&quot;&lt;ref name=MNF1/&gt;

There were inconsistencies between different AP versions of the story. In one version, the dead were taken to the morgue at Al-Yarmouk hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;gainesville&quot;&gt;Associated Press [http://www.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061125/WIRE/211250312/-1/news &quot;Six burned alive in Iraq&quot;], [[The Gainesville Sun]] Last Modified: November 24, 2006 at 10:57 p.m.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later version of the story, the six victims were taken away by residents and buried in a nearby cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot; /&gt; 

On January 21, 2007, Malkin reported in an opinion article in the ''[[New York Post]]'' that she had visited two of the six mosques on a trip she had taken to Iraq.&lt;ref name=mmnypost/&gt; At her online HotAir magazine, Malkin posted video taken during her trip to one of the mosques showing a substantially destroyed dome. She reported that this mosque had also been hit with small-arms fire and two of its inside rooms were burned out by a firebomb.&lt;ref name=mmnypost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Malkin, Michelle. [http://hotair.com/archives/2007/01/22/hurriyas-mosques-still-standing/ &quot;Hurriya's Mosques: Still Standing&quot;] Hot Air Video, &quot;HotAir.com&quot; posted January 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Her published photographs and video supported the assertions of the Multi-National Force that the damage reported by Jamil Hussein was exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Michelle.[http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006728.htm &quot;Fact-checking the AP and Jamil Hussein&quot;], ''MichelleMalkin.com'', January 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP source identity==

The AP initially identified Jamil Hussein&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;Hurst, Steven R. [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-11-28-iraq-fire_x.htm &quot;Witnesses detail immolation attack on six Sunnis in Baghdad last week&quot;], ''[[USA Today]]'', November 28, 2006, posted at 4:52 p.m.&lt;/ref&gt; as a police captain with an office at the Yarmouk police station in western Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;updateap&quot;&gt;Editor &amp; Publisher Staff. [http://www.allbusiness.com/print/4706620-1-22eeq.html &quot;UPDATE: AP Replies to New Claims Against Disputed Story -- Iraqis Say They Will Now Monitor Media &quot;], AllBusiness.com, November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The AP later identified their source as Jamal Gholaiem Hussein of the al-Khadra district &lt;ref name=&quot;disputedap&quot;&gt;Editor &amp; Publisher Staff. [http://www.allbusiness.com/print/4692165-1-22eeq.html &quot;Disputed AP Source in Iraq Now Faces Arrest for Talking to Media&quot;], Allbusiness.com&quot;, January 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP issued a statement to ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' reporting that Ministry spokesman [[Abdul-Karim Khalaf]], who had previously denied Hussein's existence, had formally acknowledged that Hussein was an officer assigned to the [[Khadra]] police station. The Ministry also released information about the pending arrest and disciplinary action against Hussein for &quot;breaking police regulations against talking to reporters.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;disputedap&quot;/&gt; 

On 15 February 2007, ''[[Pajamas Media]]'' reported that Iraqi Interior Ministry Spokesman Brigadier General Abdul-Karim Khalaf said that an Associated Press reporter had confirmed to him on two occasions that the real name of the AP source was Iraqi Police Captain Jamil Gulaim Innad al-Jashami.

==Lack of additional sources==

According to Edward Wong, a ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter who reported on the events in Baghdad on November 24, 2006: 
{{cquote|When we first heard of the event on Nov. 24, through the A.P. story and a man named Imad al-Hashemi talking about it on television, we had our Iraqi reporters make calls to people in the Hurriya neighborhood. Because of the curfew that day, everything had to be done by phone. We reached several people who told us about the mosque attacks, but said they had heard nothing of Sunni worshippers being burned alive. Any big news event travels quickly by word of mouth through Baghdad, aided by the enormous proliferation of cell phones here. Such an incident would have been so abominable that a great many of the residents in Hurriya, as well as in other Sunni Arab districts, would have been in an uproar over it. Hard-line Sunni Arab organizations such as the Muslim Scholars Association or the Iraqi Islamic Party would almost certainly have appeared on television that day or the next to denounce this specific incident. Iraqi clerics and politicians are not shy about doing this. Yet, as far as I know, there was no widespread talk of the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;foggy&quot;&gt;Zeller, Tom Jr.[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/peering-through-a-foggy-war-in-iraq &quot;Peering Through a Foggy War in Iraq&quot;], ''The Lede'', ''The New York Times'', December 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Associated Press reaction==

Associated Press reporters returned and found &quot;more witnesses who described the attack in particular detail&quot;; these new witnesses were all anonymous, AP stating that they feared persecution if identified. AP reported that Captain Jamil Hussein was a genuine police contact and argue that the Interior Ministry's files are inaccurate.&lt;ref name=&quot;apstands&quot;&gt;Editor &amp; Publisher Staff. [http://www.allbusiness.com/print/4690175-1-22eeq.html &quot;AP Stands By Iraq Story, Calls Charges 'Plain Wrong'&quot;], ''Editor &amp; Publisher'',  December 08, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Associated Press, which has lost four employees to violence in Iraq so far, has questioned bloggers attacking their credibility. AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll has said {{cquote|I never quite understood why people chose to disbelieve us about this particular man on this particular story ... AP runs hundreds of stories a day, and has run thousands of stories about things that have happened in Iraq.}}

Carroll suggested that critics might be more concerned that Hussein could face imprisonment for being a source to journalists. &quot;I think a little perspective is warranted here,&quot; she said. &quot;While this has been going on, hundreds if not thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed and hundreds of serviceman have died.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;apeditor&quot;&gt;Editor &amp; Publisher Staff.
