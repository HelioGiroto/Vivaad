'''E. J. Josey''' (January 20, 1924 – July 3, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[activist]] and [[librarian]].

==Professional background==
Elonnie Junius Josey was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], son of Willie and Frances Bailey Josey.&lt;ref&gt;Roger M. Valade III, ''The Essential Black Literature Guide'', Visible Ink, in association with the Schomburg Center, 1996; p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Howard University]] in 1949 and received his [[Master's degree|master]]'s in [[History]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1950 and a master's in [[librarian]]ship from the [[University at Albany, SUNY]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Goedeken 1998, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1959, he was Director of the Library of [[Delaware State College]], [[Dover, Delaware]], and from 1959–1966, he was Chief Librarian and Associate Professor at [[Savannah State University|Savannah State College]] in Savannah, Georgia. He also served on the staff of Columbia University Library, Free Library of [[Philadelphia]], the [[New York Public Library]], and prior to his position at Delaware State College, he served as Instructor of [[Social Sciences]] and [[History]] from 1954–1955 at [[Savannah State University|Savannah State College]].

Josey was Professor Emeritus, Department of Library and Information Science, School of Library and Information Sciences, [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Prior to his University of Pittsburgh appointment, he had been with the New York State Education Department since 1966, in its Division of Library Development, when he was first appointed Associate in the Bureau of Academic and Research Libraries and he was promoted to Chief, Bureau of Academic and Research Libraries in 1968, and held that position until 1976 when he was appointed Chief, Bureau of Specialist Library Services, [[New York State Library]]. Prior to coming to New York State, he served as Director of two college libraries.

==Memberships==
Active in the field of [[human rights]], he was a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([[NAACP]]), and served as President of Albany, New York Branch from 1982–86. He also served as President of the Albany Branch of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History. Active in community affairs, he also served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Albany County Opportunity, Inc., the local anti-poverty agency for four years.

A member of the [[American Library Association]] for 48 years, at the 1964 annual conference, he authored the resolution forbidding Association officers and staff from participating in state associations that deny membership to [[black]] librarians. This action led to the integration of the library association of several Southern states, and he became the first black librarian to be accepted as a member of the Georgia Library Association.  In ''The Black Librarian in America'' (1970) Josey recalled the 1964 annual conference:

&quot;Much to my chagrin, the Mississippi Library Association was honored there for its National Library Week Activities. I exploded! I was seething with anger, for I remembered that three civil rights workers-Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Micheal Schwerner had been murdered and lay dead and buried somewhere in Mississippi, their bodies not yet discovered. I also remembered that the Mississippi Library Association had withdrawn from ALA rather than give membership to Negro Librarians.&quot;

He was first elected to the ALA Council, the policy making body of the Association in 1970 and served until the summer of 2000, a period of 29 years. In 1979, he was elected to a four-year term on the ALA Executive Board. 

From 1980–82, he served as Chair of the Cultural Minorities Task Force of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. Having served on numerous ALA Committees, he chaired the ALA Committee on Pay Equity, the ALA Committee on Legislation, and the ALA International Relations Committee several times.

Josey was the President of ALA in 1984–85.  At his inaugural address in 1984, Josey made this forward-thinking comment still applicable to libraries today: “The information industry has the technology to control information, but its price tag on information distribution and its profit goal create a bias in what information is made available and how it is dispensed.  Only the nonprofit organization, the library, dedicated to a total community service goal with trained experts, librarians, running the operation can provide the full scope of information for the total population in a fair and objective manner.”

In the spring of 1987, he was elected to a 4-year term on the Board of Directors of the Freedom to Read Foundation and chaired the ALA International Relations Committee from 1987 to 1990. From 1990 to 1994 he served as the Chair of the ALA Legislation Committee. He returned to chair the ALA International Relations Committee for the next two years. In May and June, 1987, Professor Josey lectured in three African countries, [[Ethiopia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Zambia]] under the auspices of the [[United States Information Agency]].

==Civil Rights activities==
During the early 1960s, he participated in the [[Civil Rights]] struggle in Savannah (see ''The Black Librarian in America'', pp.&amp;nbsp;308–11). He served on the Executive Board of the Savannah Branch of the NAACP as well as the Executive Board of the Albany, NY Branch of the NAACP.

In 1964 he carried the Civil Rights struggle into the American Library Association. In spite of the 1954 [[United States Supreme Court]] decision, which encouraged [[desegregation]] of libraries and ALA chapters, the ALA was slow in implementing integration of all of its southern chapters until Josey offered his resolution at the 1964 Conference which prevented ALA officers and staff members from attending [[Racial segregation|segregated]] state chapter meetings. The four remaining segregated chapters that denied membership to African-American librarians at that time were [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Mississippi]]; and they integrated immediately. He is well known for his uncompromising opposition to any form of [[discrimination]] whether it is [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[gender]], age or [[sexual orientation]].
