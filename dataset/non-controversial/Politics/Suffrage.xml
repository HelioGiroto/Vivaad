'''Suffrage''', '''political franchise''', or simply '''franchise''', distinct from other rights to vote, is the '''right to vote''' gained through the democratic process. In English, '''suffrage''' and its synonyms are sometimes also used to mean the right to run for office (to be a candidate), but there are no established qualifying terms to distinguish between these different meanings of the term(s). The right to run for office is sometimes called ('''candidate''') '''eligibility''', and the combination of both rights is sometimes called '''full suffrage'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/womens_suffrage_movement.html&lt;/ref&gt; In many other languages, the right to vote is called the '''active right to vote''' and the right to be voted for (to run for office) is called the '''passive right to vote'''. In English, these are sometimes called '''active suffrage''' and '''passive suffrage'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://aceproject.org/main/english/lf/lfd02.htm?toc&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffrage is often conceived in terms of elections for representatives; however, suffrage applies equally to [[initiative]] and [[referendum]]. Suffrage describes not only the legal right to vote, but also the practical question of whether a question will be put to a vote. The utility of suffrage is reduced when important questions are decided unilaterally by elected or non-elected representatives. 

In most democracies, eligible voters can vote in elections of representatives. Voting on issues by [[initiative]] may be available in some jurisdictions but not others.  For example, [[Switzerland]] permits initiatives at all levels of government whereas the [[United States]] does not offer initiatives at the federal level or in many states.  That new constitutions must be approved by referendum is considered [[natural law]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Citizens become eligible to vote after reaching the [[voting age]], which is typically 18 years as of 2012. Most democracies no longer extend different rights to vote on the basis of sex or race. Resident aliens can vote in some countries and in others exceptions are made for citizens of countries with which they have close links (e.g. some members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the members of the European Union).

==Types of suffrage==
===Universal suffrage===
{{Main|Universal suffrage}}
Where [[Universal suffrage]] exists, the right to vote is not restricted by gender, race, social status, or wealth. It typically does not extend a right to vote to all [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] of a region; distinctions are frequently made in regard to [[citizenship]], age, and occasionally mental capacity or criminal convictions.

The short-lived [[Corsican Republic]] (1755–1769) was the first country to grant limited universal suffrage for all inhabitants over the age of 25. This was followed by other experiments in the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 and the island republic of [[Franceville, New Hebrides|Franceville]] (1889). In 1893, [[New Zealand]] became the first major nation to achieve universal suffrage, and the Freedom in the World index lists New Zealand as the only free country in the world in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, Dieter (2001). &quot;Elections in Asia and the Pacific: South East Asia, East Asia, and the South Pacific&quot;. p.14. Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Kulinski, K. Pawlowski. &quot;The Atlantic Community - The Titanic of the XXI Century&quot;. p.96. WSB-NLU. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, [[Finland]] became the second country in the world, and the first in Europe, to grant universal suffrage to its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Official Report of Debates&quot;. p.113. Council of Europe, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's suffrage===
[[File:SPD-Plakat 1919.jpg|thumb|German election poster from 1919: ''Equal rights - equal duties!'']]

{{Main|Women's suffrage}}
[[Women's suffrage]] is the right of women to vote on the same terms as men. This was the goal of the [[suffragists]] and the [[suffragette]]s. Limited voting rights were gained by some women in Sweden, Britain, and some western U.S. states in the 1860s. In 1893, the British colony of [[New Zealand]] became the first self-governing nation to extend the right to vote to all adult women. In 1894 the women of [[South Australia]] achieved the right to both vote ''and'' stand for Parliament. The autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] in the [[Russian Empire]] was the first European nation to allow all women to both vote and run for parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html Votes for Women - Elections New Zealand] Elections.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal suffrage===
Equal suffrage is sometimes confused with ''Universal suffrage'', although its meaning is the removal of graded votes, where a voter could possess a number of votes in accordance with income, wealth or social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/suffrage?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=suffrage&amp;sa=Search#906|title=Definition: suffrage|publisher=Websters Dictionary|accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Census suffrage===
Also known as &quot;censitary suffrage&quot;, the opposite of ''Equal suffrage,'' meaning that the votes cast by those eligible to vote are not equal, but are weighed differently according to the person's rank in the census (e.g., people with high income have more votes than those with a small income, or a stockholder in a company with more shares has more votes than someone with fewer shares). Suffrage may therefore be limited, usually to the propertied classes, but can still be ''universal,'' including, for instance, women or ethnic minorities, if they meet the census.

===Compulsory suffrage===
{{Main|Compulsory suffrage}}
Where [[Compulsory suffrage]] exists, those who are eligible to vote are required by law to do so. Thirty-two countries currently practice this form of suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html|title=CIA:The World Factbook|accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of exclusion from suffrage==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ann Jebb]] --&gt;

===Religion===
In the aftermath of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] it was common in European countries for people of disfavored [[religious denominations]] to be denied civil and political rights, often including the right to vote, to stand for election or to sit in parliament. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Roman Catholics were denied the right to vote from 1728 to 1793, and the right to sit in parliament until 1829. The anti-Catholic policy was justified on the grounds that the loyalty of Catholics supposedly lay with the [[Pope]] rather than the national monarch.

In England and Ireland, several Acts practically disenfranchised non-Anglicans or non-Protestants by imposing an oath before admission to vote or to run for office. The 1672 and 1678 [[Test Act]]s forbade non-Anglicans to hold public offices, the 1727 [[Disenfranchising Act]] took away Catholics' (''Papists''') voting rights in Ireland, which were restored only in 1788. Jews could not even be naturalized. An attempt was made to change this situation, but the [[Jewish Naturalization Act 1753]] provoked such reactions that it was repealed the next year. [[Nonconformists]] ([[Methodists]] and [[Presbyterians]]) were only allowed to run for elections to the [[British House of Commons]] in 1828, Catholics in 1829 (following the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]]), and Jews in 1858 (with the [[Emancipation of the Jews in England]]). [[Benjamin Disraeli]] could only begin his political career in 1837 because he had been converted to Anglicanism at the age of 12.

In several states in the [[U.S.]] after the [[Declaration of Independence]], Jews, [[Quakers]] or Catholics were denied voting rights and/or forbidden to run for office.&lt;ref name=williamson1960&gt;{{Citation

In [[Canada]], several religious groups ([[Mennonites]], [[Hutterites]], [[Doukhobors]]) were disenfranchised by the wartime Elections Act of 1917, mainly because they opposed military service. This disenfranchisement ended with the end of the First World War, but was renewed for Doukhobors from 1934 (''Dominion Elections Act'') to 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The first Constitution of modern [[Romania]] in 1866 provided in article 7 that only Christians could become Romanian citizens. [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews native to Romania]] were declared stateless persons. In 1879, under pressure of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Peace Conference]], this article was amended granting non-Christians the right to become Romanian citizens, but naturalization was granted on a case-by-case basis and was subject to Parliamentary approval. An application took over ten years to process. Only in 1923 was a new constitution adopted, whose article 133 extended Romanian citizenship to all Jewish residents and equality of rights to all Romanian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Wealth, tax class, social class===
Until the nineteenth century, many Western democracies had property qualifications in their electoral laws; e.g. only landowners could vote (because the only tax for such countries was the property tax), or the voting rights were weighed according to the amount of taxes paid (as in the [[Prussian three-class franchise]]). Most countries abolished the property qualification for national elections in the late nineteenth century, but retained it for local government elections for several decades. Today these laws have largely been abolished, although the [[Homelessness|homeless]] may not be able to register because they lack regular addresses.

In the [[United Kingdom]], until the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], [[peerage|peer]]s who were members of the [[House of Lords]] were excluded from voting for the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] because they were not commoners. In Britain and some other monarchies, the sovereign is ineligible to vote in parliamentary elections.

===Knowledge===
Sometimes the right to vote has been limited to people who had achieved a certain level of education or passed a certain test, e.g. &quot;[[literacy test]]s&quot; in some states of the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourdocuments.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=100&amp;page=transcript Transcript of Voting Rights Act (1965)]  U.S. National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===
Various countries, usually with large populations of [[people of color]] (POC), have historically denied the vote to people of particular races or to POC in general. This has been achieved in a number of ways:
*Official - laws and regulations passed specifically disenfranchising people of particular races (for example, the U.S. in the 19th and most of the 20th centuries, or [[South Africa under apartheid]]).
*Indirect - nothing in law specifically prevents anyone from voting on account of their race, but other laws or regulations are used to exclude people of a particular race. In southern states of the [[U.S.]] before the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], [[poll tax]]es, [[literacy test|literacy]] and other tests were used to disenfranchise African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourdocuments.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897070,00.html The Constitution: The 24th Amendment] Time Magazine. Retrieved 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Property qualifications have tended to disenfranchise POC, particularly if tribally-owned land is not allowed to be taken into consideration. In some cases  this was an unintended (but usually welcome) consequence.
*Unofficial - nothing in law prevents anyone from voting on account of their race, but people of particular races are intimidated or otherwise prevented from exercising this right.
* In New Zealand POC (Maori) were enfranchised in 1865 at the conclusion of the Maori War. Maori still have the choice of voting in a general (all race) electorate or a solely Maori electorate.

===Age===
{{Main|Voting age|Age of candidacy}}

All modern democracies require voters to meet age qualifications to vote. Worldwide voting ages are not consistent, differing between countries and even within counties, usually between 16 and 21 years. [[Demeny voting]] would extend voting rights to everyone including children regardless of age.

===Criminality===
Many countries restrict the voting rights of convicted criminals. Some countries, and [[Felony_disenfranchisement#United_States|some U.S. states]], also deny the right to vote to those convicted of serious crimes after they are released from prison. In some cases (e.g. the [[felony disenfranchisement]] laws found in many [[U.S. state]]s) the denial of the right to vote is automatic on a felony conviction; in other cases (e.g. France and Germany) deprivation of the vote is meted out separately, often limited to certain crimes such as those against the electoral system. In the [[Republic of Ireland]], prisoners are allowed the right to vote, following the ''Hirst v UK (No2)'' ruling, and this was granted in 2006. [[Canada]] allowed only prisoners serving a term of less than 2 years the right to vote, but this was found unconstitutional in 2002 by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)]]'', and all prisoners were allowed to vote as of the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 Canadian federal election]].

===Residency===
Under certain electoral systems elections are held within subnational jurisdictions, preventing persons who would otherwise be eligible from voting because they do not reside within such a jurisdiction, or because they live in an area which cannot participate. In the United States, residents of Washington, DC receive no voting representation in Congress, although they have (de facto) full representation in presidential elections. Residents of [[Puerto Rico]] have neither. 

Sometimes citizens become ineligible to vote because they are no longer resident in their country of citizenship. For example, Australian citizens who have been outside Australia more than one and less than six years may excuse themselves from the requirement to vote in [[Australian electoral system|Australian elections]] while they remain outside Australia (voting in Australia is compulsory for resident citizens).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/FAQs/Voting_Overseas.htm Australian Electoral Commission, &quot;Voting Overseas - Frequently Asked Questions&quot;, 20 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a certain period of residence in a locality may required for the right to vote in that location.  For example, in the United Kingdom up to 2001, each 15 February a new electoral register came into effect, based on registration as of the previous 10 October, with the effect of limiting voting to those resident five to seventeen months earlier depending on the timing of the election.

===Nationality===
{{Main|Right of foreigners to vote }}
In most countries, suffrage is limited to citizens and, in many cases, permanent residents of that country. However, some members of supra-national organisations such as the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the European Union have given voting rights to citizens of all countries within that organisation. Until the mid-twentieth century, many Commonwealth countries gave the vote to all British citizens in the country, regardless of whether they were normally resident there. In most cases this was because there was no distinction between British and local citizenship. Several countries qualified this with restrictions preventing non-white British citizens such as Indians and British Africans from voting. Under European Union law, citizens of European Union countries can vote in each other's local and European Parliament elections on the same basis as citizens of the country in question.

===Naturalization===
In some countries, naturalized citizens do not enjoy the right of vote and/or to be candidate, either permanently or for a determined period.

Article 5 of the 1831 [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]] made a difference between ordinary naturalization, and ''grande naturalisation''. Only (former) foreigners who had been granted ''grande naturalisation'' were entitled to vote or be candidate for parliamentary elections or to be appointed as minister. However, ordinary naturalized citizens could vote for municipal elections.&lt;ref&gt;Delcour, M.C., Traité théorique et pratique du droit électoral appliqué aux élections communales, Louvain, Ickx &amp; Geets, 1842, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary naturalized citizens and citizens who had acquired Belgian nationality through marriage were only admitted to vote, but not to be candidate, for parliamentary elections in 1976. The concepts of ordinary and grande naturalization were suppressed from the Constitution in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In [[France]], the 1889 Nationality Law barred those who had acquired the French nationality by naturalization or marriage from voting, eligibility and access to several public jobs. In 1938 the delay was reduced to 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrick-weil.com/Fichiers%20du%20site/2003%20-%20D%E9bat%20sur%20la%20nationalit%E9%20fran%E7aise%20(Dico%20Sirinelli).pdf Patrick Weil, Nationalité française (débat sur la)&quot;], dans Jean-François Sirinelli (dir.), Dictionnaire historique de la vie politique française au XXe siècle, Paris, PUF, 1995, p. 719-721&lt;/ref&gt; These discriminations, as well as others against naturalized citizens, were gradually abolished in 1973 (9 January 1973 law) and 1983.

In [[Morocco]], a former French [[protectorate]], and in Guinea, a former French colony, naturalized citizens are prohibited from voting for 5 years after their naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdh50.ma/fr/pdf/contributions/GT10-9.pdf Nadia Bernoussi, L’évolution du processus électoral au Maroc, 22 December 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ife.org.mx/documentos/AI/semghin.htm art. 3, al. 3, Loi Organique portant code électoral guinéen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the President and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] must be natural-born citizens. All other governmental offices may be held by any citizen, although citizens may only run for Congress after an extended period of citizenship (seven years for the House of Representatives and nine for the Senate).

Most countries that exercise [[separation of powers]] forbid a person to be a legislator and government official at the same time. Such provisions are found, for example, in Article I of the U.S. Constitution.

==History of suffrage around the world==
Finland was the first nation in the world to give all adult citizens full suffrage, in other words the right to vote and to run for office (in 1906). New Zealand was the first country in the world to grant all adult citizens the right to vote (in 1893), but women did not get the right to run for the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|New Zealand legislature]] until 1919.

=== Hong Kong ===
Minimum age to vote was reduced from 21 to 18 years in [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1995| 1995]]. According to the Basic Law, the constitution of the territory since 1997, stipulates that all permanent residents (a status conferred by birth or by seven years of residence) have the right to vote. The right of permanent residents who have right of abode in other countries to stand in election is, however, restricted to 12 [[functional constituencies]] by the Legislative Council Ordinance of 1997.

The right to vote and the right to stand in elections are not equal. Less than 250,000 of the electorate are eligible to run in the 30 functional constituencies, of which 23 are elected by less than 80,000 of the electorate, and in the 2008 Legislative Council election 14 members were elected unopposed from these functional constituencies. The size of the electorates of some constituencies are less than 200. Only people who can demonstrate a connection to the sector are eligible to run in a functional constituency.

The Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012, if passed, will amend the Legislative Council Ordinance to restrict the right to stand in Legislative Council by-elections in [[geographical constituencies]] and the District Council (Second) functional constituency. In addition to people who are mentally disabled, bankrupted or imprisoned, members who resigned from their seats will not have the right to stand within six months' time from their resignation. The bill is currently passing through the [[Committee of the Whole|committee stage]].

===India===
* Universal suffrage for all adult citizens aged 21 or older was established under Art. 326 of the 1950 [[Constitution of India]].  The minimum age was reduced to 18 years by the Constitution (Sixty-first Amendment) Act, 1988, with effect from 28 March 1989.

===Japan===

===New Zealand===
{{Main|History of voting in New Zealand}}

* 1853 - British government passes the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]], granting limited self rule, including a [[bicameral parliament]] to the colony. The vote was limited to male British subjects aged 21 or over who owned or rented sufficient property, and were not imprisoned for a serious offence. Communally owned land was excluded from the property qualification, thus disenfranchising most [[Māori people|Māori]] (indigenous) men.
* 1860 - Franchise extended to holders of miner's licenses who met all voting qualifications except that of property.
* 1867 - [[Māori seats]] established, giving Māori four [[reserved seats]] in the [[lower house]]. There was no property qualification; thus Māori men gained universal suffrage before other New Zealanders. The number of seats did not reflect the size of the Māori population, but Māori men who met the property requirement for general electorates were able to vote in them or  in the Māori electorates but not both.
* 1879 - Property requirement abolished.
* 1893 - [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|Women given equal voting rights]] with men, making New Zealand the first nation in the world to allow adult women to vote.
* 1969 - Voting age lowered to 20.
* 1974 - Voting age lowered to 18.
* 1975 - Franchise extended to permanent residents of New Zealand, regardless of whether they have citizenship.
* 1996 - Number of Māori seats increased to reflect Māori population.
* 2010 - Prisoners imprisoned for 1 year or more denied  voting rights while serving the sentence.
* 2012 - The National party, lead by Prime Minister John Key, places a four year suspension on electing Environment Canterbury Councillors.  Earthquake hit Canterbury residents  lose their power to decide how their regional land is used.

===South Africa===

* 1910 — The [[Union of South Africa]] is established by the [[South Africa Act 1909]]. The [[House of Assembly (South Africa)|House of Assembly]] is elected by [[first-past-the-post]] voting in single-member constituencies. The franchise qualifications are the same as those previously existing for elections of the legislatures of the colonies that comprised the Union. In the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State Province|Orange Free State]] the franchise is limited to [[white South African|white]] men. In [[Natal Province|Natal]] the franchise is limited to men meeting property and literacy qualifications; it was theoretically colour-blind but in practise nearly all non-white men were excluded. The traditional &quot;[[Cape Qualified Franchise]]&quot; of the [[Cape Province]] is limited to men meeting property and literacy qualifications and is colour-blind; nonetheless 85% of voters are white. The rights of non-white voters in the Cape Province are protected by an [[entrenched clause]] in the South Africa Act requiring a two-thirds vote in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament.
* 1930 — The [[Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930]] extends the right to vote to all white women over the age of 21.
* 1931 — The [[Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931]] removes the property and literacy qualifications for all white men over the age of 21, but they are retained for non-white voters.
* 1936 — The [[Representation of Natives Act, 1936]] removes [[black African|black]] voters in the Cape Province from the common voters' roll and instead allows them to elect three &quot;Native Representative Members&quot; to the House of Assembly. Four [[Senate of South Africa|Senators]] are to be indirectly elected by chiefs and local authorities to represent black South Africans throughout the country. The act is passed with the necessary two-thirds majority in a joint sitting.
* 1951 — The [[Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951]] is passed by Parliament by an ordinary majority in separate sittings. It purports to remove [[coloured]] voters in the Cape Province from the common voters' roll and instead allow them to elect four &quot;Coloured Representative Members&quot; to the House of Assembly.
* 1952 — In ''[[Harris v Minister of the Interior]]'' the Separate Representation of Voters Act is annulled by the Appellate Division of the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Supreme Court]] because it was not passed with the necessary two-thirds majority in a joint sitting. Parliament passes the [[High Court of Parliament Act, 1952]], purporting to allow it to reverse this decision, but the Appellate Division annuls it as well.
* 1956 — By packing the Senate and the Appellate Division, the government passes the [[South Africa Act Amendment Act, 1956]], reversing the annulment of the Separate Representation of Voters Act and giving it the force of law.
* 1958 — The [[Electoral Law Amendment Act, 1958]] reduces the [[voting age]] for white voters from 21 to 18.
* 1959 — The [[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959]] repeals the Representation of Natives Act, removing all representation of black people in Parliament.
* 1968 — The [[Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968]] repeals the Separate Representation of Voters Act, removing all representation of coloured people in Parliament.
* 1969 — The first election of the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]] (CPRC), which has limited legislative powers, is held. Every Coloured citizen over the age of 21 can vote for it, in first-past-the-post elections in single-member constituencies.
* 1978 — The voting age for the CPRC is reduced from 21 to 18.
* 1981 — The first election of the [[South African Indian Council]] (SAIC), which has limited legislative powers, is held. Every [[Indian South African]] citizen over the age of 18 can vote for it, in first-past-the-post elections in single-member constituencies.
* 1984 — The [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution of 1983]] establishes the [[Tricameral Parliament]]. Two new Houses of Parliament are created, the [[House of Representatives (South Africa)|House of Representatives]] to represent coloured citizens and the [[House of Delegates (South Africa)|House of Delegates]] to represent Indian citizens. Every coloured and Indian citizen over the age of 18 can vote in elections for the relevant house. As with the House of Assembly, the members are elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies. The CPRC and SAIC are abolished.
* 1994 — With the end of [[apartheid]], the [[South African Constitution of 1993|Interim Constitution of 1993]] abolishes the Tricameral Parliament and all racial discrimination in voting rights. A new [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] is created, and every South African citizen over the age of 18 has the right to vote for the assembly. Elections of the assembly are based on [[party-list proportional representation]]. The [[right to vote]] is entrenched in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]].
* 1999 — In ''[[August and Another v Electoral Commission and Others]]'' the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] rules that prisoners cannot be denied the right to vote without a law that explicitly does so.
* 2003 — The [[Electoral Laws Amendment Act, 2003]] purports to prohibit convicted prisoners from voting.
* 2004 — In ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v NICRO and Others]]'' the Constitutional Court rules that prisoners cannot be denied the right to vote, and invalidates the laws that do so.
* 2009 — In ''[[Richter v Minister for Home Affairs and Others]]'' the Constitutional Court rules that South African citizens outside the country cannot be denied the right to vote.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|History of British society|The Parliamentary Franchise in the United Kingdom 1885-1918}}

King [[Henry VI of England]] established in 1432 that only [[Forty shilling freeholders|male owners of property worth at least forty shillings]], a significant sum, were entitled to vote in a county. The rules for boroughs were complex, but also restrictive. Changes were made to the details of the system, but there was no major reform until the [[Reform Act 1832#The franchise|Reform Act 1832]]. [[Parliament of Scotland#Three Estates|Suffrage in Scotland]], an independent state until 1707, was also restricted.
Suffrage in the United Kingdom was slowly changed over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries through the use of the [[Reform Act]]s and the [[Representation of the People Act]]s, culminating in universal suffrage, excluding children and convicted prisoners.
*[[Reform Act 1832]] - extended voting rights to adult males who rented propertied land of a certain value, so allowing 1 in 7 males in the UK voting rights
*[[Reform Act 1867]] - enfranchised all male householders, so increasing male suffrage to the United Kingdom
*[[Representation of the People Act 1884]] - amended the Reform Act of 1867 so that it would apply equally to the countryside; this brought the voting population to 5,500,000, although 40% of males were still disenfranchised, whilst women could not vote
*Between 1885-1918 moves were made by the [[Women's_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom#The formation of a national movement|suffrage]] movement to ensure votes for women. However, the duration of the First World War stopped this reform movement. See also [[The Parliamentary Franchise in the United Kingdom 1885-1918]].
*[[Representation of the People Act 1918]] - the consequences of World War I persuaded the government to expand the right to vote, not only for the many men who fought in the war who were disenfranchised, but also for the women who helped in the factories and elsewhere as part of the war effort. Property restrictions for voting were lifted for men, who could vote at 21; however women's votes were given with these property restrictions, and were limited to those over 30 years old. This raised the electorate from 7.7 million to 21.4 million with women making up 40% of the electorate. Seven percent of the electorate had more than one vote. The first election with this system was the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918]]
*[[Representation of the People Act 1928]] - this made women's voting rights equal with men, with voting possible at 21 with no property restrictions
*[[Representation of the People Act 1948]] - the act was passed to prevent [[plural voting]]
*[[Representation of the People Act 1969]] - extension of suffrage to those 18 and older
*The [[Representation of the People Act]]s of [[Representation of the People Act 1983|1983]], [[Representation of the People Act 1985|1985]] and [[Representation of the People Act 2000|2000]] further modified voting
*[[Electoral Administration Act 2006]] - modified the ways in which people were able to vote and reduced the age of standing at a public election from 21 to 18.

===United States===
{{Main|Voting rights in the United States}}
In the United States, suffrage is determined by the separate states, not federally (Wyoming being the first state to instill suffrage). However, the &quot;right to vote&quot; is expressly mentioned in five Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These five Amendments limit the basis upon which the right to vote may be abridged or denied:

*[[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (1868): Regarding apportionment of Representatives.

*[[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] (1870): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.&quot;

*[[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] (1920): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.&quot;

*[[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment]] (1961): provides that residents of the [[District of Columbia]] can vote for the President and Vice-President.

*[[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] (1964): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.&quot;

*[[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]] (1971): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.&quot;

===Muslim world===
{{Main|Timeline of first women's suffrage in majority-Muslim countries}}

==Etymology==
The word ''suffrage'' comes from Latin ''suffragium'', meaning &quot;vote&quot;, &quot;political support&quot;, and ''the right to vote''.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/suffrage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suffrage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=suffrage&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the Latin word is uncertain, with some sources citing Latin ''suffragari'' &quot;lend support, vote for someone&quot;, from ''sub'' &quot;under&quot; + ''fragor'' &quot;crash, din, shouts (as of approval)&quot;, related to ''frangere'' &quot;to break&quot; (related to ''fraction''). Other sources say that attempts to connect ''suffragium'' with ''fragor'' cannot be taken seriously.&lt;ref name=latin&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Suffragium.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some etymologists think that it may be related to ''suffrago'' and may have originally meant an ankle bone or knuckle bone.&lt;ref name=latin/&gt;
