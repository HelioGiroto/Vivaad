[[File:Leviathan gr.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of Hobbes' ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'' famously portrays the metaphor by showing a body formed of a multitude of citizens which is surmounted by a King's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Landscape, nature, and the body politic |page=87 |author=Kenneth Olwig |year=2002 |quote=The frontispiece to Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan ... is a particularly famous example of the depiction of the body politic ... |isbn=978-0-299-17424-8 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''body politic''' is a [[metaphor]] in which a nation is considered to be a [[corporation|corporate entity]],&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{citation |quote=A nation regarded as a corporate entity |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com |chapter=body politic}}&lt;/ref&gt; being likened to a [[human body]]. Confusingly, the word &quot;politic&quot; in this phrase is a [[postpositive adjective]]; so it is &quot;a body of a [[wikt:politic|politic]] nature&quot; rather than &quot;a politic &lt;!-- singular -  wiktionary lists singular &quot;a politic&quot; as an archaic synonym of &quot;a politician&quot; --&gt;of a bodily nature&quot;. A body politic comprises all the people in a particular country considered as a single group. The [[analogy]] is typically continued by reference to the apex of government as the [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84718-272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of the [[Aesop's fable]], &quot;[[The Belly and the Members]]&quot;. The metaphor also appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans. [[Charlotte Mandell]]|title=The Body Politic: Corporeal Metaphor in Revolutionary France, 1770-1800|page=xv|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-2817-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The metaphor developed in [[Renaissance]] times, as the medical knowledge based upon the classical work of [[Galen]] was being challenged by new thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were made between the supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field which were considered to be [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections which might be remedied by [[purgative|purges]] and [[nostrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literal manifestation==
{{Anchor|In statehood}}In  one use &quot;body politic&quot; derives from the mediæval political concept of &quot;the king's two bodies&quot; first noted, as a point of [[theology]] as much as [[constitution|statehood]], by the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] in  ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462. He explains that the ''character angelus'' of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time  Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: &quot;made a body pollitike callid a reawme&quot;.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;   In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the &quot;Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691071209|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] with his ''[[Petition of Right]]''. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and  royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-revolutionary monarchy of France also sought legitimacy from the principle, extending it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the &quot;body politic&quot; of the old king, in a physical &quot;transfer of corporeality&quot;, on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102}&lt;/ref&gt;
