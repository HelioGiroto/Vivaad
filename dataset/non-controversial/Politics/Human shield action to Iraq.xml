      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20351">[[Image:Human shields black bus.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Human shields black bus, 25 January 2003]]'''Human shield action to Iraq''' was a group of people who travelled to [[Iraq]] to act as [[human shields]] with the purpose of preventing the [[U.S.]]-led [[coalition of the willing|coalition]] troops from bombing certain locations during the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]].

== Chronology ==
{{COI|date=March 2010|section}}
[[File:Ken O'Keefe.jpg|thumb|144px|left|Ken O'Keefe, founder of the action]]
In December 2002 [[Kenneth O'Keefe]], an ex-[[US Marine]] and [[Gulf War]] veteran who had formally renounced his [[US citizenship]] posted a call to action for large numbers of western citizens to migrate to Iraq and deploy themselves as &quot;Human Shields&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Call to Action Ken O'Keefe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title='STOP THIS WAR - SUPPORT THE UKS HUMAN SHIELD MISSION TO IRAQ' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[IndyMedia]], December 26, 2002|url=http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2002/12/3533.shtml|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action was ultimately named the TJP (Truth Justice Peace) Human Shield Action to Iraq. It was his position that protests and petitions had no chance of pre-venting the invasion and he reasoned that a large presence of western citizens, strategically placed in Iraq, at sites critical to the civilian population, was the only viable deterrent to the pre-planned war. The strategy of the action was based on the huge disparity between the way western lives and non-western lives are valued, thus he argued that thousands of Human Shields deployed to sites protected by the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] would make the invasion politically untenable. O'Keefe was in the unique position of publicly acknowledging [[Saddam Hussein]] as a &quot;violent dictator&quot; and &quot;mass-murderer&quot; before he arrived in Saddam controlled Iraq, apparently he did this in an attempt to neutralize the inevitable accusations that the Human Shields were simply pawns of Saddam.  Consequently he received no favor from the dictator, his influence within the action declined rapidly as he traveled to Iraq, and eventually he was [[deported]] days before the invasion. Before his deportation he repeatedly pointed to US and British support for Hussein during all of his worst crimes, ultimately he argued that it was the people of Iraq who would suffer most from war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Morning Herald article&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='In harm's way' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]], January 11, 2003|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/10/1041990095624.html|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ken O'Keefe interview BBC HardTalk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title='Human Shields Iraq' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[BBC HardTalk]], January 2003|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3hhxEql4|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Human shield protest in Iraq: Ask campaign leader&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Human shield protest in Iraq: Ask campaign leader' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[BBC News]], January 16, 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/forum/2654787.stm|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Statement from Ken O'Keefe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='I'm an ex-marine recruiting human shields' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[BBC News]], February 19, 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2664297.stm|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview of Ken O'Keefe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title='NTV Turkish 24 hour television' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[NTV Turkey|NTV]], January 4, 2003|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/none-by-suzanne-abu-tair-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Article in WorldNetDaily&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title='Looming Iraq war divides U.S. vets' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[WorldNetDaily]], February 13, 2003|url=http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=31013|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;call to action&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Back to Iraq as a human shield' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[The Guardian]], 29 December 2002|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/dec/29/iraq1|accessdate=29 December 2002 | date=29 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN Q&amp;A with Ken O'Keefe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Q&amp;A WITH ZAIN VERJEE' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[CNN Q&amp;A]], January 9, 2003|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0301/09/i_qaa.01.html| date=March 2010 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN interview Ken O'Keefe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='CNN CONNIE CHUNG TONIGHT' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[CNN]], January 23, 2003|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0301/23/cct.00.html| date=March 2010 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX News&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Human Shields' Booted After Criticizing Iraq's Instructions' Ken O'Keefe|work=[[Fox News Channel]], March 13, 2003|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80955,00.html|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003 a group of dedicated anti-war activists joined O'Keefe in London and set out to carry out the plan as a new form of non-violent direct action. Acknowledging that traditional forms of protest were largely ineffective, on January 25, 2003 a group of 50 volunteers left [[London]] and headed for [[Baghdad]] with the intention of acting as human shields.&lt;ref name=&quot;headforiraq&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Human shields' head for Iraq|work=[[BBC News]], 25 January 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2693289.stm|accessdate=30 January 2005 | date=25 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convoy travelled through [[Europe]] and [[Turkey]] by bus to pick up like-minded people along the way, totalling roughly 75 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;flocktoiraq&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Volunteer 'human shields' flock to Iraq|work=[[BBC News]], 17 February 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2771529.stm|accessdate=30 January 2005 | date=17 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 200 to 500 people eventually made their way into [[Iraq]] before the U.S. invasion in March.&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers_1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Shield Movement - Stefan Simanowitz|work=paragraph 8, [[Z Magazine|Z Magazine Online]], November 2003, Volume 16, Number 11|url=http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html|accessdate=30 January 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041110001317/http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html |archivedate = November 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;buses_go_back&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=UK bus owner defends Iraq trip|work=[[CNN]], Special Report, War in Iraq, 4 March 2003|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/04/sprj.irq.human.shields/|accessdate=30 January 2005 | date=4 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon reaching Baghdad, a strategy was formed on the assumption that there would not be enough human shields to avert an invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;avert_invasion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Shield Movement|work=paragraph 8, [[Z Magazine|Z Magazine Online]], November 2003, Volume 16, Number 11|url=http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html|accessdate=30 January 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041110001317/http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html |archivedate = November 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to involve the voluntary deployment of activists to strategic locations throughout Baghdad, and possibly Basra, in an effort to avert the bombing of those locations. There was much internal debate about which locations were to be chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;internal_debate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Shield Movement|work=paragraph 6, [[Z Magazine|Z Magazine Online]], November 2003, Volume 16, Number 11|url=http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html|accessdate=30 January 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041110001317/http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html |archivedate = November 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Human shields greeted crossing border into Iraq.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Human shields greeted as they cross the border into Iraq, 15 February 2003]]
Eventually volunteers deployed to Al Daura Electrical Plant, Baghdad South Electrical Plant, 7 April Water Treatment Plant, Al Daura Water Treatment Plant, Tejio Food Silo, Al Daura Oil Refinery and Al Mamun Telecommunications Facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;hs_sites&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Shields Put Bush on Notice|work=Human Shield Action to Iraq official website|url=http://www.humanshields.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=16|accessdate=30 January 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20031223121428/http://www.humanshields.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=16 |archivedate = December 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to work closely with the Iraqi government was not something many of shield volunteers felt comfortable with. Some felt that the list delivered by the officials compromised their autonomy. Others felt that they would rather be deployed in schools, hospitals, and orphanages. These shield volunteers left Iraq. The rest took up residence at the sites, a list of which was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff together with a request that they recognize their assertion that targeting these sites would be in violation of Article 54 [[Protocol I|Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention]]. There was no response to the letters.

At its peak the total of shield volunteers in Baghdad numbered about 500, but the realization that the thousands needed to have a chance of stopping a blitz on Baghdad had not materialized, combined with the failure of the United Nations to forestall war, meant that bombing was imminent. Many of the shields chose to stay; many others chose to leave. Still others, like O’Keefe, were ordered out by the Iraqi government. One 21-year-old human shield, [[Tom Hurndall]], left Baghdad for reasons of safety. He went to the Palestinian territories where he was shot by an Israeli soldier while working with the [[International Solidarity Movement]].

None of the 80 shields who stayed in Baghdad throughout the war were killed or injured. None of the sites where they were residing were destroyed.

During their deployments a small group of volunteers led by Gordon Sloan of New Zealand took on the job of vetting sites to ensure they were not in close vicinity to military facilities. This was to be the cause of some conflict with their Iraqi host, Dr. [[Abdul Razak al-Hashimi]], [[Saddam Hussein]]'s spokesman during the first Gulf War, and head of the [[Friendship, Peace and Solidarity]] organisation which was hosting the activists, under the authority of the [[Baathist]] government.&lt;ref name=&quot;hashimi_conflict&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Body blow as human shields ordered out|work=[[The Age]], 8 March 2003|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/07/1046826530928.html?oneclick=true|accessdate=30 January 2005 | location=Melbourne|date=8 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an invasion imminent, Hashimi became frustrated by Sloan's explorations, called a meeting, and asked the activists to deploy to sites or leave Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;hashimi_mistake&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Christiaan Briggs Reports On Iraq|work=[[Scoop (news website)|Scoop]], 14 March 2003|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0303/S00105.htm|accessdate=30 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hashimi's meeting is said by some of the leading volunteers to have been a costly political mistake. It was the trigger of much anxiety among the volunteers&lt;ref name=&quot;hs_anxiety&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Company of a stranger|work=[[Guardian Unlimited]], 19 July 2003|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,999861,00.html|accessdate=30 January 2005 | location=London | date=19 July 2003 | first=Rageh | last=Omaar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative reporting in the media, including mis-reports that activists were being forced to deploy to military sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;war_crimes_prosecution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Shield Movement|work=[[Z Magazine|Z Magazine Online]], November 2003, Volume 16, Number 11|url=http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html|accessdate=30 January 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041110001317/http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2003/simanowitzpr1103.html |archivedate = November 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also at this point that some of the British volunteers were to return to London along with the two double-decker red buses and their owner, which were originally meant to have left soon after arrival.&lt;ref name=&quot;buses_go_back&quot;/&gt;

The paranoia that rose up around Hashimi's announcement and the reports that the buses were leaving Iraq slowed the influx of activists into Iraq, and caused some of those already there to leave Iraq, believing they had lost credibility through Hashimi's actions. The Iraqi authorities, on the other hand, saw Kenneth O'Keefe, Sloan, and other organisers as constantly challenging Hashimi's authority and being deliberately disruptive, and that some would-be shields were taking too long to deploy to sites. Five of the 'trouble makers'  were then asked to leave the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;hashimi_conflict&quot;/&gt;

Many activists stayed on, however, and continued to shield the chosen sites. It is claimed that eighty human shields stayed in the Baghdad area throughout the bombing campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;war_crimes_prosecution&quot;/&gt;

== Analysis and effects of the human shields ==
[[Image:Human shield meeting.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Human shields meeting in Iraq, 1 March 2003, at the [[Palestine Hotel]] in Baghdad, Iraq]]
On February 26, 2003, Senior CNN Pentagon Correspondent, Jamie McIntyre, commented that the &quot;Pentagon says they will try to work around human shields&quot; as long as they were not deployed to military sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;military_work_around&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcript of Lou Dobbs Moneyline|work=[[CNN]], 26 February 2003|url=http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0302/26/mlld.00.html|accessdate=30 January 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the shielded sites, only one&amp;mdash;arguably a legitimate target under the [[Geneva Conventions]]&amp;mdash;was eventually bombed, the Al Mamun Telecommunications Facility, one day after the human shields pulled out of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombed_day_after&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Human shield summary of action|work=Human Shield Action to Iraq official website, front page|url=http://www.humanshields.org|accessdate=30 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For violating a U.S. prewar travel ban, human shields from the U.S. faced fines and/or imprisonment.&lt;ref name=&quot;jail_fines&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Human shields face 12 years' jail for visiting Iraq  |work=[[The Guardian]], 13 August 2003|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1017313,00.html|accessdate=20 May 2006 | location=London | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg | date=13 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day after the departure of the human shield convoy, White House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, released a statement condemning the action and [[Fox News]] reported that U.S. leaders were considering prosecuting U.S. human shields for war crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;war_crimes_prosecution&quot;/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
The Human Shield Movement was criticised for what many saw as being an overt act of aiding Saddam Hussein’s regime. Charges of the shields being &quot;dupes&quot; and &quot;useful idiots&quot; for Saddam were widespread in the U.S. The human shields countered that while various governments around the globe carry out acts of aggression, the human shield action saw fit to defend against this one.

[[Human Rights Watch]] stated that &quot;civilians acting as human shields, whether voluntary or not, contribute indirectly to the war capability of a state. Their actions do not pose a direct risk to opposing forces. Because they are not directly engaged in hostilities against an adversary, they retain their civilian immunity from attack.&quot; Human Rights Watch also noted that the use by a state of human shields, voluntary or not, is a violation of international law, citing Protocol I of the First Geneva Convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;human_rights_watch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=International Humanitarian Law Issues In A Potential War In Iraq|work=[[Human Rights Watch]], 20 February 2005|url=http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/iraq0202003.htm|accessdate=3 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonah Goldberg]] claimed after a debate with O'Keefe, that &quot;O'Keefe and his friends are objectively in favour of Saddam Hussein and his murderous regime because they believe he is uniquely worth defending with their bodies. They may be brave, I guess, but they're still idiots, and I'm sure Saddam is grateful for them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jonah_goldberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Saddam's Idiots|work=[[Townhall.com]], 10 January 2003|url=http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/jonahgoldberg/2003/01/10/168964.html|accessdate=3 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Ermanno, chairwoman of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, cited reports that Iraqi officials were arranging transportation, accommodations and news conferences for the human shields and that they were being used for propaganda purposes by Saddam Hussein. &quot;To go down to Iraq and live and act there on the regime's expense, then you're supporting a terrible dictator. I think that method is entirely wrong,&quot; Ermanno told Swedish Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;maria_ermanno&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Some British &quot;human Shields&quot; Flee Iraq, Cite Safety Fears|work=[[Associated Press]], 2 March 2003|url=http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2003/03/1579215.php|accessdate=3 June 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi regime was also criticised for encouraging and facilitating the human shield actions, since this was seen as violation of [[international law]] and Protocol I, article 20 of the [[Geneva Convention]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.
