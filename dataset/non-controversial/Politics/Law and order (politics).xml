      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12761">In politics, '''law and order''' refers to demands for a strict [[criminal justice]] system, especially in relation to [[violent crime|violent]] and [[property crime]], through harsher criminal [[sentence (law)|penalties]]. These penalties may include longer terms of imprisonment, [[mandatory sentencing]], [[three strikes law]]s, and in some countries, [[capital punishment]].

Supporters of &quot;law and order&quot; argue that effective [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]] combined with [[incarceration]] is the most effective means of crime prevention. Opponents of law and order argue that a system of harsh criminal punishment is ultimately ineffective because it does not address underlying or systemic causes of crime.

&quot;Law and order&quot; is a recurring theme in [[political campaign]]s around the world. Candidates may exaggerate or even manufacture a problem with law and order, or characterise their opponents as &quot;weak&quot; on the issue, to generate public support. The expression also sometimes carries the implication of arbitrary or unnecessary law enforcement, or excessive use of [[police power]]s.

==Political issue in the United States==
&quot;Law and order&quot; was a powerful conservative theme in the U.S. in the 1960s.  The leading exponents in the late 1960s were Republicans [[Ronald Reagan]] (as governor of California) and [[Richard Nixon]] (as presidential candidate in 1968). They used it to dissolve a liberal consensus about crime that involved federal court decisions and a pushback against illegal drugs and violent gang activity.  White ethnics in northern cities turned against the Democratic party, blaming it for being soft on crime and rioters&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Flamm, ''Law and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

First introduced by [[Barry Goldwater]] in his ill-fated run for president in 1964, &quot;Law and order&quot; punished [[Lyndon Johnson]] and the Democrats and propelled Reagan to the governorship in 1966 and Nixon to the White House in 1968. 

Liberals, Flamm (2005) argues, were unable to craft a compelling message for anxious voters. Instead, liberals either ignored the crime crisis, claimed that law and order was a racist ruse, or maintained that social programs would solve the &quot;root causes&quot; of civil disorder, which by 1968 seemed increasingly unlikely and contributed to a loss of faith in the ability of the government to do what it was above all sworn to do—protect personal security and private property.  Conservatives rejected the liberal notions.  &quot;How long are we going to abdicate law and order&quot; House GOP leader [[Gerald Ford]] demanded in 1966, &quot;in favor of a soft social theory that the man who heaves a brick through your window or tosses a firebomb into your car is simply the misunderstood and underprivileged product of a broken home?&quot;

Flamm (2005) documents how conservatives constructed a persuasive message that argued that the [[Civil Rights Movement]] had contributed to racial unrest and Johnson's [[Great Society]] had rewarded rather than punished the perpetrators of violence. Conservatives demanded that the national government should promote respect for law and order and contempt for those who violated it, regardless of cause. 

After Reagan took office in 1981 and started appointing tough conservative judges, the law became as weapon against crime.   The number of prisoners tripled from 500,000 in 1980 to 1.5 million in 1994.  Conservatives at the state level built many more prisons and convicts served much longer terms, with less parole. By the time they were released they were much older and thus much less violent.&lt;ref&gt;FBI, ''Uniform Crime Reports'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Ghetto Riots===
Two developments were involved. After the first civil rights laws were passed, rebellions by angry blacks broke out in over 100 cities, with nights of violence against police and looting and burning of local white-owned businesses.  The inner neighborhoods of many major cities, such as [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[New York]], were burned out.  National Guard and Army troops were called out. At one point machine gun units were stationed on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington to prevent rioters from burning it down.  Every summer from 1964 through 1970 was a &quot;long hot summer.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ann K. Johnson, ''Urban Ghetto Riots, 1965-1968'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet L. Abu-Lughod, ''Race, Space, and Riots in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Fogelson, ''Violence as Protest: A Study of Riots and Ghettos'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, ''Report on Civil Disorders'' (1968), the famous the Kerner Commission Report&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime===
Second there was a dramatic rise in violent street crime, including drug-related murders, as well as armed robberies, rapes and violent assaults. Inner city neighborhoods became far more violent and people tried to move out to safer ones. The number of violent crimes more than tripled from 288,000 in 1960 (including 9,110 murders) to 1,040,000 in 1975 (including 20,510 murders).  Then the numbers levelled off.&lt;ref&gt;FBI Uniform Crime Reports. Violent crimes included murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.  Source: Table Ec1-10 - Estimated crimes known to police, by type of offense: 1960-1997, in Susan Carter, ed. ''Historical Statistics of the United States Millennial Edition Online'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In response to sharply rising rates of crime in the 1960s, treatment of criminal offenders, both accused and convicted, became a highly divisive topic in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968 U.S. Presidential Election]].  [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] candidate [[Spiro Agnew]], then the governor of [[Maryland]], often used the expression; Agnew and Nixon won and were  reelected in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flamm&quot;&gt;Flamm, ''Law and Order'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
Advocates of stricter policies toward crime and those accused of crime have won many victories since the issue became important.  Highlights include stringent laws dealing with the sale and use of illicit drugs. For example the [[Rockefeller drug laws]] passed in New York state in 1973&amp;mdash; and later, laws mandating tougher sentences for repeat offenders, such as the [[three strikes law]]s adopted by many states starting in 1993 and the re-legalization of the [[death penalty]]  in several U.S. states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flamm&quot;/&gt;

Opponents of these and similar laws have often accused advocates of [[racism]]. [[Civil rights]] groups have steadfastly opposed the trend toward harsher measures generally.  The law-and-order issue caused a deep rift within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the late 1960s and 1970s, and this rift was seen by many political scientists as a major contributing factor in [[Ronald Reagan]]'s two successful Presidential runs in 1980 and 1984.  In both elections, millions of registered Democrats voted for Reagan, and they collectively became known as &quot;[[Reagan Democrat]]s.&quot;  Many of these voters eventually changed their party registration and became Republicans, especially in the [[U.S. Southern States|South]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flamm&quot;/&gt;

Though violent crimes are the primary focus of law-and-order advocates, quality-of-life crimes are sometimes also included under the law-and-order umbrella, particularly in local elections.  A tough stance on this matter greatly helped [[Rudolph Giuliani]] win two terms as mayor of [[New York City]] in the 1990s, and was also widely cited as propelling [[Gavin Newsom]] to victory over a more liberal opponent in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s mayoral election of 2003.
[[Richard Riordan]] became [[Los Angeles]]'s new mayor also in 1993 for the first time in 20 years, after [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] retired. 

Platt (1995) argues that the intensity of law-and-order campaigns represents a significant shift in criminal justice that involves modernization and increased funding for police technology and personnel, privatization of security services and surveillance, higher rates of incarceration, and greater racial inequality in security and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony M. Platt, &quot;Crime Rave&quot;, ''Monthly Review: An Independent Socialist Magazine'', June 1995, Vol. 47#2 pp 35-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==International issue==
Recently, crime has also become a prominent issue in [[Canadian]], [[Australia]]n, [[South Africa]]n, [[France|French]], and [[New Zealand]] politics.

==Criticisms==
{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}
Critics of law-and-order politics commonly point to actual and potential abuses of judicial and police powers, including [[police brutality]] and [[Police misconduct|misconduct]], [[racial profiling]], and prison overcrowding. As an example, they argue that while crime in New York City dropped under Mayor Giuliani, reports of police brutality increased during the same period. This period included the fatal shootings of [[Amadou Diallo]] and [[Sean Bell]], and the [[Abner Louima]] incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Rudy_Giuliani_Crime.htm Rudy Giuliani Crime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-feldman/giuliani-and-violence-in-_b_43092.html Jeffrey Feldman/Giuliani and violence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/march99/newyork30.htm Washingtonpost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In extreme cases, civil unrest has broken out in retaliation against law-and-order politics, as happened in [[1981 Brixton riot|London's Brixton district in 1981]], [[Los Angeles riots of 1992|Los Angeles in 1992]], and [[2005 civil unrest in France|France in 2005]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In 2009, Pennsylvania juvenile court judges [[Mark Ciavarella]] and Michael Conahan were pled guilty in the &quot;[[kids for cash]]&quot; scandal, of taking kickbacks from [[private prison]] industry officials in exchange for sentencing over 1,000 youths to prison terms for minor offenses.&lt;ref&gt; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7887502.stm news.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuff.co.nz_1400970&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/oddstuff/1400970 |title=US judges admit to jailing children for money |date=22 February 2009 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maricopa County]] Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]], a role model of tougher sentencing campaigners for his hardline corrections policies, was investigated by the [[FBI]] — starting in 2009 — for alleged abuses of power and intimidation of dissenting officials, among [[Maricopa County Sheriff's Office controversies#Joe Arpaio|other controversies]]. [http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/05/22/20090522FBI.html] [http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/03/05/20100305fbi-expands-joe-arpaio-probe-to-county-attorney.html]

A [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling in 2011 ordered the state of California to cut its inmate population, citing prison overcrowding to be in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]].
