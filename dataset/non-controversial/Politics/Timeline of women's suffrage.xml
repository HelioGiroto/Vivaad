{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}
{{Cleanup|date=March 2008}}
[[Women's suffrage]] has been achieved at various times in various countries throughout the world. In many countries women's suffrage was granted before [[universal suffrage]], so women (and men) from certain classes or [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] were still unable to vote, while some granted it to both sexes at the same time.

The timeline below lists years when women's suffrage was enacted in various places. In many cases the first voting took place in a subsequent year.

[[New Zealand]] in 1893 is often said to be the [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|first country in the world to give women the right to vote]].  A contestant for being the first independent nation to grant women the right to vote would be [[Sweden]], where conditional woman suffrage was granted during the [[age of liberty]] between 1718 and 1771, when taxpaying women listed in their guilds as professionals were allowed to vote&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlsson-Sjögreen 1866&quot;&gt;* Åsa Karlsson-Sjögren: ''&quot;Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten : medborgarskap och representation 1723–1866&quot;'' (Men, women and the vote: citizenship and representation 1723–1866) (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Disclaimer: This timeline reflects a vast amount of information from the women's suffrage movement throughout the globe. In many cases, countries passed various laws which progressively gave women the right to vote. Many countries may appear on the list more than once because restrictions on suffrage were only lifted slowly. This list only states the right to vote; for other rights, see [[Timeline of women's rights (other than voting)]].''

** {{flagicon|Victoria}} Women in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]] were unintentionally enfranchised by the ''Electoral Act'' (1863), and proceeded to vote in the following year's elections.

[[Wyoming]] acquired statehood in 1890 ([[Utah]] in 1896), allowing women to cast votes in federal elections. The United States as a whole acquired women's suffrage in 1920 (see below) through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]; voting qualifications in the U.S., even in federal elections, are set by the states, and this amendment prohibited states from discriminating on the basis of sex.
