      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10482">'''Disarmament''' is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing weapons. Disarmament generally refers to a country's [[military]] or specific type of weaponry. Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of [[weapons of mass destruction]], such as [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]. General and Complete Disarmament refers to the removal of all weaponry, including conventional arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNODA&quot;&gt;[http://www.un.org/disarmament/ UNITED NATIONS - Office for Disarmament Affairs] (UNODA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of disarmament==
Disarmament can be contrasted with [[arms control]], which essentially refers to the act of ''limiting'' arms rather than eliminating them. A distinction can also be made between disarmament as a process (the process of eliminating weapons), and disarmament as an end state (the absence of weapons). Disarmament has also come to be associated with two things:{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*[[Nuclear disarmament]], referring to the elimination of nuclear weapons.
*[[Unilateral disarmament]], the elimination of weapons outside of the framework of an international agreement, ''i.e.'', they are not bound by a treaty such as [[Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty|START]].

Philosophically, disarmament may be viewed as a form of [[demilitarization]]; part of an economic, political, technical, and military process to reduce and eliminate weapons systems. Thus, disarmament may be part of a set of other strategies, like [[economic conversion]], which aim to reduce the power of war making institutions and associated constituencies.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
An example on the feasibility of the elimination of weapons is the policy of gradual reduction of [[arquebus|guns]] in Japan during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].  In two centuries, Japan passed from being the country with more guns per capita to producing (or importing) none.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In the early 1930s, US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent this message to the [[World Disarmament Conference]]: &quot;If all nations will agree wholly to eliminate from possession and use the weapons which make possible a successful attack, defences automatically will become impregnable and the frontiers and independence of every nation will become secure.&quot;{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1961, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] gave a speech before the UN General Assembly where he announced the US &quot;intention to challenge the Soviet Union, not to an arms race, but to a peace race - to advance together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been achieved.&quot; He went on to call for a global general and complete disarmament, offering a rough outline for how this could be accomplished:
:The program to be presented to this assembly - for general and complete disarmament under effective international control - moves to bridge the gap between those who insist on a gradual approach and those who talk only of the final and total achievement. It would create machinery to keep the peace as it destroys the machinery of war. It would proceed through balanced and safeguarded stages designed to give no state a military advantage over another. It would place the final responsibility for verification and control where it belongs, not with the big powers alone, not with one's adversary or one's self, but in an international organization within the framework of the United Nations. It would assure that indispensable condition of disarmament - true inspection - and apply it in stages proportionate to the stage of disarmament. It would cover delivery systems as well as weapons. It would ultimately halt their production as well as their testing, their transfer as well as their possession. It would achieve under the eyes of an international disarmament organization, a steady reduction in force, both nuclear and conventional, until it has abolished all armies and all weapons except those needed for internal order and a new United Nations Peace Force. And it starts that process now, today, even as the talks begin. In short, general and complete disarmament must no longer be a slogan, used to resist the first steps. It is no longer to be a goal without means of achieving it, without means of verifying its progress, without means of keeping the peace. It is now a realistic plan, and a test - a test of those only willing to talk and a test of those willing to act.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Nuclear disarmament==
{{Main|Nuclear disarmament}} 
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb| [[United States]] and [[USSR]]/[[Russia]]n [[nuclear weapons]] stockpiles, 1945-2006. These numbers include warheads not actively deployed, including those on reserve status or scheduled for dismantlement. Stockpile totals do not necessarily reflect nuclear capabilities since they ignore size, range, type, and delivery mode.]]

Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating [[nuclear weapons]] and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.

Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] occurring, especially accidentally. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].

Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|nuclear disarmament groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Greenpeace]] and [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]. There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapons]] and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Schell. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070702/schell The Spirit of June 12] ''The Nation'', July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/1982 1982 - a million people march in New York City]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misconceptions about disarmament==

In his definition of &quot;disarmament&quot;, [[David Carlton]] writes in the Oxford University Press Political dictionary, &quot;But confidence in such measures of arms control, especially when unaccompanied by extensive means of verification, has not been strengthened by the revelation that [[Soviet program of biological weapons|the Soviet Union in its last years successfully concealed]] consistent and systematic cheating on its obligations under the [[Biological Weapons Convention]].&quot;  He also notes, &quot;Now a freeze or a mutually agreed increase is not strictly speaking disarmament at all. And such measures may not even be intended to be a first step towards any kind of reduction or abolition. For the aim may simply be to promote stability in force structures. Hence a new term to cover such cases has become fashionable since the 1960s, namely, arms control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/disarmament?cat=technology disarmament: Definition and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disarmament by definition involves inspection and verification procedures.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Thus, the book by [[Seymour Melman]], ''[[Inspection for Disarmament]]'', addresses various problems related to the problem of inspection for disarmament, evasion teams, and capabilities and limitations of aerial inspection. Gradually, as the idea of arms control displaced the idea of disarmament, the weaknesses of the present arms control paradigm have created problems for the idea of disarmament itself. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
