'''Titus Livius Patavinus''' (59 BC &amp;ndash; AD 17)—known as '''Livy''' in [[English language|English]]—was a [[Ancient Rome| Roman]] historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people. ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book) |Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'', &quot;Books from the Foundation of the City,&quot; covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome well before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of [[Augustus]] in Livy's own time. He was on familiar terms with the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] family, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor [[Claudius]], as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history.{{Sfn | Foster | 1874 | p = xii | ps =, citing [[Suetonius]], ''Claudius'', xli.}}  Livy and Augustus's wife, [[Livia]], were from the same [[gens|clan]] in different locations, although not related by blood.

==Life==
Livy was born as '''Titus Livius''' in Patavium in northern Italy, now modern [[Padua]]. There is a debate about the year of Titus Livius' birth, 64 BC or more likely 59 BC. At the time of Livy’s birth, his home city of Patavium was the second wealthiest city in the Italian peninsula.  Patavium was a part of the province of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] at the time. In his works, Livy often expressed his deep affection and pride for Patavium, and the city was well known for its conservative values in morality and politics.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | p = ix}}

Livy’s teen years were during the 40s BC, a time that coincided with the civil wars that were occurring throughout the Roman world.  The governor of Cisalpine Gaul at the time, a man called [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)| Asinius Pollio]], had tried to bring Patavium into the camp of [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] (Mark Antony), who was one of the three men in the fight for control over Rome. The wealthier citizens of Patavium refused to contribute money and arms to Asinius Pollio and went into hiding. Asinius Pollio then attempted to bribe the slaves of the wealthy citizens of Patavium to expose the whereabouts of their masters. Asinius Pollio's bribery did not work, and the citizens of Patavium pledged their allegiance to conservatism and the senate instead. Therefore, Livy and the other citizens of Patavium did not end up supporting Marcus Antonius in his campaign for control over Rome. It is likely, then, that the Roman civil wars prevented Livy from pursuing a higher education in Rome or going on a Grand Tour of Greece, which was common for adolescent males during the time. Later on, Asinius Pollio made a jibe at Livy's &quot;patavinity,&quot; saying that Livy's Latin showed certain &quot;provincialisms&quot; frowned on at Rome.  His jibe at Livy and his &quot;patavinity&quot;, however, may have been said because of the fact that the city of Patavium had rejected Asinius Pollio, and he still harboured harsh feelings toward the city as a whole.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = ix–x}}

Titus Livius probably went to Rome in the 30s BC, and it is likely that he spent a large amount of time in the city after this, although it may not have been his primary home. During his time in Rome, he was never a senator nor held any other governmental position. His elementary mistakes in military matters show that he was never a soldier. However, he was educated in philosophy and rhetoric. It seems that Livy had the financial resources and means to live an independent life.  He devoted a large part of his life to his writings, which he was able to do because of his financial freedom.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = x}}

Livy was known to give recitations to small audiences, but he was not heard of to engage in declamation, which was a common pastime. He was familiar with the emperor Augustus, formerly [[Augustus|Octavian]], and the imperial family. Octavian was one of the three men fighting for the control of Rome during the Civil Wars in the 40s BC. Octavian gained power after defeating Marcus Antonius and [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], and was later given the honorary name of Augustus. Considering that Augustus came to be known as the greatest Roman Emperor in the eyes of the Romans, being a historian under Augustus was very beneficial to Livy’s career even after his death.  It is said that Livy was the one who encouraged the future emperor Claudius, who was born in 10 BC, to explore the writing of history during his childhood. Livy himself was married and had at least one daughter and one son.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = x}}

Perhaps Livy’s most famous work was his history of Rome. In it he explains the complete history of the city of Rome, from its foundation to the death of Augustus. Because he was writing under the emperor Augustus, Livy’s history emphasizes the great triumphs of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Payne | title = The Roman Triumph | place = London | publisher = Robert Hale | year = 1962 | page = 38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote his history with embellished accounts of Roman heroism in order to promote the new type of government implemented by Augustus when he became emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Donald R | last = Dudley | title = The Romans: 850 BC – AD 337 | place = New York | publisher = Alfred A Knopf | year = 1970 | page = 19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Livy’s preface to his history, he said that he did not care whether his personal fame remained in darkness, as long as his work helped to “preserve the memory of the deeds of the world’s preeminent nation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Andrew | last = Feldherr | title = Spectacle and Society in Livy’s History | place = London | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1998 | p = ix}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Livy was writing about events that had occurred hundreds of years beforehand, the value of his history was questionable, although many Romans came to believe what he wrote to be the true history of Rome’s foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Fritz Moritz | last = Heichelheim | title = A History of the Roman People | place = Upper Saddle River, NJ | publisher = Prentice-Hall | year = 1962 | page = 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had also written other works, including an essay in the form of a letter to his son, and numerous dialogues, most likely using [[Cicero]] as a model.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = xi}}

Titus Livius is said to have died in the year AD 17 (three years after the death of the emperor Augustus) in his home city of Patavium.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = ix}}

==Works==
{{main|Ab Urbe Condita (book)}}
[[File:Augustus 2.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Bust of Caesar Augustus from the [[Musei Capitolini]], [[Rome]]]]
Livy's only surviving work is the &quot;History of Rome&quot; (''Ab Urbe Condita''), which was his career from an age in middle life, probably 32, until he left Rome for Padua in old age, probably after the death of Augustus in the reign of [[Tiberius]]. When he began this work he was already past his youth; presumably, events in his life prior to that time had led to his intense activity as a historian. [[Seneca the Younger]] gives brief mention that he was also known as an orator and philosopher and had written some treatises in those fields from a historical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seneca the Younger|title=Moral Letters to Lucilius|chapter=Letter 41.9|quote=...for Livy wrote both dialogues (which should be ranked as history no less than as philosophy), and works which professedly deal with philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===In Roman Empire===
Livy's ''History of Rome'' was in demand from the publication of the first packet. Livy became so famous that a man from [[Cadiz]] travelled to Rome just to see him, and once he had seen, returned home.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger]], ''Epistles'', II.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the work continued through the entire classical period. A number of Roman authors used Livy, including [[Aurelius Victor]], [[Cassiodorus]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], [[Florus]], [[Granius Licinianus]] and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Julius Obsequens]] used Livy, or a source with access to Livy, to compose his ''De Prodigiis'', an account of [[supernatural]] events in Rome, from the consulship of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus|Scipio]] and [[Gaius Laelius|Laelius]] to that of [[Paulus Fabius]] and [[Quintus Aelius]].

Livy wrote during the reign of Augustus, who came to power after a civil war with generals and consuls claiming to be defending the [[Roman Republic]], such as [[Pompey]]. Patavium had been pro-Pompey. To clarify his status, the victor of the civil war, Octavian Caesar, had wanted to take the title ''Romulus'' (the first king of Rome) but in the end accepted the senate proposal of ''Augustus''. He did not abolish the republic de facto but adapted its institutions into the empire.

Livy's enthusiasm for the republic is evident from the first pentade of his work, and yet the Julio-Claudian family (the imperial family) were as much fans of Livy as anyone. He could not have been an advocate of any sort of sedition in favor of restoring the Republic; he would have been put on trial for treason and executed, as many had been and would be. He must have been viewed as a harmless and relevant advocate of the ancient morality, which was a known public stance of the citizens of Patavium. His relationship to Augustus is defined primarily by a passage from [[Tacitus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Annales'' IV.34.&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Cremutius Cordus]] is put on trial for his life for offenses no worse than Livy's and defends himself face-to-face with the frowning Tiberius as follows:

{{quote |I am said to have praised Brutus and Cassius, whose careers many have described and no one mentioned without eulogy. Titus Livius, pre-eminently famous for eloquence and truthfulness, extolled Cneius Pompeius in such a panegyric that Augustus called him Pompeianus, and yet this was no obstacle to their friendship.}}

To avoid conviction, while waiting for a verdict Cordus committed suicide by self-starvation. His worst fears were realized in absentia: his books were sentenced to be burned by the [[aedile]]s, but they performed the task without zeal and many escaped. Livy's reasons for returning to Padua after the death of Augustus (if he did) are unclear, but the circumstances of Tiberius' reign certainly allow for speculation.

===Later===
During the Middle Ages interest in Livy declined.{{Sfn | Foster | 1874 | p = xxiv}}  Due to the length of the work the literate class were already reading summaries rather than the work itself, which was tedious to copy, expensive, and required a lot of storage space. It must have been during this period, if not before, that manuscripts began to be lost without replacement. 

The [[Renaissance]] was a time of intense revival; the population discovered that Livy was being lost and large amounts of money changed hands in the rush to collect Livy manuscripts. The poet Beccadelli sold a country home for the money to purchase one manuscript copied by Poggio.{{Sfn | Foster | 1874 | p = xxiv}}  [[Petrarch]] and [[Pope Nicholas V]] launched a search for the now missing books. Laurentius Valla published an emended text initiating the field of Livy scholarship. [[Dante]] speaks highly of him in his poetry, and [[Francis I of France]] commissioned extensive artwork treating Livian themes; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s work on [[republic]]s, the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' is presented as a commentary on the ''History of Rome''. Respect for Livy rose to lofty heights.

After a few hundred years of Livy being studied by the youth of every Western population, moderns have developed their own views of Livy and his place in the ancient world, which were not current in ancient times. For example, one text on western civilization pronounces: &quot;Livy was the prose counterpart of [[Virgil|Vergil]]&quot;, as both have been standard in the study of Golden Age Latin literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short history of Western civilization|first=John Baugham |last=Harrison|first2=Richard Eugene |last2= Sullivan|page= 198 | edition =3|year=1971|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0-394-31057-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Age Latin was not known as such in classical times and the ancient reader could choose from a vastly larger bibliography; but in fact, private reading was a privilege of the literate few, who had the wealth to buy manuscripts or have them copied and had the time for library research. Public readings of works, however, were common and were the main way in which an author became known.

==Dates==
The authority supplying information from which possible vital data on Livy can be deduced is [[Eusebius of Caesaria]], a [[bishop]] of the early [[Catholic Church]]. One of his works was a summary of world history in [[ancient Greek]], termed the [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronikon]], dating from the early 4th century. This work was lost except for fragments (mainly excerpts), but not before it had been translated in whole and in part by various authors such as St. Jerome. The entire work survives in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. St. Jerome wrote in Latin. Fragments in [[Syriac]] exist.{{Sfn | Fotheringham | 1905 | p = 1}}

Eusebius' work consists of two books, the ''Chronographia'', a summary of history in annalist form, and the ''Chronikoi  Kanones'', tables of years and events. St. Jerome translated the tables into Latin as the ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'', probably adding some information of his own from unknown sources. Livy's dates appear in Jerome's Chronicon.

The main problem with the information given in the [[Manuscript|MSS]] is that between them they often give different dates for the same events or different events, do not include the same material entirely and reformat what they do include. A date may be in ''Ab urbe condita'' or in [[Olympiad]]s or in some other form, such as age. These variations may have occurred through scribal error or scribal license. Some material has been inserted under the aegis of Eusebius.

The topic of manuscript variants is a large and specialized one, on which authors of works on Livy seldom care to linger. As a result standard information in a standard rendition is used, which gives the impression of a standard set of dates for Livy.  There are no such dates.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A typical presumption is of a birth in the 2nd year of the 180th Olympiad and a death in the first year of the 199th Olympiad, which are coded 180.2 and 199.1 respectively.&lt;ref name= jerome&gt;{{cite web| title= St. Jerome (Hieronymus): Chronological Tables — for Olympiads 170 to 203 [= 100 BC – 36 AD]|url=http://www.attalus.org/translate/jerome2.html|publisher=Attalus |accessdate= 14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; All sources use the same first Olympiad, 776/775–773/772 BC by the modern calendar.  By a complex formula (made so by the 0 reference point not falling on the border of an Olympiad) these codes correspond to 59 BC for the birth, 17 AD for the death. In another manuscript the birth is in 180.4, or 57 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1|title= Livy | volume = Book 1|first1 = Titus|last1 = Livius | editor1-first = John Robert | editor1-last =Seeley|location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1881|isbn=0-86292-296-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome says that Livy was born the same year as [[Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus]] and died the same year as [[Ovid]].&lt;ref name=jerome/&gt; Messala, however, was born earlier, in 64 BC, and Ovid's death, usually taken to be the same year as Livy's, is more uncertain. As an alternative view, [[Ronald Syme]] argues for 64 BC – 12 AD as a range for Livy, setting the death of Ovid at 12.{{Sfn | Livy | Kraus | 1994 | p = 1 | ps =, citing several articles by Syme.}}  A death date of 12, however, removes Livy from Augustus' best years and makes him depart for Padua without the good reason of the second emperor, Tiberius, being not as tolerant of his republicanism. The contradiction remains.
