{{Party politics}}
A '''political party''' (from {{lang-la|pars}}, [[Genitive]] ''partis'', &quot;part&quot;, &quot;portion&quot;) is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to influence government policy, usually by nominating candidates with aligned political views and trying to seat them in political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mc Donald|first=Neil|title=The Study of Political Parties|year=1963|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties participate in [[elections|electoral campaigns]] and educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.

==Structure==
An individual who either volunteers for, is employed by, or helps to establish and operate a political party is known as a '''[[party organizer]]''', also known as the '''party activist''' or '''party worker'''. 

A political party is typically led by a '''[[party leader]]''' (the most powerful member and spokesperson representing the party), a '''[[party secretary]]''' (who maintains the daily work and records of party meetings), '''[[party treasurer]]''' (who is responsible for membership dues) and '''[[party chair]]''' (who forms strategies for recruiting and retaining party members, and also chairs party meetings). Most of the above positions are also members of the '''party executive''', the leading organization which sets policy for the entire party at the national level. 

On a regular, periodic basis, [[party conference]]s are held to elect party officers, although snap leadership elections can be called if enough members opt for such. Party conferences are also held in order to affirm party values for members in the coming year.

Depending on the demographic spread of the party membership, party members form local or regional party committees in order to help candidates run for local or regional offices in government. These local party branches reflect the officer positions at the national level.

It is also customary for political party members to form '''wings''' for current or prospective party members, most of which fall into the following two categories:
* '''identity-based''': including [[youth wing]]s, [[women's wing]]s, ethnic minority wings, LGBT wings, etc.
* '''position-based''': including wings for candidates, mayors, governors, professionals, [[student]]s, etc.

These are useful for party outreach, training and employment.

===Parliamentary party structure===
When the party is represented by members in the lower house of parliament, the party leader simultaneously serves as the leader of the [[parliamentary group]] of that full party representation; depending on a minimum number of seats held, [[Westminster system|Westminster-based]] parties typically allow for leaders to form [[frontbench]] teams of senior fellow members of the parliamentary group to serve as critics of aspects of government policy. When a party becomes the largest party not to be represented in a Westminster-style parliament, the party's parliamentary group forms the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Official Opposition]], with Official Opposition frontbench team members often forming the Official Opposition [[Shadow cabinet]]. When a party achieves enough seats in an election to form a majority, the party's frontbench becomes the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] of government ministers.

Parliamentary party members and leaders who are part of neither the Government or Official Opposition frontbenches are known as [[backbencher]]s, and are relegated to sitting behind or perpendicular to designated frontbenchers.

==Regulation==
The freedom to form, declare membership in, or campaign for candidates from a political party is considered a measurement of a state's adherence to liberal democracy as a political value. Regulation of parties may run from a crackdown on or repression of all opposition parties, a norm for authoritarian governments, to the repression of certain parties which hold or promote ideals which run counter to the general ideology of the state's incumbents (or possess membership by-laws which are legally unenforceable).

Furthermore, in the case of far-right, far-left and regionalist parties in the national parliaments of much of the European Union, mainstream political parties may form an informal [[cordon sanitaire]] which applies a policy of non-cooperation towards those &quot;Outsider Parties&quot; present in the legislature which are viewed as 'anti-system' or otherwise unacceptable for government. ''Cordon Sanitaires'', however, have been increasingly abandoned over the past two decades in multi-party democracies as the pressure to construct broad coalitions in order to win elections - along with the increased willingness of outsider parties themselves to participate in government - has led to many such parties entering electoral and government coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell and Newell (2011) 'Outsider Parties'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the second half of the 20th century modern democracies have introduced rules for the flow of funds through party coffers, e.g. the Canada Election Act 1976, the PPRA in the U.K. or the FECA in the U.S.. Such [[political finance]] regimes stipulate a variety of regulations for the transparency of fundraising and expenditure, limit or ban specific kinds of activity and provide public subsidies for party activity, including campaigning.

==Voting systems==
The type of [[electoral system]] is a major factor in determining the type of party political system. In countries with a simple [[plurality voting system]], parties elected tend to be few (often only two in any given jurisdiction). In countries that have a [[proportional representation]] voting system, as exists throughout Europe, or to a greater extent [[ranked voting systems]], such as in [[Australia]] or [[Ireland]], three or more parties are often elected to [[parliament]] in significant proportions, and thus may have more access to [[public office]].

==Partisan style==
Partisan style varies according to each jurisdiction, depending on how many parties there are, and how much influence each individual party has.

=== Nonpartisan ===
In a [[nonpartisan system]], no official political parties exist, sometimes reflecting legal [[restrictions on political parties]]. In nonpartisan elections, each candidate is eligible for office on his or her own merits. In nonpartisan legislatures, there are no typically formal party alignments within the legislature. The administration of [[George Washington]] and the first few sessions of the [[United States Congress]] were nonpartisan. Washington also warned against political parties during his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].&lt;ref&gt;Redding 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[unicameral]] [[Nebraska Legislature|legislature]] of [[Nebraska]] is nonpartisan. In [[Canada]], the territorial legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] are nonpartisan. In [[New Zealand]], [[Tokelau]] has a nonpartisan parliament.  Many city and county governments{{Vague|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- US or worldwide?! --&gt; are nonpartisan. Nonpartisan elections and modes of governance are common outside of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Abizadeh 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless there are legal prohibitions against political parties, factions within nonpartisan systems often evolve into political parties.

=== Single dominant party ===
In [[single-party system]]s, one political party is legally allowed to hold effective power. Although minor parties may sometimes be allowed, they are legally required to accept the leadership of the dominant party. This party may not always be identical to the government, although sometimes positions within the party may in fact be more important than positions within the government. [[North Korea]] and [[China]] is an example; others can be found in [[Fascism|Fascist]] states, such as [[Nazi Germany]] between 1934 and 1945. The [[single-party system]] is thus usually equated with [[dictatorship]]s and tyranny.

In [[dominant-party system]]s, opposition parties are allowed, and there may be even a deeply established democratic tradition, but other parties are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. Sometimes, political, social and economic circumstances, and public opinion are the reason for others parties' failure. Sometimes, typically in countries with less of an established democratic tradition, it is possible the dominant party will remain in power by using [[patronage]] and sometimes by [[voting fraud]]. In the latter case, the definition between Dominant and single-party system becomes rather blurred. Examples of dominant party systems include the [[People's Action Party]] in [[Singapore]], the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]], the [[Human Rights Protection Party]] in [[Samoa]], the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[India]] from 1947-1996, and the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] in [[Montenegro]]. One party dominant systems also existed in [[Mexico]] with the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] until the 1990s, in the southern [[United States]] with the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] from the late 19th century until the 1970s, in [[Indonesia]] with the [[Golkar|''Golongan Karya'']] (Party of the Functional Groups) from the early 1970s until 1998, and in [[Japan]] with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] until [[Japanese general election, 2009|2009]].

===Two political parties===
[[Two-party system]]s are states such as [[Jamaica]], and [[Ghana]] in which there are two political parties dominant to such an extent that electoral success under the banner of any other party is almost impossible. One [[right wing]] coalition party and one [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] coalition party is the most common ideological breakdown in such a system but in two-party states political parties are traditionally [[Big tent|catch all parties]] which are ideologically broad and inclusive.

The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since the birth of the republic, a conservative (such as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]) and liberal (such as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. Third parties often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|election of 1912]], [[George Wallace]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|election of 1968]] and [[Ross Perot]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1992|election of 1992]]).

The UK political system, while technically a [[multi-party system]], has functioned generally as a two-party (sometimes called a &quot;two-and-a-half party) system; since the 1920s the two largest political parties have been the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Before the Labour Party rose in British politics the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was the other major political party along with the Conservatives. Though [[Coalition government|coalition]] and [[minority government]]s have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics, the [[plurality electoral system|first-past-the-post]] electoral system used for [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general elections]] tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/past_elections/html/default.stm |title=General Election results through time, 1945–2001 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2006-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A plurality voting system usually leads to a two-party system, a relationship described by [[Maurice Duverger]] and known as [[Duverger's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Duverger 1954&lt;/ref&gt;) However, the 2010 General Election resulted in a coalition government led by the Conservative Party and including the Liberal Democrats. There are also numerous other parties that hold or have held a number of seats in Parliament.

===Multiple political parties===
[[File:ElezioneBrunate.jpg|thumb|right|A poster for the [[European Parliament]] election 2004 in [[Italy]], showing party lists]]
[[Multi-party]] systems are systems in which more than two parties are represented and elected to public office.

[[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[People's Republic of Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Norway]] are examples of countries with two strong parties and additional smaller parties that have also obtained representation. The smaller or &quot;third&quot; parties may hold the [[balance of power]] in a parliamentary system, and thus may be invited to form a part of a [[coalition government]] together with one of the larger parties; or may instead act independently from the dominant parties.

More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in [[Germany]] on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the [[Communes of Germany|communal]] level. Furthermore since the forming of the [[Republic of Iceland]] there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] and one other (often the [[Social Democratic Alliance]]). Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.{{Dubious|date=June 2010}}

== Party funding ==
Political parties are funded by contributions from
 
* party members and other individuals,
 
* organizations which share their political ideas or who stand to benefit from their activities or
 
* governmental public funding.&lt;ref&gt;See Heard, Alexander, 'Political financing'. In: Sills, David I. (ed.) ''International Emcyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', vol. 12. New York, NY: Free Press - Macmillan, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;235–241; Paltiel, Khayyam Z., 'Campaign finance - contrasting practices and reforms'. In: Butler, David et al. (eds.), Democracy at the polls - a comparative study of competitive national elections. Washington, DC: AEI, 1981, pp. 138-172; Paltiel, Khayyam Z., 'Political finance'. In: Bogdanor, Vernon (ed.), ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Institutions''. Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;454–456; 'Party finance', in: Kurian, George T. et al. (eds.) The encyclopedia of political science. vol 4, Washington, DC: CQ Press, 2011, pp. 1187-1189.
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Political parties, still called [[Political faction|factions]] by some, especially those in government, are [[lobbying|lobbied]] vigorously by organizations, businesses and [[special interest groups]] such as [[trades unions]]. Money and gifts-in-kind to a party, or its leading members, may be offered as incentives. Such donations are the traditional source of funding for all right-of-centre cadre parties. Starting in the late 19th century these parties were opposed by the new founded left-of-centre workers' parties. They started a new party type, the mass membership party, and a new source of political fundraising, '''membership dues'''.

From the second half of the 20th century on parties which continued to rely on donations ran into mounting problems. Along with the increased scrutiny of '''donations''' there has been a long term contraction in party memberships in most western democracies which itself places more strains on funding. For example in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] membership of the two main parties in 2006 is less than an 1/8 of what it was in 1950, despite significant increases in population over that period. 

In some parties, such as the post-communist parties of France and Italy or the [[Sinn Féin]] party and the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)]], elected representatives of take only the average industrial wage from their salary as a representative  or their entire earnings, while the rest goes into party coffers. Although these examples may be rare nowadays, &quot;rent-seeking&quot; continues to be a feature of many political parties around the world.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Foresti and Wild 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5143&amp;title=political-parties-governance-politics Support to political parties: a missing piece of the governance puzzle]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[United Kingdom]], it has been alleged that [[peerages]] have been awarded to contributors to party funds, the benefactors becoming members of the [[House of Lords|Upper House of Parliament]] and thus being in a position to participate in the legislative process. Famously, [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] was found to have been selling peerages. To prevent such corruption in the future, Parliament passed the [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]] into law. Thus the outright '''sale of''' peerages and similar '''honours''' became a [[criminal act]]. However, some benefactors are alleged to have attempted to circumvent this by cloaking their contributions as loans, giving rise to the '[[Cash for Peerages]]' scandal. 

Such activities as well as assumed &quot;[[influence peddling]]&quot; have given rise to demands that the scale of donations should be capped. As the costs of electioneering escalate, so the demands made on party funds increase. In the UK some politicians are advocating that parties should be funded by the [[State (polity)|state]]; a proposition that promises to give rise to interesting debate in a country that was the first to regulate campaign expenses (in 1883).. 

In many other democracies such subsidies for party activity (in general or just for campaign purposes) have been introduced decades ago. '''Public financing''' for parties and candidates (during election timess and beyond) has several permutations and is increasingly common. Germany, Sweden, Israel, Canada, Austria and Spain are cases in point, although Canada has removed its public funding for political parties as of 2010. More recently among others [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Poland]] have followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;For details you may want to consult specific articles on [[Campaign finance in the United States]], [[Federal political financing in Canada]], [[Party finance in Germany]], [[Political donations in Australia]], [[Political finance]], [[Political funding in Japan]], [[Political funding in the United Kingdom]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two broad categories of funding, direct, which entails a montetary transfer to a party, and indirect, which includes broadcast time on [[state media]], use of the mail service or supplies.  According to the Comparative Data from the [[ACE Electoral Knowledge Network]], out of a sample of over 180 nations, 25% of nations provide no direct or indirect public funding, 58% provide direct public funding and 60% of nations provide indirect public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/epic-en/CDMap?question=PC12 ACEproject.org] ACE Electoral Knowledge Network: Comparative Data: Political Parties and Candidates&lt;/ref&gt;  Some countries provide both direct and indirect public funding to political parties.  Funding may be equal for all parties or depend on the results of previous campaigns or the number of candidates participating in an election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/epic-en/CDMap?question=PC15 ACEproject.org] ACE Electoral Knowledge Network: Comparative Data: Political Parties and Candidates&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequently parties rely on a mix of private and public funding and are required to disclose their finances to the [[Election management body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/focus/core/crb/crb05/?searchterm=party%20funding ACEproject.org] ACE Encyclopaedia: Public funding of political parties&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding can also be provided by '''[[foreign aid]]'''. International donors provide financing to political parties in developing countries as a means to promote democracy and [[good governance]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Support can be purely financial or otherwise frequently is provided as capacity development activities including the development of party manifestos, party constitutions and campaigning skills.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Developing links between ideologically linked parties is another common feature of international support for a party.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Sometimes this can be perceived as directly supporting the political aims of political party, such as the support of the US government to the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] party behind the [[Rose Revolution]]. Other donors work on a more neutral basis, where multiple donors provide grants in countries accessible by all parties for various aims defined by the recipients.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; There have been calls by leading development think-tanks, such as the Overseas Development Institute, to increase support to political parties as part of developing the capacity to deal with the demands of donors to improve governance.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

== Colours and emblems for parties ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Color]] --&gt;

: ''Main article: see [[Political colour]] and [[List of political party symbols]]''

Generally speaking, over the world, political parties associate themselves with colors, primarily for identification, especially for voter recognition during [[elections]]. [[Conservatism|Conservative]] parties generally use [[blue]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc color&quot;&gt;{{citation | publisher=BBC | title=Why is the Conservative Party Blue | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4923050.stm | date=2006-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[black]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
[[Pink]] sometimes signifies moderate [[socialist]]. [[Yellow]] is often used for [[libertarianism]] or [[classical liberalism]], due to yellow being the color of [[gold]], which signifies the [[gold standard]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.  [[Red]] often signifies [[communist]] or [[socialist]] parties{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

[[Green]] is the color for [[green parties]], [[Islamist]] parties and [[Irish republican]] parties. [[Orange (colour)|Orange]] is sometimes a color of nationalism, such as in the [[Netherlands]], in [[Israel]] with the [[Orange Camp]] or with [[Ulster Loyalism|Ulster Loyalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]]; it is also a color of reform such as in [[Ukraine]]. In the past, [[Purple]] was considered the color of [[royal family|royalty]] (like white), but today it is sometimes used for feminist parties. White also is associated with nationalism. &quot;Purple Party&quot; is also used as an academic hypothetical of an undefined party, as a centralist party in the United States (because purple is created from mixing the main parties' colours of red and blue) and as a highly idealistic &quot;peace and love&quot; party [http://www.purpleparty.com]-- in a similar vein to a Green Party, perhaps. [[Black]] is generally associated with [[fascism|fascist]] parties, going back to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s blackshirts, but also with [[Anarchism]]. Similarly, [[brown]] is sometimes associated with [[Nazism]], going back to the [[Nazi Party]]'s [[brownshirt|tan-uniformed]] [[storm trooper]]s.

Color associations are useful for mnemonics when [[vote]]r [[literacy|illiteracy]] is significant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Another case where they are used is when it is not desirable to make rigorous links to parties, particularly when [[coalition]]s and [[wiktionary:alliance|alliance]]s are formed between political parties and other organizations, for example: [[Red Tory]], &quot;[[Purple (government)|Purple]]&quot; (Red-Blue) alliances, [[Red-green alliance]]s, [[Blue-green alliance]]s, [[Traffic light coalition]]s, [[Pan-green coalition]]s, and [[Pan-blue coalition]]s.

Political color schemes in the [[United States]] diverge from international norms. Since 2000, red has become associated with the right-wing [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and blue with the left-wing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. However, unlike political color schemes of other countries, the parties did not choose those colors; they were used in news coverage of 2000 election results and ensuing legal battle and caught on in popular usage. Prior to the 2000 election the media typically alternated which color represented which party each presidential election cycle. The color scheme happened to get inordinate attention that year, so the cycle was stopped lest it cause confusion the following election.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher =Washington Post | title= Elephants Are Red, Donkeys Are Blue | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html |first=Paul |last=Farhi |date=2004-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[emblem]] of socialist parties is often a red [[rose]] held in a fist. Communist parties often use a [[hammer]] to represent the worker, a [[sickle]] to represent the farmer, or [[Hammer and sickle|both a hammer and a sickle]] to refer to both at the same time.

The emblem of [[Nazism]], the [[swastika]] or ''&quot;[[hakenkreuz]]&quot;,'' has been adopted as a near-universal symbol for almost any organized white supremacist group, even though it dates from more ancient times.

[[Symbols]] can be very important when the overall [[Constituency|electorate]] is illiterate. In the [[Kenyan constitutional referendum, 2005]], supporters of the constitution used the [[banana]] as their symbol, while the &quot;no&quot; used an [[orange (fruit)|orange]].

== International organizations of political parties ==
During the 19th and 20th century, many national political parties organized themselves into international organizations along similar policy lines. Notable examples are the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also called the First International), the [[Socialist International]] (also called the Second International), the [[Communist International]] (also called the Third International), and the [[Fourth International]], as organizations of [[working class party|working class parties]], or the [[Liberal International]] (yellow), [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]],  [[Christian Democratic International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]] (blue). Organized in Italy in 1945, the [[International Communist Party]], since 1974 headquartered in Florence and with sections in six countries, is an expanding global party. [[Worldwide green parties]] have recently established the [[Global Greens]]. The Socialist International, the Liberal International, and the [[International Democrat Union]] are all based in [[London]]. 
Some administrations (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]) outlaw formal linkages between local and foreign political organizations, effectively outlawing international political parties.

==Types of political parties==

The French political scientist [[Maurice Duverger]] drew a distinction between cadre parties and mass parties.  Cadre parties were political elites that were concerned with contesting elections and restricted the influence of outsiders, who were only required to assist in election campaigns.  Mass parties tried to recruit new members who were a source of party income and were often expected to spread party ideology as well as assist in elections.  Socialist parties are examples of mass parties, while the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|German Christian Democratic Union]] are examples of hybrid parties.  In the United States, where both major parties were cadre parties, the introduction of primaries and other reforms has transformed them so that power is held by activists who compete over influence and nomination of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, ''Political parties'', pp. 65-67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Klaus von Beyme]] categorized European parties into nine families, which described most parties.  He was able to arrange seven of them from left to right:  [[communist]], [[socialist]], [[Green party|green]], [[liberalism|liberal]], [[Christian democratic]], [[conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]].  The position of two other types, agrarian and regional/ethnic parties varied.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, ''Political parties'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
