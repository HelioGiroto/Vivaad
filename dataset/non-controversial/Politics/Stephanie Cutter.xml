'''Stephanie Cutter''' (born October 22, 1968) is a political consultant who currently serves as Deputy Campaign Manager for President [[Barack Obama]]'s 2012 reelection campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url = http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/26/first-on-cnn-cutter-to-leave-white-house-for-obama-campaign/|title = Cutter to leave White House for Obama campaign|work = politicaltracker|publisher = CNN|accessdate = February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has previously worked in campaign and communications roles for other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] including Ted Kennedy, John Kerry and Michelle Obama. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described her as  &quot;a popular but polarizing face of (Obama's) campaign&quot;, and a &quot;soldier who says the things the candidate can’t (or won’t) say.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chozick, Amy (2012-10-12) [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/us/politics/stephanie-cutter-is-a-messenger-who-does-the-shooting-for-obama.html &quot;A Messenger Who Does the Shooting&quot;], ''The New York Times'', Retrieved October 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Cutter was born in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] and raised in nearby [[Raynham, Massachusetts]]. She graduated from [[Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alspach|first=Kyle|title=Raynham native named chief spokesperson for Obama transition|url=http://www.enterprisenews.com/homepage/x835134858/Raynham-native-named-chief-spokesperson-for-Obama-transition|publisher=''[[The Enterprise (Brockton)|The Enterprise]]''|accessdate=2012-08-28|date=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is a school teacher and she has a brother who served in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chozick&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/us/politics/stephanie-cutter-is-a-messenger-who-does-the-shooting-for-obama.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0|title=A Messenger Who Does the Shooting|last=Chozick|first=Amy|date=14 October 2012|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Smith College]] and [[Georgetown Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Zeleny | title=The New Team - Stephanie Cutter | date=2008-11-21 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/us/politics/21web-cutter.html |work=New York Times  | accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, she worked as a junior aide to [[Mario Cuomo]] and also worked for the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref name=politicoromano/&gt;

She worked for former President [[Bill Clinton]] as Deputy Communications Director at the White House during his administration &quot;to help restore Mr. Clinton’s image in the aftermath of (his) impeachment and Monica Lewinsky&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chozick, Amy (2012-10-12) [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/us/politics/stephanie-cutter-is-a-messenger-who-does-the-shooting-for-obama.html &quot;A Messenger Who Does the Shooting&quot;], ''The New York Times'', Retrieved October 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;, and as Associate Administrator for Communications at the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]].

Beginning in 2001, she served as Communications Director for Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].

In July 2003 was named Communications Director for the Democratic National Committee. In November 2003, she was named communications director for the [[John Kerry]] campaign, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6421297/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;at Kennedy's recommendation&lt;ref name=politicoromano/&gt;. During that campaign, she was criticized for having a surly and difficult personality and was often scapegoated for Kerry's loss.&lt;ref name=politicoromano&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephanie Cutter, President Obama’s 1-woman rapid response team |author=Lois Romano |date= July 8, 2012 |work=Politico |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78180.html#ixzz24scIlPL5 |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, campaign workers noted it was a chaotic campaign with plenty of blame to go around. Cutter has been wrongly blamed for the Kerry campaign's failure to respond to the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth|Swift Boat]] controversy, when, in fact, she argued for a rapid and aggressive response. Kerry considered the criticism of her unfair and praised her work.&lt;ref name=politicoromano/&gt; After the Kerry campaign, Cutter returned to work for Kennedy.

In June 2008 Cutter was appointed Chief of Staff to [[Michelle Obama]] for the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Presidential general election campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Shailagh Murray, [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/06/16/new_staffer_for_michelle_obama.html New Staffer for Michelle Obama], ''The New York Times'', June 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Cutter and Michelle Obama immediately clicked and Cutter is widely credited with building Obama's popularity with the public, particularly her [[Let's Move!]] health initiative. She is credited with enlisting Republican [[Mike Huckabee]] to the program, to help prevent criticism from conservatives.&lt;ref name=politicoromano/&gt;

She served as the Chief Spokesperson for the [[Obama-Biden Transition Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicshome.com/usa/Landing.aspx?Blog=4332&amp;perma=link#4332 |title=All today's politics in one place &amp;#124; Front Page |publisher=PoliticsHome |date= |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served in the Treasury Department as [[Timothy Geithner]]'s counselor  where &quot;she protected Geithner’s fragile reputation and tried to spin unpopular policies like the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] and the A.I.G. bailout.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chozick, Amy (2012-10-12) [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/us/politics/stephanie-cutter-is-a-messenger-who-does-the-shooting-for-obama.html &quot;A Messenger Who Does the Shooting&quot;], ''The New York Times'', Retrieved October 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Cutter was appointed to serve as adviser to President Obama in the Supreme Court nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/white-house/cutter-to-white-house-for-cour.html |work=The Washington Post  |title=Cutter to White House for Court Fight |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate= 2009-05-17 |first=Chris |last=Cillizza}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine named Cutter one of the 50 most powerful people in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gq.com/news-politics/politics/200911/50-most-powerful-in-dc-49|work=[[GQ]] |title=49. Stephanie Cutter |date=2009-10 |accessdate= 2009-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Cutter was named Assistant to the President for Special Projects, charged with managing communications and outreach strategy for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Frumin |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/04/white-house-taps-stephanie-cutter-to-sell-health-care-reform.php |title=White House Taps Stephanie Cutter To Sell Health Care Reform |publisher=TPMDC|date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Cutter was named Deputy Senior Advisor to President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/48318.html|title=Full text of Bill Daley's announcement|first=Bill|last=Daley|date=2011-01-27|accessdate=2011-01-27|authorlink=Bill Daley|newspaper=Politico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the White House announced Cutter would leave her position as Deputy Senior Advisor to serve as deputy campaign manager for Obama for America. She has appeared in numerous campaign videos and ads for Obama's campaign, as well as a guest in TV appearances.&lt;ref name=politicoromano/&gt; During the 2012 campaign, Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist, stated that Cutter is &quot;arguably the strongest player on either side out there now.&quot;&lt;ref name=politicoromano/&gt;
