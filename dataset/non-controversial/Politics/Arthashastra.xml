The same individual is meant in each case. The ''[[Panchatantra|Pańcatantra]]'' explicitly identifies [[Chanakya]] with {{IAST|Viṣṇugupta}}.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; who was a scholar at [[Takshashila]] and the teacher and guardian of Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of [[Mauryan Empire]].

==Date and authorship==
The author of the ''Arthashastra'' refers to himself as 'Kautilya', while the last verse mentions the name 'Vishnupgupta'. Many scholars believe that the former was the [[gotra]] of the author, while the latter was his personal name. Most scholars, though not all, also believe that these names refer to the 4th century BC scholar {{IAST|Chāṇakya}}. Thus, the original identification of Kautilya or Vishnugupta with the [[Mauryan]] minister Chanakya would date the ''Arthaśāstra'' to the 4th century [[BCE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett 1964&quot;&gt;Mabbett 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that Arthasastra was written at a later stage. Their arguments include the assertion that the state described in Arthasastra is smaller than the Maurya empire, and there is no reference to either the empire or its capital Pataliputra. In addition, some of the geographical place names, the reference to the [[Hunas]] and the use of the Greek loan words suggest a later date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Namita2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Namita Sanjay Sugandhi | title=Between the Patterns of History: Rethinking Mauryan Imperial Interaction in the Southern Deccan | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8bdULPF4gNYC&amp;pg=PA88 | accessdate=6 June 2012 | year=2008 | publisher=ProQuest | isbn=978-0-549-74441-2 | pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas R. Trautmann]] and I.W. Mabbett have hypothesized that the 'Arthaśāstra' is a composition from no earlier than the 2nd century AD, but is clearly based on earlier material. Their explanation is that while the doctrines of the 'Arthaśāstra' may have been written by Chanakya in the 4th century BC, the treatise we know today may have been edited or condensed by another author in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann 1971:185 &quot;If the ''Kautilīya Arthaśāstra'' in its present form is not so old as it pretends, the ''śāstra'' itself is certainly old, predating the ''dharma smritis''.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Mabbett 1964 &quot;The content of the text is consistent with authorship in about the third century, C.E., and raises some questions which must be answered if it is to be assigned to the fourth B.C.E. Against this must be set the verses naming and characterising Kautilya, and the references in later literature. What emerges is that there is no necessary incompatibility between the essential claims that Chanakya was responsible for the doctrines of the Arthaśāstra, and that the text we know is a product of the later time. These do not conflict. The work could have been written late on the basis of earlier teachings and writings. Sanskrit literature being so full of derivative, traditional and stratified material, this possibility is ''a priori'' strong. Those who favour the early date usually admit the probability of interpolations....Those who favour a later date usually admit the probability that the work draws on traditional material. The controversy is therefore spurious. It is entirely possible that the {{IAST|Mauryan Kautilya}} wrote an arthaśāstra and that a later editor rewrote his work, or compressed it, or compiled a text from the teachings of his school.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This would explain, some affinities with [[smrti]]s and references in the Arthaśāstra which would be anachronistic for the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann 1971:&quot;The Ages of the ''Arthaśāstra''&quot;, 167–187.&lt;br&gt;Mabbett 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann believes that ''Arthashastra'' is actually a compilation of a number of earlier texts written by various authors, and Chanakya might have been 'one'' of these authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Namita2008&quot;/&gt;

K.C. Ojha has put forward the view attributing the doctrines of 'Arthaśāstra' to Kautilya or Chanakya and suggests that Vishnugupta is in fact a redactor of the original work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett 1964&quot;/&gt; Thomas Burrow goes even further and says that Chanakya and Kautilya are actually two different people.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann 1971:67 'T. Burrow (&quot;Chānakya and Kautalya&quot;, ''Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 48–49'' 1968, p. 17 ff.) has now shown that Chanakya is also a ''[[gotra]]'' name, which in conjunction with other evidence makes it clear that we are dealing with two distinct persons, the minister {{IAST|Cānakya}} of legend and Kautilya the compiler of the ''Arthaśāstra''. Furthermore, this throws the balance of evidence in favor of the view that the second name was originally spelt ''Kautalya'' and that after the compiler of the ''Arth''. came to be identified with the Mauryan minister it was altered to Kautilya (as it appears in Āryaśūra, Viśākhadatta and Bāna) for the sake of the pun. We may then assume that the later spelling subsequently replaced the earlier in the ''[[gotra]]'' lists and elsewhere.'&lt;/ref&gt; However, some doubt about Burrow's assertion is due to the end of the treatise, which says: &quot;This Sástra has been made by him who from intolerance (of misrule) quickly rescued the scriptures and the science of weapons and the earth which had passed to the Nanda king.&quot; This supports the more commonly held belief that Kautilya and Chanakya are the same person, given Chanakya's role as mentor to Chandragupta Maurya.

More recently, Mital&lt;ref&gt;Mital, S. N. (2000), Kautilya Arthashastra Revisited (New Delhi: PHISPC).&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the methods used by Trautmann were inadequate to prove his claims, and therefore &quot;there exists no direct evidence against Kautilya being the sole author of The Arthashastra, nor evidence that it was not written during the 4th century BCE.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sihag, Balbir S. &quot;Kautilya on the Scope and Methodology of Accounting, Organizational Design and the Role of Ethics in Ancient India&quot;. ''The Accounting Historians Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mital goes on to rebut Trautmann's reliance on the affinity with the [[smrti]]s.

Noted Indian scholars such as Dr [[RC Majumdar]], Dr [[DR Bhandarkar]], Dr [[KP Jayaswal]] and Dr AS Altekar place the date of the Arthshastra between 7th century BC to 2nd century BC. Dr RK Mookerji, Prof FW Thomas and [[Vincent Arthur Smith]] all agree with the 4th century BC as the time of the book's composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i-y6ZUheQH8C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=chandragupta+maurya+kshatriya&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bd1dTuK3Lsi3rAfxiKmqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=arthsh&amp;f=false |title=Chandragupta Maurya And His Times - Radhakumud Mookerji - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; HC Raychoudhuri puts 249BC as the lower limit and 100AD as the upper limit of composition of the text of the Arthshastra in its present form and postulates that the original text dates from an earlier period. Sir RG Bhandarkar dated the composition of the current treatise to around 1st or 2nd century AD. This view is also held by some Western scholars but scholars such as DR RC Majumdar and Vincent Arthur Smith have rejected the date of Arthshastra as late as 2nd century AD and cite evidence that supports the composition of the Arthshastra in 4th century BC. DD Kosambi, noted historian and Indologist, maintains that the book is a 4th BC century creation by Chanakya or Kautilya who was Prime Minister of Chandragupta Maurya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=uFuDAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=dd+kosambi+arthashastra+4th+century+BC&amp;dq=dd+kosambi+arthashastra+4th+century+BC&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gdFhTom5F8eJrAed0vSGCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA |title=The Kauṭilīya Arthaśāstra: its author, date, and relevance for the Maurya period - Śrīrāma Goyala - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof Romilla Thapar believes that the book is a geniune text dating from Mauryan India (4th century BC) but given its final touch by an editor in 3rd century AD. She supports the view of Trautmann that portions were composed by Kautilya, but various sections were composed or edited later and the treatise was given its present day form in 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=J4-kubt-SsoC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=romila+thapar+arthashastra+3RD+century+AD&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ENNhTsCULcjyrQeIl9WrCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Recent Perspectives of Early Indian History - Book Review Trust, New Delhi - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann notes that some portions of the treatise were probably composed by Kautilya, who was the Prime Minister of Chandragupta, but that other parts were added later on. He dates the composition of Book-2 of the 'Arthaśāstra' to 150CE and the whole treatise in its present form by 250CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=arthashastra+1st+century+AD&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N9VhTu7AJsSHrAfZwvyZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the ... - Upinder Singh - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, most scholars put the composition of the 'Arthaśāstra' to between 4th century BC and 2nd century AD. The text was influential until the 12th century, when it disappeared. It was discovered in 1904 by [[R. Shamasastry]], who published it in 1909 and the first English translation was published in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boesche|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation of the title==
Different scholars have translated the word &quot;arthaśāstra&quot; in different ways.
*R.P. Kangle – &quot;science of politics,&quot; a treatise to help a king in &quot;the acquisition and protection of the earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Roger | last = Boesche | year = 2003 | month = January | title = Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–37 | doi = 10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 | ref = harv | issn = 0899-3718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[A.L. Basham]] – a &quot;treatise on polity&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boesche 2003&quot;&gt;Boesche 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[D.D. Kosambi]] – &quot;science of material gain&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boesche 2003&quot;/&gt;
*G.P. Singh – &quot;science of polity&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boesche 2003&quot;/&gt;
*Roger Boesche – &quot;science of [[political economy]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boesche 2003&quot;/&gt;

Roger Boesche describes the ''Arthaśāstra'' as &quot;a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the common good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boesche|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centrally, ''Arthaśāstra'' argues how in an [[autocracy]] an efficient and solid [[economy]] can be managed. It discusses the [[ethics]] of [[economics]] and the duties and obligations of a king.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, R.K. and Basu, R.L. 2006. ''Economics in Arthasastra''. New Delhi: Deep &amp; Deep Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of ''Arthaśāstra'' is, however, far wider than statecraft, and it offers an outline of the entire legal and [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] framework for administering a kingdom, with a wealth of descriptive cultural detail on topics such as mineralogy, mining and metals, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine and the use of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clem Tisdell|Tisdell, C.]] 2005. Elephants and polity in ancient India as exemplified by Kautilya's Arthasastra (Science of Polity). Working papers in ''Economics, Ecology and the Environment'', No. 120. School of Economics, University of Queensland: Brisbane, Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arthaśāstra'' also focuses on issues of [[welfare state|welfare]] (for instance, redistribution of wealth during a [[Famine in India|famine]]) and the collective [[ethics]] that hold a [[society]] together.

==Comparison to Machiavelli==
Because of its harsh political pragmatism, the ''Arthashastra'' has often been compared to [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]''.
{{quote|Is there any other book that talks so openly about when using violence is justified? When assassinating an enemy is useful? When killing domestic opponents is wise? How one uses secret agents? When one needs to sacrifice one's own secret agent? How the king can use women and children as spies and even assassins? When a nation should violate a treaty and invade its neighbor? Kautilya — and to my knowledge only Kautilya — addresses all those questions. In what cases must a king spy on his own people? How should a king test his ministers, even his own family members, to see if they are worthy of trust? When must a king kill a prince, his own son, who is heir to the throne? How does one protect a king from poison? What precautions must a king take against assassination by one's own wife? When is it appropriate to arrest a troublemaker on suspicion alone? When is torture justified? At some point, every reader wonders: Is there not one question that Kautilya found immoral, too terrible to ask in a book? No, not one. And this is what brings a frightful chill. But this is also why Kautilya was the first great, unrelenting political realist.|{{Harvtxt|Boesche|2002|p=1}}}}

[[Max Weber]] observed {{quote|Truly radical 'Machiavellianism', in the popular sense of that word, is classically expressed in Indian literature in the Arthasastra of Kautilya (written long before the birth of Christ, ostensibly in the time of Chandragupta): compared to it, Machiavelli’s ''The Prince'' is harmless.|Max Weber, ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' (1919)&lt;ref&gt;This translation is from ''Weber: Selections in Translation'', ed. W. G. Runciman, trans. Eric Matthews (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), pp. 212–25 (p. 220); see also [http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/weber/lecture/politics_vocation.html this translation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, these aspects form just one of the 15 books that comprise the 'Arthaśāstra'. The scope of the work is far broader than popular perceptions indicate, and in the treatise can also be found compassion for the poor, for servants and slaves, and for women. For instance, Kautilya advocates what is now known as [[land reform]], and elsewhere ensures the protection of the chastity of female servants or prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Reading About the World vol. 1 | editors=Paul Brians et al | isbn=0-15-567425-0 | url=http://wsu.edu/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_1/arthashastra.html | publisher=[[Washington State University]] | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant portions of the book also cover the role of [[dharma]], welfare of a kingdom's subjects and alleviating hardship in times of disaster, such as famine.

==The Rajarshi==
''Arthashastra'' deals in detail with the qualities and disciplines required for a [[Rajarshi]] – a wise and virtuous king.

:&quot;''In the happiness of his subjects lies the king's happiness, in their welfare his welfare. He shall not consider as good only that which pleases him but treat as beneficial to him whatever pleases his subjects''&quot; – Kautilya.

According to Kautilya, a Rajarshi is one who: 
*Has self-control, having conquered the inimical temptations of the senses;
*Cultivates the intellect by association with elders;
*Keeps his eyes open through spies;
*Is ever active in promoting the security and welfare of the people;
*Ensures the observance (by the people) of their dharma by authority &amp; example;
*Improves his own discipline by (continuing his) learning in all branches of knowledge; and
*Endears himself to his people by enriching them and doing good to them.

Such a disciplined king should: – 
*Keep away from another's wife;
*Not covet another's property;
*Practice [[ahinsa]] (non-violence towards all living things);
*Avoid day dreaming, capriciousness, falsehood and extravagance; and
*Avoid association with harmful persons and indulging in (harmful) activities.

[[Kautilya]] says that artha (Sound Economies) is the most important; [[dharma]] and [[kama]] are both dependent on it. A Rajarshi shall always respect those councillors and purohitas who warn him of the dangers of transgressing the limits of good conduct, reminding him sharply (as with a goad) of the times prescribed for various duties and caution him even when he errs in private.

===Duties of the king===
If the king is energetic, his subjects will be equally energetic. If he is lax (and lazy in performing his duties), the subjects will also be lax and thereby eat into his wealth. Besides, a lazy king will easily fall into the hands of enemies. Hence the Rajarshi should himself always be energetic. He shall divide the day and the night, each into eight periods of one and half hours, and perform his duties as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| First 1½ hrs. after sunrise || Receive reports on defence, revenue, expenditure
|- 
| Second 1½ hrs. after sunrise || Public audiences, to hear petitions of city and country people
|- 
| Third 1½ hrs. after sunrise and Last 1½ hrs. before noon|| Receive revenues and tributes; appoint ministers and other high officials &amp; allot tasks to them
|-
| First 1½ hrs. after noon|| Write letters &amp; dispatches, confer with councillors, receive secret information from spies
|- 
| Second 1½ hrs. after noon|| Personal: recreation, time for contemplation
|- 
| Third 1½ hrs. after noon and Last 1½ hrs. before sunset||Inspect and review forces; Consult with Chief of Defence
|}
The day shall end with evening prayers.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| First 1½ hrs. after sunset||Interview with secret agents
|- 
| Second 1½ hrs. after sunset|| Personal: bath, meals, study
|- 
| Third &amp; Fourth 1½ hrs. after sunset and First 1½ hrs. after midnight ||Retire to the bed chamber to the sound of music, sleep
|- 
| Second 1½ hrs. after midnight|| After waking to the sound of music, meditate on political matters and on work to be done
|- 
| Third 1½ hrs. after midnight||Consult with councilors, send out spies
|- 
| Last 1½ hrs. before sunrise|| Religious, household &amp; personal duties, meetings with his teacher, adviser on rituals, purohitas, personal physician, chief cooks and astrologer
|}

Or some other time table which suits the king.

Hence the king shall be ever active in the management of the economy. The root of wealth is (economic) activity and lack of it (brings) material distress. In the absence of (fruitful economic) activity, both current prosperity and future growth will be destroyed. A king can achieve the desired objectives and abundance of riches by undertaking (productive) economic activity. 

An ideal king is one who has the highest qualities of leadership, intellect, energy &amp; personal attributes. 

The qualities of [[leadership]] (which attracts followers) are: birth in a noble family, good fortune, intellect and prowess, association with elders, being righteous, truthful, resolute, enthusiastic and disciplined, not breaking his promises, showing gratitude (to those who help him), having lofty aims, not being dilatory, being stronger than neighbouring kings and having ministers of high quality. 

The qualities of [[intellect]] are: desire to learn, listening (to others), grasping, retaining, understanding thoroughly and reflecting on knowledge, rejecting false views and adhering to the true ones. 
An energetic king is one who is valorous, determined, quick, and dexterous. 
As regards personal attributes, an ideal king should be eloquent, bold and endowed with sharp intellect, a strong memory and a keen mind. He should be amenable to guidance. He should be well trained in all the arts and be able to lead the army. He should be just in rewarding and punishing. He should have the foresight to avail himself of the opportunities (by choosing) the right time, place and type of action. He should know how to govern in normal times and in times of crisis. He should know when to fight and when to make peace, when to lie in wait, when to observe treaties and when to strike at an enemy's weakness. He should preserve his dignity at all times and not laugh in an undignified manner. He should be sweet in speech, look straight at people and avoid frowning. He should eschew passion, anger, greed, obstinacy, fickleness and backbiting. He should conduct himself in accordance with advice of elders.

===Internal strife===
[[Kautilya]] says – Quarrels among people can be resolved by winning over the leaders or by removing the cause of the quarrel – people fighting among themselves help the king by their mutual rivalry. Conflicts (for power) within the royal family, on the other hand, bring about harassment and destruction to the people and double the exertion that is required to end such conflicts. 
Hence internal strife in the royal family for power is more damaging than quarrels among their subjects. The king must be well versed in [[discretion]] and shrewd in judgement.

===Comments on vices===
Vices are corruptions due to ignorance and indiscipline; an unlearned man does not perceive the injurious consequences of his vices. He summarizes: subject to the qualification that [[gambling]] is most dangerous in cases where power is shared, the vice with the most serious consequence is [[alcoholism|addiction to drink]], followed by, lusting after women, gambling, and lastly hunting.

===Training of a future king===
'''Importance of self-discipline'''
Discipline is of two kinds – inborn and acquired. (There must be an innate capacity for self discipline for the reasons given below). Instruction &amp; training can promote discipline only in a person capable of benefiting from them, people incapable of (natural) self-discipline do not benefit. Learning imparts discipline only to those who have the following mental facilities – obedience to a teacher, desire and ability to learn, capacity to retain what is learnt, understanding what is learnt, reflecting on it and (finally) ability to make inferences by deliberating on the knowledge acquired. Those who are devoid of such mental faculties are not benefited (by any amount of training) One who will be a king should acquire discipline and follow it strictly in life by learning the sciences from authoritative teachers.

===The training of a prince===
With improving his self-discipline, he should always associate with learned elders, for in them alone has discipline its firm roots. For a trained intellect ensues yoga (successful application), from yoga comes self-possession. This is what is meant by efficiency in acquiring knowledge. Only a king, who is wise, disciplined, devoted to a just governing of the subjects &amp; conscious of the welfare of all beings, will enjoy the earth unopposed.

===Seven ways to greet a neighbour===
Kautilya recommended seven strategies in dealing with neighboring powers to [[Chandragupta Maurya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AskAsia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askasia.org/teachers/essays/essay.php?no=8|title=Seven Ways to Greet a Neighbor|year=2009|publisher=AskAsia|accessdate=3 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090511164912/http://www.askasia.org/teachers/essays/essay.php?no=8| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategies are:
#'''Sanman''' – Appeasement, non-aggression pact
#'''Dana''' – Gift, bribery
#'''Danda''' – Strength, punishment
#'''Bheda''' – Divide, split, separating opposition
#'''Maya''' – Illusion, deceit
#'''Upeksha''' – Ignoring the enemy
#'''Indrajala''' – Faking military strength&lt;ref name=&quot;AskAsia&quot; /&gt;

==Maintenance of law and order==
A conducive atmosphere is necessary for the state's economy to thrive. This requires that a state's law and order be maintained. Arthashastra specifies fines and punishments to support strict enforcement of laws. The science of law enforcement is also called ''Dandaniti''.

==Wildlife and forests==
The Mauryas firstly looked at forests as a resource. For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus Nicator]], [[Alexander]]'s governor of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was more cost and time-effective to catch, tame and train wild elephants than raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''Arthashastra''  unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests'':&lt;ref name=&quot;IWH4&quot;&gt;Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|On the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The Superintendent should with the help of guards...protect the elephants whether along on the mountain, along a river, along lakes or in marshy tracts...They should kill anyone slaying an elephant.|Arthashastra}}

The ''Kauthilayas Arthashastra'' also reveals that the Mauryas designated specific forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers, for skins. Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.

==Economic ideas==
The exhaustive account of the economic ideas embedded in the [[Arthasastra]] has been given by [[Ratan Lal Basu]]&lt;ref&gt;Ratan Lal Basu &amp; Raj Kumar Sen, ''Ancient Indian Economic Thought, Relevance for Today'', ISBN 81-316-0125-0, Rawat Publications, New Delhi, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and by many renowned [[Arthasastra]]-experts in an Edited Volume by Sen &amp; Basu&lt;ref&gt;Raj Kumar Sen &amp; Ratan Lal Basu (eds): ''Economics in Arthasastra'', ISBN 81-7629-819-0, Deep&amp; Deep Publications Pvt.

Shamasastry]].&lt;ref name=outlook&gt;{{cite news|last=Srinivasaraju|first=Sugata|title=Year of the Guru|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?250522|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Outlook India|date=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
{{Quote box

In October 2012, after about two thousand years from its composition, [[National Security Advisor (India)|India's National Security Advisor]] [[Shiv Shankar Menon]] praised Arthashastra for its clear and precise rules which apply even today. Furthermore, he recommended reading of the book for broadening the vision on strategic issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;India needs to develop its own doctrine for strategic autonomy: NSA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=India needs to develop its own doctrine for strategic autonomy: NSA|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/india-needs-to-develop-its-own-doctrine-for-strategic-autonomy-nsa/articleshow/16868737.cms|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=Economic Times|date=18 October 2012|agency=PTI|location=NEW DELHI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
