'''Minarchism''' (also known as '''minimal statism''') is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[capitalist]] [[political philosophy]]. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it maintains that the [[State (polity)|state]] is necessary and that its only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]], and [[fraud]], and the only legitimate governmental institutions are the [[military]], [[police]], and [[courts]]. In the broadest sense, it also includes [[fire department]]s, [[prison]]s, the [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[legislatures]] as legitimate government functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;gregory&quot;&gt;Gregory, Anthory.[http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/gregory/gregory6.html The Minarchist's Dilemma]. ''[[Strike The Root]]''. 10 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peikoff What Role Should Certain Specific Governments Play in Objectivist Government?&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Peikoff|first=Leonard|title=What Role Should Certain Specific Governments Play in Objectivist Government?|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/03/07/what-role-should-certain-specific-governments-play-in-objectivist-government/|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=peikoff.com|date=March 7th, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peikoff Interview with Yaron Brook on Economic Issues in Today’S World (Part 1)&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Peikoff|first=Leonard|title=Interview with Yaron Brook on Economic Issues in Today’S World (Part 1)|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/10/03/interview-with-yaron-brook-on-economic-issues-in-todays-world-part-1/|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=peikoff.com|date=October 3rd, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such states are generally called [[Night-watchman state|night-watchman states]].

Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly on force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a [[laissez-faire]] approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.

== Ideology ==
Some minarchists justify the state on the grounds that it is the logical consequence of adhering to the [[non-aggression principle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Some argue that a state is inevitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight in Iowa City by Emmett&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Emerald Group Publishing | isbn = 978-1-78052-008-7 | last = Emmett | first = Ross B. | title = Frank H. Knight in Iowa City, 1919-1928 | date = 2011-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some minarchists argue that [[anarchism]] is immoral because it implies that the non-aggression principle is optional, because the enforcement of laws under anarchism is open to competition.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Another common justification is that private defense and court firms would tend to show bias, unevenly representing the interests of paying clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G. http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_08_3_holcombe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Nozick]] in ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' argued that a night watchman state provides a framework that allows for any political system that respects fundamental individual rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Nozick&gt; {{Cite book | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-09720-3 | last = Nozick | first = Robert | title = Anarchy, State, and Utopia | date = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[taxation]] is polarizing among minarchists.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Some minarchists support taxation on principle or see it as a [[Lesser of two evils principle|necessary evil]] to address the [[free rider problem]], while others believe it is [[morality|morally]] wrong.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Ayn Rand]] is notable for her opposition to taxation, while also holding that the elimination of taxation in a society should occur gradually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayn Rand Answers by Rand and Mayhew&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Penguin | isbn = 978-0-451-21665-6 | last = Rand | first = Ayn | coauthors = Robert Mayhew | title = Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q &amp; A | date = 2005-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another polarizing issue among minarchists is whether citizens should have to pay the government to enforce their [[contracts]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Objectivism===
Ayn Rand's philosophy, [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], supports the establishment of a minarchist state responsible for a court system, police, and military.

Objectivism views government as &quot;the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws;&quot; thus, government is both legitimate and critically important&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to protect individual rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=125–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand opposed so-called &quot;[[Anarchism|rational anarchism]],&quot; because she saw putting police and courts on the market as an inherent miscarriage of [[justice]]. Objectivism holds that the proper functions of a government are &quot;''the police'', to protect men from criminals—''[[military|the armed services]]'', to protect men from foreign invaders—''[[courts|the law courts]]'', to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws,&quot; the [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[legislatures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in protecting individual rights, the government is acting as an agent of its citizens and &quot;has no rights except the rights ''delegated'' to it by the citizens&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it must act in an impartial manner according to specific, objectively defined laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=128}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=364–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Samuel Edward Konkin III]], an [[agorism|agorist]], coined the term ''[[wikt:minarchism|minarchism]]'' in 1971 to describe libertarians who defend some form of compulsory government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Konkin invented the term ''minarchism'' as an alternative to the cumbersome phrase ''limited-government libertarianism''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It is ostensibly formed as ''min(imal)'' + ''-archy'' (government) + ''[[-ism (disambiguation)|-ism]]'' (system) – &quot;system of minimal government&quot;.

== Criticisms ==
[[Anarcho-capitalists]] generally argue that government violates the [[non-aggression principle]] by its nature because governments use force against those who have not [[theft|stolen private property]], [[vandalism|vandalized private property]], [[assault|assaulted anyone]], or [[fraud|committed fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick Long|Long, Roderick]], [http://praxeology.net/Anarconst2.pdf Market Anarchism as Constitutionalism], ''[http://praxeology.net/anarcres.htm Molinari Institute]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plauché, Geoffrey Allan (2006). [http://www.veritasnoctis.net/docs/persistentanarchyapsa2006.pdf On the Social Contract and the Persistence of Anarchy], ''[[American Political Science Association]]'', (Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State University).&lt;/ref&gt; Many also argue that [[monopoly|monopolies]] tend to be corrupt and inefficient.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Murray Rothbard]] argued that all government services, including defense, are inefficient because they lack a market-based [[pricing mechanism]] regulated by the voluntary decisions of [[consumer]]s purchasing services that fulfill their highest-priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth of Efficient Government Service by Rothbard&quot; /&gt; Therefore, the state's monopoly on the use of force is a violation of [[natural rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth of Efficient Government Service by Rothbard&quot; /&gt; He wrote, &quot;The defense function is the one reserved most jealously by the State.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth of Efficient Government Service by Rothbard&quot; /&gt; It is vital to the State's existence, for on its monopoly of force depends  its ability to extract taxes from the citizens. If citizens were  permitted privately owned courts and armies, then they would possess the  means to defend themselves against invasive acts by the government as  well as by private individuals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth of Efficient Government Service by Rothbard&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rothbard | first = Murray N | title = The Myth of Efficient Government Service | work = Mises Daily | location = Auburn, AL | accessdate = 2012-01-11 | date = 2004-03-18 | url = http://mises.org/daily/1471/The-Myth-of-Efficient-Government-Service }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Power and Market]]'', he argued that geographically large minarchist states are indifferent from a unified minarchist world monopoly government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Power and Market: Defense services on the Free Market
|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]
|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/mes.asp
|page=1051
|quote=It is all the more curious, incidentally, that while ''laissez-faireists'' should by the logic of their position, be ardent believers in a single, unified world government, so that no one will live in a state of “anarchy” in relation to anyone else, they almost never are.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard wrote that governments were not inevitable, noting that it often took hundreds of years for aristocrats to set up a state out of anarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothbard1054&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|title=Power and Market: Defense services on the Free Market
|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]
|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/mes.asp
|page=1054
|quote=In the purely free-market society, a would-be criminal police or judiciary would find it very difficult to take power, since there would be no organized State apparatus to seize and use as the instrumentality of command. To create such an instrumentality de novo is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to establish a functioning State apparatus. Furthermore, the purely free-market, stateless society would contain within itself a system of built-in “checks and balances” that would make it almost impossible for such organized crime to succeed.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that if a minimal state allows individuals to freely secede from the current jurisdiction to join a competing jurisdiction, then it does not by definition constitute a state.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title=Power and Market: Defense services on the Free Market
|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]
|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/mes.asp
|page=1051
|quote=But, of course, if each person may secede from government, we have virtually arrived at the purely free society, where defense is supplied along with all other services by the free market and where the invasive State has ceased to exist.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists generally argue that private defense and court firms would have to have a good reputation in order to stay in business. Furthermore, [[Linda &amp; Morris Tannehill]] argue that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a free market and that a government's citizenry can’t desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency.&lt;ref&gt;Linda &amp; Morris Tannehill.  ''[http://www.mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf The Market for Liberty]'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of an economically interventionist state argue it is best to evaluate the merits of government intervention on a case-by-case basis in order to address [[recession]]s (''see [[economic interventionism]]'') or [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|existential threats]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[social liberalism|Social liberals]] and [[social democrats]] argue that a government ought to appropriate private wealth in order to ensure care for disadvantaged or dependent people such as children, the elderly, the physically and mentally disabled, immigrants, the homeless, the poor, the unemployed, caretakers, or victimized minority groups.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[social conservatism|Social conservatives]] argue that the state should maintain a [[moral code|moral]] outlook and legislate against behavior commonly regarded as culturally destructive or immoral; that, indeed, the state cannot survive if its citizens do not have a certain kind of [[public morality|character]], integrity and [[civic virtue]], and so ignoring the state's role in forming people's ethical dispositions can be disastrous.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
