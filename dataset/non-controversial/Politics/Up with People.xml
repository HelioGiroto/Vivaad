      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12099">'''Up with People (UWP)''' is a global education organization whose mission is to bridge cultural barriers and create global understanding through service and music.  UWP was founded on the principle of using music as a means of communicating with and inspiring people. The musical production remains a core component of the program, and all students play an important role in bringing this show to the stage in each community. 

UWP is unique because of the one-of-a-kind combination of international travel, cultural immersion, education, performing arts and service learning. UWP’s educational program is experiential in nature and supported through a series of interactive workshops focused on leadership, communication, team-building, cultural understanding and global issues. Professional development opportunities are available though internships.

The UWP headquarters is in Denver, Colorado, USA, with satellite offices in Belgium and Mexico.  All students spend a month in Denver preparing for their tour.  Each traveling group, called a cast, consists of approximately 100 students from around the globe, and host families provide housing.

== History ==

Up with People was founded by J. Blanton Belk in 1965 as a positive voice for young people during a turbulent period in the United States. Its historic path officially began in 1968 when it was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) international, educational non-profit entity.

===Over the years:===

•	More than 21,000 young men and women from more than 80 countries have come together to travel in 180 casts to deliver a common message of hope and goodwill to people around the world, and pursue their own global education and personal growth goals through service, music and travel.

•	UWP has visited more than 4,000 communities in 42 countries;

•	Over 3 million hours of community service have been performed by UWP students;

•	500,000 host families around the world have welcomed UWP students into their homes, and

•	An estimated 22 million people worldwide have been directly impacted by UWP.

===Up with People Today:===

Up with People continues to be a global education and arts organization whose goal is to bridge cultural barriers and create global understanding through service and music. 

The program offers:

Multi-Continent Travel,

Community Service-Learning,

Cultural Immersion,

Performing Arts and 

Experiential and workshop-based education focused on leadership, communication, global awareness and personal development.

Students from all parts of the world travel with UWP for one or two semesters. Each international tour embarks with nearly 100 participants ages 17 – 29 from more than 15 countries. 

===The UWP Semester===

Each group, called a cast, travels to nearly 20 communities across two or three continents, per semester, spending about one week in each community. Each week, they live with a local host family, participate in 8 – 12 hours of service-learning projects, learn about different cultures through 4 – 6 hours of educational workshops, and perform in Up with People’s two-hour professional musical stage production. Programs begin in January or July of each year, and college credit is available.  Participants can apply to go abroad with UWP for one or two semesters.

== ''Smile 'Til It Hurts: The Up with People Story'' ==
The [[documentary film]] ''Smile 'Til It Hurts: The Up with People Story'' &lt;ref&gt; Storey, Lee.  ''Smile 'Til It Hurts: The Up with People Story.''  Storey Vision Productions, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1329440/&lt;/ref&gt; premiered at the 2009 [[Slamdance Film Festival]].  It is an '''unofficial''' documentary history of the organization.  The film was [[film director|directed]] by Lee Storey who is married to early alumnus William Storey.  

The film documents the troupe's history from its origins in the late 1950s within [[Moral Re-Armament]] and the Sing-Out groups, through its successful years of the 1980s and subsequent decline.

The film states that the troupe, funded by corporate entities including [[Halliburton]], [[General Motors]], [[Exxon]], and [[Searle]], was intended to counter the [[hippie]] [[subculture]]. The film further claims that the musical group emphasized extreme [[right wing politics]], and alleges that troupe rules included aspects of a [[religious cult]], including  [[arranged marriages]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smiletilithurts.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews have noted that while a critique of the organization, the film has also shown respect for those who were involved and demonstrated their good intentions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-07-28/film/docuweeks-allows-screentime-for-mdash-gasp-mdash-complex-women/&lt;/ref&gt;

The film had also been at issue in an [[IRS]] [[Michael_C._Donaldson#Lee_.26_William_Storey_v._Commissioner_of_Internal_Revenue|court case]] over whether an unprofitable [[independent film]] is a business venture versus a hobby.  Ultimately it was determined to be a business venture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053177 Documentary filmmaking is not a hobby: Lee Storey's court victory vs. IRS reassures community]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Up with People Alumni:==

Up with People’s more than 21,000+ alumni have made very real and sustainable change across the globe. For more than four decades, students who traveled in Up with People have gone on to become enthusiastic leaders in their communities, their countries and the world. Equipped with the life skills and broad perspectives learned on the road, many have become true global citizens and continue to give back in their careers and everyday lives.
