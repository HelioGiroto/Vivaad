The '''anti-Stalinist left''' describes plural forms of [[left-wing politics]] critical of [[Joseph Stalin]], of [[Stalinism]] as a political philosophy, and of the actual [[History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953)|system of governance Stalin implemented]] as Premier of the Soviet Union. It may also refer to left-wing opposition to [[dictatorship]], [[cult of personality|cults of personality]], and [[police state]]s, features commonly attributed to Stalin's regime. (Anti-Stalinism might ''also'' include opposition to [[Maoism]] and to the current regime in [[North Korea]]).

== Trotskyism ==
[[File:Diego rivera Commies.jpg|thumb|A [[Diego Rivera]] mural (''[[Man, Controller of the Universe]]'') depicts Trotsky with Marx and Engels as a true champion of the workers' struggle.]]
Associates and followers of [[Leon Trotsky]] were organised in the [[Left Opposition]] within the Communist parties before they were purged in the [[Moscow Trials]] in the 1930s. Subsequently, his followers formed the [[Fourth International]] in opposition to the Stalinist [[Third International]]. Trotsky saw the Stalinist states as [[deformed workers states]], where a political structure gave most workers very little power in decision making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/fi-3rdcongress/1951-congress08.htm &quot;Class Nature of Eastern Europe&quot;] Resolution Adopted by the Third Congress of the Fourth International—Paris, April 1951&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trotsky and his followers were very critical of the lack of internal debate among Stalinist organizations and societies and political repression enacted by Stalinist governments (i.e., [[The Great Purge]]); nationalist elements of Stalinist theory (the [[Socialism in One Country]] thesis, for example, adopted by Stalin as state policy), that led to a very poor revolutionary strategy in an international contest (and breaking with the [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] traditions of [[Marxism]]); and its dictatorial, bureaucratic, [[obscurantist]], personalistic, and high repressive methods (which Trotsky called &quot;inquisitorial&quot;, in a speech that was read and broadcast in English). Less orthodox [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other critics of Stalin have seen it as a new form of class state, called [[bureaucratic collectivism]] ([[James Burnham]], [[Milovan Đilas]], and [[Max Shachtman]]) or as [[state capitalist]] ([[Tony Cliff]] and [[C. L. R. James]]).

== Left communism ==
The [[Left communism|communist left]] was initially enthusiastic about the [[Bolshevik revolution]], but lines of tension between the communist left and the leadership of the [[Communist International]] opened up very soon. Left communists such as [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg#Criticism of the October Revolution|Rosa Luxemburg]] were among the first left-wing critics of [[Bolshevism]]. Left communists see communism as something that can only be achieved by the [[proletariat]] itself, and not through the dictatorship of a [[vanguard party]] acting on its behalf. (See also [[council communism]], [[Marxist humanism]], [[ultra-left]], [[luxemburgism]].)

== Anarchism ==
[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] like [[Emma Goldman]] were initially enthusiastic about the Bolsheviks, particularly after dissemination of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s pamphlet ''[[State and Revolution]]'', which painted Bolshevism in a very [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] light. However, the relations between the anarchists and the Bolsheviks soured in Soviet Russia (e.g. in the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and the [[Makhnovist]] movement). Anarchists and Stalinist Communists were also in armed conflict during the [[Spanish civil war]]. Anarchists are critical of the statist, [[totalitarian]] nature of Stalinism (and [[Marxism-Leninism]] in general), as well as its [[cult of personality]] around Stalin (and subsequent leaders seen by anarchists as Stalinists, such as [[Fidel Castro]] or [[Mao Zedong]]).

== Democratic socialism ==
A significant current of the [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] movement has defined itself in opposition to Stalinism. This includes [[George Orwell]], [[H. N. Brailsford]],&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Leventhal, ''The Last Dissenter: H.N. Brailsford and His World'',
Oxford University Press, 1985, ISBN 0198200552  (pp. 248-49).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fenner Brockway]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Corthorn, ''In the shadow of the dictators: the British Left in the 1930s''. Tauris Academic Studies, 2006, ISBN 1850438439,
 (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Independent Labour Party]] in Britain (particularly after World War II), the group around [[Marceau Pivert]] in France and, in America, [[the New York Intellectuals]] around the journals ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[Dissent (magazine)|Dissent]]''. These democratic socialists saw Soviet Communism as a form of [[totalitarianism]] in some ways mirroring [[fascism]].

== Right Opposition ==
Another major split in the international communist movement was that between Stalin and the [[Right Opposition]]. In several countries parallel communist parties were formed that either were rejected by the [[Comintern]] or distanced themselves from it. Their criticism did in some ways become similar to positions raised by the Trotskyists, but as a tendency they were far less coherent. The Right Opposition developed contacts with other groups that did not fit into either the international [[Social democracy]] or Comintern, such as the Independent Labour Party in Britain. This tendency largely died out at the time of the Second World War. In other cases dissident Marxist trends developed outside of the established communist movement, such as the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Anushlian Marxists]] in India.

== Titoism ==
At first, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] and the regime it established through the successful war of liberation against the Axis invaders by the [[partizan]]s was modeled on that of Soviet Union, and [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] was considered to be &quot;[[Stalin]]'s most faithful pupil&quot;. However, in 1948, the two leaders broke apart and Tito's aides (most notably [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan Djilas]] and [[Moša Pijade]]) began a theoretical effort to develop a new brand of Socialism that would be both [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] in nature and [[anti-Stalinism|anti-Stalinist]] in practice. The result was the Yugoslav system of '''socialist [[workers' self-management]]''', also known [[Titoism]], based on the organizing every productive activities of society into &quot;self-managed units&quot;.

Djilas, particularly, wrote extensively against Stalinism and was radically critical of the bureaucratic apparatus built by Bolshevism in Soviet Union. Ironically, he later grew critical of his own regime as well and became a dissident in Yugoslavia. He was imprisoned but later pardoned and died in his homeland as a free citizen.

==Non-Communist Left==
&quot;Non-Communist Left&quot;, or NCL, was a designation used in the U.S. [[State Department]] and [[United States Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) referring mainly to leftist intellectuals who had become disillusioned by Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 62–63. &quot;The Agency had been toying with an idea for a while now: who better to fight the Communists than former Communists? In consultation with Koestler, this idea now began to take shape. The destruction of the Communist mythos, he argued, could only be achieved by mobilizing those figures on the left who were non-Communist in a campaign of persuasion. The people of whom Koestler spoke were already designated as a group—the Non-Communist Left—in the State Department and intelligence circles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] highlighted the group's growing power in a popular 1948 essay titled &quot;Not Right, Not Left, But a Vital Center&quot;, making a case for a permanent end to [[Left-wing politics|the Left]] as a unified bloc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vital Center&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlesinger, Jr.|first=Arthur M.|title=Not Right, Not Left, But a Vital Center|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schlesinger-notrightleft.html|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times Magazine|date=4 April 1948|authorlink=Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key publication was ''[[The God that Failed]]'' (1948), a complation of essays from six former communists.

[[File:CIA floor seal.gif|thumb|A major international strain of anti-Stalinism was sponsored by the CIA]]

Winning over and harnessing the power of the NCL became central to the US propaganda struggle against the USSR during the early [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), p 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy directly inspired the creation of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF), as well as international journals like [[Melvin J. Lasky|''Der Monat'']] and ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]''; it also influenced existing publications such as the ''[[Partisan Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 162. &quot;The headquarters of 'professional' anti-Stalinism was the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, and the magazines whose editors who sat on its board, namely ''Commentary'', the ''New Leader'' and ''Partisan Review''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under these auspices (and consequently in fashionable intellectual circles in the US and Europe), anti-Stalinism became &quot;almost a professional stance&quot;, &quot;a total outlook on life, no less, or even a philosophy of history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rahv]], quoted in: Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 161–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent figures in this group include [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Melvin J. Lasky]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Sidney Hook]], [[Stephen Spender]], [[Nicolas Nabokov]], and [[Isaiah Berlin]]. (The NCL notably excluded [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] because it could not accept his individualistic existentialist views.)&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), p 121. &quot;Sartre was the enemy not just because of his position on Communism, but because he preached a doctrine (or anti-doctrine) of individualism which rubbed against the federalist 'family of man' society which America, through organizations like the Congress for Cultural Freedom, was promoting. (The Soviet Union, by the way, found Sartre equally uncongenial, branding existentialism 'a nauseating and putrid concoction.')&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Key organizers of the CIA's Non-Communist Left operation, titled QKOPERA, included [[Frank Wisner]], Lawrence de Neufville, [[Thomas Braden]], [[Charles Douglas Jackson|C.D. Jackson]], and Michael Josselson.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; (Other supporters within the intelligence community included [[George Kennan]], [[Averell Harriman]], and General [[Lucius D. Clay]].)&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCL began to loose its cohesion and its appeal to the CIA during the radicalism of the late 1960s. [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Opposition to the Vietnam War]] fractured the coalition, and 1967 revelations of CIA funding (by ''Ramparts'' and others) were embarrassing for many of the intellectuals involved. Soon after the story broke, Braden (with tacit support from the CIA) wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post which exposed CIA involvement with the Non-Communist Left and organized labor.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 401–402. &quot;Richard Helms, who was now director of the CIA, was, according to Rostow's memo, aware of the article, and conceivably of its contents also. The CIA had ample time to invoke its secrecy agreement with Braden, and prevent him publishing the piece.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Braden 1967&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Braden|first=Thomas|title=I'm glad the CIA is 'immoral'|url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/braden_20may1967.html|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=Saturday Evening Post|date=20 May 1967|authorlink=Thomas Braden|pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argued that this article represented an intentional and final break of the CIA with the NCL.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, ''Cultural Cold War'' (1999), pp. 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New Left ==
The emergence of the [[New Left]] and the [[new social movements]] in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest alternative forms of [[Marxism]]. Figures associated with British [[cultural studies]] (e.g., [[Raymond Williams]]), Italian [[autonomism]] and [[workerism]] (e.g., [[Antonio Negri]]), French groups like the [[Situationist International]] (e.g., [[Guy Debord]]) and [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] (e.g., [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) as well as the magazine '' [[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'' in America, were examples of this.
