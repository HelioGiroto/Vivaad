The '''Miami model''' is the tactics employed by [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] during demonstrations in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] relating to the negotiations for the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA) trade agreement in November 2003. 

On November 13, 2003, four days before the FTAA, the city passed City of Miami Ordinance 54-6.1, outlawing a broad range of items that could be construed as weapons or devices for disrupting public order, as in a &quot;[[sleeping dragon]]&quot; and outlawed any coordinated group of two or more people who are attempting to get public attention and disrupt the normal flow of traffic. In addition, any gathering of 8 or more people lasting more than 30 minutes without a permit would be considered illegal. The ordinance was designed specifically for the FTAA and had a [[sunset provision]] built into it.

Miami-Dade State Attorney Kathy Fernandez Rundle responded to allegations of [[police brutality]] saying &quot;The police were very professional, very controlled... I think we have a model here for the rest of the world to emulate in the future when these sort of events take place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tmm-indy&quot; /&gt; Further allegations and complaints were met with assurances by authorities that police had acted 'according to plan'. [[Political activist]]s and academics continue to use the term to refer to a framework of similar tactics used by law enforcement in subsequent events, including trade meetings and political conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitale|first=Alex|title=“The Command and Control and Miami Models at the 2004 Republican National Convention: New Forms of Policing Protests,|journal=Mobilization|year=2007|month=December|volume=12|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}

==Features==
The Miami model carries the distinctive features of [[crowd control]] techniques used in Miami, which included large scale pre-emptive [[arrest]]s, heavily armed sometimes unidentifiable law enforcement, the collection of intelligence from protesters, and the &quot;embedding&quot; of corporate media with the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071023200835/http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&amp;itemid=488 &quot;Infamous ‘Miami Model’ of Protest Clampdown, Coming to a Town Near You&quot;], ''The NewStandard'' (archived).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, areas that are to be the site of a major event are given large federal grants to purchase materials for security. Thus, police may be unfamiliar with the use of the new equipment they have been given and rural police brought in to the city may be somewhat unfamiliar with crowd control tactics in general. Protestors and activists allege some of the following&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.g20media.org/miami-model-checklist Miami Model characteristics] (as applied in Pittsburgh)&lt;/ref&gt; as further tactics belonging to the Miami model:

* Establishment of joint, unified, multi-agency command/control network.
* Mass purchase of [[surveillance]] equipment, riot gear and other supplies.
* Training of local law enforcement in &quot;crowd control tactics&quot; and less lethal weapons.
* Public relations, &quot;[[information warfare]]&quot;, [[newspeak]]/[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]:
**&quot;terrorists/violent protesters coming&quot; vs &quot;well trained officers&quot;.
** &quot;event meaningful target for terrorism.&quot;
** &quot;police will protect the right to protest.&quot;
** &quot;anarchists and criminal elements&quot;, dramatic Seattle WTO or London imagery.
** display of confiscated &quot;weapons&quot; prove malintent.
** &quot;unpermitted protests can continue&quot; due to police good will.
** [[independent media]] targeted, cameras, video confiscated.
* Pro-event/anti-demonstrator promotional tools developed/used in community.
* Reluctant officials, civic groups pressured to comply with plan by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]/[[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]].
* Locations strategically valuable to protesters reserved by law enforcement.
* Plans to secure public buildings and strategic private businesses complete.
* Anti-protest ordinances and other legal hurdles to prevent lawful assembly begin.
* State of Emergency declared or Executive Order signed to allow military policing.
* Surveillance and disruption of protest organizers begins.
* Attempts to divide protest groups and organizers begins in media and meetings.
* Court system tied up: regular business delayed during protest; assist [[mass arrest]]s.
* Mass detention facilities identified and prepped for use.
* Civic groups and clubs employed to support law enforcement activities.
* March and event permits denied or delayed; delay tactics.
* Police/military collaborate with media, i.e. [[Embedded journalism|embedded reporters]], etc.
* Street level surveillance increases on organizers and demonstrators.
* Public training drills and mass show of force.
* Sporadic harassment, detention and arrest of demonstrators traveling in area.
* Disruption of organizing/assembly/housing/media spaces. Possible preemptive arrest.
* Command Center operational; large undercover teams begin reporting
* Militarized &quot;hard zone&quot; and limited access &quot;soft zone&quot; created with fences, barricades.
* Area wide surveillance video, including 3-D video systems operational.
* Field forces ([[Riot control|riot police]], bike police, [[Security checkpoint|checkpoints]], etc.) put into place.
* Day of protest: assembly blocked, obstructed, redirected.
* Use of [[less-lethal weapon]]s - [[Rubber bullet|projectiles]], [[Lachrymatory agent|chemical weapons]], [[Electroshock weapon|electric weapons]], [[Sonic weapon|sound devices]] etc.
* Streets cleared using force; protesters pursued; more mass arrest.
* [[Jail solidarity]] events allowed to protest for few hours, then cleared.

==Miami protests==
Miami Activist Defense and [[National Lawyers Guild]] filed a federal lawsuit against the City, the Mayor, Police Chief Timoney, Homeland Defense Secretary Ridge, and Attorney General Ashcroft for rampant abuse of the constitution.

The [[American Civil Liberties Union of Florida]] filed numerous lawsuits claiming excessive use of force and illegal serches. The City and County of Miami have paid close $500,000 in settlements in thee cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami FTAA Riots|url=http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/settlements/09526/miami-ftaa-riots.html|publisher=lawyersandsettlements.com/settlements|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[AFL-CIO]] filed an additional lawsuit claiming that their 1st and 4th Amendment rights had been violated. 

Among the groups which organized against the FTAA were the Green Bloc, United for Peace and Justice, [[Root Cause]], several [[AFL-CIO]] affiliated unions, [[Midwest Unrest]], [[Pittsburgh Organizing Group]], [[Food Not Bombs]] and many others.

==Film==
''The Miami Model'' is also the title of a documentary film, produced by [[Indymedia]], about the FTAA, the police action in Miami, and political organizing led by [[people of color]] in the Miami area.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmm-indy&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071011114459/http://ftaaimc.org/miamimodel The Miami Model : an indymedia production] (archived).&lt;/ref&gt;
