'''North America''' is a [[continent]] wholly within the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and almost wholly within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. It is also considered a northern [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=britannica-northamerica&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418612/North-America|title = North America|publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered to the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the west and south by the [[Pacific Ocean]], and to the southeast by [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]].

North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers&lt;!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --&gt; (9,540,000 square miles), about 4.8% of the planet's surface or about 16.5% of its land area. As of July 2008, its population was estimated at nearly 529 million people across [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America|23 independent states]]. North America is the third-largest continent in area, following [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], and the [[List of continents by population|fourth]] in population after Asia, Africa, and [[Europe]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Historisch Nordamerika.jpg|thumb|Map of North America, from the 16th century]]

The Americas are usually accepted as having been named after the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] by the German cartographers [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626894/Amerigo-Vespucci |title= Amerigo Vespucci |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci, who explored South America between 1497 and 1502, was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller produced a world map, in which he placed the word &quot;America&quot; on the continent of South America, in the middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book ''Cosmographiae Introductio'',

:''ab Americo inventore ... quasi Americi terram sive Americam'' (from Americus the discoverer ... as if it were the land of Americus, thus America).&lt;ref&gt;p. 9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=3bOg4Nroos4C ''The Cosmographiæ Introductio of Martin Waldseemüller in Facsimile''], translated by Edward Burke and Mario E. Cosenza, introduction by Joseph Fischer and Franz von Wieser, edited by Charles George Herbermann, New York: The United States Catholic Historical Society, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Waldseemüller, no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer. He used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name (Americus Vespucius), but in its feminine form &quot;America&quot;, following the examples of &quot;Europa&quot; and &quot;Asia&quot;.

Later, when other mapmakers added North America, they extended the original name to it as well: in 1538, [[Gerard Mercator]] used the name America to all of the Western Hemisphere on his world map.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;&gt;[http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html The Naming of America: Fragments We've Shored Against Ourselves]. By Jonathan Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and so a derivation from &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; could be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=John |authorlink=John Lloyd (writer) |coauthors= John Mitchinson |title=The Book of General Ignorance |publisher=Harmony Books |isbn=978-0-307-39491-0 |page=95 |quote=New countries or continents were never named after a person’s first name, but always after the second... |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo Palma (1949) proposed a derivation from the &quot;Amerrique&quot; mountains of Central America—Vespucci was the first to discover South America and the ''Amerrique'' mountains of Central America, which connected his discoveries to those of [[Christopher Columbus]].

[[Alfred Hudd|Alfred E. Hudd]] proposed a theory in 1908 that the continents are named after a Welsh merchant named [[Richard Amerike]] from Bristol, who is believed to have financed [[John Cabot]]'s voyage of discovery from England to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1497. A minutely explored belief that has been advanced is that America was named for a Spanish sailor bearing the ancient [[Visigothic]] name of 'Amairick'. Another is that the name is rooted in a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of North America}}

===Geologic history===
[[Laurentia]] is an ancient [[craton]] which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 to 1.0 billion years ago during the [[Proterozoic]] eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalziel |first=I.W.D. |year=1992 |title=On the organization of American Plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |journal=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Shield]] is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late [[Paleozoic]] to Early [[Mesozoic]] eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], with [[Eurasia]] to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which [[Taconic orogeny|formed]] some 480 million years ago, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago, North America became part of [[Laurasia]], before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Zeeya Merali, Brian J. Skinner, Visualizing Earth Science, Wiley, ISBN 978-0-470-41847-5&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the [[Laramide orogeny]], between 80 and 55 million years ago. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] connected the continent to South America about three million years ago, and the [[Great Lakes]] (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.  

North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about [[geologic time]] periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-american&quot; /&gt; The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of [[dinosaur]]s than any other modern country.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-american&quot; /&gt; According to [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-american&quot;/&gt; Much of the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]] is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinopedia-american&quot;&gt;Dodson, Peter (1997). &quot;American Dinosaurs.&quot; ''Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs''. Edited by Phillip J. Currie and Kevin Padian. Academic Press. p. 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant [[Late Jurassic|Late]] [[Jurassic]] dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the [[Morrison Formation]] of the western United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;jurassicdistribution&quot;&gt;Weishampel, David B; et al (2004). &quot;Dinosaur distribution (Late Jurassic, North America).&quot; In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osmólska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 543–545. ISBN 0-520-24209-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Columbian===
[[File:Chichen-Itza El Castillo.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of [[Chichén Itzá]], Mexico.]]
Anthropologists have [[Models of migration to the New World|a number of models explaining the origins]] of the [[Paleo-Indians|early human population of North America]]. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples of North America]] have many [[creation myth]]s by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation. The consensus is that indigenous North Americans first arrived from Asia during the [[last Ice Age]], most likely through the [[Bering Land Bridge]] and possibly by primitive boats also.

[[Pre-Columbian|Before contact with Europeans]], the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, from small [[Band society|bands]] of a few families to large empires. They lived in several &quot;[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|culture areas]]&quot;, which roughly correspond to [[Geography of North America|geographic and biological zones]] and give a good indication of the main [[lifeway]] or occupation of the people who lived there (e.g. the [[Plains Bison|bison]] [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of the [[Plains Indian|Great Plains]], or the farmers of [[Mesoamerica]]). Native groups can also be classified by their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language family]] (e.g. [[Athabaskan languages|Athapascan]] or [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]). Peoples with similar languages did not always share the same [[material culture]], nor were they always [[allies]]. Anthropologists think that the [[Inuit]] people of the high [[Arctic]] came to North America much later than other native groups, as evidenced by the disappearance of [[Dorset culture]] artifacts from the [[archaeological record]], and their replacement by the [[Thule people]]. It is possible that North America had several peoples among its early settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/280/5361/191 ANTHROPOLOGY: Kennewick Man's Contemporaries], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', April 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The best known evidence that supports this theory is [[Kennewick Man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060425183740.htm Kennewick Man Skeletal Find May Revolutionalize Continent's History], ''Science Daily'', April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest cultures yet found is the [[Clovis culture]] of modern [[New Mexico]]. Later cultures include the [[Mississippian culture]] and related [[Mound builder (people)|Mound building]] cultures, found in the [[Mississippi river]] valley and the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Pueblo culture]] of what is now the [[Four Corners]]. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the [[domestication]] of many common [[Crop (agriculture)|crops]] now used around the world, such as tomatoes and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world's major staples, maize (corn).

As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many important cultural advances were made there. For example, the [[Maya civilization]] developed a [[Maya script|writing system]], built [[Mesoamerican pyramids|huge pyramids and temples]], had a [[Maya calendar|complex calendar]], and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE, a few hundred years after the [[Mesopotamians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciam.com/math/article/id/what-is-the-origin-of-zer | title = What is the origin of zero? How did we indicate nothingness before zero? | author = Robert Kaplan | publisher = Scientific American | date = 16 January 2007 | accessdate =19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayan culture was still present in [[southern Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]] when the [[Conquistadors|Spanish]] explorers arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the [[Aztec Empire]] whose capital city [[Tenochtitlan]] was located further north in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref name=Grunberg&gt;Bernard Grunberg, ''&quot;La folle aventure d'Hernan Cortés''&quot;, in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin West]]'s ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771) depicting the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].]]

===Post-Columbian===
During the [[Age of Discovery]], Europeans began exploring and staking claims in various parts of North America. Upon their arrival in the &quot;[[New World]],&quot; the Native American population declined substantially, primarily due to the introduction of European diseases to which the Native Americans lacked immunity,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 42–46, ''A Concise History of World Population: An Introduction to Population Processes'', Massimo Livi Bacci, Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing, 2001, 3rd ed., ISBN 0-631-22335-5.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as violent conflicts. Native peoples found their culture changed drastically. As such, their affiliation with political and cultural groups changed as well, several linguistic groups went [[Language death|extinct]], and others changed quite quickly. The names and cultures that Europeans recorded for the natives were not necessarily the same as the ones they had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today.

[[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], and [[France]] fought over and established extensive territories in North America. In the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th, several independence movements started across the continent, which would create its modern countries. The 13 British colonies on the North Atlantic coast declared independence in 1776, becoming the [[United States of America]]. [[Canada]] was formed from the unification of northern territories controlled by Britain and France. [[New Spain]], a territory that stretched from modern-day southern U.S. to Central America, declared independence in 1810 becoming the [[First Mexican Empire]]. In 1823 the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], then part of the Mexican Empire, became the first [[sovereign state|independent state]] in Central America, officially changing its name to the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]].

Before the Central American isthmus was raised, the region had been underwater. The islands of the [[West Indies]] delineate a submerged former [[land bridge]] which had connected North America and South America via what are now [[Florida]] and [[Venezuela]]. The continental coastline is long and irregular. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by [[Hudson Bay]]. Others include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

There are numerous islands off the continent’s coasts, principally, the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Arctic Archipelago]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Turks &amp; Caicos]], the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], the [[Aleutian Islands]] (some of which are in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] proper), the [[Alexander Archipelago]], the many thousand islands of the [[British Columbia Coast]], and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. [[Greenland]], a self-governing [[Denmark|Danish]] island, and the [[list of islands by area|world's largest]], is on the same [[tectonic plate]] (the [[North American Plate]]) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, [[Bermuda]] is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island which was formed on the fissure of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] over 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago. The nearest landmass to it is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]]. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to [[Virginia]] and other parts of the continent.
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]]]]
The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western [[Mexico]], including Baja California, and of [[California]], including the cities of [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]] and part of [[San Francisco]], lie on the eastern edge of the [[Pacific Plate]], with the two plates meeting along the [[San Andreas fault]]. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] lie on the [[Caribbean Plate]], whereas the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and [[Cocos Plate|Cocos plates]] border the North American Plate on its western frontier.

The continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the [[Great Plains]] stretching from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]]; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], [[Geography of California|California]] and [[Alaska]]; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the [[Canadian Shield]] in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long [[plateau]]s and [[American cordillera|cordilleras]], falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.

The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coast ranges]] in California, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]], with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is [[Denali]] in Alaska.

The [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Geographic%20Centers United States Geographical Survey] states that the geographic center of North America is &quot;6&amp;nbsp;miles west of [[Balta, North Dakota|Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota]]&quot; at approximately {{Coord|48|10|N|100|10|W}}, approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} from [[Rugby, North Dakota]]. The USGS further states that “No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 States, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.” Nonetheless, there is a 15-foot (4.5&amp;nbsp;m) field stone [[obelisk]] in Rugby claiming to mark the center.

[[File:Languages of the Americas.PNG|thumb|Languages spoken in the Americas]]
[[Image:Langs N.Amer.png|thumb|[[First language|Native languages]] of North America (Map of U.S., Canada and Greenland)]]

The prevalent [[languages in North America]] are English, Spanish, and French. The term [[Anglo-America]] is used to refer to the [[English language|anglophone]] countries of the Americas: namely [[Canada]] (where English and French are co-official) and the [[United States]], but also sometimes [[Belize]] and parts of the [[Caribbean|tropics]], especially the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]]. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the United States) where the [[Romance language]]s, derived from [[Latin language|Latin]], of Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (but French speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always [[Belize]]), part of the [[Caribbean]] (not the Dutch, English or French speaking areas), [[Mexico]], and most of South America (except [[Guyana]], Suriname, [[French Guiana]] ([[France|FR]]), and The Falkland Islands (UK)).

The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of [[Quebec]], where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of [[New Brunswick]]. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of [[Ontario]] (the official language is English, but there is an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of [[Manitoba]] (co-official as de jure with English), the [[French West Indies]] and [[Saint-Pierre et Miquelon]], as well as the US state of [[Louisiana]], where French is also an official language. [[Haiti]] is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in [[Saint Lucia]] and the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] alongside English.

Economically, Canada and the United States are the wealthiest and most [[developed country|developed nations]] in the continent, followed by Mexico, a [[newly industrialized countries|newly industrialized country]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot; /&gt; The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development. For example, small [[Caribbean]] island-nations such as [[Barbados]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Antigua and Barbuda]] have a higher [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] than Mexico due to their smaller populations. [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]] have a significantly higher [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2010_EN_Complete.pdf|title=2010 Human development Report|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|pages=148–151|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographically, North America is a racially and ethnically diverse continent. Its three main racial groups are [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], [[Mestizo]]s and [[Black people|Blacks]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} There is a significant minority of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] and [[Asian people|Asians]] among other less numerous groups.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Socially and culturally, North America presents a well-defined entity. Canada and the United States have a similar culture and similar traditions as a result of both countries being [[British America|former British colonies]]. A common cultural and economic market has developed between the two nations because of the strong economic and historical ties. Spanish-speaking North America shares a common past as former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]]. In Mexico and the Central American countries where civilizations like the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] developed, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] preserve traditions across modern boundaries. Central American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical proximity and the fact that they won independence from Spain.

Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of [[Monterrey]], [[Tijuana]], [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Mexicali]], is strongly influenced by the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] and [[American way|way of life of the United States]]. Of the a fore mentioned cities, Monterrey has been regarded as the most [[Americanization|Americanized]] city in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;MonterreyFall&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Special report: If Monterrey falls Mexico falls - Rueters |publisher=Rueters |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |last=Emmot |first=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immigration to the United States]] and [[Immigration to Canada|Canada]] remains a significant attribute of many nations close to the southern border of the U.S. The [[Anglophone Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean states]] have witnessed the decline of the [[British Empire]] and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America. In the Anglophone Caribbean this influence is partly due to the relatively small populations (less than 200,000) of the majority of English-speaking Caribbean countries, and the fact that many of these countries now have [[expatriate]] diasporas living abroad that are larger than those remaining at home.

While the United States, Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Chicago, [[Toronto]], [[Havana]], [[Santo Domingo]], and [[Montreal]]. Cities in the [[sunbelt]] regions of the United States, such as those in [[Southern California]] and [[Houston]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Miami, [[Atlanta]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of [[Baby Boomers]], large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the United States border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is [[Tijuana]], a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of [[water shortages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cetron, Marvin J.; O'Toole, Thomas: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=K_VGAAAAMAAJ Encounters with the future: a forecast of life into the 21st century]'', Mcgraw-Hill, April 1982, pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight of the top ten [[metropolitan areas]] [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|are located in the United States]]. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the [[New York City metropolitan area]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]], [[Chicago metropolitan area]], and the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]].&lt;ref name=PopEstCBSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_NSRD_GCTPL2.US24PR&amp;prodType=table|title=Population and Housing Occupancy Status: 2010 - United States -- Metropolitan Statistical Area; and for Puerto Rico  more information 2010 Census National Summary File of Redistricting Data|work=2010 United States Census|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the United States, Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America: [[Greater Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA - The World Factbook: Mexico |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html |accessdate=20 June 2011 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the [[Toronto metropolitan area]] having five and half million citizens.&lt;ref name=statcan2006&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CMA&amp;Code1=535__&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Toronto&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom= | title= Toronto, Ontario (Census metropolitan area) | author=Statistics Canada| authorlink= Statistics Canada| year= [[Canada 2006 Census|Census 2006]] | accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of cities to each other on the [[Canada - United States border]] and [[Mexico - United States border]] has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas. These [[urban agglomerations]] are observed at their largest and most productive in [[Detroit–Windsor]] and [[San Diego–Tijuana]] and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded USD $13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego-Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at USD $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit Regional Chamber (2006) [http://www.detroitchamber.com/detroiter/articles.asp?cid=7&amp;detcid=531 Detroit/Windsor Border Update: Part I-Detroit River International Crossing Study]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning SD-TJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=CHAPTER IV PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE: URBAN &amp; REGIONAL PLANNING IN THE SAN DIEGO-TIJUANA REGION |publisher=International Community Foundation |url=http://www.icfdn.org/publications/blurredborders/documents/urbanch4.pdf |accessdate=20 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North America continent has also been witness to the growth of [[megapolitan area]]s. In the United States exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]], [[Pacific Northwest|Cascadia]], Florida, [[Front Range Urban Corridor|Front Range]], [[Great Lakes Megaregion]], [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast Megaregion]], [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast]], [[Northern California]], [[Piedmont Atlantic]], [[Southern California]], and the [[Texas Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagler, Yoav (2009). &quot;Defining U.S. Megaregions.&quot; New York, NY: [[Regional Plan Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] - both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megaregion - and megalopolis of [[Central Mexico]]. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, D.C. Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet [[United States megapolitan areas#Megaregions and planning: A brief history|megaregion criterion]] have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.&lt;ref name=RPA08&gt;Regional Plan Association (2008).

===Canadian geology===
Geologically, Canada is one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of [[precambrian]] rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the [[Palaeozoic]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marianopolis&quot;&gt;Wallace, Stewart W. [http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/GeologyofCanada.htm &quot;Geology Of Canada.&quot;] The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. III, Toronto, University Associates of Canada, 1948, 396p., p. 23-26. [http://faculty.marianopolis.edu Marianopolis College]. Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marianopolis&quot;/&gt; Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, [[zinc]], copper, gold, lead, [[molybdenum]], and [[uranium]] reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/16-12/ff_diamonds_sb &quot;Digging for Diamonds 24/7 Under Frozen Snap Lake&quot;] [http://www.wired.com Wired.com]. Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]] has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;&gt;[http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html 3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly] Retrieved on 13 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.

===U.S. geological provinces===
The [[Continental United States|lower 48 U.S. states]] can be divided into roughly five [[physiography|physiographic]] provinces:
# The [[American cordillera]].
# The [[Canadian Shield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marianopolis&quot;/&gt;
# The stable platform.
# The coastal plain.
# The [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] [[orogeny|orogenic]] belt.

The geology of [[Alaska]] is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of [[Neogene]] [[volcano|volcanics]] erupted over a [[hotspot (geology)|hot spot]].

===Central American geology===
[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|left|{{legend|#FAD4AF|Central America rests in the [[Caribbean Plate]].}}]]

Central America is geologically active with [[volcanic eruption]]s and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquake]], killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of [[Nicaragua]], was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killed about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated [[El Salvador]], one in 1986 and two in 2001; one [[2009 Costa Rica earthquake|earthquake]] devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009 killing at least 34 people; in [[2009 Honduras earthquake|Honduras]] a powerful earthquake killed 7 people in 2009.

[[Volcano|Volcanic]] eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.

Central America has many [[mountain range]]s; the longest are the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]], the [[Cordillera Isabelia]] and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]]. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact most of the population of [[Honduras]], Costa Rica and [[Guatemala]] live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans and other crops.

The Caribbean trade bloc - CARICOM - came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was USD $96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a [[CARICOM passport|common passport]] for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on [[Free Trade Agreement]]s and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations (OTN) free trade agreements have been signed into effect.

Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. Recent implementation of the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) has left the future of the CACM unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central American Community and Market |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0811094.html |publisher=Pearson Education |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the United States. The focal point of CAFTA is to created a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the United States, Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs. Currently under proposal, the [[Canada – Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CA4) would operate much the same as CAFTA with the United States does.

North American nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]] with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The United States has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the [[Transatlantic Free Trade Area]] between itself and the [[European Union]]; the [[US-Middle East Free Trade Area]] between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.

[[Image:PanAmericanHwy.png|thumb||The full [[Pan American Highway]], (including South America), from [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]] to [[Ushuaia]], Argentina.]]
The [[Pan-American Highway]] route in North America is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000&amp;nbsp;km in length which travels through the mainland nations of the Americas. No definitive length of the Pan American Highway exists because the U.S. and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U.S. border. However, the total length of the North American portion of the highway is roughly {{convert|16000|mi|km}}.

[[Image:Class1rr.png|thumb|left|2006 map of the North American [[Class I railroad]] network]]

The First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States was built across North America in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous [[Golden spike]] event at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the [[U.S. West|American West]], catalyzing the transition from the [[wagon train]]s of previous decades to a modern transportation system. Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern US railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) had, by 1867, already accumulated more than {{convert|2055|km|mi}} of track by connecting Portland, Maine, and the three northern New England states with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.

Many of the nations of North America cooperate on a shared telephone system known as the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP) which is an integrated [[telephone numbering plan]] of 24 countries and territories: the United States and its [[Insular area|territories]], Canada, [[Bermuda]], and 17 [[Caribbean]] nations.

==Regions==
{{see also|List of regions of Canada|List of regions of Mexico|List of regions of the United States}}
Geographically the North American continent is composed of many regions and subregions. These included regions formed by cultural, economic, and geographic standards. Economic regions included those formed by trade blocs; among notable inclusionss, the North American Trade Agreement bloc and Central American Trade Agreement. Linguistically and culturally, the continent could be divided into [[Anglo-America]] and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of Northern America, [[Belize]], and Caribbean islands with English speaking populations - though sub-national entities such as [[Louisiana]] and [[Quebec]] are [[Francophone]] in composition.

The southern North American continent is often recognized as being composed of two regions. These recognized regions are Central America and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaCA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Central America|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861670266/Central_America.html|publisher=Encarta Encyclopedia|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Caribbean|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of ''North America'', that which encompasses the whole continent, the term ''North America'' is also used to refer to Canada, Mexico, the United States, and Greenland.&lt;ref name=Trilateral /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parsons |first= Alan |coauthors= Jonathan Schaffer |title= Geopolitics of oil and natural gas |publisher= U.S. Department of State |series= Economic Perspectives |year= 2004 |month= May |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAGreenland&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- North America |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbExt/region_noa.html |accessdate=20 June 2011 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CountryReports&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eNotes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=North America: World of Earth Science |url=http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/north-america |accessdate=20 June 2011 |publisher=eNotes Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Northern America, originating in reference to the northern-most countries and territories of North America, is used in reference to Canada, the United States, Greenland, Bermuda, and St. Pierre and Miquelon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/migration/index.asp?panel=3 Definition of major areas and regions], from World Migrant Stock: The 2005 Revision Population Database, United Nations Population Division.

The largest countries of the continent, Canada and the United States, also maintain well-defined and recognized regions. In the case of Canada these are the [[British Columbia Coast]], [[Canadian Prairies]], Central Canada, [[Atlantic Canada]], and Northern Canada. These regions also maintain numerous subregions. In the case of the United States - and in accordance with the U.S. Census Bureau definitions - these regions are: [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]], [[East North Central States]], [[West North Central States]], [[South Atlantic States]], [[East South Central States]], [[West South Central States]], [[Mountain States]], and [[Pacific States]]. Regions shared between both nations included the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]]. [[Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolis']] have also formed between both nations in the case of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Great Lakes Megaregion]].

==Usage of the term ''North America''==
The term ''North America'' maintains various definitions in accordance with location and context. In English, ''North America'' may be used to refer to the United States and Canada together.&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, R. W., ed. 2004. &quot;America.&quot; ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]]'' (ISBN 0-19-861021-1) New York: Oxford University Press, p. 48&amp;nbsp;– quotation reads: &quot;the term 'North America' is mostly used to mean the United States and Canada together. Countries to the south of the United States are described as being in Central America (Mexico, Nicaragua, etc.) or South America (Brazil, Argentina, etc.)&quot;; see also: McArthur, Tom. 1992. &quot;North American.&quot; ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'' (ISBN 0-19-214183-X) New York: Oxford University Press, p. 707.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, usage sometimes includes Greenland&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAGreenland&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CountryReports&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eNotes&quot;/&gt; and Mexico (as in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]),&lt;ref name=Trilateral&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Region|url=http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;pid=12|publisher=The Trilateral Commission|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CountryReports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Countries in North America - Country Reports |url=http://www.countryreports.org/maps/northamerica.aspx |publisher=Country Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;epa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot; /&gt; as well as offshore islands.

In [[Ibero-America]] and other parts of Europe,{{Which|date=June 2011}} ''North America'' usually designates a subcontinent of the Americas containing Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and often Greenland, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, and Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;In Ibero-America, ''North America'' is considered a subcontinent containing Canada, the United States, Mexico, Greenland, Bermuda and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090130015145/http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html (Mexican version)] (archived from [http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html Norteamérica the original] on 30 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

North America has been historically referred to by other names. Spanish North America ([[New Spain]]) was often referred to as ''[[Northern America (disambiguation)|Northern America]]'', and this was the [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|first official name]] given to Mexico.&lt;ref name=AGN&gt;{{cite web|title=Acta Solmente de la Declaración de Independencia de la América Septentrional|url=http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/documentos.html|work=Archivos de la Independencia|publisher=Archivo General de la Nación|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of North America, going into the twentieth century, the whole American continent (North, Central and South America as well as the Caribbean) was referred simply as &quot;America&quot; or &quot;The Americas&quot;, one of the &quot;Five Continents&quot; (the other four being, Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Martin W. |last2=Wigen|first2=Kären |title=The myth of continents: a critique of metageography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C2as0sWxFBAC|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20743-1|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=C2as0sWxFBAC&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
