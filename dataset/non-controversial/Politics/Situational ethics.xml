      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16049">'''Situational ethics,''' or '''situation ethics,''' is a [[Christian Ethics|Christian ethical theory]] that was principally developed in the 1960s by the then Episcopal priest [[Joseph Fletcher]].  It basically states that sometimes other moral principles can be cast aside in certain situations if love is best served; as [[Paul Tillich]] once put it: &quot;Love is the ultimate law.&quot; The moral principles Fletcher is specifically referring to are the [[moral codes]] of Christianity and the type of love he is specifically referring to is [[Agapē|'αγαπη']] love. Agapē is a Greek term meaning love (sometimes translated as unconditional love). Fletcher believed that in forming an ethical system based on love, he was best expressing the notion of &quot;love thy neighbor,&quot; which [[Jesus Christ]] taught in the [[Gospels]] of the [[New Testament]] of the Bible. Through situational ethics, Fletcher attempted to find a &quot;middle road&quot; between [[Legalism (theology)|legalistic]] and [[antinomian]] ethics. Fletcher developed situational ethics in his books: ''The Classic Treatment'' and ''Situation Ethics''. 

Fletcher believed that there are no absolute laws other than the law of Agapē love and all the other laws were laid down in order to achieve the greatest amount of this love. This means that all the other laws are only guidelines to how to achieve this love, and thus they may be broken if the other course of action would result in more love.

Situational ethics is a [[teleology|teleological]], or [[consequentialism|consequential]] theory, in that it is concerned with the outcome or consequences of an action; the ''end''. In the case of situational ethics, the ends ''can'' justify the means or rules can be used to justify the means if a situation is not intrinsically bad.

==Ethical classification==
Because of its [[consequentialism]], situational ethics is often confused with [[utilitarianism]], because [[utilitarianism]]'s aim is '''''the greatest good for the greatest number''''', although situational ethics focuses more on creating the greatest amount of '''''love''''' and it also has different origins. Having said that, however, situational ethics can also be classed under the ethical theory genre of &quot;[[proportionalism]]&quot; which says that &quot;It is never right to go against a principle unless there is a proportionate reason which would justify it&quot; (''Hoose, 1987'').

==Fletcher's four examples==
Joseph Fletcher famously gave four situations as examples in which the established moral laws might need to be put on hold in order to achieve the greater amount of love. They were all either real situations, or based upon real situations; also he never gave any final judgment for these situations, but rather made people think about the best outcomes themselves.

Here are four cases adapted from Joseph Fletcher's ''Situation Ethics'':

===Himself Might his Quietus Make===
{{cquote|I dropped in on a patient at the hospital who explained that he only had a set time to live. The doctors could give him some pills (that would cost $40 every three days) that would keep him alive for the next three years, but if he didn't take the pills, he’d be dead within six months. Now he was [[insured]] for $100,000, [[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] and that was all the insurance he had. But if he took the pills and lived past next October when the insurance was up for renewal, they were bound to refuse the renewal, and his insurance would be canceled. So he told me that he was thinking that if he didn't take the pills, then his family would get left with some security, and asked my advice on the situation.}}
Pragmatism, positivism, relativism and personalism are the 4 working principles which mean to be reasonably sure the act you take will work and provide the most loving consequence, accepting Situational Ethics as a matter of faith and not reason, each situation must be relative to love and bring about the most loving result and finally the needs of people come first rather than a set of rules.

===Special Bombing Mission No. 13===
{{cquote|When the [[atomic bomb]] was dropped on [[Hiroshima]], the plane crew were silent. Captain Lewis uttered six words, &quot;My God, what have we done?&quot; Three days later another one fell on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. About 152,000 were killed, many times more were wounded and burned, to die later. The next day Japan sued for peace. When deciding whether to use &quot;the most terrible weapon ever known&quot; the [[Harry S. Truman|US President]] appointed an [[Interim Committee]] made up of distinguished and responsible people in the government. Most but not all of its military advisors favoured using it. Top-level scientists said they could find no acceptable alternative to using it, but they were opposed by equally able scientists. After lengthy discussions, the committee decided that the lives saved by ending the war swiftly by using this weapon outweighed the lives destroyed by using it and thought that the best course of action.}}

===Christian Cloak and Dagger===
{{cquote|I was reading &quot;Biblical Faith and Social Ethics&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/oct1960/v17-3-bookreview6.htm theologytoday.ptsem.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton Gardner's book on a shuttle plane to New York. Next to me sat a young woman of about twenty-eight or so, attractive and well turned out in expensive clothes of good taste. She showed some interest in my book, and I asked if she'd like to look at it. &quot;No&quot;, she said, &quot;I'd rather talk.&quot; What about? &quot;Me.&quot; I knew this meant good-bye to the reading. &quot;I have a problem I'm confused about. You might help me to decide,&quot; she explained... There was a war going on that her government believed could be stopped by some clever use of espionage and [[blackmail]]. However, this meant she had to [[seduction|seduce]] and sleep with an enemy spy in order to lure him into blackmail. Now this went against her morals, but if it brought the war to an end, saving thousands of lives, would it be worth breaking those standards?}}

===Sacrificial Adultery===
{{cquote|As the [[Russia]]n armies drove westward to meet the [[United States|Americans]] and British at the [[Elbe]], a [[Soviet]] [[patrol]] picked up a Mrs. Bergmeier [[foraging]] food for her three children. Unable even to get word to the children, she was taken off to a [[POW camp]] in Ukraine. Her husband had been captured in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and taken to a [[POW camp]] in Wales. When he was returned to Berlin, he spent months rounding up his children, although they couldn't find their mother. She more than anything else was needed to reconnect them as a family in that dire situation of hunger, chaos and [[fear]]. Meanwhile, in [[Ukraine]], Mrs. Bergmeier learned through a [[sympathy|sympathetic]] [[commandant]] that her husband and family were trying to keep together and find her. But the rules allowed them to release her to Germany only if she was pregnant, in which case she would be returned as a [[Wiktionary:liability|liability]]. She turned things over in her mind and finally asked a friendly [[Volga German]] camp guard to [[impregnate]] her, which he did. Her condition being medically verified, she was sent back to Berlin and to her family. They welcomed her with open arms, even when she told them how she had managed it. And when the child was born, they all loved him because of what they [sic] had done for them. After the [[infant baptism|christening]], they met up with their local pastor and discussed the [[morality]] of the situation.}}

These situations were criticised by many as being quite extreme, although [[Joseph Fletcher]] agreed that they were so, because in normal cases, the general guidelines should be applied and it is only in extreme cases that exceptions would need to be made.

==Situational ethics outlined==
[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] outlined his theory in ten principles, which he split into the four working principles and the six fundamental principles.

===The four working principles===
There are four presuppositions that Fletcher makes before setting out the situational ethics theory:
#'''[[Pragmatism]]''' - This is that the course of action must be practical and work
#'''[[Relativism]]''' - All situations are always relative; situational ethicists try to avoid such words as &quot;never&quot; and &quot;always&quot;
#'''[[Positivism]]''' - The whole of situational ethics relies upon the fact that the person freely chooses to believe in [[agape]] love as described by Christianity.
#'''[[Personalism]]''' - Whereas the legalist thinks people should work to laws, the situational ethicist believes that laws are for the benefit of the people.

===The six fundamental principles (propositions)===
; First proposition : Only one thing is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]]; namely [[greek words for love|love]]: nothing else at all. ''[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1963, pg56)''
; Second proposition : The ruling norm of Christian decision is [[greek words for love|love]]: nothing else. ''[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1963, pg69)''
; Third proposition : [[greek words for love|Love]] and [[Justice]] are the same, for [[justice]] is [[greek words for love|love]] distributed, nothing else. ''[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1963, pg87)
:[[Justice]] is Christian [[greek words for love|love]] using its head, calculating its [[duties]], [[obligations]], opportunities, [[factors of production|resources]]... [[Justice]] is [[Greek words for love|love]] coping with situations where distribution is called for. ''[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1963, pg95)''
; Fourth proposition : [[greek words for love|Love]] wills the neighbour's good, whether we like him or not. ''[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1963, pg103)''
; Fifth proposition : Only [[the ends justify the means|the end justifies the means]], nothing else. Actions only acquire moral status as a means to an end; for Fletcher, the end must be the most loving result. When measuring a situation, one must consider the desired end, the means available, the motive for acting and the foreseeable consequences. '' [[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1963, pg120)''
; Sixth proposition : [[Greek words for love|Love's]] decisions are made situationally, not prescriptively. ''[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher]] (1963, pg134)''

==Biblical links==
As a priest, [[Joseph Fletcher]] claimed situational ethics to be a true set of Christian morals that tie in with [[Biblical]] teaching. However, not all people agree with him on this, so here are some passages of relevant [[bible|biblical scripture]] (from the [[New International Version]]), and it is left to the reader as to whether the teachings of situational ethics are [[Biblical]] or not.

===Jesus in relation to The Law and The Prophets===
&quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish [[torah|the Law]] or [[Old testament|the Prophets]]; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until [[Heaven#In Protestant Christianity|Heaven]] and [[Earth]] disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of [[heaven#In Protestant Christianity|Heaven]], but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of [[heaven#In Protestant Christianity|Heaven]].&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''[[gospel of matthew|Matthew]] 5:17-19'')

===The Greatest Commandment===
&quot;One of...[the [[Pharisees]]], an expert in [[torah|the law]], tested Him with this question: '[[rabbi|Teacher]], which is the greatest [[ten commandments|commandment]] in the [[torah|Law]]?' Jesus replied: '[[ten commandments|'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.']] This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: [[ten commandments|'Love your neighbour as yourself.']] All the [[torah|Law]] and [[Old Testament|Prophets]] hang on these two [[ten commandments|commandments]].'&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''[[gospel of matthew|Matthew]] 22:35-40'')

&quot;One of the [[rabbi|teachers]] of [[torah|the law]] came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked Him, 'Of all the [[ten commandments|commandments]], which is the most important?' 'The most important one', answered Jesus, 'is this: [[ten commandments|'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your mind and with all your strength.']] The second is this: [[ten commandments|'Love your neighbour as yourself.']] There is no [[ten commandments|commandment]] greater than these.' 'Well said, [[rabbi|teacher]]', the man replied. 'You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.' When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, 'You are not far from the [[kingdom of God]].'...&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''[[gospel of mark|Mark]] 12:28-34'')

===Lord of the Sabbath===
{{main|Lord of the Sabbath}}
&quot;Then He said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath...'&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''[[gospel of mark|Mark]] 2:27'')

===Jesus at a Pharisee's House===
&quot;One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent [[Pharisee]], He was being carefully watched. There in front of Him was a man suffering from [[dropsy]]. Jesus asked the [[Pharisees]] and experts in [[torah|the law]], 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?' But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, He healed him and sent him away. Then He asked them, 'If one of you has a son or an [[ox]] that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?' And they had nothing to say.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''[[gospel of luke|Luke]] 14:1-6'')

===The relationship between Love and the Law===
&quot;The Law by itself was unable to save anyone since no one was capable of its fulfilment. Thus the Law served (initially) only to increase sin since it posed many rules available to be broken. However, it was through the Law (rather than by the Law) that the possibility of salvation would come. One man, came and fulfilled the Law. This righteousness was imputed to some through faith, which altered their eternal destiny. Now sure of a right relationship with God, and with knowledge of God's eternal promise, they were free to enter into a genuinely loving relationship with God, and they love God by loving others.&quot;{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Paul talks about freedom we have in grace===
&quot;For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love... You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love. The entire law is summed up in a single command: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.'&quot;&lt;br&gt;
