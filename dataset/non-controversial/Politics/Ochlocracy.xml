'''Ochlocracy''' ({{lang-el|ὀχλοκρατία}}, ''okhlokratía''; {{lang-la|ochlocratia}}) or '''mob rule''' is [[government]] by mob or a mass of people, or the [[intimidation]] of legitimate authorities.
As a pejorative for [[majoritarianism]], it is akin to the [[Latin]] phrase '''''mobile vulgus''''' meaning &quot;the fickle crowd&quot;, from which the English term &quot;mob&quot; was originally derived in the [[Glorious Revolution|1680s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ochlocracy (&quot;rule of the general populace&quot;) is [[democracy]] (&quot;rule of the people&quot;) spoiled by [[demagoguery]], &quot;[[tyranny of the majority]]&quot; and the rule of passion over reason, just like [[oligarchy]] (&quot;rule of a few&quot;) is [[aristocracy]] (&quot;rule of the best&quot;) spoiled by [[Political corruption|corruption]], and [[tyranny]] is [[monarchy]] spoiled by lack of [[virtue]]. Ochlocracy is synonymous in meaning and usage to the modern, informal term &quot;[[wikt:mobocracy|Mobocracy]],&quot; which emerged from a much more recent colloquial etymology.

==Terminology==
The term appears to have been coined by [[Polybius]] in his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' (6.4.6).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He uses it to name the 'pathological' version of popular rule in opposition to the good version, which he refers to as democracy. There are numerous mentions of the word &quot;ochlos&quot; in the [[Talmud]] (where &quot;ochlos&quot; refers to anything from &quot;mob,&quot; &quot;populace&quot; to &quot;armed guard&quot;), as well as in [[Rashi]], a Jewish commentary on the Bible. The word is recorded in English since 1584, derived from the French ''ochlocratie'' (1568), which stems from the original Greek ''okhlokratia'', from ''okhlos'' &quot;mob&quot; and ''kratos'' &quot;rule, power, strength&quot;

In ancient Greek political thought ochlocracy was considered as one of the three &quot;bad&quot; forms of government ([[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]] and ochlocracy) as opposed to the three &quot;good&quot; forms of government ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[democracy]]). The distinction between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; was made according to whether the government form would act in the interest of the whole community (&quot;good&quot;) or the exclusive interests of a group or individual at the expense of justice (&quot;bad&quot;).

An '''ochlocrat''' is one who is an advocate or partisan of ochlocracy. It can also be used as an adjective
('''ochlocratic''' or '''ochlocratical''').

The threat of &quot;mob rule&quot; to a [[democracy]] is restrained by ensuring that the [[rule of law]] protects [[minority group|minorities]] or individuals against short-term [[demagoguery]] or [[moral panic]]. Though considering how laws in a democracy are established or repealed by the majority, the rule of law's protection of minorities is questionable.

==Mobs in history==
Historians{{Who|date=January 2012}} often comment on mob rule as a factor in the [[rise of Rome]] and its maintenance,{{Dubious|date=January 2012}} as the city of [[Rome]] itself was large—between 100,000 and 250,000 citizens—while the [[aristocracy]] and even [[military]] was very small by comparison to the citizenry.{{Vague|date=January 2012}} Lapses in this control often led to loss of power, or even the loss of heads, of officials—most notably in the reign of [[Commodus]] when [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander|Cleander]] unwisely used the [[Praetorian Guard]] against a mob which had come to call for his head. As [[Edward Gibbon]] relates it,

{{quotation|The people... demanded with angry clamors the head of the public enemy. Cleander, who commanded the Praetorian Guards, ordered a body of [[cavalry]] to sally forth and disperse the seditious multitude. The multitude fled with precipitation towards the city; several were slain, and many more were trampled to death; but when the cavalry entered the streets their pursuit was checked by a shower of stones and darts from the roofs and windows of the houses. The foot guards, who had long been jealous of the prerogatives and insolence of the Praetorian cavalry, embraced the party of the people. The tumult became a regular engagement and threatened a general massacre. The Praetorians at length gave way, oppressed with numbers; and the tide of popular fury returned with redoubled violence against the gates of the palace, where Commodus lay dissolved in luxury and alone unconscious of the [[civil war]]... Commodus started from his dream of pleasure and commanded that the head of Cleander should be thrown out to the people. The desired spectacle instantly appeased the tumult...{{cite quote|date=November 2012}}}}

This followed a previous incident in which the [[List of Roman legions|legions of Britain]] had demanded and received the death of [[Perennis]], the prior administrator. The mob thus realized that it had every chance of success.

The [[Salem Witch Trials]], in which the unified belief of the townspeople overpowered the logic of the law, has also been cited as an example of mob rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amath.colorado.edu/carnegie/lit/lynch/mobrule.htm Mob Rule and Violence in American Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, [[Abraham Lincoln]] wrote about [[lynching]] and &quot;the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country—the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicreader.com/book/3237/12/ Opposition to Mob-Rule.] The Writings of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobs used to affect policy==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2009}}

The modern theories of [[civil disobedience]] and ''[[satyagraha]]'' can be differentiated from &quot;mob rule&quot; and its mechanics, as these approaches forego the use of violence and force that the mob of ancient times employed.

Traditional non-violent protest theory holds that if the demonstrators are restrained and do not do any violence, yet refuse to back down, then they could conceivably win, as they either will be joined by the forces they face, be allowed to defy the law or government openly and peacefully, or be physically attacked, struck down, and made into powerful moral symbols of the lengths to which the agents of the state will go to enforce its laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html] ''[[From Dictatorship to Democracy]]'' by [[Gene Sharp]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, police forces around the world have become adept at making such gatherings irrelevant by limiting them to areas, in some cases dubbed &quot;[[free speech zones]],&quot; sufficiently separate from the object of their discontent, the rest of the public, and the media, to make them easily ignored. Permitting requirements in many jurisdictions effectively make demonstrations without advance police permission illegal. Various efforts to increase demonstrators' communal intelligence and mobility using cell phone networks and bicycles have been employed to circumvent crowd control and marginalizing techniques. [[Flash mob]]s and [[Critical Mass]] style &quot;bike block&quot; actions are examples experimented with, with mixed results, notably during the [[2004 Republican National Convention protest activity|2004 Republican National Convention]].

Modern theory concludes that since Roman guards, facing [[crucifixion]] for disobedience, could be swayed by mobs, it is also possible to sway modern [[police]], even in a [[police state]]. The [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]] in the Philippines, the [[Velvet Revolution]] in former [[Czechoslovakia]], and the resistance to [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|the attempted military coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 that led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of that state, are situations where it is possible that it was the &quot;mob&quot; which won the day due to defections by authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html] ''[[From Dictatorship to Democracy]]'' by [[Gene Sharp]]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of political pressure put on by a large amassed group of people was also frequently demonstrated in the [[Arab Spring]], which contributed to swift political change in countries as [[Tunisia]], [[Egypt]], and [[Libya]].
