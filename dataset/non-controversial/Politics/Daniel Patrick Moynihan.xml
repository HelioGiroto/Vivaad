'''Daniel Patrick Moynihan''' (March 16, 1927 – March 26, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[sociologist]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was first elected to the [[United States Senate]] for [[New York]] in 1976, and was re-elected three times (in 1982, 1988, and 1994). He declined to run for re-election in 2000. Prior to his years in the Senate, Moynihan was the United States' Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] and to [[India]], and was a member of four successive [[President of the United States|presidential]] administrations, beginning with the administration of [[John F. Kennedy]], and continuing through that of [[Gerald Ford]].

==Early life and education==
Moynihan was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the son of Margaret Ann (née Phipps), a homemaker, and John Henry Moynihan, a reporter for a daily newspaper in Tulsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=iP0ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=tulsa+John+Henry+Moynihan&amp;dq=tulsa+John+Henry+Moynihan&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=IZIMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=tulsa+John+Henry+Moynihan&amp;dq=tulsa+John+Henry+Moynihan&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] at the age of six. Brought up in a poor neighborhood, he shined shoes, attended various [[Public education|public]], private, and [[parochial school]]s, and ultimately graduated from [[Benjamin Franklin High School (New York, New York)|Benjamin Franklin High School]] in [[East Harlem]]. He was a parishioner of [[St. Raphael's Church (New York City)]], [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen / Clinton]], and also cast his first vote in that church.&lt;ref name=organ&gt;[http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/SSCyrilMethodius.html NYC Organ History Website] (Accessed 24 Jan 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
He and his brother, Michael Willard Moynihan, spent most of their childhood summers at his grandfather's farm in [[Bluffton, Indiana]]. After high school, Moynihan worked as a [[longshoreman]] before entering [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), which at that time provided free [[higher education]].

After a year at CCNY, he joined the [[United States Navy]], receiving [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12]] officer training at [[Tufts University]], where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] He was on active duty from 1944 to 1947, last serving as [[Gun|gunnery officer]] of the [[USS Quirinus (ARL-39)|USS ''Quirinus'']]. He received an [[masters degree|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in sociology from the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], also at Tufts. Moynihan then studied as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellow]] at the [[London School of Economics]]. Many years later, he received an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from Tufts.

==Political career==
Moynihan's political career started in the 1950s when he served as a member of New York governor [[W. Averell Harriman|Averell Harriman]]'s staff, a stint which ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Two years later, Moynihan was a delegate to the  [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.

===Assistant Secretary of Labor; controversy over the War on Poverty===
Moynihan was an [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for policy in the Kennedy Administration and in the early part of the [[Lyndon Johnson]] Administration. In that capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities, allowing him to devote all of his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. He had a small staff including Paul Barton, Ellen Broderick, and [[Ralph Nader]] (who at 29 years of age, hitchhiked to [[Washington, D.C.]] and got a job working for Moynihan in 1963).

They took inspiration from the book ''Slavery'' written by [[Stanley Elkins]]. Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that that dependence still existed a century later.  This supported the concept that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority but must also &quot;act affirmatively&quot; in order to counter the problem.

Moynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.

Moynihan issued his research under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm Moynihan's War on Poverty report]&lt;/ref&gt; fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks.  Critics on the left attacked it as &quot;[[Victim blaming|blaming the victim]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The National Review''; March 27, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; a slogan coined by psychologist William Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;See William Ryan, ''Blaming the Victim,'' Random House, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists&lt;ref&gt;Graebner, William. &quot;The End of Liberalism: Narrating Welfare's Decline, from the Moynihan Report (1965) to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (1996)&quot;, ''Journal of Policy History'', Vol. 14, Number 2, 2002, pp. 170–190&lt;/ref&gt; because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan's warnings, the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if the &quot;Man [was] out of the house.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} (See [[Man out of the house (welfare rule)]].)  Critics said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house. Moynihan supported [[Richard Nixon]]'s idea of a [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI). Daniel Patrick Moynihan had significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B. Long]] and [[Louis O. Kelso]].

After the 1994 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] sweep of Congress, Moynihan agreed that correction was needed for a welfare system that possibly encouraged women to raise their children without fathers: &quot;The Republicans are saying we have a helluva problem, and we do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time1994&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard|last=Lacayo|title= Down on the Downtrodden |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982006,00.html |publisher=''Time Magazine'' |date=December 19, 1994 |accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local New York City politics and academic career===
By the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]], Moynihan was politically supporting [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]]. He then became Director of the [[Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]]. With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, &quot;a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements&quot; descided to &quot;call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [http://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that the next administration would have to be able to unite the nation again.

===Nixon Administration===
Connecting with [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968, Moynihan joined Nixon's [[White House Staff]] as [[Counselor to the President]] for Urban Affairs. He was very influential at that time, and was one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies.

In 1969, on the initiative of Nixon, [[NATO]] tried to establish a third civil column, establishing a hub of research and initiatives in the civil area, dealing as well with environmental topics.&lt;ref name= &quot;Hüne&quot;/&gt; Moynihan&lt;ref name= &quot;Hüne&quot;/&gt; named [[Acid Rain]] and the [[Greenhouse effect]] as suitable international challenges to be dealt by NATO. NATO was chosen, since the organization had suitable expertise in the field, as well as experience with international research coordination. The German government was skeptical and saw the initiative as an attempt by the US to regain international terrain after the lost [[Vietnam War]]. The topics gained momentum in civil conferences and institutions.&lt;ref name= &quot;Hüne&quot;&gt;Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), [[Kai F. Hünemörder]], Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN 3-515-08188-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Moynihan wrote a memo to President Nixon saying, &quot;The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect.' The subject has been too much talked about. The forum has been too much taken over to hysterics, paranoids, and boodlers on all sides. We need a period in which [[Negro]] progress continues and racial rhetoric fades.&quot;[http://www.aol.bartleby.com/73/1579.html] He argued that Nixon's conservative tactics (particularly the speeches of Vice-President [[Spiro Agnew]]) were playing into the hands of radicals. Moynihan regretted that critics misinterpreted his memo as advocating that the government should neglect minorities.

===UN Ambassador===
Nixon appointed Moynihan as [[United States Ambassador to India]], where he served from 1973 to 1975. The relationship between the two countries was at a low point. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian rupees to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, which is equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Rupee Deal&quot; is logged in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him as the [[United States Ambassador to United Nations]] (UN), serving a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in 1976. As ambassador, Moynihan took a hardline [[anti-communist]] stance, in line with the agenda of the White House at the time. He was also consistently a strong supporter of [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0694/9406044.html Daniel Moynihan], WRMEA.&lt;/ref&gt; condemning the 1975 UN resolution that declared [[Zionism]] to be a form of [[racism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 320&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 320|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Ambassador to the UN from June 1975 until February 1976.

Perhaps the most controversial action of Moynihan's career was his response, as Ambassador to the UN, to the [[Indonesia]]n invasion of [[East Timor]] in 1975. [[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000–200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger.&lt;ref name=CAVR&gt;[http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm Chega! The CAVR Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/updateFiles/english/CONFLICT-RELATED%20DEATHS.pdf Conflict-Related Deaths In Timor-Leste: 1974-1999] CAVR&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Moynihan wrote:

{{quote|The United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring this about. The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dangerous Place'', Little Brown, 1980, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Later, he said he had defended a &quot;shameless&quot; Cold War policy toward East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;p. 153, ''Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics'', Oxford University Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moynihan's thinking began to change during his tenure at the UN In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms.  He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline.  He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.

Nevertheless, for the duration of his tenure as ambassador, Moynihan continued his hardline rhetoric, which he describes in ''Pandaemonium'' as extreme: &quot;I became something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.&quot;

===Career in the Senate===
In 1976, Moynihan was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], [[Ramsey Clark]], [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=26 &quot;The History of the Fisc&quot;], on the Fisc Report website. Retrieved 2010-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;). Moynihan's strong support for Israel while UN Ambassador may have increased support for him among the state's [[Jewish]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/daniel-patrick-moynihan Daniel Patrick Moynihan], Oxford University Press Political Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moynihan's strong advocacy for New York's interests in the Senate, buttressed by the ''Fisc'' reports and recalling his strong advocacy for US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once &quot;slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan’s office after a long day to discuss their shared interest in [[urban renewal]] over a glass of port.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2010/06/02/pages/3628/index.xml?page=2&amp; &quot;Uncivil society: Jim Leach ’64 leads an effort to restore respectful discourse to our national life, but it’s tough going&quot;], by Mark F. Bernstein, ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'', June 2, 2010. Retrieved 2010-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moynihan continued to be interested in foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the Select Committee on Intelligence. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration's hawkish [[Cold War]] policies, such as support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere.  He suggested the U.S.S.R. was suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986 editorial in the ''[[New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union.  He blasted the Reagan Administration's &quot;consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism – which is not in fact going on.&quot; In a September 8, 1990 letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: &quot;I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the cold war. Huge changes took place, some of which we hardly notice.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]]. [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/ikes-last-stand/the-other-eisenhowers/ The Other Eisenhowers], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Moynihan introduced Section 1706 of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], which cost certain professionals (like computer programmers, engineers, draftspersons, and designers) who depended on intermediary agencies (consulting firms) a self-employed tax status option, but other professionals (like accountants and lawyers) continued to enjoy Section 530 exemptions from payroll taxes. This change in the tax code was expected to offset the tax revenue losses of other legislation that Moynihan proposed to change the law of foreign taxes of Americans working abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/nyregion/new-tax-law-threatens-high-tech-consultants.html?scp=5&amp;sq=%22Section%201706%22&amp;st=cse &quot;New Tax Law threatens high-tech consultants&quot;] by Karla Jennings, ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1987 (p. 11 in paper).

Retrieved 2010-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Moynihan was one of the Democrats to support the ban on the procedure known as [[partial-birth abortion]]. He said of the procedure: &quot;I think this is just too close to [[infanticide]]. A child has been born and it has exited the [[uterus]]. What on Earth is this procedure?&quot; Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue. He challenged them saying, &quot;you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on [[abortion]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Human Life Review'', Summer 2003, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter4: Too close to infanticide [http://books.google.com/books?id=WS7IqNEKUFQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT51#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false GB link] at [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]], in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that &quot;there is no health care crisis in this country.&quot;

He voted against the [[death penalty]], the [[flag desecration amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]], the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[Communications Decency Act]], and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]]. Moynihan surprised many in 1991 when he voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]]. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he surprised many people again by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.

==Public speaker==
Moynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, in the form of slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels for emphasis.  Linguist Geoff Nunberg compared his speaking style to that of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|title=William F.

==Commission on Government Secrecy==
{{Main|Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy}}

In the Post–[[Cold War]] Era, the 103rd Congress enacted legislation directing an inquiry into the uses of government secrecy. Moynihan chaired the Commission. The Committee studied and made recommendations on the &quot;culture of secrecy&quot; that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.

The Committee's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.

After release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794 Secrecy: The American Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.

==Career as scholar==
In addition to his career as a politician and a diplomat, Moynihan worked as a [[sociologist]]. He was Director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], as well as a Fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]] from 1964 to 1967. In magazines such as ''Commentary'' and ''The Public Interest'', he published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].

Moynihan coined the term &quot;professionalization of reform,&quot; by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his 1971 return to Harvard, having served two years in the Nixon White House as Counselor to the President, Moynihan became a professor in the Department of Government. In 1983 he was awarded the [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] Award given by the [[American Political Science Association]] &quot;in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He wrote 19 books, leading his personal friend, columnist and former professor [[George F. Will]], to remark that Dr. Moynihan &quot;wrote more books than most senators have read.&quot; He also joined the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] as a [[public administration]] faculty after retiring from the Senate.

Moynihan's scholarly accomplishments led [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], writing in the ''Almanac of American Politics'' to describe the senator as &quot;the nation's best thinker among politicians since [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and its best politician among thinkers since [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics 2000 |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone |coauthors=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |publisher=National Journal |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |pages=1090–1091 |quote=Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson, now approaches the end of a long career in public office. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moynihan's 1993 article, &quot;Defining Deviancy Down&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The American Scholar'', vol. 62, no. 1, winter 1993, pp. 17–3&lt;/ref&gt; was notably controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm Defining Deviancy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/defining_deviancy_down_daniel_patrick_moynihan Defining Deviancy down]&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;I don't think there's any point in being Irish if you don't know that the world is going to break your heart eventually. I guess that we thought we had a little more time.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;– Reacting to the [[assassination]] of [[John F. Kennedy]], November 1963

*&quot;No one is innocent after the experience of governing. But not everyone is guilty.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;– ''The Politics of a Guaranteed Income'', 1973

*&quot;Secrecy is for losers. For people who do not know how important the information really is.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;– ''Secrecy: The American Experience'', 1998

*&quot;The issue of race could benefit from a period of benign neglect.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;– Memo to President [[Richard Nixon]]

*&quot;Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.&quot; – quoted in [[Robert Sobel]]'s review of ''Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies'', edited by Mark C. Carnes

*(In response to the question: &quot;Why should I work if I am going to just end up emptying slop jars?&quot;) &quot;That's a complaint you hear mostly from people who don't empty slop jars. This country has a lot of people who do exactly that for a living. And they do it well. It's not pleasant work, but it's a living. And it has to be done. Somebody has to go around and empty all those bed pans. And it's perfectly honorable work. There's nothing the matter with doing it. Indeed, there is a lot that is right about doing it, as any hospital patient will tell you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = |title = In Their Own Words | publisher = US News and World Report | date = May 26-June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question is, how come the United States can grow food and you can't?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;– speaking to Third World countries about global famine&lt;ref&gt;Frances Moore Lappe and Joseph Collins. ''Food First:  Beyond the Myth of Scarcity'' Chapter 12: Why Can't People Feed Themselves?&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society.  The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.&quot;
