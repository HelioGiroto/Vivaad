The '''marriage gap''' describes observed economic and political disparities between those who are [[Marriage|married]] and those who are [[Single person|single]]. The marriage gap can be compared to, and should not be confused with, the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]].&lt;ref&gt;National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and marriage==
As part of the marriage gap, unmarried people are &quot;considerably more liberal&quot; than married people.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAES&quot;&gt;NAES.&lt;/ref&gt;  With little variation between professed [[moderates]], married people respond to be [[Conservatism|conservative]] 9 percent more, and single people respond to be [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] 10 percent more.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. Definitions of ''moderate'', ''conservative'', and ''liberal'' were not given.&lt;/ref&gt;
Married people tend to hold political opinions that differ from those of people who have never married.

===Party affiliation in the United States===
In the U.S., being a married woman is correlated with a higher level of support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and being single with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. There is no significant difference between married people. 32 percent of married people call themselves Republicans and 31 percent say they are Democrats&lt;!-- I think this is not a difference --&gt;, while among single people, 19 percent are Republicans and 38 percent Democrats&lt;!-- This is a difference --&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAES&quot;/&gt;  The difference is most striking between married and single women.  Married women respond as being Republicans 15 percent more; single women respond as being Democrats 11 percent more.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political issues===
The marriage gap is evident on a range of political issues in the [[United States]]:
*[[same-sex marriage]], 11% more married people favor Constitutional amendments disallowing it&lt;ref name=&quot;NAES&quot;/&gt;
*[[abortion]], 14% more married people favor completely banning it&lt;ref name=&quot;NAES&quot;/&gt;
*[[school vouchers]], 3% more married people favor them&lt;ref name=&quot;NAES&quot;/&gt;

==Marriage and cohabitation==
It is not clear that legally or religiously formalized marriages are associated with better outcomes than long-term cohabitation. Part of the issue is that in many western countries, married couples will have cohabited before marrying, so that the stability of the resulting marriage might be attributable to the cohabitation having worked.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Because we now have the acceptance of long-term cohabitation, people who go into marriage and stay in marriage are a more homogenous group. They are people who believe in certain things that contribute to stability. So the selection effect is really important. Yes, it's true that married couples on average stay together longer than cohabiting couples. But cohabitation is such an unhelpful word, because it covers a whole ragbag of relationships, so it's not really comparable. We're better off talking about formal and informal marriages: those that have legal certificates, and those that don't. Is there any difference between a formal and informal marriage? If we really compare like with like, I'm not sure you'd see much difference.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Penny Mansfield quoted in the [http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/jul/14/comment.uknews Guardian of  17-7-2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpreting the data==

The marriage gap is susceptible to multiple interpretations because it is not clear to what
extent it is attributable to [[Correlation does not imply causation|causation]] and what to [[correlation]]. It may be that people who already have a number of positive indicators of future wellbeing in terms of wealth and education are more likely to get married.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The distinction between correlation and causation cuts to the heart of the debate about marriage. The evidence is unequivocal; children raised by married couples are healthier, do better at school, commit fewer crimes, go further in education, report higher levels of wellbeing. It is easy for politicians to deduce - and assert - that married couples therefore produce superior children. But the children do not necessarily do better because their parents are married and there is actually very little evidence that marriage alone, in the absence of anything else, benefits children.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Mansfield of quoted in the [http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/jul/14/comment.uknews Guardian of  17-7-2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
