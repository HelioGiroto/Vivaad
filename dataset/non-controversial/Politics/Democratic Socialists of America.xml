'''Democratic Socialists of America''' ('''DSA''') is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and [[social democracy|social-democratic]] organization in the [[United States]] and the U.S. affiliate of the [[Socialist International]], an international federation of social-democratic, democratic socialist and [[Labour movement|labor]] political parties and organizations.

DSA was formed in 1982 by a merger of the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) and the [[New American Movement]] (NAM).  Under the leadership of [[Michael Harrington]], DSOC had become America's largest democratic socialist organization, despite having started, in Harrington's words, as &quot;the remnant of a remnant&quot;—with Harrington having been the leader of a minority caucus of the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1972.  At that time the SPA split three ways, The left group remained with the Socialist Party, the center group would become the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee and the right group would become the [[Social Democrats,&amp;nbsp;USA]] (SDUSA).&lt;!--  by a vote of 73 to 34 --&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;

Initially the DSA consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members. Upon the DSA's founding, [[Michael Harrington]] and [[Socialist feminism|socialist-feminist]] author [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] were elected as co-chairs of the organization.

According to Maria Svart, then national director of the DSA, the group has its roots in the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] of [[Eugene Debs]] and [[Norman Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/12165/lets_talk_democratic_socialism_already/| author=Maria Svart| title=Let’s Talk Democratic Socialism, Already| publisher=In These Times| date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that the DSA's strategy of primarily working within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] has been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://links.org.au/node/2615| author=Dan La Botz| title=United States: Occupy the Democratic Party?

{{Further|History of the socialist movement in the United States}}
The DSA was formed in 1982 after a merger between the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC) and the [[New American Movement]] (NAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2002 | author=Hunt, E.K. | title=Property and Prophets: The Evolution of Economic Institutions and Ideologi | pages=260–261 | publisher=M.E.

Retrieved November 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At its start, DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board; approximately 200 had previously had membership in [[Social&amp;nbsp;Democrats,&amp;nbsp;USA]] or its predecessors&lt;!--  (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max_Shachtman.2C_Civil_Rights.2C_and_the_War_on_Poverty|Socialist&amp;nbsp;Party Social&amp;nbsp;Democratic Federation]], &quot;formerly the Socialist Party,&amp;nbsp;USA&quot;), --&gt; in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|O'Rourke|1993|pp=195–196}}: &lt;p&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Rourke|first=William|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5iUJfPxlTCcC&amp;pg=PA195|chapter=L: Michael Harrington|title=Signs of the literary times: Essays, reviews, profiles, 1970-1992'|pages=192–196|publisher=SUNY Press|series=The Margins of Literature (SUNY Series)|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1681-X|id={{ISBN-13|9780791416815}}|ref=harv}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

In electoral politics, DSA, like DSOC before it, was very strongly associated with [[Michael Harrington]]'s position that &quot;the left wing of realism is found today in the Democratic Party.&quot; In its early years DSA opposed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates by giving critical support to Democratic&amp;nbsp;Party nominees like [[Walter Mondale]] in 1984.&lt;ref name = &quot;Davis&quot;&gt;Mike Davis, ''Prisoners of the American Dream: Politics and Economy in the History of the US Working Class.'' London: Verso; pp. 256-260, 275-276.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, DSA enthusiastically supported Jackson's second presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Manning Marable, ''Beyond Black and White: Transforming African-American Politics.'' London: Verso, 1996; pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; DSA's position on US electoral politics states that &quot;democratic socialists reject an either–or approach to electoral&amp;nbsp;coalition building, focused solely on [either] a new party or on realignment within the Democratic Party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/about/where.html#elect &quot;Where We Stand: The Political Perspective of the Democratic Socialists of America,&quot;] section 5. dsausa.org Retrieved March 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, DSA gave the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] an overall rating of C-, &quot;less than satisfactory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.dsausa.org/news/repcard.html &quot;Progressive Groups Issue Report Card on Clinton.&quot;] dsausa.org, Retrieved November 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSA's leadership believes working within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is necessary because of the nature of the American political system, which rarely gives [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] a chance politically. That said, DSA is very critical of the corporate-funded Democratic Party leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsausa.org/dl/sum2k/01.html &quot;Electoral Politics As Tactic — Elections Statement 2000.&quot;] dsausa.org Retrieved November 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization believes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Much of progressive, independent political action will continue to occur in Democratic Party primaries in support of candidates who represent a broad progressive coalition. In such instances, democratic socialists will support coalitional campaigns based on labor, women, people of color and other potentially anti-corporate elements... Electoral tactics are only a means for democratic socialists; the building of a powerful anti-corporate coalition is the end...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsausa.org/about/where.html &quot;Where We Stand — The Political Perspective of the Democratic Socialists of America.&quot;] dsausa.org Retrieved November 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Electoral positions===

In 2000, DSA took no official position on the [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential election]], with several prominent DSA members backing [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]].

In 2004, the organization backed [[John Kerry]] after he won the Democratic nomination. In its official magazine the DSA's [[Political Action Committee]] declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;While we have no illusions about how a Kerry administration would govern — absent mass pressure from below — and are not impressed with his delayed criticism of the war and his earlier commitments in favor of 'free trade,' we also realize that the Bush administration is as reactionary as Reagan’s. A Kerry defeat would be taken not as a defeat of the US political center, which Kerry represents, but of the mainstream Left. As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan’s]] 1984 defeat of [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] did. On the other hand, a Kerry victory will let us press onward, with progressives aggressively pressuring an administration that owed its victory to democratic mobilization from below.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/dl/DLFall2004.pdf &quot;DSA PAC Statement on Kerry Campaign,&quot;] ''Democratic Left,'' vol. 32, no. 4 (Fall 2004), pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only resolution on upcoming elections at the DSA's 2005 convention focused on [[Bernie Sanders]]' independent campaign for the [[U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/dl/Winter_2006.pdf  &quot;Convention Resolution: DSA Priorities,&quot;] ''Democratic Left,'' vol. 33 no.3 (Winter 2006), page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's 2007 convention in Atlanta, Georgia featured record-breaking attendance and more participation by the organization's youth wing.  The convention was highlighted by a keynote address from Senator Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hirsch, [http://www.dsausa.org/dl/Winter_2008.pdf  &quot;Economic Justice Agenda Adopted,&quot;] ''Democratic Left,'' vol. 35 no.3 (Winter 2008), page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the DSA supported Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] in his race against Republican candidate [[John McCain]]. Following Obama's election, many on the right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/08/inyti-peppers-obama-with_n_172883.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Jason | last=Linkins | title=&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;NYT&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Peppers Obama With Questions About Socialism | date=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to allege that the policies of his administration may be &quot;socialistic,&quot; a claim rejected by DSA and the Obama administration alike. The widespread use of the word &quot;socialism&quot; as a political [[epithet]] against the Obama government by its opponents caused National Director [[Frank Llewellyn]] to declare that &quot;over the past 12 months, the Democratic Socialists of America has received more media attention than it has over the past 12 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Llewellyn and Joseph Schwartz, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-perspec1101socialismnov01,0,5511171.story &quot;Socialists Say: Obama is No Socialist,&quot;] ''Chicago Tribune,'' November 1, 2009. Retrieved November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership size ===
[[File:Democratic Socialists Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Members march at the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest on September 17, 2011]]
Membership in DSA is obtained through the payment of annual dues, which in 2010 range from a &quot;low income and student&quot; rate of $20 to a &quot;sustainer&quot; rate of $130, with a basic rate of $45.&lt;ref name=&quot;Join&quot;&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/join/index.html &quot;Join Us,&quot;] dsausa.org Retrieved September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Every member receives a paid subscription to the organization's quarterly newsletter, ''Democratic Left'' (commonly known as ''DL'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/dl/Winter_2010.pdf &quot;Change the USA! Join the DSA!&quot;] ''Democratic Left,'' vol. 37, no. 3 (Winter 2009), page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also offers &quot;family memberships&quot; at the rate of $80, which include only one subscription to ''DL,''&lt;ref name=&quot;Join&quot; /&gt; and sells subscriptions to the publication to non-members for $10 per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;W09&quot;&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/dl/Winter_2010.pdf &quot;Change the USA!

When formed, the estimated membership was 5,000, after the merger with the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Haer, John |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=QwgOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5206,38030&amp;dq=democratic+socialists+of+america+democratic-socialists-of-america&amp;hl=en |title=Reviving Socialism |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' |date=May 1, 1982 |accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the membership had grown to an estimate 7,000 in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Oreskes, Michael |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/04/us/jackson-to-shun-socialist-backing.html |title=Jackson to Shun Socialist Backing |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=December 4, 1987 |accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Fox News]] claimed there were 8,000 members in the organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Baker, Harlan |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,65995,00.html |title=Group Accuses Socialists of Voter Fraud |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=October 17, 2002 |accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three years later the DSA announced on its website that its membership had increased by some 13% since July 2003 as the result of a recent direct mail campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.dsausa.org/LatestNews/2005/DSA%20membership%20grows.html |title=Direct Mail Yields Membership Increase |publisher=Democratic Socialists of America |date=August 6, 2005 |accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DSA does not release annual membership numbers, nor do officials of the organization state them with precision in the press. It does, however, publish annually its sworn declaration of &quot;Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation&quot; in its official magazine so as to qualify for subsidized postage rates from the [[United States Postal Service]]. In the 12 months previous to its 2009 declaration, the group indicates that ''Democratic Left'' had an average &quot;Total Paid Distribution&quot; of 5707 copies.

The &quot;Total Paid Distribution&quot; numbers of ''Democratic Left'' over recent years are as follows:

=== Structure ===
DSA is organized at the local level, and works with [[Trade union|labor union]]s, community organizations, and campus activists on issues of common interest. Nationwide campaigns are coordinated by the organization's national office in [[New York City]].  {{As of|2006}}, the DSA website lists 24 chartered locals.

Governance of the DSA is by the group's National Political Committee, which, since 2001, has been a 16-person body.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Convention 2003,&quot; ''Democratic Left,'' vol. 31, no. 3 (Winter 2003-04), pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's constitution states that at least eight of the NPC's members shall be women and at least four members of &quot;racial or national&quot; minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DSA Constitution and By-laws,&quot; Article VIII, Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A seventeenth vote is cast by the representative of the DSA's youth affiliate, the Young Democratic Socialists, who elect one male and one female delegate who split the vote. The NPC meets four times a year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DSA Constitution and By-laws,&quot; Article VIII, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NPC elects an inner committee of six, including five of its own members and one representative of the youth section, called the &quot;Steering Committee.&quot; At least two of these are constitutionally required to be women and at least one a &quot;person of color,&quot; with the National Director and the Youth Section Organizer also participating as ex-officio members. This Steering Committee meets bimonthly, either in person or by conference call.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DSA Constitution and By-laws,&quot; Article VIII, Section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The DSA has a [[Religious socialism|Religion and Socialism Commission]], in which [[Cornel West]] has played a leading role. [[John Cort]] was a founding editor of the Commission's magazine, ''Religious Socialism''.

DSA publishes ''Democratic Left'', a quarterly newsletter of news and analysis. This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by DSA forerunner the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee since its establishment in 1973. In 2008, DSA members active in the U.S. labor movement founded ''Talking Union'', a blog that focuses on labor politics, working class struggles and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.talkingunion.wordpress.com |title=Talking Union: A Project of the DSA Labor Network |publisher=Talkingunion.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Young Democratic Socialists]] (YDS) is the official youth section of Democratic Socialists of America. The YDS publishes a quarterly newsletter called ''The Red Letter'' and maintains an online [[blog]] called &quot;The Activist&quot;.

== Ideology ==

The DSA's ideas are greatly influenced by those of writer [[Michael Harrington]], Chairman of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]] (1964) and member of the National Executive Board of the [[Socialist Party of America]] (1960–68). Opposed to [[capitalism]] and [[communism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[realignment]] of the U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], away from an amorphous amalgam of often contradictory ideas towards making it a principled party of the [[left-wing politics|left]].

Throughout his life, Harrington simultaneously embraced the thinking of [[Karl Marx]] while rejecting the &quot;actually existing&quot; Communist systems of the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]], and [[Eastern Europe]]. Harrington said:&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small d. The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning...and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism.... I want to be on the left wing of the possible.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harrington made it clear that, even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to &quot;result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bella Stumbo, [http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=yGwVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gwsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6424,4771417&amp;dq=democratic+socialists+of+america+democratic-socialists-of-america&amp;hl=en &quot;A Socialist Utopia,&quot;] ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 12, 1987. Retrieved November 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the collapse of the USSR, the DSA voiced opposition to that nation's bureaucratically managed economy and control exerted over its [[satellite state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Harrington and Barbara Ehrenreich, [http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/opinion/l-in-spirit-of-glasnost-a-half-toast-to-perestroika-us-left-supportive-478689.html &quot;In Spirit of Glasnost, a Half-Toast to Perestroika; U.S. Left Supportive,&quot;] ''New York Times,'' June 16, 1989. Retrieved November 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The DSA welcomed [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms in the [[Soviet Union]]. Sociologist [[Bogdan Denitch]] wrote in DSA's ''Democratic Left'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= [[Michael Harrington|Harrington, Michael]] and [[Barbara Ehrenreich|Ehrenreich, Barbara]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/opinion/l-in-spirit-of-glasnost-a-half-toast-to-perestroika-us-left-supportive-478689.html |title=In Spirit of Glasnost, a Half-Toast to Perestroika; U.S. Left Supportive |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=June 16, 1989 |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The aim of democrats and socialists should be...to help the chances of successful reform in the Soviet bloc... While supporting liberalization and economic reforms from above, socialists should be particularly active in contacting and encouraging the tender shoots of democracy from below&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, the organization issues few statements about overriding principles while frequently commenting on matters of public policy. One primary leaflet detailing the group's official ideas, &quot;What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America,&quot; states that while &quot;no country has fully instituted democratic socialism,&quot; nonetheless there are lessons to be learned from &quot;the comprehensive welfare state maintained by the Swedes, from Canada’s national health care system, France’s nationwide childcare program, and Nicaragua’s literacy programs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author= |url= http://www.dsausa.org/pdf/widemsoc.pdf |title=What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America |publisher=Democratic Socialists of America |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;tremendous prosperity and relative economic equality&quot; established by the Social Democratic Parties of the countries of [[Scandinavia]] and [[Western Europe]] is lauded.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatis&quot;/&gt;
