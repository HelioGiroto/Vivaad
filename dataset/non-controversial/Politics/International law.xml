[[File:Chile signs UN Charter 1945.jpg|thumb|Created in 1945, the [[United Nations]] is responsible for much of the current framework of international law]]
'''International law'''  is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and nations.&lt;ref name=definition – international law&gt;{{cite web|title=The Free Dictionary Definition of Human Rights|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/international+law|publisher=The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009.|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the indispensable framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomanson|first=William|title=Fundamental Perspectives on Internationa Law|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, USA|pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; International law differs from national [[legal system]]s in that it primarily concerns nations rather than private citizens. National law may become international law when [[treaties]] delegate national jurisdiction to [[supranational]] tribunals such as the [[European Court of Human Rights]] or the [[International Criminal Court]]. Treaties such as the [[Geneva Conventions]] may require national law to conform.

International law is consent-based governance. This means that a state member of the international community is not obliged to abide by international law unless it has expressly consented to a particular course of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomanson|first=William|title=Fundamental Perspectives on Internationa Law|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, USA|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an issue of [[state sovereignty]].

The term &quot;international law&quot; can refer to three distinct legal disciplines:

* [[Public international law]], which governs the relationship between [[province]]s and international entities. It includes these legal fields: [[treaty law]], [[law of sea]], [[international criminal law]], the [[laws of war]] or [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]].
* [[Private international law]], or [[conflict of laws]], which addresses the questions of (1) which jurisdiction may hear a case, and (2) the law concerning which jurisdiction applies to the issues in the case.
* [[Supranational law]] or the law of [[supranational]] organizations, which concerns regional agreements where the laws of nation states may be held inapplicable when conflicting with a supranational legal system when that nation has a treaty obligation to a supranational [[collective]].

The two traditional branches of the field are:
* ''[[jus gentium]]'' — law of nations
* ''[[jus inter gentes]]'' — agreements between nations

==Sources of international law==
{{Main|Sources of international law}}

A source of international law is where an international decision maker or researcher looks to verify the substantive legal rule governing a legal dispute or academic discourse. The [[sources of international law]] applied by the community of nations to find the content of international law are listed under Article 38.1 of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]]: [[Treaties]], international customs, and general principles are stated as the three primary sources; and judicial decisions and scholarly writings are expressly designated as the subsidiary sources of international law. Many scholars agree that the fact that the sources are arranged sequentially in the Article 38 of the ICJ Statute suggests an implicit hierarchy of sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomanson|first=William|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, USA|pages=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no concrete evidence, in the decisions of the international courts and tribunals, to support such strict hierarchy, at least when it is about choosing international customs and treaties. In addition, unlike the Article 21 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which clearly defines hierarchy of applicable law (or sources of international law), the language of the Article 38 do not explicitly support hierarchy of sources.  

The sources have been influenced by a range of political and legal theories. During the 20th century, it was recognized by legal [[positivists]] that a [[sovereign state]] could limit its authority to act by consenting to an agreement according to the principle ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]''. This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, which was succeeded by the [[United Nations Charter]] and is preserved in the [[United Nations]] Article 7 of the 1946 [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]].

==Public international law==
{{Main|Public international law}}
Public international law (or international public law) concerns the [[treaty]] relationships between the nations and persons which are considered the subjects of international law. Norms of international law have their source in either:
# custom, or [[customary international law]] (consistent provincial practice accompanied by [[opinio juris]]),
# globally accepted standards of behaviour (peremptory norms known as [[jus cogens]] or ius cogens), or
# codifications contained in conventional agreements, generally termed [[treaties]].
Article 13 of the [[United Nations Charter]] obligates the [[UN General Assembly]] to initiate studies and make recommendations which encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification. Evidence of consensus or state practice can sometimes be derived from intergovernmental resolutions or academic and expert legal opinions (sometimes collectively termed [[soft law]]).

International law has existed since the [[Middle Ages]] but much of its modern corpus began developing from the mid-19th century.Two sophisticated legal systems developed in the Western World: the codified systems of continental European states (Civil Law) and the judge-made law of England (Common Law). The fall of the Roman civilization did not result in the loss of the concepts of Roman Law. Starting in the later Middle Ages, unlegislated Roman law (ius commune or lex mercatoria) was applied by merchants in northern Italian city states and north-western European countries as the basis for commercial (and other) relationships. In the 20th century, the two [[World War]]s and the formation of the [[League of Nations]] (and other international organizations such as the [[International Labor Organization]]) all contributed to accelerate this process and established much of the foundations of modern public international law. After the failure of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and [[World War II]], the League of Nations was replaced by the [[United Nations]], founded under the [[UN Charter]]. The UN has also been the locus for the development of new advisory (non-binding) standards, such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Other international norms and laws have been established through international agreements, including the [[Geneva Conventions]] on the conduct of [[war|war or armed conflict]], as well as by agreements implemented by other international organizations such as the [[International Labor Organization|ILO]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], the [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[UNESCO]], the [[World Trade Organization]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The development and consolidation of such conventions and agreements has proven to be of great importance in the realm of international relations.

==Conflict of laws==
{{Main|Conflict of laws}}
Conflict of laws, often called &quot;private international law&quot; in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, is less international than public international law. It is distinguished from public international law because it governs conflicts between private persons, rather than states (or other international bodies with standing). It concerns the questions of which jurisdiction should be permitted to hear a legal dispute between private parties, and [[Choice of law|which jurisdiction's law should be applied]], therefore raising issues of international law. Today [[corporation]]s are increasingly capable of shifting capital and labor [[supply chain]]s across borders, as well as trading with overseas corporations. This increases the number of disputes of an inter-state nature outside a unified legal framework, and raises issues of the enforceability of standard practices. Increasing numbers of businesses use commercial [[arbitration]] under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|''New York Convention 1958'']].

==Supranational law==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
{{Main|Supranational law}}

The Term &quot;International Law&quot; refers to treaty law made in and between sovereign states.   &quot;Law&quot; is defined as &quot;a rule of conduct or action prescribed or formally recognized as binding or enforced by a controlling authority,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|law}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas &quot;Sovereign&quot; is defined as &quot;supreme power or authority.&quot; Given this contradiction, nations have at times abrogated &quot;International Laws&quot; when they considered doing so in their national interest.  The term &quot;World Law&quot; is the evolution of a system of law at the global level representing the sovereignty of the whole. Initial steps have been taken to evolve a system of supra-national laws, but true &quot;World Law&quot; may await the evolution of a legislative body of, by and for the people of the planet.  
 
===International courts===
There are numerous international bodies created by [[treaties]] adjudicating on legal issues where they may have jurisdiction. The only one claiming [[universal jurisdiction]] is the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Others are: the [[United Nations]] [[International Court of Justice]], and the [[International Criminal Court]] (when national systems have totally failed and the [[Treaty of Rome]] is applicable) and the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]

===East Africa Community===
{{Main|East African Community}}
There were ambitions to make the East African Community, consisting of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], a political federation with its own form of binding supranational law but this effort has not been completed.

===Union of South American Nations===
{{Main|Union of South American Nations}}
The Union of South American Nations is for the South American continent. It intends to establish a framework akin to the European Union by the end of 2019. It is envisaged to have its own passport and currency, and limit barriers to trade.

===Andean Community of Nations===
{{Main|Andean Community of Nations}}
The Andean Community of Nations is the first attempt the countries around the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. It started with the Cartagena Agreement of 26 May 1969, and nowadays consists in four countries: [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. It does have a supranational law, called Agreements, which are mandatory for these countries.
