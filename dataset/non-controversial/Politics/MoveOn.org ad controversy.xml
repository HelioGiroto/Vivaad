      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31665">The '''MoveOn.org ad controversy''' began when the [[Opposition to the Iraq War#Opposition in the United States|anti-war]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[advocacy group]] [[MoveOn.org]] published a full-page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 10, 2007 accusing General [[David H. Petraeus]] of &quot;[[cooking the books]] for the [[George W. Bush Administration|White House]]&quot;. The [[newspaper advertisement|ad]] also labeled him &quot;General Betray Us&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/Decision2008/story?id=3581727&amp;page=1 ABC News: Ad Against Petraeus Strikes a Nerve&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization created the ad in response to Petraeus' [[Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq]]. MoveOn hosted pages on its website about the ad and their reasons behind it from 2007 to June 23, 2010.  On June 23, 2010, after President Obama nominated General Petraeus to be the new top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan (taking over the position from retiring General [[Stanley McCrystal]]), MoveOn erased these webpages and any reference to them from its website.&lt;ref name=removes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/moveon-org-removes-general-betray-us-ad-in-response-to-petraeus-appointment/|publisher=[[Mediaite]]|title=MoveOn.org Removes “General Betray Us” Ad In Response To Petraeus Appointment|first=Jon|last=Bershad|date=June 24, 2010|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments===
[http://web.archive.org/web/20071009170409/http://pol.moveon.org/petraeus.html The ad argued]:
*&quot;Every independent report on the [[2007 in Iraq|ground situation in Iraq]] shows that the [[Iraqi troop surge of 2007|surge strategy]] has failed.&quot;
::The group later cited the [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d071222t.pdf GAO], [http://www.politico.com/pdf/PPM44_070823iraq_nie_-_kj's_-_08-23-07.pdf NIE], and [http://media.csis.org/isf.pdf Jones] reports published for [[United States Congress|Congress]] around the same time as Petraeus' report. ''[[USA Today]]'' compared the four reports' findings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-09-10-iraq-compare_N.htm &quot;Comparing four views on Iraq situation&quot;] by [http://www.usatoday.com/community/tags/reporter.aspx?id=298 Jim Micheals] in ''[[USA Today]]'' on September 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' has also done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/ref/world/20070910_REPORTS_GRAPHIC.html | work=The New York Times | date=September 10, 2007 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group referred to an [[Associated Press]] study finding that the civilian death toll in [[2007 in Iraq|August 2007]] was the second highest since the surge began. The study found as well that &quot;monthly death tolls began to decline after the [[Operation Law and Order|new security plan]] was launched&quot; and that &quot;Deaths went down in [[Baghdad]] during August&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20543737/ &quot;At least 1,809 Iraqi civilians killed in August&quot;] on [[MSNBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; The group also referred to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article stating that &quot;the U.S. troop increase has had little effect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-violence1sep01,0,3069115.story &quot;Iraqi civilian deaths climb again&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;Yet the General claims a reduction in violence. That’s because, according to the [[New York Times]], [[the Pentagon]] has adopted a bizarre formula for keeping tabs on violence. For example, deaths by [[car bombs]] don’t count.&quot;
::The group later referred to [http://select.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/opinion/07krugman.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin an editorial] by [[American liberalism|liberal]] [[Op-Ed|columnist]] [[Paul Krugman]]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has stated that Petraeus' report included data about [[car bombing|car bombs]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2007/09/general_betray_us.html | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=May 13, 2010 | title=General Betray Us?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;The Washington Post reported that [[assassinations]] only count if you're shot in the back of the head -- not the front.&quot;
:: ''[[The Washington Post]]'' article [[anonymous sourcing|anonymously quoted]] a senior [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence official]] in [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] commenting on U.S. military data. The official stated that &quot;If a bullet went through the back of the head, it's [[sectarianism|sectarian]]&quot; but that &quot;If it went through the front, it's criminal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502466.html &quot;Experts Doubt Drop In Violence in Iraq&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the [[MNF-I]] says that they make no distinction among the possible points of impact on the head.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

*&quot;According to news reports, there have been more civilian deaths and more American soldier deaths in the past three months than in any other summer we’ve been there.&quot;
::The group later cited an [[Associated Press]] story stating that &quot;This year’s U.S. troop buildup has succeeded in bringing violence in [[Baghdad]] down from peak levels, but the death toll from [[sectarianism|sectarian]] attacks around the country is running nearly double the pace from a year ago.&quot; The story also stated that &quot;The U.S. military did not get all the additional American forces into Iraq until June 15, so it would be premature to draw a final statistical picture of the effect of the added troops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20440397/ &quot;Violence appears to be shifting from Baghdad&quot;] on [[MSNBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; The group also cited an [[NPR]] article quoting former [[United States Army|Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [http://www.douglasmacgregor.com/ Doug MacGregor] calling Petraeus' statistics &quot;an illusion created by the [[George W. Bush Administration|White House]]&quot;. The article concluded by stating that &quot;So is the surge working? The short answer is that no one can know for certain because statistics only tell a small part of the story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14198105 NPR: Statistics the Weapon of Choice in Surge Debate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*&quot;We'll hear of neighborhoods where violence has decreased. But we won't hear that those neighborhoods have been [[ethnically cleansed]].&quot;
:: The group later cited a ''[[Newsweek]]'' story stating that &quot;When Gen. David Petraeus goes before Congress next week to report on the progress of the surge, he may cite a decline in [[Iraqi Insurgency|insurgent]] attacks in [[Baghdad]] as one marker of success. In fact, part of the reason behind the decline is how far the [[Shiite]] [[Private militias in Iraq|militias]]' cleansing of [[Baghdad]] has progressed: they've essentially won.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20546328/site/newsweek &quot;Baghdad's New Owners&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;Iraq is mired in an unwinnable [[sectarianism|religious]] [[civil war in Iraq|civil war]].&quot;

*&quot;General Petraeus has actually said American troops will need to stay in Iraq for as long as ten years.&quot;
::The group later referred to a statement by [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States House|Congresswoman]] [[Jan Schakowsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/rep.-schakowsky-petraeus-hints-at-decade-long-iraq-presence-2007-08-10.html TheHill.com - Rep. Schakowsky: Petraeus hints at decade-long Iraq presence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[nonpartisan]] website [[Factcheck.org]] has criticized previous ads that state that Petraeus supports leaving troops in Iraq for ten more years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/liberal_lobby_lacks_context.html FactCheck.org: Liberal Lobby Lacks Context&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; because Petraeus had only said, during a [[BBC News]] interview, that &quot;the average [[counter-insurgency]] is somewhere around a 9- or a 10- year endeavor&quot; in reference to [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Criticism===
''[[The Washington Post|The Washington Post's]]'' [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/ Fact Checker] stated that the General's report of &quot;sharply declining Iraqi casualty rates is certainly open to analysis, debate, and challenge&quot; but that &quot;MoveOn.org does not provide adequate factual support for its larger assertion that Petraeus is 'constantly at war with the facts' and is 'cooking the books' for the White House&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Payment controversy ===
''[[The New York Times]]'' initially charged [[MoveOn.org]] $65,000 for the ad using its &quot;standby rate.&quot; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has stated that the full one-time rate is $142,000 for an ad receiving guaranteed placement on a specific day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092300752_pf.html &quot;New York Times Says It Violated Policies Over MoveOn Ad&quot;], By Howard Kurtz, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 24, 2007, p. A8&lt;/ref&gt; ''Times'' [[Ombudsman#News ombudsman|public editor]] and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winner [http://www.nytimes.com/ref/opinion/hoyt-bio.html Clark Hoyt] later stated in an [[editorial]] that the organization was mistakenly charged a rate to which it was not entitled under the newspaper's policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/opinion/23pubed.html?n=Top/Opinion/The%20Public%20Editor &quot;Betraying Its Own Best Interests&quot;], by Clark Hoyt, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Moveon.org repaid the difference to the ''Times'' on September 25, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/us/26moveon.html?ex=1348459200&amp;en=27c42c4c5a49bc84&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=MoveOn Pays The Times $77,508 for Ad Cost | first=Katharine Q. | last=Seelye | date=September 26, 2007 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Post]]'' quoted a ''Times'' [[public relations]] director saying the full one-time rate was $182,000, an additional $40,000 above what has been paid back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09132007/news/nationalnews/times_gives_lefties_a_hefty_di.htm | work=New York Post | title=Times Gives Lefties A Hefty Discount For 'Betray Us' Ad | first=CHARLES HURT | last=Bureau | date=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fox News]] stated:
: Catherine Mathis, vice president of corporate communication at ''the Times'', said she could not discuss specific advertisers, but said the rate for a special advocacy, full-page, black and white, standby ad is $64,575. At that rate, an advertiser can request that an ad run on a specific date, but cannot be guaranteed such placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296745,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Pro-Bush Group Airs Ads Denouncing Liberal Anti-Petraeus Ad | date=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Conservatism|Conservative]] [[columnist]] [[George Will]] has argued that &quot;the paper made a huge and patently illegal contribution to MoveOn.org's issue advocacy ad.&quot; He also stated that &quot;''The Times''' performance in this matter confirms an axiom: There can be unseemly exposure of mind as well as of body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/09/sauce_for_the_times.html &quot;All the Hubris Fit to Print&quot;] at [[RealClearPolitics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former President [[Bill Clinton]] has criticized what he called the &quot;disingenuous&quot; &quot;feigned outrage&quot; of the Republicans on [[CNN|CNN's]] [[The Situation Room]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFzs_qCEGxY September 28 Video of Bill Clinton] on [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minnesota]] [[Minnesota United States Senate election, 2008|Senatorial candidate]] [[Al Franken]] argued in a ''[http://www.startribune.com/ Star Tribune]'' editorial &quot;It is, of course, ridiculous that the United States Senate spent a day debating and voting on a resolution condemning an advertisement while our troops remained in Iraq, fighting a war with no end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/562/story/1445784.html Al Franken: Hyper (and hypo)critical&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] argued that the &quot;ad has raised vital questions that need a thorough and open discussion. The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed the trust of the troops and the American people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-lakoff/whose-betrayal_b_64579.html &quot;Whose Betrayal?&quot;] on the ''[[Huffington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[modern liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] [[blog]]ger [[Arianna Huffington]] argued that &quot;Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. Did it go for the [[wikt:jugular|jugular]]? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/dept-of-misdirection-wi_b_64748.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Dept. of Misdirection: With Iraq a Disaster, GOP Goes Crazy Over a Newspaper Ad | date=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opposition to the Iraq War#Opposition in the United States|Anti-war activist]] and [[Cindy Sheehan#Sheehan challenges Pelosi for U.S. House seat|Congressional candidate]] [[Cindy Sheehan]] stated that &quot;I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true '[[Opposition to the Iraq War#Opposition in the United States|anti-war]]' movement and encourage them to come with us farther.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/21/3988/ &quot;General Betray-Us and MoveOn.org&quot;] in [[Common Dreams NewsCenter|commondreams.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Council of Foreign Relations]] fellow [[Peter Beinart]] argued that &quot;It is terribly unfortunate that MoveOn.org is essentially calling Petraeus a Republican hack, but it’s the logical result of the position the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] has put him in.&quot; Fellow [[Max Boot]] accused Moveon.org of &quot;desperate attempts to besmirch one of the most admired soldiers in the entire American armed forces&quot; and argued that the ad will &quot;backfire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/14191/cfr_fellows_respond_to_iraq_testimony.html &quot;CFR Fellows Respond to Iraq Testimony&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pete Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran and executive director of [[Vets for Freedom]], published an article in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' calling the ad &quot;utterly shameful.&quot; He argued that &quot;It shows contempt for America's military leadership, as well as for the troops who have confidence in him, as our fellow soldiers in Iraq certainly do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/091rhesh.asp &quot;MoveOn.org Calls Petraeus a Traitor&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine [[blog]]ger [[Joe Klein]] posted that &quot;It is no small thing to accuse a military man of betraying his country. It is also palpably untrue in this case. Whoever cooked up this ad is guilty of a disgraceful act of malicious [[wikt:puerility|puerility]].&quot; He also posted that &quot;This is a distraction from the main event.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://time-blog.com/swampland/2007/09/moveoninfantile.html &quot;Moveon.Infantile&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MoveOn.org]] stands by their ad, stating that the General &quot;offered a twisted version of the truth designed to support prolonging the war&quot; and that &quot;the public needs to know that Petraeus is neither objective nor trustworthy when it comes to assessing progress in Iraq&quot;. The organization also stated that the ad had been targeted by a &quot;concerted right-wing [[smear campaign]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pol.moveon.org/petraeus_ad.html MoveOn.org Political Action: Democracy in Action&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Politico]]'' has stated that Moveon.org &quot;welcomes the controversy.&quot; Eli Pariser has said, &quot;Sometimes you have to call a spade a spade, even if it’s a respected general&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0907/5813.html &quot;'Betray Us' ad unites GOP, distracts Dems&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

MoveOn hosted pages on its website about the ad and their reasons behind it from 2007 to June 23, 2010. On June 23, 2010, MoveOn erased these webpages and any reference to them from its website.
