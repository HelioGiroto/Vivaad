      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11855">'''Corporate welfare''' is a sociological concept that [[Analogy|analogizes]] corporate [[subsidy|subsidies]] to [[Social security|welfare payments]] for the poor. The term is often used derogatorily to describe a government's bestowal of money grants, [[tax break]]s, or other special favorable treatment on [[corporation]]s or selected corporations, and implies that corporations are much less needy of such treatment than the poor.  In practice, the term is often used virtually interchangeably with [[crony capitalism]].  To the extent that there is a distinction, the latter term could be considered broader, including all types of governmental decisions that favor the &quot;cronies&quot; (big businesses and industry groups providing substantial campaign contributions), while corporate welfare might be restricted only to direct government subsidies.  

==History==
[[Ralph Nader]], an American critic of corporate welfare, is often credited with coining the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nader.org/releases/63099.html Testimony of Ralph Nader Before the U.S. House of Representatives June 30, 1999] www.Nader.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forgive Us Our Debts: The Intergenerational Dangers of Fiscal Irresponsibility|first=Andrew L.|last=Yarrow|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canada|Canadian]] [[New Democratic Party]] picked up the term as a major theme in its [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 federal election]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David. ''Louder voices: The corporate welfare bums'' (Lewis &amp; Samuel, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
===Background===
[[Subsidies]] considered excessive, unwarranted, wasteful, unfair, inefficient, or bought by [[lobbying]] are often called corporate welfare. The label of corporate welfare is often used to decry projects advertised as benefiting the general welfare that spend a disproportionate amount of funds on large corporations, and often in uncompetitive, or [[anti-competitive]] ways. For instance, in the United States, [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] are usually portrayed as helping honest, hardworking independent farmers stay afloat. However, the majority of income gained from commodity support programs actually goes to large [[agribusiness]] corporations such as [[Archer Daniels Midland]], as they own a considerably larger percentage of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm USDA: American Farms] www.USDA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Peters and Peter Fisher (Associate Professors,  Graduate  Program  in  Urban  and  Regional  Planning,  University  of Iowa)&lt;ref&gt;[http://heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/5678.pdf] Professors&lt;/ref&gt; have estimated that state and local governments provide $40â€“50 billion annually in economic development incentives,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Peters and Peter Fisher, &quot;The Failures of Economic Development Incentives&quot;, ''Journal of the American Planning Association'', Volume 70, Issue 1, March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; which critics characterize as corporate welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimorebrew.com/2011/07/14/tax-breaks-for-developers-economic-development-or-corporate-welfare/ Economic Development or Corporate Welfare]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists consider the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|recent bank bailouts in the United States]] to be corporate welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/us-could-cut-deficit-and-gain-but-thats-unlikely-20101207-18oew.html |accessdate=2010-12-22 | title=US could cut deficit and gain, but that's unlikely| work=Sydney Morning Herald | first=Joseph | last=Stiglitz | date=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/welfare-for-bankers/ |accessdate=2011-04-28 | title=Welfare for Bankers| work=New York Times | first=Nancy | last=Folbre | date=April 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. politicians have also contended that zero-interest loans from the [[Federal Reserve System]] to financial institutions during the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2010|global financial crisis]] were a hidden, backdoor form of corporate welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/banking-financial-institutions/131487-sanders-uses-fed-disclosures-to-call-for-further-inquiry  |accessdate=2010-12-15 | title=Sanders uses 'jaw-dropping' Fed disclosures to call for further inquiry

===Comprehensive analyses===
====Cato Institute====
[[Policy analysis]] conducted by the [[Cato Institute]], an [[Libertarianism in the United States|American libertarian]] [[think tank]], argued that [[United States]] [[Fiscal policy of the United States|fiscal policy]] allocated approximately {{US$|92 billion}} in the [[2006 United States federal budget|2006 federal budget]] toward programs that the authors considered to be corporate welfare.&lt;ref name='Slivinski 2007-05-17'&gt; {{cite journal | title = The Corporate Welfare State: How the Federal Government Subsidizes U.S. Businesses | journal = Policy Analysis | date = 2007-05-17 | first = Stephen | last = Slivinski | authorlink = Stephen Slivinski | publisher = [[Cato Institute]] | issue = 592 | url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa592.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='WSJ 2011-11-08'&gt; {{cite news | title = The Corporate Welfare State | date = 2011-11-08 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204002304576631192120542046.html | work = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent analysis by the institute estimated that number to be {{US$|100 billion}} in the [[2012 United States federal budget|2012 federal budget]].&lt;ref name='DeHaven 2012-07-25'&gt; {{cite journal | title = Corporate Welfare in the Federal Budget | journal = Policy Analysis | date = 2012-07-25 | first = Tad | last = DeHaven | issue = 703 | url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/PA703.pdf | publisher = [[Cato Institute]] | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Koenig 2012-08-06'&gt; {{cite news | first = Brian | last = Koenig | title = Corporate Welfare Spending Hits $100 Billion in FY 2012 | date = 2012-08-06 | publisher = [[John Birch Society]] | url = http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/commentary/item/12350-corporate-welfare-spending-hits-$100-billion-in-fy-2012 | work = The New American | accessdate = 2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Bandow 2012-08-20'&gt; {{cite news | first = Doug | last = Bandow | authorlink = Doug Bandow | title = Where to Cut the Federal Budget?

====Independent====
Daniel D. Huff, [[professor emeritus]] of [[social work]] at [[Boise State University]], published a comprehensive analysis of corporate welfare in 1993.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'&gt; {{cite journal | title = Phantom Welfare: Public Relief for Corporate America | journal = Social Work | date = May 1993 | first = Daniel D. | last = Huff | coauthors = David A. Johnson | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 311-316 | doi = 10.1093/sw/38.3.311 | url = http://web1.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/Nasw.htm | accessdate = 2012-11-06 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6ByInyoNI | archivedate = 2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huff ratiocinated that a very conservative estimate of corporate welfare expenditures in the United States would have been at least {{US$|170 billion}} as of 1990.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt; Huff compared this number with [[social welfare]]:

{{quote|In 1990 the federal government spent 4.7 billion dollars on all forms of international aid. Pollution control programs received 4.8 billion dollars of federal assistance while both secondary and elementary education were allotted only 8.4 billion dollars. More to the point, while more than 170 billion dollars is expended on assorted varieties of corporate welfare the federal government spends 11 billion dollars on Aid for Dependent Children. The most expensive means tested welfare program, Medicaid, costs the federal government 30 billion dollars a year or about half of the amount corporations receive each year through assorted tax breaks. S.S.I., the federal program for the disabled, receives 13 billion dollars while American businesses are given 17 billion in direct federal aid.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt;}}

Huff noted that deliberate [[obfuscation]] was a complicating factor.&lt;ref name='Huff 1993'/&gt;

===Commentary===
In 2002, [[Bernie Sanders]] scrutinized corporate welfare policies in the United States, which he considered to total {{US$|125 billion}} annually.&lt;ref name='Sanders 2002-05-15'&gt; {{cite news | first = Bernie | last = Sanders | title = The Export-Import Bank: Corporate Welfare At Its Worst | date = 2002-05-15 | publisher = [[Common Dreams NewsCenter]] | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0515-09.htm | work = United States Congress | accessdate = 2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
