'''Early voting''' (also known as '''advance polling''' or '''voting''') is the process by which electors can vote on a single or series of days prior to an election. Early voting can take place remotely, such as by mail, or in person, usually in designated early voting [[polling station]]s.  The availability and time periods for early voting vary based on jurisdiction and type of election. The goal of early voting is usually to increase participation and relieve congestion of polling stations on the [[Election Day (politics)|election day]].

An advance poll is held in some [[election]]s to allow participation by voters who may not be able to [[vote]] on the set election day(s). This may include people who will be out of the polling area during the election period, poll workers, [[election campaign|campaign]] workers, people with medical procedures scheduled for that time, among others.

== In individual jurisdictions ==
=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], early voting is known as pre-poll voting.  However, to cast an early vote a voter must already be registered.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], early voting is known as advance polling. It is offered to all voters in all federal, provincial, and most municipal elections. In federal elections, voters do not need to be registered in order to vote at an advance poll provided they are carrying proof of identity and address, or bring a registered voter who will swear an oath of identification at the polling station on their behalf.

=== Finland ===
Finland and Sweden have similar early voting systems. The only distinction is that Finland uses post offices as early voting stations.

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], most eligible voters are required to register their place of residence and receive a ''Wahlbenachrichtigung'' (notification of election) by 3 weeks before an election to the [[Bundestag]], which also contains a postal vote application form. It is possible to cast one's vote directly at the office that handles the application, i.e. the municipal government.

The requirement for an excuse has been removed in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wahlrecht.de/news/2008/20.htm |title=Wahlrecht – News – Briefwahl nun ohne Hinderungsgrund möglich |publisher=Wahlrecht.de |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was just an abstract assurance before that never has been validated. 19% of all voters voted early in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahl2005/downloads/Heft_5.pdf Der Bundeswahlleiter: Wahl zum 16. Deutschen Bundestag am 18. September 2005, Heft 5: Textliche Auswertung der Wahlergebnisse], page 38, table 15 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules for the elections in the states of Germany and on county and municipal level are very similar.

Germans living abroad may register and vote through mail for Bundestag elections and European Parliament elections, but not for state and local elections.

=== Ireland ===
It is common for voters on the remote coastal islands to vote in the few days prior to the election, in case bad weather impeded voting on the official day.
=== New Zealand ===
{{main|Special vote}}
In [[New Zealand]], early voting is a form of special voting, which allows voters who will be outside their [[electoral district|electorate]] or incapacitated on election day to vote in advance or at another polling place.

=== Norway ===

In [[Norway]] early voting is known as &quot;forhåndsstemming&quot;. At the general election of 2009, 707,489 Norwegians voted in advance. This was 200 000 more than the previous record, set in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/krd/pressesenter/pressemeldinger/2009-2/-har-forhandsstemt.html?id=576794 |title=707 489 har forhåndsstemt |publisher=regjeringen.no |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
[[File:Advancevotinglocationmalmoe.JPG|thumb|Early polling station in a [[supermarket]] in Malmö during the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Sweden)|European Parliament election 2009]]]]
Sweden has traditionally a high participation in elections and tries to make it as easy as possible to vote. No registration is needed since everyone is generally [[Population registration in Sweden|registered with a home address]]. Normally, a voter should vote on the election day in their specified polling station. But everyone can vote during the last week at an early polling station, anywhere in the country. These places are usually municipality owned places like libraries. Also on the election day, some of them are open even though the election day always is a Sunday. In hospitals and homes for the elderly, there are special voting opportunities. In elections until 1998, [[Posten (Sweden)|post offices]] were used for several decades as early voting stations (post offices now belong to a commercial company, earlier on a national administration). Swedes living abroad must register their address and can vote at embassies or through mail. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.val.se/in_english/general_information/voting/index.html Valmyndigheten: Voting]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early votes are transported to the voter's polling station in double envelopes. On election day, a voter can vote at his or her polling station on election day. Before the early vote is counted, officials check if the voter has voted at the polling station. If that is the case, the vote is destroyed with the inner envelope unopened. Early votes that don't reach the polling station in time are transported to the [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Board]] and counted if the voter hasn't already voted. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.val.se/det_svenska_valsystemet/rostning/fortidsrosta/index.html Valmyndigheten: Förtidsrösta i Sverige]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
{{main|Voting in Switzerland}}
Swiss federal law allows [[postal voting]] in all federal elections and referenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite swiss law|sr=161.1|link=161_1|art=8|en=Federal Statute on Political Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all [[Swiss cantons|cantons]] also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail a few weeks before the election or referendum. They may either cast it at a polling station on election day or mail it back at any prior time.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]], early voting is known as ''เลือกตั้งล่วงหน้า'' (advance voting). It is available since [[1997 Constitution of Thailand]] and offered both inside and outside [[constituency]], especially for migrant workers and students, to all voters at central [[polling place]]s, mostly at the registered district offices, for [[House of Representatives of Thailand|MP]] elections and [[Thai constitutional referendum, 2007]]. Eligible voters are required to [[Voter registration|register]] at district offices (which they are closest to) and receive a reply notification. For advance voting outside constituency, voters must register before election day not less than 30 days. No need to register if voter has registered for latest election. But if voters would like to go back and vote at original constituency (according to house registration), they must apply for register cancellation. Thais living abroad may also register at embassies or consulates and vote through mail or at the embassies or consulates prior to election day.

Early voting day is same as election day, voters must carrying proof of identity, even expired is valid. [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]] uses [[post offices]] send constituency ballots from other constituencies and abroad to original constiuencies. They will be counted with election day constiuency ballots. 
 
Early voting in [[Thai general election, 2011|2011 general election]] was arranged on Sunday (26 June 2011) only while prior elections arranged on Saturday and Sunday. Around 2.6 million people including 1.07 million in [[Bangkok]] turned up to vote; however, many potential voters were unable to vote due to large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Large crowds for advance voting |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2011/06/27/national/Large-crowds-for-advance-voting-30158762.html |location=Bangkok |newspaper=The Nation (Thailand) |date=27 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters who did not vote on early voting day still can vote at their original constituencies on election day.

=== United States ===
[[Image:Early voting US states.svg|thumb|left|No-excuse early voting in U.S. states, as of September 2007.{{update after|2008|reason=[[Wisconsin]] has since allowed no-excuse early voting.}} {{legend|#3399ff;|in-person and postal}}
{{legend|#cc00cc;|in-person only}}
{{legend|#00c200;|postal only}}
{{legend|#dddddd;|none}}]]
{{see also|Absentee ballot|Postal voting}}
Early voting is similar to &quot;''no-excuse''&quot; absentee voting. In many U.S. states the period varies between four and fifty days prior to Election Day. Early voting in person is allowed with no excuse required in 32 [[U.S. state]]s and in D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncsl-ae&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx | title = Absentee and Early Voting | date = 2012-09-04 / July 2011 | publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] | accessdate = 2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absentee voting by mail with no excuse is allowed in 27 states and D.C., with an excuse in 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncsl-ae&quot;/&gt; No-excuse permanent absentee voting is allowed in 7 states and in D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncsl-ae&quot;/&gt;

====D.C.====
The [[District of Columbia]] required an excuse for early voting and absentee voting,&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=16604 Absentee and Early Voting]. National Conference of State Legislatures.&lt;/ref&gt; until its primary election on September 14, 2010.  Early voting for the D.C. primary began August 30, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See DC ST § 1-1001.09, http://weblinks.westlaw.com/  or searchable link at http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/dcofficialcode&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Florida ====
[[Florida]] officially began early voting in 2004 as part of post-2000 election reform. 

Turnout for early voting exceeded one million in 2004.  There were some problems: 1st-day [[computer]] failures in [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] and [[Broward County]]; accidentally-erased votes in [[Volusia County]]; and a lack of early voting sites in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].  Reforms are being discussed to address the known issues, as well as possibly eliminating the standard [[Opinion poll|poll]] in favor of modified early voting.

==== Georgia ====
In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], &quot;early voting&quot; and &quot;advance voting&quot; have two different meanings.  Voting a week early is called &quot;advance&quot; voting, and is typically available at several locations in urban and suburban counties.  Voting well in advance, up to 45 days before election day, is called &quot;early&quot; voting, and is normally available only at [[list of counties in Georgia|the 159 county]] election offices (where &quot;advance&quot; voting is also available).  There is no weekend voting when most people are off work, and there is no voting the day before election day.  Calls to extend voting through the three days prior to the election cannot be honored by the [[Secretary of State of Georgia|Georgia secretary of state]], each county must request permission from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], due to the history of [[voting rights]] violations in the [[American South]] decades ago.

==== Maryland ====
[[File:Early voting at Bauer Drive Community Recreation Center.jpg|thumb|right|Early voting in Rockville, Maryland]]
In August 2006, a judge ruled in favor of several plaintiffs that the state constitution only permitted voting on the day of the election.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The plaintiffs were challenging a new early-voting law on the probability of [[fraud]]. [[Absentee ballot]]s appear to remain acceptable for the time being.

Voters approved a constitutional amendment in November 2008 to allow early voting starting with the primary elections in 2010.  Maryland now offers both early voting in person and absentee voting by mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.state.md.us/voting/early_voting.html |title=Early Voting |publisher=Elections.state.md.us |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other states ====
The National Conference of State Legislatures provides up-to-date tables of summary and detailed outlines of each state's laws, as well as links to the relevant Codes and Statutes.&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt;
