It is the largest single university in [[Ireland]], discounting the federal [[National University of Ireland]]. The University of Ulster was established in 1968 as the ''New University of Ulster'' and can trace its roots back to 1845 when ''Magee College'' was established in Derry and 1849, when the ''School of Art and Design'' was inaugurated in Belfast. The university incorporated its four campuses in 1984 under the University of Ulster banner; these are located in [[Belfast]], [[Coleraine]] (site of the administrative headquarters), [[Magee College]] in [[Derry]], and [[Jordanstown]]. A fifth [[Distance education|distance learning]] campus, ''Campus One'', delivers online programmes; mainly at [[Graduate school|graduate level]].

Ulster is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acu.ac.uk/institutions/search?code=GB&amp;pageID=5&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European University Association]], [[Universities Ireland]] and [[Universities UK]]. High demand for places and a thriving development programme contributed to a record number of applications in 2004-05 to keep the University of Ulster in the top 10 of the UK's most popular universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=University of Ulster|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/universityguide/profile/story/0,,496649,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2006-10-10|accessdate=2007-04-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Ulster was shortlisted for the [[Sunday Times University of the Year]] award in 2001.

The university has one of the highest further study and/or employment rates in the UK, with 95% of graduates being in work or undertaking further study six months after they have completed their degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/single.htm?ipg=6583 |title=University of Ulster |publisher=Complete University Guide |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the field of [[biomedical sciences]], the University of Ulster obtained a 5* rating, as well as being ranked joint first in the UK, following the Research Assessment Exercises in 1996 and 2001. In the 2008 RAE 86% of research activity at the university was rated as being of international quality, with 20% being classified as world-leading. Of particular note are the submissions within Biomedical Sciences, the [[University of Ulster Institute of Nursing Research]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.science.ulster.ac.uk/inr/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; and Celtic Studies which were all ranked within the top three UK universities&lt;ref name=&quot;thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

==History==

The New University of Ulster (NUU) incorporated [[Magee College]] founded in 1865 in [[Derry]]. Magee College was a college of the [[Royal University of Ireland]] from 1880 and later became associated with the [[University of Dublin]] (better known as Trinity College) when the Royal University was dissolved in 1908 and replaced by the [[National University of Ireland]]. In 1953 Magee College broke its links with Dublin and became ''Magee University College''. It was hoped that this [[university college]] would become Northern Ireland's second university after The [[Queen's University of Belfast]]. However, this did not happen and instead it was subsumed into the New University, primarily as a result of the unwillingness of the [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] government at [[Stormont Parliament|Stormont]] to have the second university sited in overwhelmingly [[nationalist]] Derry, in which [[The Troubles in Derry|&quot;The Troubles&quot;]] were just beginning to break out. The decision caused an outcry at the time {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The university was built at Coleraine as part of the UK government's expansion of higher education in the 1960s. Coleraine today is the university's headquarters and main campus. Following a review of higher education in Northern Ireland under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Chilver in 1982 the direct-rule government decided to merge NUU with the Ulster Polytechnic to form the University of Ulster.The merger took effect on 1 October 1984. This was the first, and as of 2010, only merger in [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[higher education]] whereby what is now called a [[plate glass university]] merged with what would now be a [[post-1992 university]].

[[Image:University-ulster-jordanstown-polytechnic.jpg|thumb|left|Jordanstown campus was once known as Ulster Polytechnic]]

==Academic==

The University's course provision is the largest in Northern Ireland, covering arts, business, engineering, information technology, life and health sciences, management, and social sciences. Courses have a strong [[vocational]] element and the majority include a period of industrial or professional placement.

The University of Ulster has a strong reputation for innovation. In order to create new pathways into higher education the University of Ulster initiated its Online Distance Learning (ODL) project called Campus One.  The Campus One programme provides an alternative mode of study, with a range of courses available online to students all over the world. Campus One courses range from full [[postgraduate]] programmes, professional development and continuing development courses; through to short business-focused courses all offered over the Internet.

The University contributes a higher than national average to local research and development activity and has a strategic research focus.

The University of Ulster is particularly strong in the field of biomedical sciences, and a Centre for Molecular Biosciences (located at Coleraine) is one of the major projects developed by the University. The Biomedical Sciences department obtained the highest possible 5* rating as well as being joint first in the UK, following the UK – wide [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE) in 1996. It was the only UK university to retain a 5* rating for biomedical sciences in the 2001 RAE - part of a performance that saw significant improvement and consolidation of the 1996 results. A 5* research rating was also awarded in the field of Celtic studies. The University performed strongly in the 2008 RAE. Full details of Ulster's RAE results are available at http://research.ulster.ac.uk/rae/rae2008.html

The University is a leading partner in the Northern Ireland Science Park development, with Science Park sites at the [[Coleraine]] and Magee campuses, and in Belfast. There are also Innovation Centres at Coleraine and Magee which provide incubation support to developing spin-out and spin-in companies.

==Financial Restructuring==
In autumn 2011 Vice-Chancellor Barnett announced  a programme of financial restructuring with the aim of reducing the number of staff employed by the University from 3,150 to 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moriarty|first=Gerry|title=Learning curve for North's universities as cheaper fees may create free-for-all|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1129/1224308280653.html|work=Irish Times 29 November 2011|accessdate=2012-01-29|date=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff at the University expressed concern about the proposed means and impact of the restructuring, citing &quot;the use of the threat of compulsory redundancy to bully and intimidate staff&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Leath, Ted. &quot;University of Ulster: Stop the Threats!&quot;, http://www.change.org/petitions/university-of-ulster-stop-the-threats Retrieved 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the belief that the University was  &quot;abdicating its responsibilities to the wider community that funds it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reisz, Matthew. &quot;Cuts threaten access reputation, Ulster staff claim&quot;. ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', 22 March 2012 http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=419409&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, the UU branch of the University and College Union (UCU) declared a formal dispute with university management over its implementation of the restructuring, stating that the recourse to &quot;premature deadlines and unwarranted threats of compulsory redundancy&quot; was &quot;unreasonable as well as contrary to University policy and corporate goals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, Lyn S.,&quot;UCU Declaration of Dispute&quot;. Letter to Richard Barnett, 27 April 2012 http://www.ulster.ac.uk/ucu/Documents/Declaration%20of%20dispute%20UCU%20April%202012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculties==
The faculties of the University (and the dean of each faculty listed after), are:
*'''Faculty of Arts''', ''Professor Pól Ó Dochartaigh''
*'''Faculty of Art, Design and the Built Environment''', ''Professor Ian Montgomery
*'''Faculty of Computing and Engineering''', ''Professor Richard Millar''

==Locations==
The University of Ulster currently maintains 5 sites across Northern Ireland, as well as one &quot;Online&quot; site. In February 2009 the university announced the movement of many courses from the Jordanstown campus to the main Belfast campus and a consolidation of student numbers at Coleraine and the reuse of university grounds for a business park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7864046.stm|title=Courses to move in £250m scheme |date=2009-02-02|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UniveristyofUlster UUC.PNG|thumb|150px|right|Coleraine was the primary campus of the New University of Ulster]]

===Coleraine===
{{main|University of Ulster at Coleraine}}

The Coleraine campus (UUC) is the administration headquarters of the University and is the most traditional in outlook, with a focus on science and the humanities. The traditional focus is primarily as a result of it always being a university campus as opposed to the more vocational type courses offered at the polytechnic at Jordanstown. The internationally acclaimed School of Biomedical Science is based at Coleraine as is the Northern Ireland Centre for Food and Health (NICHE).The Coleraine campus also hosts the only optometry school in Northern Ireland and is indeed one of only two on the island of Ireland.  In 2009 the University launched a new Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) course at Coleraine. The Coleraine campus includes the Riverside Theatre, the third-largest professional theatre in Northern Ireland.  The campus is situated on the banks of the River Bann with views to the North Coast and County Donegal hills.

====Portrush Site====

The Portrush site was part of the Coleraine Campus and home to the School of Hotel, Leisure and Tourism. [[Portrush]] is a town east of Coleraine on the North Coast of [[Northern Ireland]].

The Portrush Campus closed in 2008 and courses were relocated to the Coleraine and the newly developed Belfast campuses.

===Jordanstown===

The Jordanstown campus (UUJ) is located in [[Jordanstown]], 7 miles outside Belfast and concentrates on engineering, health and social science, and is the home of the highly successful Ulster Business School. The {{convert|114|acre|km2|sing=on}} Jordanstown campus is set in a leafy suburb approximately seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) from Belfast city centre and situated at the foot of the Antrim Hills overlooking Belfast Lough. UUJ is home to the Sports Institute for Northern Ireland and has a range of Sports facilities including a new high performance centre. The Buildings are mostly situated around a central Mall with on-site stores and services.  A number of high-demand undergraduate courses at UUJ have extremely high entry requirements such as Physiotherapy, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Radiography, Speech and Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Clinical Physiology,  Communication Advertising and Marketing (CAM), Law, Sport and Exercise Science/Sports Studies.

The campus is within walking distance to the shopping and entertainment districts and is serviced by transport links.  Since 1984, development of the university has focused on the expansion of the Magee campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;magee-history&quot; /&gt;

===Belfast===
[[Image:Belfast-University-of-Ulster.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
The Belfast campus (UUB) is the University’s home of the School of Art and Design, and completed major redevelopment in 2008. The Building is situated in the Cathedral Quarter of the City.  This is becoming a fashionable area of the city which has been developing rapidly in recent years.   There are many social and cultural activities in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. Southern Belfast, where most student accommodations are found, has many restaurants, pubs, theatres and shops. Students at the Belfast campus can use the fine recreation facilities at the larger Jordanstown campus. Transportation between the two sites is quick and frequent. Total enrolment: 1,100 students.

===Ballyronan, &lt;small&gt;Ballymaguigan&lt;/small&gt; ===

The University of Ulster formerly had a base named, 'The University of Ulster Freshwater Laboratory' in a small townland called [[Ballymaguigan]] in the village of [[Ballyronan]], outside the town of [[Magherafelt]] in [[County Londonderry]]. 

The Freshwater Laboratory, although not a campus was a base of the University and consisted of on-campus accommodation, classrooms and testing labs. Courses offererd were all based on studying agriculture, wildlife in [[Lough Neagh]], water testing and other aquatic courses. 

The base closed around ten years ago, and still remains standing, the buildings and on-site accommodation are in a run down state. The site has been purchased by [[Magherafelt District Council]]. 

The remaining site is located on the edge of Lough Neagh, along the Point Road in Ballymaguigan. The area today has become popular with the locals for camping, fishing and boating.

===Campus One===
Campus One, the Virtual Campus of the University of Ulster, was launched on 8 October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Access &amp; Distributed Learning http://adl.ulster.ac.uk |url=http://campusone.ulster.ac.uk/aboutus/news.php?nid=16 |title=eLearning at the University of Ulster |publisher=Campusone.ulster.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It represents a revolutionary new route to learning via the World Wide Web and was selected by the [http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm European Commission] to deliver [http://www.hysafe.org/MScHSE World's First Higher Educational Programme in Hydrogen Safety Engineering]. It developed the world's first ever fully on-line Masters programme in biomedical sciences. Campus One, a 'University at Your Fingertips', provides an online portal through which all of the University of Ulster's e-learning courses are made available on a global scale. The virtual campus incorporates existing e-learning courses with new postgraduate and undergraduate programmes, all of which can be accessed and completed via Campus One from anywhere in the world. Campus One is the first e-learning network of its kind in the UK and Ireland, and has been developed in association with academic partners in the USA and Hong Kong, ensuring its e-learning programmes have global reach and relevance.
