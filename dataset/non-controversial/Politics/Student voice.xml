      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20921">'''Student voice''' describes the distinct perspectives and actions of young people throughout schools focused on education.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (n.d.) [http://www.newhorizons.org/voices/fletcher.htm &quot;Broadening the bounds of involvement: Transforming schools with student voice.&quot;] New Horizons for Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Student voice is giving students the ability to influence learning to include policies, programs, contexts and principles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. (2000). Students as Change Agents: The Generation Y Model. Olympia, WA: Generation Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

Student voice is the individual and collective perspective and actions of students within the context of learning and education.&lt;ref&gt;SoundOut. [http://www.soundout.org/tips.html Student Voice Tip Sheet]. Accessed 12/18/06.&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified in schools as both a metaphorical practice&lt;ref&gt;Britzman, D. (1989). &quot;Who has the floor? Curriculum teaching and the English student teacher's struggle for voice&quot;, ''Curriculum Inquiry. 19''(2), 143-162.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a pragmatic concern.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A. (2005).  &quot;Student voice: Bridges to learning.&quot; Seattle: University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Student voice work is premised on the following convictions:
*Young people have unique perspectives on learning, teaching, and schooling;
*Their insights warrant not only the attention but also the responses of adults; and
*They should be afforded opportunities to actively shape their education.&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Sather, A. (2006). Sound, Presence, and Power: Exploring ‘Student Voice’ in Educational Research and Reform. Curriculum Inquiry 36, 4 (Winter), 359-390&lt;/ref&gt;

Several typologies differentiate the practices that identify as student voice.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, M. (2004). “New wave” student voice and the renewal of civic society. ''London Review of Education'' 2, 3 (November), 197-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, C. (2005). From hearing voices to engaging in dialogue: Problematising student participation in school improvement. ''Journal of Educational Change'', 6, 2 (June), 125-146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thiessen, D. (1997). Knowing about, acting on behalf of, and working with primary pupils’ perspectives: Three levels of engagement with research. In A. Pollard, D. Thiessen &amp; A. Filer (Eds.), ''Children and their curriculum'' (pp. 184–196). London, Falmer Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One identifies multiple roles for students throughout the [[education system]], including education planning, research, teaching, evaluating, decision-making and [[Student activism|advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.)[http://www.soundout.org/examples.html Examples of Meaningful Student Involvement.] SoundOut website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative approaches===
The presence and engagement of student voice has been seen as essential to the [[educational process]] since at least the time of [[John Dewey]], if not long before. In 1916 Dewey wrote extensively about the necessity of engaging student experience and perspectives in the curriculum of schools, summarizing his support by saying,:
:The essence of the demand for freedom is the need of conditions which will enable an individual to make his own special contribution to a group interest, and to partake of its activities in such ways that social guidance shall be a matter of his own mental attitude, and not a mere authoritative dictation of his acts.&lt;ref&gt;Democracy and Education. John Dewey, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

Today student voice is seeing a resurgence of importance as a growing body of literature&lt;ref&gt;[http://soundout.org/bibliography.html SoundOut Student Voice Library]&lt;/ref&gt; increasingly identifies student voice as necessary throughout the educational process.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Cook-Sather, ''Authorizing Student Perspectives: Towards Trust, Dialogue, and Respect in Education'' (2002) http://www.aera.net/publications/?id=434&lt;/ref&gt; Areas where advocates encourage actively acknowledging student voice include [[curriculum|curriculum design]] and [[Teaching_methods#Teaching|instructional methods]], [[Educational leadership]] and general [[school reform]] activities, including [[research]] and [[evaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundout.org/links.html Student Voice Links] from the SoundOut website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curricular approaches===
Specific types of activities that can specifically engage student voice include [[learning by teaching|teaching]], education decision-making, school planning, [[participatory action research]], learning and teaching evaluations, educational advocacy, and student advisories for [[Principal (school)|principals]] and [[Superintendent (education)|superintendents]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful Student Involvement Guide to Students as Partners in School Change] Adam Fletcher, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Service learning====
Engaging student voice is a primary objective of [[service learning]], which commonly seeks to entwine classroom learning objectives with [[community service]] opportunities. Student voice is also present in [[student government]] programs, [[experiential education]] activities, and other forms of [[Student-centred learning|student-centered learning]].
{{Further|Service learning}}

===Student as education decision-makers===
Engaging '''students as educational decision-makers''' is the practice of actively [[teaching]] [[youth|young people]] [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their [[education]] by [[Systematics - study of multi-term systems|systematically]] [[engagement|engaging]] them in making [[choice theory|choices]] about [[learning]], [[schooling]], and the [[education system]] in areas ranging from what affects them personally to what affects an entire [[student body]] to what affects the entire [[school system]].

Choosing [[curricula]], calendar year planning, school [[building design]], teacher hiring, and many more issues are often seen as the duties of a school [[principal (school)|principal]] or [[teacher]]s. Today those roles are increasingly seen as avenues for student voice. Students are joining [[board of education|boards of education]] at all levels, including local, district, and state boards. Some [[state education agency|education agencies]] engage students as staff in programs where they make decisions about [[grant making]], [[standardized test|school assessment]], and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.k12.wa.us/TitleVpartA/YES/default.aspx Youth Leadership &amp; Service Team] Washington State Office of Supertintendent of Public Instruction&lt;/ref&gt; Students are also participating in [[decision-making]] by establishing and enforcing codes of conduct and in personal education decision-making, such as choosing classes and deciding whether to attend school.

==Worldwide examples==
Education reform has long been the domain of parents, teachers, school administrators and politicians. In some nations, however, there is a trend beginning to encompass a much larger element of student participation in scholastic affairs.

===Australia===
The ''[http://www.asprinworld.com Connect]'' journal, published in Melbourne, features dozens of examples of student voice throughout education in its bi-monthly publication.

The [[Victorian Student Representative Council]] is the umbrella or peak body of Student Councils in Victoria, Australia. It is supported with funding from the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD) and auspiced by the [http://www.yacvic.org.au Youth Affairs Council of Victoria (YACVic)]. The VicSRC is an organisation run by secondary school students, elected by their peers.

===Canada===
Including student voice on district school boards was mandated by the Ontario Education Act in 1998. Students in each one of the 72 provincial school boards are represented by a 'pupil representative', commonly called &quot;Student Trustee&quot;. They are meant to represent the needs and concerns of students in discussions with the school board administration and the province. The [[Ontario Student Trustees' Association]], [http://www.osta-aeco.org OSTA-AECO], has become Ontario's chief student stakeholder, providing professional development to its members and advocates for students' educational interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osta-aeco.org/ OSTA-AECO] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for Democratic Education is an organization in [[Toronto]] that includes many aspects of heightened student inclusion in education reform policy. The Society for Democratic Education was founded in early 2005 by [[Bianca Wylie]]. It has published several essays and position papers that discuss the importance of wide-scale education reform, especially in how it applies to secondary level education and civic education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activereform.org The Society for Democratic Education] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Canadian organization of note is Learning for a Cause founded in 2004 by educator and poet Michael Ernest Sweet [http://www.learningforacause.org Learning for a Cause] which promotes student voices for social change through creative writing and publishing opportunities for Canadian students.

Provincial governments and Ministries of Education across Canada are also getting on board with student engagement and student voice.  Alberta Education launched [http://www.speakout.alberta.ca Speak Out] - the Alberta Student Engagement Initiative in November 2008 and thousands of students have been sharing their ideas on how to improve how education looks and feels for them.

Ontario's [[SpeakUp]] initiative seeks students ideas on what strengthens their engagement in their learning.  Ontario's student voice program is centered around four main intiatives, the Minister's Student Advisory Council (MSAC), SpeakUp projects, SpeakUp in a Box and Student Regional Forums.

The Minister’s Student Advisory Council (MSAC) is composed of sixty students, from Grades 7 to 12, they are selected annually to share their ideas and submit recommendations directly to the Ontario Minister of Education. MSAC also determines the themes for Regional Student Forums taking place during the school year. The members of the Minister's Student Advisory Council have been selected in each year since the inaugural year including 2010,2011 and 2012. SpeakUp projects are micro-grants for students. Student submit applications for projects they have designed that support the goals of the Student Voice initiative, over 1.2 million dollars in grant money is available yearly. Over 5000 SpeakUp projects have been led since 2008. Regional Student Forums are held across the province where students are invited to explore, discuss, and make recommendations about factors that facilitate/hinder their learning. Last, SpeakUp in a box allows students to hold their own forums for 30 people free of charge with the Ontario Ministry of Education providing the materials to do so. More information is available at  [http://www.ontario.ca/speakup SpeakUp].

The [[Calgary Board of Education]], in 2010, launched the Chief Superintendent's Student Advisory Council - a group of high school students with student representation from each of the Calgary Board of Education's high school programs. They meet regularly with the Calgary Board of Education's Chief Superintendent, Naomi Johnson, to discuss issues in the system and propose solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbe.ab.ca/New/feature/Werklund/EmpoweringStudentVoice.pdf Empowering Student Voice Information Package].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
A powerful example of student voice in school improvement comes from the [[2006 student protests in Chile]]. Throughout the spring of that year, public high school students from across the country began a series of protests, school takeovers, and negotiations designed to bolster support for public education improvement. After seeing the massive effect of the students, government officials met their demands and are working to support ongoing reforms as necessitated by students.

The government's failure at meeting the core student proposals triggered the biggest social [[2011 student protests in Chile|protests]] in Chile since the return of democracy, in 2011, beginning in May and becoming increasily strong since mid-June.

===United Kingdom===
England has had a long history of student voice, from [[Robert Owen]]'s school in New Lanark (allowing the children to direct their learning through questioning, 1816) to [http://www.educationrevolution.org/neldicandmod.html Neillie Dick]'s anarchist school in Whitechapel (set-up by her in 1908 aged 13); [[A.S.Neill]]'s [[Summerhill School]] and [http://www.mantleoftheexpert.com/studying/articles/MF%20-%20Alex%20Bloom%20-%20Pioneer%20of%20Radical%20State%20Education.pdf Alexander Bloom]'s St Georges-in-the-East (1945–55). Summerhill School children and staff have been fighting for greater children's rights in schools, running training sessions, presentations and workshops for teachers and children at the House of Commons, London's City Hall, Universities and Schools. They lobbied at the [http://www.iheu.org/node/1129 UN Special Session on the Child], spoke at [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/International/ICE/pdf/cierapfinane10.pdf UNESCO] and have lobbied the [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmeduemp/362/362ap10.htm Select Committee on Education]. Summerhill School children facilitated the [http://www.dovergrammar.co.uk/archives/1st-thursday/11-2001.html first secondary school children's conference in Dover], involving some 10 schools. Tower Hamlets primary school children have learnt about Summerhill and their [http://www.eastendtalking.org.uk/schoolcouncils/being-a-lawyer legal fight] for their children's rights; and regularly work with  their local town hall to express their views with the support of HEC Global Learning Centre, including [http://www.eastendtalking.org.uk/schoolCouncils/primary-conferences primary conferences].

The [[English Secondary Students' Association]] is the representative body for secondary students in England. It aims to support students in expressing their views about education by providing workshops and a network of support with other secondary school students. The National College for School Leadership provides career-long learning and development opportunities, professional and practical support for England's existing and aspiring school leaders. Their goal is to ensure that school leaders have the skills, recognition, capacity and ambition to transform the school education system into the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org.uk NCSL] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenix Education Trust is the organisation that helped to found ESSA and currently provides the students with administrative support. It aims to explore and support education in which children are trusted and respected and their participation in decision-making is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenixeducation.co.uk Phoenix] website.&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.involver.org.uk involver] support schools to develop sustainable structures for effective student voice, school councils and participation, and work with teachers and pupils in primary, secondary and special schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.involver.org.uk involver] website.&lt;/ref&gt; involver provides training, resources, ongoing support and access to a large UK network of schools. The Organizing Bureau of European School Students Unions is the umbrella organisation for secondary school student organisations in European.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obessu.org OBESSU] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Some state schools are also pushing student Voice internally and independently across the UK. Schools like [[Quintin Kynaston Community Academy]] are now recognised for having one of the largest and most active Student Voice 'faculties' in the country.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the Irish Second-Level Students' Union (ISSU) is the national umbrella body for second-level school Student Councils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issu.ie The Irish Second-Level Students' Union] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
SoundOut is the only nonprofit education program in the US solely focused on engaging student voice throughout education. SoundOut works with students, educators, administrators, policy-makers, and academics to raise the profile, substance, and effect of student voice in K-12 settings across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundout.org Soundout] website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Youth Rights Association]] advocates for increased recognition for student rights in schools, including the right to privacy, student access to records, and student representation throughout the education system. What Kids Can Do shares stories of student voice throughout the educational process, both within the school system and throughout the community. Their highlights emphasize exceptional learning, belonging, and engagement of students in a variety of capacities for a variety of purposes, the greatest of which is in order to promote student voice. WKCD has authored several books about student voice, primarily written by [[Kathleen Cushman]] working with high school students, including ''Fires in the Bathroom: Advice from high schools students for teachers'' and ''Sent to the Principal's Office''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatkidscando.org WKCD] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Education|Evolving integrates student voices with current major topics in education policy and maintains an online clearinghouse of student voices on education policy. Their website also has students describing the learning experiences on video.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationevolving.org/studentvoices E|E&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://ceep.indiana.edu/hssse High School Survey of Student Engagement] works with high schools across the country to capture students' beliefs and experiences, and strengthen student engagement in schools.

==Outcomes==
Student voice is increasingly identified as a pillar of successful [[school reform]], as educational researchers, academic institutions, and educational support organizations around the world increasingly advocate for the inclusion of students in the reform process after identifying student voice as a vital element of [[student engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Newmann, F. (1993) ''Student Engagement in American Schools.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critical educators including [[bell hooks]], [[Paulo Freire]], and [[Henry Giroux]] have voiced concern with the singular notion of a student voice. Another expert has written about this over-simplification, saying that:
:It is not enough to simply listen to student voice. Educators have an ethical imperative to do something with students, and that is why meaningful student involvement is vital to school improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundout.org/MSIResearch.pdf Meaningful Student Involvement Research Guide] Adam Fletcher, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
