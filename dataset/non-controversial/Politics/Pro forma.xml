{{Refimprove|article|date=September 2008}}

The term '''''pro forma''''', [[Latin]] for &quot;as a matter of form&quot; or &quot;for the sake of form&quot;, is a term applied to practices or documents that are done as a pure formality, [[wikt:perfunctorily|perfunctorily]], or seek to satisfy the minimum requirements or to conform to a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] or [[doctrine]]. It has different meanings in different fields.

== Accounting ==
The ''pro forma'' accounting is a statement of the company's financial activities while excluding &quot;unusual and nonrecurring [[Expense|transactions]]&quot; when stating how much money the company actually made. Expenses often excluded from pro forma results include company [[restructuring]] costs, a decline in the value of the company's investments, or other accounting charges, such as adjusting the current [[balance sheet]] to fix faulty accounting practices in previous years.

There was a boom in the reporting of pro forma results in the USA starting in the late 1990s, with many [[Dot-com company|dot-com companies]] using the technique to recast their [[Income statement|loss]]es as [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s, or at least to show smaller losses than the US [[GAAP]] accounting showed. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] requires [[public company|publicly traded companies]] in the United States to report US GAAP-based financial results, and has cautioned companies that using pro forma results to obscure US GAAP results would be considered [[fraud]] if used to mislead investors.

== Business ==
===Financial statements===
In [[business]], ''pro forma'' [[financial statement]]s are prepared in advance of a planned [[Financial transaction|transaction]], such as a merger, an acquisition, a new capital investment, or a change in capital structure such as incurrence of new [[debt]] or issuance of [[Stock|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pro Forma&quot; explained in the glossary of [http://www.mergers-acquisitions.org/glossary/term/437/ mergers-acquisitions.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pro forma'' models the anticipated results of the transaction, with particular emphasis on the projected [[cash flows]], net revenues and (for taxable entities) taxes. Consequently, ''pro forma'' statements summarize the projected future status of a company, based on the current financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Ross  | first = Stephen  | coauthors = Wasterfield, Randolph W.  | title = Corporate Finance  | publisher = The McGraw-Hill  | year = 2008  | page = 64  | isbn = 0-07-310590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a transaction with a material effect on a company's financial condition is contemplated, the Finance Department will prepare, for management and Board review, a [[business plan]] containing ''pro forma'' [[financial statements]] demonstrating the expected effect of the proposed transaction on the company's financial viability.  Lenders and investors will require such statements to structure or confirm compliance with [[debt covenant]]s such as debt service reserve coverage and [[debt to equity ratio]]s.  Similarly, when a new corporation is envisioned, its founders will prepare ''pro forma'' [[financial statements]] for the information of prospective investors. ''Pro forma'' figures should be clearly labeled as such and the reason for any deviation from reported past figures clearly explained.
===Invoices===
In trade transactions, a ''pro forma'' [[invoice]] is a document that states a commitment from the seller to sell [[Good (economics)|goods]] to the [[buyer]] at specified prices and terms. It is used to declare the value of the trade. It is not a true invoice, because it is not used to record [[accounts receivable]] for the seller and [[accounts payable]] for the buyer.
Simply, a 'Proforma Invoice' is a ''Confirmed Purchase Order'' where buyer and Supplier agree on the Product Detail and cost to be shipped to buyer.
A [[sales quote]] is prepared in the form of a ''pro forma'' invoice which is different from a commercial invoice. It is used to create a sale and is sent in advance of the commercial invoice. The content of a pro forma invoice is almost identical to a commercial invoice and is usually considered a [[binding agreement]] although the price may change in advance of the final sale.

A pro forma invoice can also be used for shipments containing items that ''are not'' being bought or sold, such as gifts, samples and personal belongings, whereas a Commercial Invoice is used when the commodities shipped ''are'' being bought or sold. &lt;ref&gt;Invoice Types [https://webship.dhl-usa.com/Shipment/viewinvtypehelp.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks usually prefer a pro forma invoice to a quotation for establishment of a [[letter of credit]] or for advance payment by the importer through his bank.

In some countries, [[customs]] may accept a ''pro forma'' invoice (generated by the [[import]]er and not the [[export]]er) if the required commercial invoice is not available at the time when filing entry documents at the [[port of entry]] to get goods released from customs. The [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], for example, uses ''pro forma'' invoices to assess [[Duty (economics)|duty]] and examine goods, but the importer on record is required to post a [[Surety bond|bond]] and produce a commercial invoice within 120 days from the date of entry. If the required commercial invoice is needed for statistical purposes, the importer has to produce the commercial invoice within 50 days from the date Customs releases the goods to the importer.

== Law ==
In [[law]], ''pro forma'' [[Court order|court rulings]] are intended merely to facilitate the legal process (to move matters along).

''Pro forma'' audiences are used to obey a formal demand. For example, one ''pro forma'' audience may be heard for a judge to order the production of a certain proof or to schedule another date.
&lt;/span&gt;

== Engineering ==

In [[engineering]], ''pro forma'' drawings are used to facilitate the drawing release of imaginary pieces.

== Government ==
&lt;span id=&quot;Legislation&quot;&gt;
===Commonwealth system===

In certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations with a [[Westminster system]], such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]], ''pro forma'' bills are introduced immediately before consideration of the [[Speech from the Throne]]. ''Pro forma'' bills are incomplete pieces of legislation and undergo only the [[Reading (legislature)|first reading]] stage. They symbolize the authority of the [[parliament]] to discuss matters other than those specified by the [[head of state]], for which ostensibly parliament was summoned. After first reading, the bill is never considered further. The pro forma bill was first introduced in the [[British House of Commons]] in 1558.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&amp;List=faq#cs1|title=The Library of Parliament's research tool for finding information on legislation|publisher=[[Library of Parliament]]|date=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the equivalents are the [[Outlawries Bill]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Select Vestries Bill]] in the [[House of Lords]]. In the [[Parliament of Canada]], such bills are titled [[Bills C-1 and S-1|Bill C-1, An Act respecting the Administration of Oaths of Office, and Bill S-1, An Act relating to Railways]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] and [[Canadian Senate]], respectively. In the [[Parliament of Australia]] and the [[parliaments of the Australian states and territories]], the ''pro forma'' bills consist only of a [[short title]], and do not proceed beyond the [[first reading]] stage.

===United States===

In the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]], either [[Chambers of parliament|house]] of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] (the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] or the [[United States Senate|Senate]]) can hold a ''pro forma'' session at which no formal business is expected to be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-26/politics/politics_fema-funding_1_disaster-relief-fund-senate-democrats-strong-bipartisan-vote/2?_s=PM:POLITICS | work=CNN | title=Debate over FEMA funding continues in Irene aftermath | date=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually to fulfill the obligation under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] &quot;that neither chamber can adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/pro_forma_session.htm|title=pro forma session|work=Senate Glossary|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pro forma'' sessions can also be used to prevent the [[President of the United States|President]] [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoing]] bills, or calling the Congress into [[special session]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0208/Democrats_set_pro_forma_sessions_to_avoid_special_session_on_FISA.html|title=Democrats set pro forma sessions to avoid 'special session' on FISA|first=John|last=Bresnahan|work=The Crypt|publisher=[[The Politico]]|date=2008-02-18|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been used to prevent presidents from making [[recess appointment]]s. However, in 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] made four appointments during a ''pro forma'' session,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obama-to-recess-appoint-cordray-to-cfpb-2012-01-04|title=Obama recess appoints Cordray to CFPB|first=Ronald|last=Orol|work=MarketWatch|publisher=MarketWatch, Inc.|date=2012-01-04|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling the practice of blocking recess appointments into question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/justice-deptartment-backs-legality-obama-appointments-161643005.html]&lt;/ref&gt; {{dead|date=June 2012}}

Similar practices exist in the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], and for similar reasons; for example, in [[Minnesota]], legislative bodies have the same every-three-days meeting requirement that Congress has. ''Pro forma'' sessions are held to meet this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/cco/rules/mncon/Article4.htm Minnesota Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
In [[Pakistan]], the term is only used in educational communities and not in government.

== International Trade ==
A pro forma invoice is much the same as a commercial invoice which, when used in international trade, represents the details of an international sale to customs authorities.  A pro forma invoice is presented in the place of a [[commercial invoice]] when there is no sale between the sender and the importer (for example, in the case of an [[Return merchandise authorization|RMA]] for replacement goods), or if the terms of the sale between the seller and the buyer are such that a commercial invoice is not yet available at the time of the international shipment. A pro forma invoice is required to state the same facts that the commercial invoice would and the content is prescribed by the governments who are a party to the transaction.
