:''For Veer Savarkar's book, see [[Hindutva (book)]].''
'''Hindutva''' (Devanagari: हिन्दुत्व, &quot;Hinduness&quot;, a word coined by [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] in his 1923 pamphlet entitled ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?]]'' ) is the set of movements advocating [[Hindu nationalism]]. Members of the movement are called ''Hindutvavadi''s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShahAdministration)2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ghanshyam Shah|author2=Centre for Rural Studies (Lal Bahadur Shastry National Academy of Administration)|title=Dalits And The State|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J1gnfSo29mAC&amp;pg=PA186|accessdate=16 April 2012|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-922-3|pages=186–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1995  [[Supreme Court of India]] judgement the word Hindutva could be used to mean &quot;the way of life of the Indian people and the Indian culture or ethos&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Supremecourt&quot; /&gt;

In India, an umbrella organization called the [[Sangh Parivar]] champions the concept of Hindutva. The sangh comprises organizations such as the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), [[Bajrang Dal]], and the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]].

This [[ideology]] has existed since the early 20th century, forged by Savarkar, but came to prominence in [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the late 1980s, when two events attracted a large number of mainstream [[Hindu]]s to the movement. The first of these events was the [[Rajiv Gandhi]] government's use of its large Parliamentary Majority to overturn a [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] verdict granting alimony to an old woman, a verdict that had angered many [[Muslim]]s (see the [[Shah Bano case]]). The second was the dispute over the 16th century [[Mughal era|Mughal]] [[Babri Mosque]] in [[Ayodhya]]&amp;mdash;built by [[Babur]] after his first major victory in India. The Supreme Court of India refused to take up the case in the early 1990s, leading to a huge outcry. Tempers soon flared, and a huge number of nationalist Hindus from all parts of India razed the mosque in late 1992, causing nationwide communal riots. The razing of the mosque and subsequent conflict arguably lifted the BJP and Hindutva to international prominence.

==Definition==
[[Image:Flag of the Maratha Empire.svg|thumb|Ancient Hindu flag with two pennants.]]
According to Savarkar, Hindutva is meant to denote the Hindu characteristic, or Hinduness.&lt;ref name=Savarkar&gt;Savarkar, Vinayak Damodar: Hindutva, Bharati Sahitya Sadan, Delhi 1989 (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2012}}

In a judgment delivered in 1995, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that &quot;Ordinarily, Hindutva is understood as a way of life or a state of mind and is not to be equated with or understood as religious Hindu fundamentalism... it is a fallacy and an error of law to proceed on the assumption... that the use of words Hindutva or Hinduism per se depicts an attitude hostile to all persons practising any religion other than the Hindu religion... It may well be that these words are used in a speech to promote secularism or to emphasise the way of life of the Indian people and the Indian culture or ethos, or to criticise the policy of any political party as discriminatory or intolerant. &lt;ref name = &quot;Supremecourt&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsanalysisindia.com/supremcourt.htm Supreme Court on Hindu Hindutva and Hinduism] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Central concepts==
===Cultural nationalism===
According to this, the natives of India share a common culture, history and ancestry.

M S Golwalkar, one of the main proponents of Hindutva believed that India's diversity in terms of customs, traditions and ways of worship was its uniqueness and that this diversity was not without the strong underlying cultural basis which was essentially native. He believed that the Hindu natives with all their diversity, shared among other things &quot;the same philosophy of life&quot;, &quot;the same values&quot; and &quot;the same aspirations&quot; which formed a strong cultural and a civilizational basis for a nation.&lt;ref name=bunch&gt;M S Golwalkar (1966), Bunch of thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana&lt;/ref&gt;

Savarkar similarly believed that the [[Indian subcontinent]] (which includes the area south of the [[Himalaya]] and the [[Hindu Kush]] or [[Akhand Bharat]] (''undivided India'', अखण्ड भारत) is the [[homeland]] of the Hindus. He considered &quot;Hindus&quot; as those who consider India (''Bharat'', भारत) to be their motherland (''matrubhumi''),  fatherland (''pitrubhumi'', पितृभूमि) as well as their holy land (''punyabhumi'', पुण्यभूमि), hence describing it purely in cultural terms.&lt;ref name=Savarkar/&gt; 

RSS, one of the main votaries of Hindutva has stated that it believes in a cultural connotation of the term ''Hindu''. &quot;The term Hindu in the conviction as well as in the constitution of the RSS is a cultural and civilizational concept and not a political or religious dogma. The term as a cultural concept will include and did always include all including Sikhs, Buddhists,and Jains. The cultural nationality of India, in the conviction of the RSS, is Hindu and it was inclusive of all who are born and who have adopted Bharat as their Motherland, including Muslims, Christians and Parsis. The answering association submit that it is not just a matter of RSS conviction, but a fact borne out by history that the Muslims, Christians and Parsis too are Hindus by culture although as religions they are not so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoting RSS General Secretary's reply to the Tribunal constituted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 to hear the case on the RSS, Organiser, June 6, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decolonization===
Emphasizing historical oppression of Hindus by colonial invaders like the [[Islam|Muslims]] (see [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]]) and the Christians and the call to &quot;reverse&quot; the cultural influence resulting from these intrusions.&lt;ref name=bunch/&gt;

===Social justice===
The acceptance that Hindu social structure &quot;is ridden with castes and communities&quot;, and that this has led to &quot;barriers and segregation&quot; and condemnation of &quot;obnoxious vice of social inequality&quot; and &quot;untouchability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Chitkara 2004, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Published by APH Publishing,  ISBN 81-7648-465-2, ISBN 978-81-7648-465-7 (Quoting Late RSS leader Balasaheb Deoras &quot;If untouchability is not a sin, nothing is a sin&quot;).
&lt;/ref&gt; The supporters of Hindutva have a positive outlook towards the [[Dalit]] community, which they aim to bring to leadership positions in their organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1797864.cms Organize under Dalit leadership: RSS]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniform Civil Code===
Leaders subscribing to Hindutva have been known for their demands for a [[Uniform Civil Code]] for all the citizens of India. They believe that differential laws based on religion violate Article 44 of the Indian Constitution and have sowed the seeds of divisiveness between different religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=66122 BJP leader, Rajnath Singh demanding Uniform Civil Code]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The advocates of Hindutva often use the term [[pseudo-secularism]] to refer to policies which they believe are unduly favorable towards the Muslims and Christians. They oppose what they see as a '[[separate-but-equal]]' system; some supporters of Hindutva see it as the [[Indian National Congress]] party's effort to woo the sizable minority [[Votebank|vote bank]] at the expense of true equality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjp.org/Press/sep_2008/sep_0308_p.htm  ]&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of a Uniform Civil Code, which would remove special religion-based provisions for different religions (Hindus, Muslims, Christians, etc.)  from the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], is thus one of the main agendas of Hindutva organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Civil Code, Article 370 back on BJP Agenda http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Uniform-civil-code-Article-370-back-on-BJP-agenda/317218/&lt;/ref&gt; The Uniform Civil Code is opposed by Muslims&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=23591&lt;/ref&gt; and political parties like the Indian National Congress and The [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/may/03code.htm Uniform civil code will divide the country on communal lines: Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

Followers of Hindutva have questioned differential religious laws in India which allows polygamy and triple talaq among Muslims and thereby compromises on the status of Muslim women and &quot;marginalizes&quot; them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.organiser.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=239&amp;page=36&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the [[Shah Bano case|Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986]] by the Rajiv Gandhi government, under pressure from conservative Muslims, to dilute the secular judgment of the Supreme Court, was opposed by Hindutva organisations. The new act, in tune with the [[Shariat]], denied even utterly destitute Muslim divorcees the right to alimony from their former husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/08/10/stories/2003081000221500.htm Shah Bano Case]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection of Hindu interests===
The followers of Hindutva are known for their criticism of the  [[Government of India|Indian government]] as too passive with regard to the [[ethnic cleansing]] of Kashmiri Hindus&lt;ref&gt;[[Kashmiri Pandit|See refs in Kashmiri Pandit]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wandhama massacre|see refs in Wandhama massacre]]&lt;/ref&gt; by Kashmiri Muslim separatists and advocates of Hindutva wish a harder stance in [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/polsoc/staff/academic/rob-jenkins/wsj-india-main-article-jenkins Indian Summer looks set to become a long autumn] by Robert Jenkins&lt;/ref&gt;

They have called for the protection of native Hindu traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organiser.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=259&amp;page=8 Speech by RSS leader K S Sudarshan,Oct 18 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; holy structures, rivers&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.boloji.com/2008/01/16277.htm  'Save Ganga' Campaign by RSS, BJP]&lt;/ref&gt; and the cow (which is considered holy by Hindus).

Hindu nationalists have the stated aim of uniting the Hindu society which is plagued by [[caste]]ism, [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]], and passive religion.

==Views on other faiths==
The votaries of Hindutva believe that the way Muslims and Hindus have treated each other in the past is a ''one-way compromise'' and they intend on making society more balanced and fair towards the majority Hindu population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjp.org BJP Official Website] See philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The BJP has also invited Muslims to be a part of this new society and work with the Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs for a better India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjp.org/philo.htm Bharatiya Janata Party Official Website] ''Hindutva: The Great Nationalistic Ideology''&lt;/ref&gt; Even more militant parties such as the [[Shiv Sena]] have invited Muslims to join and the party leader declared after the Babri Mosque incident, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We must look after the Muslims and treat them as part of us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 interview&quot;&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/21nandy.htm The Rediff Election Interview/Bal Thackeray],''Rediff.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views on Indian history==
The Hindu organisations like the RSS believe that the history of India was written by the British with a condescending attitude towards the native people and their culture. M S Golwalkar writes that the history of ancient India was summed up as &quot;[[Tanglewood Tales]]&quot;. Similar concerns were raised by [[Nobel Laureate]] Rabindranath Tagore in his essay, &quot;The History of Bharatvarsha&quot;, in 1903. He calls the history books &quot;nightmarish account of India&quot;. He writes &quot;while the lands of the aliens existed, there also existed the indigenous country&quot; meaning the latter was grossly being neglected. He adds that the British accounts of Indian history &quot;throw a beam of artificial light on such a spot that in our own eyes the very profile of our country is made dark&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rabindranath Tagore, The History of Bharatavarsha, Bhadra 1309 Bengal Era (August 1903)&lt;/ref&gt;

M S Golwalkar argues that it was a delibrate Imperialist strategy to teach Indians a wrong version of history.&lt;ref name=bunch&gt;M S Golwalkar, Bunch of thoughts&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, writings of [[Lord Macaulay]],&quot;the brain behind the system of English education&quot;, are referred to as an indication of this.&lt;ref name=bunch/&gt;

Lord Macaulay had stated, &quot;We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and millions whom we govern—a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.&quot; 
&lt;ref&gt;George Anderson, Manilal Bhagwandes Subedar, The Last Days of the Company: A Source Book of Indian History, 1818-1858, Published by G. Bell, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

He had also written &quot;No Hindu who has received an English education ever remains sincerely attached to his religion. It is my firm belief that if our plans of education are followed up, there will not be a single idolater among the respected classes 30 years hence.”  
&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Richard O'Gorman Anderson, Imagined Communities:Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, Edition: 2, revised Published by Verso, 1991, ISBN 0-86091-546-8, ISBN 978-0-86091-546-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior RSS leader H V Sheshadri refers to this attitude of &quot;[[White man's burden]]&quot; which he believes shaped the English education system in India and British version of Indian history.&lt;ref&gt;Sheshadri H V, Tragic story of Partition, Publisher: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSS is opposed to the theory of [[Indo-Aryan migration]] to India, a number believing in the alternative [[Out of India]] theory. While largely uncontroversial in academia, the  &quot;Aryan Invasion theory&quot; debate in India, involving e.g. [[Sita Ram Goel]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[Irfan Habib]] and [[Arun Shourie]], is also a matter of politics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Organizations==
{{Main|Sangh Parivar}}

Hindutva is commonly identified as the guiding ideology of the [[Sangh Parivar]], a family of radical [[Hindu Nationalist]] organizations, and of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] in particular.
In general, ''Hindutvavaadis'' (followers of Hindutva) condescendingly believe that they represent the well-being of [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Ayyavazhi]], [[Jainism]] and all other [[Indian religions|religions]] prominent in India.

Most nationalists are organized into political, cultural and social organizations - using the concept of Hindutva as a political tool to mislead the common voter. The first Hindutva organisation formed was the extremist [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), founded in 1925. A prominent [[India]]n political party, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) (BJP) is closely associated with a group of organisations that advocate Hindutva. They collectively refer to themselves as the &quot;Sangh Parivar&quot; or family of associations, and include the RSS, [[Bajrang Dal]] and the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]]. Other organisations include:
* [[Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh]] - Overseas branch of the RSS
* [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]] - Worker's Union
* [[Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad]] - A Student's Union
* [[Bharatiya Kisan Sangh]] - A Farmers' organisation

The major political wing is the BJP which was in power in India's Central Government for six years from 1998 to 2004 and is now the main opposition party. In May 2012 it was in power in the states of [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Karnataka]]. It is an alliance partner in the states of [[Orissa]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Bihar]], [[Goa]]

Political parties pertaining to the Hindutva ideology are not limited to the [[Sangh Parivar]].
Examples of political parties independent from the Sangh's influence include Prafull Goradia's [[Akhil Bharatiya Jana Sangh]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.news.yahoo.com/041021/43/2hfvw.html Jana Sangh promises to make India Hindu nation]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uma Bharti|Uma Bharti's]] Bharatiya Janshakti Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/apr/30uma.htm Uma launches new party]&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these groups is relatively limited.

The controversial Maharashtrian political party, the [[Shiv Sena]], converted its ideology to the Hindutva one in recent times. It has been very influential in the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]]. The party is not part of the Sangh Parivar but is associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party. 
Similar is the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], which is a [[Sikh]] religious party but maintains ties with Hindutva organizations, as they also represent Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990119/01951725.html SAD-BJP Alliance helped bridge Hindu Sikh gap] Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ Dr.Rajeev Menon Ji Maharaj, National President of Hindu Mahasabha is  Active in South Indian States like [[Karnataka]] [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] respectively.

==Criticism and support==
The opponents of Hindutva philosophy consider Hindutva ideology as a euphemistic effort to conceal communal beliefs and practices. 

Many Indian sociologues have described the Hindutva movement as fascist in classical sense, in its ideology and class support specially targeting the concept of homogenised majority and [[cultural hegemony]].&lt;ref&gt;Fascism of our times [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0970-0293%28199303%2F04%2921%3A3%2F4%3C69%3ATFOOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage Prabhat Patnaik]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hindutva movement on the other hand terms such description as coming from the [[far left]].&lt;ref&gt;eg. [http://www.proxsa.org/resources/ghadar/v1n2/priya.html Partha Banergee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;- Rajesh Tembarai Krishnamachari, [[South Asia Analysis Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; More moderate critics of Hindutva do not base their criticism on allegations of &quot;fascism&quot;, but raise issues with regards to their sometimes-vacillating attitudes towards non-Hindus and secularism. The epithet of &quot;fascism&quot; is also used to evoke double standards against Hindus in political and academic discourse. The academia and polity have been accused of engaging in a form of [[anti-Hindu]] [[McCarthyism]] against Hindu political expression by leveling the accusation of &quot;fascism&quot; against anyone who expresses sympathy for Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/s_es/s_es_rosse_puzzle.htm Puzzling Dimensions and Theoretical Knots in my Graduate School Research], ''Yvette Rosser''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics&lt;ref&gt;eg. [http://www.proxsa.org/resources/ghadar/v1n2/priya.html Partha Banergee], [[Romila Thapar]], [[Himani Bannerji]], [[Prabhat Patnaik]]&lt;/ref&gt; have used the political epithets of &quot;Indian fascism&quot; and &quot;Hindu fascism&quot; to describe the ideology of the [[Sangh Parivar]]. For example, Marxist social scientist [[Prabhat Patnaik]] has written that the Hindutva movement as it has emerged is &quot;classically [[fascist]] in class support, methods and programme&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Fascism of Our Times&quot; ''Social Scientist'' VOl 21 No.3-4, 1993, p.69 [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0970-0293(199303%2F04)21%3A3%2F4%3C69%3ATFOOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Patniak bases this argument on the following &quot;ingredients&quot; of classical fascism present in Hindutva: the attempt to create a unified homogenous majority under the concept of 'the Hindus'; a sense of grievance against past injustice; a sense of cultural superiority; an interpretation of history according to this grievance and superiority; a rejection of rational arguments against this interpretation; and an appeal to the majority based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[masculinity]]. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Fascism of Our Times&quot; ''Social Scientist'' VOl 21 No.3-4, 1993, p.69 [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0970-0293(199303%2F04)21%3A3%2F4%3C69%3ATFOOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y]&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of Hindutva as fascist has been condemned by pro-Hindutva authors such as [[Koenraad Elst]] who claim that the ideology of Hindutva meets none of the characteristics of fascist ideologies. Claims that Hindutva social service organisations such as the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] are &quot;fascist&quot; have been disputed by academics such as Vincent Kundukulam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.christianpost.com/article/20031219/1016.htm Christian Post], [http://web.archive.org/web/20061021224420/http://world.christianpost.com/article/20031219/1016.htm archive link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics Chetan Bhatt and Parita Mukta reject the identification of Hindutva with fascism, because of Hindutva's embrace of cultural rather than racial nationalism, because of its &quot;distinctively Indian&quot; character, and because of &quot;the RSS’s disavowal of the seizure of state power in preference for long-term cultural labour in [[civil society]].&quot; They instead describe Hindutva as a form of &quot;revolutionary conservatism&quot; or &quot;ethnic absolutism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' Volume 23 Number 3 May 2000 pp. 407–441 ISSN 0141–9870 print/ISSN 1466–4356 online&lt;/ref&gt; Mohan Bhagwat, the head of RSS, says, “The country should have a Prime Minister who propounds Hindutva.”&lt;ref&gt;http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/country-needs-a-pm-who-propounds-hindutva-rss_782871.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Laureate]] [[V.S. Naipaul]] also rejects these allegations and views the rise of Hindutva as a welcome, broader civilizational resurgence of India.&lt;ref&gt;Naipaul V.S.
