      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9419">'''Social-imperialism''' is a [[Marxist]] expression, typically used in a derogatory fashion, to describe people, parties, or nations that are &quot;socialist in words, imperialist in deeds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, VI., (1916), State and Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first used in Marxist circles during the early 20th century discussions on the position of the [[Second International|international workers' movement]] towards the [[World War I|impending European war]] and particularly in regards to the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Luxemburg, R., (1915), &quot;Rebuilding the International&quot; | url=http://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/luxemburg/1915/xx/rebuild-int.htm  | accessdate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lenin, VI., (1915), &quot;Draft resolution of the leftwing delegates at the International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald&quot; | url=http://www.workers.org/marcy/cd/sambol/bolwar/bolwar12.htm | accessdate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context it is very similar to, but not interchangeable with, the terms [[social chauvinism]] and [[social patriotism]].

In the later decades the most significant use of the phrase has been in the [[Maoism|Maoist]] critique of the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Mao Zedong]] argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an [[imperialism|imperialist]] power while maintaining a [[socialist]] façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mao, (1964), &quot;On Khrushchev’s Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World&quot; | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm | accessdate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Communist]] leader [[Enver Hoxha]] agreed with Mao in this analysis, before later using the expression to also condemn [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s [[Three Worlds Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hoxha, E., (1979), &quot;Imperialism and the Revolution: The Theory of 'Three Worlds': A Counterrevolutionary Chauvinist Theory&quot; | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch4.htm  | accessdate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic use==
The term has also been used as a conceptual device by left-wing academics. The academic use of the phrase is usually used to describe governments that engage in imperialism meant to preserve the domestic social peace. The [[left-wing]] German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] has defined social imperialism &quot;the diversions outwards of internal tensions and forces of change in order to preserve  the social and political status quo&quot;, and as a &quot;defensive ideology&quot; to counter the &quot;disruptive effects of industrialization on the social and economic structure of Germany&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoff Eley|Eley, Geoff]] &quot;Social Imperialism&quot; pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 925.&lt;/ref&gt; In Wehler's opinion, social imperialism was a device that allowed the German government to distract public attention from domestic problems and preserve the existing social and political order&lt;ref name=&quot;Eley pages 925-926&quot;&gt;Eley, Geoff &quot;Social Imperialism&quot; pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 925.&lt;/ref&gt; Wehler argued the dominant elites used social imperialism as the glue to hold together a fractured society and to maintain popular support for the social ''status quo''&lt;ref name=&quot;Eley pages 925-926&quot;/&gt; Wehler argued German colonial policy in the 1880s was the first example of social imperialism in action, and was followed up by the &quot;Tirpitz plan&quot; for expanding the German Navy starting in 1897&lt;ref name=&quot;Eley pages 925-926&quot;/&gt; In this point of view, groups such as the Colonial Society and the [[Navy League (Germany)|Navy League]] are seen as instruments for the government to mobilize public support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eley pages 925-926&quot;/&gt; The demands for annexing most of Europe and Africa in World War I are seen by Wehler as the pinnacle of social imperialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eley pages 925-926&quot;/&gt;

The British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[Geoff Eley]] contends that there are three flaws to Wehler's theory of social imperialism. The first is that Wehler credits leaders such as Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and Prince [[Bernhard von Bülow]] with a greater degree of vision then what they in fact possessed&lt;ref&gt;Eley, Geoff &quot;Social Imperialism&quot; pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 pages 925-926.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that many of the pressure groups on the right who advocated an imperialist policy for Germany were not the creations of the government, and in fact often demanded far more aggressive policies then what the government was willing to undertake&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Eley, Geoff &quot;Social Imperialism&quot; pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 926.&lt;/ref&gt; The third was that many of these imperialist lobbying groups demanded a policy of political and social reform at home, in addition to imperialism abroad&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Eley argued that what is required in thinking about social imperialism is a broader picture with an interaction from above and below, and a wider view of the relationship between imperialism abroad and domestic politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

One of the more notable uses of the social imperialism concept was by the British Marxist historian [[Timothy Mason]] who argued that [[World War II]] was caused by social imperialism. In Mason’s opinion, German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a “barbaric variant of social imperialism”.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Mason argued that “Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion”&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mason that the timing of a such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 165&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mason, by 1939, the “overheating” of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans caused by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the a sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing in 1939&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaillis, Aristotle pages 165-166&quot;&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  pages 165-166&lt;/ref&gt; Mason contented that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless “smash and grab” foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 166&lt;/ref&gt; Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic “next victim” syndrome after the ''[[Anschluss]],'' in which the “promiscuity of aggressive intentions” was nurtured by every successful foreign policy move.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 151&lt;/ref&gt; In Mason’s opinion, the decision to sign the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and to attack Poland and with it risking a war with Britain and France were the abandonment by Hitler of his foreign policy programme outlined in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' forced on him by the need to stop a collapsing German economy by seizing territory abroad to be plundered&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaillis, Aristotle pages 165-166&quot;/&gt;
