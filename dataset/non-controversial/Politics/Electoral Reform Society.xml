The '''Electoral Reform Society''' is a political [[pressure group]] based in the [[United Kingdom]] which promotes [[electoral reform]]. It is believed to be the oldest operating organisation concerned with electoral systems in the world.

==Aims==

Since its formation, the Society has promoted the use of the [[Single Transferable Vote]] (STV) in [[Elections in the United Kingdom#General elections|general elections]]. It also has many influences around the world in concern with electoral reformation. The mission of the society is to secure an [[Electoral system of the United Kingdom|electoral system in the United Kingdom]] which it believes will:

*Give all votes equal value
*Give effective representation to all significant points of view within the electorate
*Not have the problem of tactical voting and votes wasted
*Ensure the accountability of individual representatives to their electorates

==History==

The ERS was founded in January 1884 as the Proportional Representation Society by the Victorian naturalist, archaeologist and polymath [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]]. The founding members included academics, [[barrister]]s, and an equal number of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party UK|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s. Famous early members included Charles Dodgson (better known as [[Lewis Caroll]]), [[C.P. Scott]], editor of the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and [[Thomas Hare (political scientist)|Thomas Hare]], the inventor of STV.

The Society campaigned for the introduction of [[Single Transferable Vote|STV]] until 1888. It then became inactive until 1904. It resumed campaigning for STV, succeeding in getting it introduced in [[local election]]s in [[Ireland]], and in numerous religious, educational and professional organisations. 

After [[World War II]] the Society suffered from financial problems and a lack of public interest in electoral reform. It was kept going for many decades by its Director, [[Enid Lakeman]], an inveterate pamphleteer, public speaker and writer of letters to newspapers about STV. When [[Fianna Fáil]] twice (1959 and 1968) put to a referendum a proposal to abolish STV in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and revert to [[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]], Lakeman led a successful ERS campaign to keep STV there.&lt;ref&gt;(Sinnott, Richard, 1999. ‘The electoral system’, pp. 99–126 in John Coakley and Michael Gallagher (eds), ''Politics in the Republic of Ireland'', 3rd ed. London: Routledge and PSAI Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 STV was introduced in [[Northern Ireland]] for elections to local councils and to the new [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], and the Society and its staff were called upon to advise in the programme of education set up by the [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] to train [[returning officer]]s in the new techniques and raise public awareness in the Province of the implications of the newly introduced voting method.&lt;ref&gt;http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/electoralsystem.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner ring shows national share of the vote for each party; the outer ring shows seats won.]]

Interest in [[proportional representation]] revived sharply in Britain in 1974, and from then on the Society was able to secure a higher public profile for its campaign. 

In 1983 the Society was recognised by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] as a [[Non-Governmental Organisation]] with Consultative Status.

==Post 2010 activities==

The Society has campaigned successfully for the introduction of STV for local elections in [[Scotland]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairsharevoting.org/what.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and led the call for a referendum on the voting system in the wake of the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal]] as part of the [[Vote for a Change]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/24/letters-mps-expenses&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Society was later a principal funder of the [[YES! To Fairer Votes]] campaign in its unsuccessful bid for a Yes vote in the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|2011 referendum]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/03/av-referendum-details-donations-yes-no-campaigns&lt;/ref&gt; on the Alternative Vote, its Chief Executive [[Katie Ghose]] serving as the campaign's chair.

The Society has three closely related organisations:

* '''Electoral Reform Services Limited''' (ERS, formerly Electoral Reform Ballot Services): A company established in 1988 to provide an independent balloting and polling service to organisations conducting elections and polls. The service is widely used by [[trade union]]s, [[political parties]], [[building societies]] and companies when balloting their members or shareholders in ways defined by the law and their internal management. In many cases these organisations are forbidden from conducting their ballots internally in an attempt to ensure that the ballots are conducted impartially.

* '''[[Electoral Reform International Services]]''' (ERIS): A company established in 1991 to provide assistance in conducting elections worldwide. Activities include advice, training and election monitoring.

* '''[[The McDougall Trust]]''': A registered charity which promotes the understanding of electoral issues.
