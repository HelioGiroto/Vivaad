'''The Mischief Makers''' are a group of [[activists]] and [[artists]] based in [[Nottingham]] ([[UK]]) who formed  early 2005 as a creative response to the [[G8 Summit]], held at [[Gleneagles Hotel]], [[Scotland]] in July that year. The collective uses [[creativity]] to support [[community]], [[Social environment|environmental]] and [[social justice]] [[Political campaign|campaign]] and [[activist]] groups. The group's aim is &quot;to inspire people and [[Empowerment|empower]] them to identify challenges and take [[Direct action|action]] in their local environment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mischief Makers [http://www.mischiefmakers.org.uk website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Mischief makers 07.jpg|thumb|Geishas at the MPH march in [[Edinburgh]], July 2005|300px|right|Geishas at the MPH march in [[Edinburgh]], July 2005]]

Early 2005 a benefit event in aid of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Tsunami Disaster]] was organised in various venues around [[Nottingham]], UK. Two local artists made [[Geisha]]-like costumes and performed an interactive theatre piece on the streets, trying to get public to interact with the [[costumes]] and the &quot;wish fishes&quot; to engage with the issues related to the disaster. Afterwards, the costumes were altered and used as an [[interactive]] way of engaging with people on the issues of [[debt]], [[poverty]] and [[climate change]] as the Summit of the G8 was approaching.

During the spring of 2005, various [[kimono]]-making [[workshops]] asked people to &quot;join the geisha of gaiety on a passionate mission of peace and progression, when 8 men think to meet undisturbed, unruffled and untroubled to decide upon the worlds future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Be a Geisha at the G8! [http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/05/311960.html article on UK Indymedia]&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Geisha Bloc&quot; took part in the [[Make Poverty History]] march in [[Edinburgh]] on July 2 and others took their costumes to the camp in [[Stirling]] for [[direct action]] planned to disturb the summit.

===Supporting the NAIL Campaign===
Nottingham Against [[Incineration]] and [[Landfill]] stepped up its campaign mid 2005 after the proposed expansion of Eastcroft Incinerator was announced. The expansion has been rather controversial as [[Sneinton]], the most affected area has been dealing with various health problems as a consequence of the [[incinerator]] being very close. The Mischief Makers have supported the NAIL Campaign on numerous occasions with bannerdrops, awareness raising, [[fundraising]] and during [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protests]] with [[costumes]], [[puppets]] and [[performance]].

About the campaign: &quot;NAIL (Nottingham Against Incineration and Landfill) was originally set up in 2002 by a group of local environmental campaigners. We decided to form a pressure group, when a woman who developed [[breast cancer]] approached members of Nottingham [[Greenpeace]]. She claimed that there was two other ladies, who shared her office for many years overlooking the [[incinerator]] plant, had also developed [[cancer]], one of whom had died. They were believed that their condition was caused by their prolonged exposure to [[pollution]] from Eastcroft incinerator. The group developed and was joined by local residents of the Eastcroft Incinerator. We have since gained growing support, since the expansion announcement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Incinerator's Make me sick&quot; [http://www.nail.uk.net/NAIL.htm article on NAIL website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting the No Border Network===
[[Image:Mischief makers 04.jpg|thumb|Solidarity Sister costumes, [[Sheffield]], Oct 2005|180px|left|Solidarity Sister costumes, [[Sheffield]], Oct 2005]]

In October 2005 a new piece called 'The Solidarity Sisters' was developed to support the work of the No Borders Network, which aim is to spread the message of soldarity with refugees and those seeking asylum in the UK.

One Solidarity Sister explains: &quot;We have appeared in these costumes a couple of times in Nottingham and in Sheffield. We dress in little white dresses, with one of us in lederhosen and hats and bags.. It's about showing solidarity. It's more a sort of universal image. On the bands and the skirts there's lots of images of people holding hands. It's about spreading equality, friendship and acceptance. We look a little bit like aid nurses. Like it's about having a helping hand. Being there to support people. The dresses were made from reclaimed fabrics. They were used for car seat padding. It's good to be reusing stuff.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Sheffield No Borders Tour [http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/regions/sheffield/2005/10/325680.html?c=on#comments article on Sheffield Indymedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

About the [[No Border Network]]: &quot;The no border network is a tool for all groups and grass root organizations who work on the questions of migrants and asylum seekers in order to struggle alongside with them for freedom of movement, for the freedom for all to stay in the place which they have chosen, against repression and the many controls which multiply the borders everywhere in all countries.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Presentation of the No Border Network [http://www.noborder.org on noborder.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art and Activism Caravan was a project initiated by the [[Amsterdam]] based youth organisation [[European Youth For Action]] in which The Mischief Makers took place. Its idea was to &quot;support and connect youth, campaign, community and activist groups, their actions and campaigns with creative forms of activism.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;What is the AA Caravan?

===The Climate Camp===
The [[Camp for Climate Action]], also known as the 'Climate Camp' was held in [[Barlow, North Yorkshire|Barlow]], [[Selby]], North West [[Yorkshire]] to push for action on the issue of [[climate change]]. Over 600 people came together for 10 days to follow [[workshops]], share skills and take [[Direct action|action]]. The [[campsite|camp]] was set up near [[Drax power station]], the largest [[coal]] fired [[power station]] in [[Europe]] and the biggest single contributor to [[CO2]] emissions in the [[UK]]. The Mischief Makers made a giant ostrich [[puppet]] which was taken on the 'kids march' to Drax Power Station on Thursday 31 August 2006 and seized by the [[police]]. [[Chief Inspector]] Barry Smith told the [[BBC]] &quot;a giant home-made ostrich had been seized by police, and found to be containing tools which could have been used by demonstrators to chain themselves to fences.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Power station protesters arrested [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/5300560.stm BBC article]&lt;/ref&gt; More coverage from the Climate Camp can be found on [http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/actions/2006/climatecamp UK Indymedia].
