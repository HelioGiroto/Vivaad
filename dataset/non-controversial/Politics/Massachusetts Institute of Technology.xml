We all desired cardinal red; it has stood for a thousand years on land and sea in England's emblem; it makes one-half of the stripes on America's flag; it has always stirred the heart and mind of man; it stands for 'red blood' and all that 'red blood' stands for in life. But we were not unanimous for the gray; some wanted blue, I recall. But it (the gray) seemed to me to stand for those quiet virtues of modesty and persistency and gentleness, which appealed to my mind as powerful; and I have come to believe, from observation and experience, to really be the most lasting influences in life and history....We recommended 'cardinal and steel gray.'&quot; (Alfred T.

'''Massachusetts Institute of Technology''' '''(MIT)''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[research university]] located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, United States. MIT has five schools and one college, containing a total of 32 academic departments, with a strong emphasis on scientific, engineering, and technological education and research.

Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization of the United States]], the institute adopted the [[History of European research universities|European polytechnic university model]] and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Angulo |first=A.J. |title=William Barton Rogers and the Idea of MIT |pages=155–156 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-9033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIT's early emphasis on applied technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to close cooperation with industry. Curricular reforms under [[Karl Compton]] and [[Vannevar Bush]] in the 1930s re-emphasized basic scientific research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lecuyer&quot;/&gt; MIT was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1934. Researchers were involved in efforts to develop [[Whirlwind (computer)|computers]], [[radar]], and [[inertial navigation system|inertial guidance]] in connection with [[Technology in World War II|defense research]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under [[James Killian]].

The current {{convert|168|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} campus opened in 1916 and extends over {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} along the northern bank of the [[Charles River|Charles River basin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/campus.html |title=MIT Facts: The Campus |publisher=MIT |accessdate=September 8, 2010 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 60 years, MIT's educational disciplines have expanded beyond the [[physical science]]s and engineering into fields such as [[biology]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], and [[management]].

In 1859, various individuals and Bostonian organizations submitted to the [[Massachusetts General Court]] a proposal to use newly opened lands in [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]], Boston for a &quot;Conservatory of Art and Science&quot;, but the proposal failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kneeland |first=Samuel |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/house260.pdf |format=PDF|title=Committee Report:Conservatory of Art and Science |publisher=Massachusetts House of Representatives, House No. 260 |month=March | year=1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Timeline|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/mithistory/mit-timeline/|work=MIT History|publisher=MIT Institute Archives|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later proposal by [[William Barton Rogers]] led to a charter for the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was signed by the [[John Albion Andrew|governor of Massachusetts]] on April 10, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acts and Resolves of the General Court Relating to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/1861%20Charter.pdf|work=MIT History|publisher=MIT Institute Archives|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers sought to establish a new institution of higher education to address the challenges posed by the mid-19th century's rapid scientific and technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Facts 2012: Origins and Leadership|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/origins.html|work=MIT Facts|publisher=MIT|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=William |publisher=The Committee of Associated Institutions of Science and Arts |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/objects-plan.pdf |format=PDF|title=Objects and Plan of an Institute of Technology: including a Society of Arts, a Museum of Arts, and a School of Industrial Science; proposed to be established in Boston |year=1861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he valued first-hand experience as part of a proper education, he did not intend to found a [[vocational education|professional school]], but advocated instruction in useful knowledge that combined elements of both professional and liberal education,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis Report&quot;&gt;Lewis 1949, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; writing that &quot;The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/timeline/letter1846.html |title=Letter from William Barton Rogers to His Brother Henry |date=March 13, 1846 |accessdate=October 2, 2010 |publisher=Institute Archives, MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rogers Plan, as it came to be known, reflected the [[History of European research universities#European university models in the 19th and 20th centuries|German research university model]], emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Geiger |editor1-first=Roger L. |last=Angulo |first=A.J. |chapter=The Initial Reception of MIT, 1860s–1880s |title=Perspectives on the History of Higher Education |pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early developments===

[[File:МИТ кампус 1905.jpg|thumb|left|A 1905 map of MIT's Boston campus.]]

Just two days after the issuance of the charter, the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|
first battle]] of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out. After years of delay caused by wartime funding and staffing difficulties, MIT's first classes were held in rented space at the Mercantile Building in downtown Boston in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andrews |first=Elizabeth |coauthors=Nora Murphy and Tom Rosko |year=2000 |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/wbr-visionary/ |publisher=MIT Archives |title=William Barton Rogers: MIT's Visionary Founder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was a private institution to be located in the middle of urban Boston, the new institute had a mission that matched the intent of the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] to fund institutions &quot;to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes&quot;, and was thus named a land-grant school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stratton |first1=Julius Adams |last2=Mannix |first2=Loretta H. |title=Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT |pages=251–276 |chapter=The Land-Grant Act of 1862 |isbn=0-262-19524-0 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In 1863, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts separately founded under the same act the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst#History|Massachusetts Agricultural College]], which later became the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Besides MIT, the other privately owned land-grant institution is [[Cornell University]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;BostonTech1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=When M.I.T. Was &quot;Boston Tech&quot;, 1861–1916 |last=Prescott |first=Samuel C |year=1954 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT soon came to be called &quot;Boston Tech&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BostonTech1&quot; /&gt; After surviving a period of financial uncertainties, the institute saw significant expansion in the last two decades of the 19th century under President [[Francis Amasa Walker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunbar1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=Charles F.|title=The Career of Francis Amasa Walker|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|year=1897|month=July|volume=11|issue=4|pages=446–447|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/info/1880719|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/spotlight/tea-party/ |title=Explore campus, visit Boston, and find out if MIT fits you to a tea |date=2006-12-16 |accessdate=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Munroe1923a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=James P. |last=Munroe |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company |year=1923 |title=A Life of Francis Amasa Walker |location=New York |pages=233, 382}}&lt;/ref&gt; new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to well over 1000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunbar1&quot; /&gt;
The curriculum became increasingly vocational; less and less focus was placed on theoretical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1949, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
During these &quot;Boston Tech&quot; years, MIT faculty and alumni repeatedly rejected overtures from former MIT faculty turned [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]], to merge MIT with Harvard College's [[Lawrence Scientific School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/harvard-mit/index.html |title=Alumni Petition Opposing MIT-Harvard Merger, 1904–05 |publisher=Institute Archives, MIT |accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT reinforced its independence in 1916 when it moved to its new campus on a mile-long tract on the Cambridge side of the Charles River,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Souvenir Program, Dedication of Cambridge Campus, 1916|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/pageant/index.html|work=Object of the Month|publisher=MIT Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  almost entirely on [[Land reclamation|landfill]].{{#tag:ref|A comparison of today's maps and older maps reveals that much of MIT's current campus is located on what was once the Charles River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |publisher=J.

===Curricular reforms===

In the 1930s, President [[Karl Taylor Compton]] and Vice-President (effectively [[Provost (education)|Provost]]) [[Vannevar Bush]] reformed the applied technology curriculum by re-emphasizing the importance of &quot;pure&quot; sciences like physics and chemistry and by reducing the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lecuyer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lecuyer |first=Christophe |title=The making of a science based technological university: Karl Compton, James Killian, and the reform of MIT, 1930–1957 |journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences |volume=23 |issue=1 |year=1992 |pages=153–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the challenges of the [[Great Depression]], the Compton reforms &quot;renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Lewis 1949, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion and reforms cemented MIT's academic reputation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lecuyer&quot;/&gt; though unlike [[Ivy League]] schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger L. |last=Geiger |title=To advance knowledge: the growth of American research universities, 1900–1940 |year=2004 |pages=13–15, 179–9|isbn=0-19-503803-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Institutions and Years of Admission|url=http://www.aau.edu/about/default.aspx?id=5476|publisher=Association of American Universities|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that &quot;the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school&quot;, a &quot;partly unjustified&quot; perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1949, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MITTECHNOLOGYREVIEW&quot;&gt;Bourzac, Katherine, [http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=18345 &quot;Rethinking an MIT Education: The faculty reconsiders the General Institute Requirements&quot;], ''Technology Review'', Monday, March 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences]] and the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of [[MIT School of Science|Science]] and [[MIT School of Engineering|Engineering]].

===Defense research===

MIT's involvement in  [[Military funding of science|military research]] surged during [[World War II]]. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zachary1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Zachary|first=Gregg |title=Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century |publisher= Free Press |year=1997 |pages=248–249 |isbn = 0-684-82821-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's [[Radiation Laboratory]], established in 1940 to assist the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British military]] in developing [[cavity magnetron|microwave]] [[radar]]. The work done there significantly impacted both the war and subsequent research in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadLab&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/MIT_Rad_Lab |title=MIT's Rad Lab |publisher= IEEE Global History Network |accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other defense projects included [[gyroscope]]-based and other complex [[control system]]s for [[gunsight]], [[bombsight]], and [[inertial navigation]] under [[Charles Stark Draper]]'s [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|Instrumentation Laboratory]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doc Draper &amp; His Lab|url=http://www.draper.com/doc_draper.html|work=History|publisher=The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Draper: Gyroscopic Apparatus|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/draper.html|work=Inventor of the Week|publisher=MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the development of a [[digital computer]] for flight simulations under [[Project Whirlwind]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Whirlwind|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/project-whirlwind/index.html|work=Object of the Month|publisher=MIT Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[high-speed photography|high-speed]] and [[Espionage balloon|high-altitude]] photography under [[Harold Edgerton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgerton-digital-collections.org/docs-life/wartime-strobe |accessdate=November 28, 2009 |title=Wartime Strobe: 1939–1945 – Harold &quot;Doc&quot; Edgerton |h2=Doc's Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bedi|first=Joyce|title=MIT and World War II: Ingredients for a Hot Spot of Invention|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/e-prototype_may10.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2012|newspaper=Prototype|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&amp;D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush),&lt;ref name=&quot;Zachary1&quot; /&gt; employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone&lt;ref name=&quot;RadLab&quot; /&gt; and receiving in excess of $100 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.1|1946|2012|r=1}}}} billion in 2012 dollars) before 1946.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war [[Research funding|government-sponsored research]] at MIT included [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] and guidance systems for [[ballistic missile]]s and [[Project Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leslie |first=Stuart |title = The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-231-07959-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of &quot;any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute&quot; to match the return to peacetime, remembering the &quot;academic tranquillity of the prewar years&quot;, though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1949, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of [[Karl Taylor Compton]], president of MIT between 1930 and 1948, [[James Rhyne Killian]], president from 1948 to 1957, and [[Julius Adams Stratton]], chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer merely benefited the industries it had worked so closely with three decades prior, and was much closer to its new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Lecuyer, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate program===
The four year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences, and is selective, admitting few transfer students&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot; /&gt; and 9.7% of its applicants in the 2010–2011 application season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Admittance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/faqs.html|title=MIT Facts 2012: MIT at a Glance |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/front.degre.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Degree Charts |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010–2011 academic year, 1,161 bachelor of science (abbreviated ''[[Scientiæ Baccalaureus|SB]]'') degrees were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Degrees&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Degrees Awarded|url=http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/students/degrees.html|publisher=Institutional Research, Office of the Provost|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap3.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Academic Programs |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 62.7% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (28.5%), School of Humanities, Arts, &amp; Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (1.8%). The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ({{nowrap|Course 6-2}}), Computer Science and Engineering ({{nowrap|Course 6-3}}), Mechanical Engineering ({{nowrap|Course 2}}), Physics ({{nowrap|Course 8}}), and Mathematics ({{nowrap|Course 18}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Enrollments&quot;/&gt;

All undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).&lt;ref name=&quot;GIR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap3-gir.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Undergraduate General Institute Requirements |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be &quot;communication-intensive&quot;,&lt;ref name=CommReq&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Requirement|url=http://web.mit.edu/commreq/index.html|work=Undergraduate Communication Requirement|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including &quot;substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation&quot;.&lt;ref name=CommReqFac&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty and Instructors|url=http://web.mit.edu/commreq/faculty.html|work=Undergraduate Communication Requirement|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, all students are required to complete a [[Human swimming|swimming]] test; non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of [[physical education]] classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIR&quot;/&gt;

In 1969, [[Margaret MacVicar]] founded the [[Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program]] (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects (&quot;UROPs&quot;) for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT UROP: Basic Information|url=http://web.mit.edu/UROP/basicinfo/index.html|publisher=MIT|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial majority of undergraduates participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Research and Teaching Firsts |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/special/firsts.html |accessdate=October 6, 2006 |publisher=MIT News Office |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060915023328/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/special/firsts.html |archivedate = September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program|url=http://wiki.mitadmissions.org/UROP|publisher=MIT Admissions|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students often become [[scientific journal|published]], file [[patent application]]s, and/or launch [[startup company|start-up companies]] based upon their experience in UROPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Use of Undergraduates in Research Is Hailed by M.I.T.; Inventions by Students |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Maeroff |first=Gene I. |date=January 11, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V119/N47/UROP_turns_30.47f.html |title=An MIT Original, the Oft Replicated UROP Program Reaches 30 Years |last=Palmer |first=Matthew |date=October 5, 1999 |newspaper=The Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published ''[[The Hidden Curriculum]],'' arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations, and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled &quot;[[History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Course &quot;Bibles&quot;|course bibles]]&quot;, collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers to be used as references for later students. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered the development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Snyder|title=The Hidden Curriculum|year=1970|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-69043-8|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=4398&amp;ttype=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahoney|first=Matt|title=Unwritten Rules|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/mitnews/427509/unwritten-rules/|accessdate=21 June 2012|newspaper=Technology Review|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT has 1,018 faculty members, of whom 217 are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faculty and Staff&quot;/&gt; Faculty are responsible for lecturing classes, advising both graduate and undergraduate students, and sitting on academic committees, as well as conducting original research. Between 1964 and 2009, a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT were awarded Nobel Prizes (fourteen during the last quarter century, thirteen the last 25 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nobel Foundation|title=Nobel laureates and universities|year=2009|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/universities.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize laureates by university affiliation|MIT faculty members]] past or present have won a total of twenty-seven Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/awards/nobel.html|title=Institutional Research: Nobel Prize|last=MIT, Office of the Provost|year=2009|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among current faculty and teaching staff, there are eighty [[Guggenheim Fellow]]s, six [[Fulbright Scholar]]s, and twenty-nine [[MacArthur Fellow]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faculty and Staff&quot;/&gt; Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as [[Institute Professor]]s for the remainder of their tenures.

A 1998 MIT study concluded that a systemic bias against female faculty existed in its college of science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/women/women.html |title=A Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science at MIT |publisher=MIT Faculty News Letter |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the study's methods were controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaf.edu/northern/mitstudy/ |first=Judith |last=Kleinfeld |title=MIT Tarnishes Its Reputation with Gender Junk Science |accessdate=April 10, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208134206/http://www.uaf.edu/northern/mitstudy/ |archivedate = February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment041001b.shtml |title=Feminist Mythology |first=Kathryn Jean |last=Lopez |date=April 10, 2001 |publisher=National Review |accessdate=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the study, though, women have headed departments within the Schools of Science and Engineering, and MIT has appointed several female vice presidents, although allegations of sexism continue to be made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Male Domain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/12/06/tenure_at_mit_still_largely_a_male_domain/ |title=Tenure at MIT Still Largely a Male Domain |last=Wertheimer |first=Linda |work=The Boston Globe |date=December 6, 2007 |accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Hockfield]], a molecular [[neurobiology|neurobiologist]], was MIT's president from 2004 to 2012 and was the first woman to hold the post.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hockfield&quot;/&gt;

Tenure outcomes have vaulted MIT into the national spotlight on several occasions. The 1984 dismissal of [[David F.
