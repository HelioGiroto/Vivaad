The '''Turner Controversy''' is a name given to a dispute within the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] regarding the nature of [[socialism]] instigated by [[Tony Turner (socialist)|Tony Turner]].  The dispute ultimately led to an exodus of members who went on to form the short-lived '''Movement for Social Integration'''.

When membership and activity was at a peak in the period after the [[Second World War]], Turner began giving lectures for the Party on what [[socialism]] would be like. The content of these lectures led
him to develop a position that caused enormous controversy in the Party by the early to mid-1950s and which was elaborated by Turner and his supporters in articles in the Party’s internal discussion journal of the time, ''[[Forum (journal)|Forum]]''&lt;ref name =&quot;Forum 26&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|title=Socialism - or Clause 6?, Forum 26
|location=London
|publisher=The Socialist Party of Great Britain
|year=November 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Three interlocking propositions underpinned the ‘Turnerite’ viewpoint:
# that the society of mass [[consumerism]] and [[automation|automated labour]] which [[capitalism]] had become had to be swept away in its entirety if alienation was to be abolished and a truly human community created. This meant a return to [[pre-industrial]] methods of production, on lines inspired by [[Tolstoy]] and [[William Morris]]’s ''[[News From Nowhere]]''.
# that the creation of the new socialist society was not simply in the interests of the [[working class]] but was in the interests of the whole of humanity, irrespective of class, a proposition they thought it essential for the Party to recognise in its everyday propaganda, and
# the means of creating the new peaceful and cooperative society had to be entirely peaceful, indeed [[pacifist]] (and in the view of some, possibly even gradual).
This view was in direct contradiction to the Party's Declaration of Principles, which identifies [[socialism]] as being the product of the [[class struggle]] and which states that the socialist
movement will organise for the capture of political power, including power over the state’s coercive machinery, should it need to be used against a recalcitrant anti-socialist minority.

A series of acrimonious disputes between the ‘Turnerites’ and the majority of the Party&lt;ref name =&quot;Forum 28&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|last=

|title=Socialism and Clause Six, Forum 28

|year=January 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminated in a Party referendum and then a resolution being carried at the 1955 Party Conference to the effect that all members not in agreement with the Declaration of Principles be asked to resign. Turner, having survived a previous attempt to expel him, promptly did so, along with a number of other
members including [[Joan Lestor]] (later to become a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] minister) and the psychologist [[John Rowan (psychologist)|John Rowan]]. Some of these ex-members formed a short-lived Movement for Social Integration, though, ironically enough, the impact the dispute had on the Party as a whole was almost entirely disruptive and negative. Indeed, it didn’t recover its vitality for some years, until the wave of radicalisation that grew up in the 1960s.
