The '''International Solidarity Movement''' ('''ISM''') is an organization focused on assisting the [[Palestinian cause]] in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] using [[nonviolent]] [[protest]]s. It was founded in 2001 by [[Ghassan Andoni]], a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[activist]]; [[Neta Golan]], an [[Israel]]i activist; [[Huwaida Arraf]], a [[Palestinian-American]]; and George N. Rishmawi, a Palestinian activist. [[Adam Shapiro (activist)|Adam Shapiro]], an American, joined the movement shortly after its founding and is also often considered one of the founders.

The organization calls on civilians from around the world to participate in acts of nonviolent protests against the [[Israeli military]] in the [[West Bank]] and previously the [[Gaza Strip]].

==Funding==

According to the ISM's website, &quot;International volunteers who join the ISM are responsible for paying their own way and covering all their expenses in Palestine. The ISM does not receive any funding from any state, government or association. We rely on donations from average people all over the world that support peace and the Palestinian struggle for freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/about-ism/&lt;/ref&gt; The ISM regularly sends speakers on fund-raising trips and encourages funding drives.

==Philosophy==

The organization calls on civilians from around the world to participate in acts of [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] protests against the [[Israeli military]] in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. It has recently been criticised for working alongside other groups to pressure Palestinian artists to boycott the [[One Voice Peace Summit]] and for helping to undermine the Summit by creating a competing event.  ISM and affiliated groups critical of the Summit say that One Voice fails to fully support Palestinian rights guaranteed under [[international law]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===ISM's position on violence===

The ISM's website describes the organization as a &quot;Palestinian-led movement committed to resisting the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land using nonviolent, direct-action methods and principles&quot;. It emphasizes international volunteers are not there to &quot;teach nonviolent resistance&quot; but to support resistance through nonviolent direct action, emergency mobilization and documentation.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://palsolidarity.org/about About ISM] on ISM website.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspaper]] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called ISM &quot;the 'peace' group that embraces violence&quot; because its mission statement recognises &quot;armed struggle&quot; as the &quot;right&quot; of Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement in question is taken from the ISM Mission Statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As enshrined in international law and UN resolutions , we recognize the Palestinian right to resist Israeli violence and occupation via legitimate armed struggle. However, we believe that nonviolence can be a powerful weapon in fighting oppression and we are committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ISM further explains on its website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ISM does not support or condone any acts of terrorism – which is not legitimate armed struggle. The ISM does not associate, support, or have anything to do with armed or violent resistance to the occupation. The ISM does not assist or engage in any kind of armed resistance, no matter what form it may take.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This right to resist occupation applies not only to the Palestinian people, but to all peoples who are faced with a military occupation. The ISM regards all people as equals with equal rights under international law. We believe that nonviolent action is a powerful weapon in fighting oppression and are committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

During a [[CNN]] interview, [[Paula Zahn]] with Adam Shapiro and Huwaida Arraf asked about an article they had co-authored which stated: &quot;Palestinian resistance must take on a variety of characteristics, both violent and nonviolent. But most importantly, it must develop a strategy involving both aspects. Nonviolent resistance is no less noble than carrying out a suicide operation.&quot; She noted that &quot;some people could lead to the conclusion that you were promoting suicide bombing.&quot; Shapiro and Arraf replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The article that we wrote was actually in response to another article written by a Palestinian, who said the Palestinians could not be nonviolent. And so we were addressing within the context of the debate over whether the Palestinians could use violence or could not use nonviolence or could use nonviolence. So it was, first of all, within that context...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There already is violence. We’re not advocating it. It’s already there. It’s on the ground. We’re working with people and with Palestinians who want to promote nonviolence, and that was the context of the whole article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/10/ltm.08.html Interview with Adam Shapiro, Huwaida Arraf, Activists] (May 10, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Activism tactics===
{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}
Past ISM campaigns have used the following tactics:

*Acting to deter military operations. Some ISM volunteers object to the use of the term ''[[human shield]]'' to describe their work because, they argue, in a Palestinian context the expression more usually refers to forced use of captive Palestinians by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) when searching Palestinian neighborhoods. They argue that the IDF is far more likely to shoot the darker skinned Palestinian civilians than white western looking activists, given the difference in international response. This tactic is colloquially referred to as the &quot;white-face defense&quot;.
*Accompanying Palestinians to minimize alleged harassment by [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settler]]s or soldiers, for example ensuring that queues at Israeli checkpoints are processed efficiently and providing witnesses and intermediaries during annual olive harvests, which are often disrupted by settlers and police.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
*Removing roadblocks. These are large unmanned mounds of earth and concrete on roads throughout the [[West Bank]], and sometimes placed at the entrances of Palestinian villages by the IDF, thereby isolating those villages' inhabitants by preventing traffic in or out.
*Attempting to block military vehicles such as [[tank]]s and [[bulldozer]]s.
*Violating Israeli [[curfew]] orders enforced on Palestinian areas in order to monitor Israeli military actions, deliver food and medicine to Palestinian homes, or escort medical personnel to help facilitate their work.
*Interfering with the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]] and placing political graffiti on the wall.
*Entering areas designated as &quot;closed military zones&quot; by the Israeli military. This is not really a 'strategy' as such, but is a prerequisite for ISM being able to conduct many of the above activities as areas in which the ISM is active are often summarily designated as &quot;closed military zones&quot; by the IDF.
*Attempting to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip by supporting and participating in initiatives to send vessels through the naval blockade to Gaza.

==Noteworthy ISM events==
*The ISM received extensive media coverage of its presence in [[Yasser Arafat]]'s compound in [[Ramallah]] and at the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]].
*On Aug. 8, 2006, ISM activist [[Adam Shapiro (activist)|Adam Shapiro]] announced that a group of ISM activists was traveling to southern [[Lebanon]] to attempt to deliver aid and show solidarity with suffering residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/08082006/6/n-world-activists-trickle-lebanon-protest-israel-war.html Activists trickle to Lebanon to protest Israel war] (via [[Yahoo!]] News)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nobel Peace Prize nominations===
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
*ISM was nominated for the 2004 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by [[Svend Robinson]], a former [[New Democratic Party]] Member of the [[Parliament of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulsetc.com/article.php?sid=448]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/critiques/All_Wet_in_Toronto.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydney.indymedia.org.au/node/11605 Full Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISM casualties by the Israeli Army===

According to ISM volunteer Joe Carr stated that Israeli troops were always careful not to hurt ISM volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnews.com/view.asp?ID=1520 Israel e-News: The Myth of Rachel Corrie]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of controversial incidents have taken place.

====Deaths====

=====Rachel Corrie=====
{{Main|Rachel Corrie}}
[[File:Rachel Corrie 2003 March 16 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Rachel Corrie]] stands before Israeli [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] bulldozers]]
ISM volunteer [[Rachel Corrie]] was killed as she attempted to block an [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) [[bulldozer]] conducting military operations in [[Rafah]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] on March 16, 2003. Controversy surrounds her death. An internal [[Israel Defence Forces|IDF]] investigation concluded that Corrie's death was an accident but ISM eyewitnesses vehemently dispute this account, contending that the bulldozer driver deliberately struck Corrie as she was protesting in plain view.  The IDF claims that tapes of the event show Corrie below the driver's eye level, and also contend that the noise level was too loud for Ms. Corrie to be heard. The activities of the bulldozer she was blocking are also subject to disagreement — ISM claim it was preparing to demolish the home of a Palestinian pharmacist. Other accounts backed by the film footage claim that the bulldozer was not near a house but was removing shrubbery covering an arms smuggling tunnel — according to an article in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name=&quot;motherjones&quot;&gt;Hammer, Joshua. [http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/09/ma_497_01.html The Death of Rachel Corrie.] ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]].'' September/October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; hotly disputed by the ISM, Israeli authorities claimed that the crew's assignment was to sweep the area for booby traps planted by militants. The IDF itself has never explicitly claimed that the house contained a tunnel and two tunnels were found when the home was eventually demolished 9 months later.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

George Rishmawi of the ISM told the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' that: &quot;When Palestinians get shot by Israeli soldiers, no one is interested anymore. But if some of these foreign volunteers get shot or even killed, then the international media will sit up and take notice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/S-F-Jewish-activist-held-as-security-threat-in-2708205.php S.F. Jewish activist held as security threat in Israel] (via [[San Francisco Chronicle]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrie's parents brought lawsuits in the United States and in Israel, but in both cases, they lost the suit. In Israel, in August 2012, the court said that Corrie could have avoided danger.  The court ruled that Israel was not at fault for Corrie’s death, and there was neither intent nor negligence involved in her death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haifa verdict&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/rachel-corries-death-ruled-accidental-by-haifa-high-court/ | title=Haifa District Court rejects damages claim in Rachel Corrie case | publisher=The Times of Israel | date=August 28, 2012 | accessdate=August 28, 2012 | author=Friedman, Matti}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge also said that Israel's investigation was appropriate and did not contain mistakes. The judge also criticized the U.S. for failing to send a diplomatic representative to observe Corrie's autopsy.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPost Court verdict&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=282862 | title=Haifa court rules against Rachel Corrie family in suit | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | work=The Jerusalem Post | date=August 28, 2012 | accessdate=August 28, 2012 | author=Bob, Yonah Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tom Hurndall=====
{{Main|Tom Hurndall|Taysir Hayb}}
On April 11, 2003 [[Israel Defense Forces]] soldier [[Taysir Hayb]] shot ISM volunteer [[Tom Hurndall]] in the head. Hurndall, who had been aiding Palestinians in [[Gaza]], died of his wound in January 2004. Hurndall was unarmed, dressed in the bright orange jacket of the International Solidarity Movement, and steering two Palestinian children away from an Israeli tank-mounted machine gun shooting in their direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/2003/04/11/statement-tom-hurndall-shooting/ ISM: Israeli soldier shoots British ISM activist Tom Hurndall in Gaza] (11 April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/2003/04/12/ism-rafah-statement-hurndall/ ISM Rafah: Statement on the shooting of Thomas Hurndall] (12 April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/jan/22/guardianobituaries.israel &quot;As IDF rifle fire hit the mound, the children fled.

IDF Sergeant [[Taysir Hayb]] claimed he had shot at a man in military fatigues who was firing at the soldiers with a pistol, in the no-go security zone. This was at odds with the ISM's account, confirmed by photographic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents fight to learn why Israeli sniper shot their son|work=[[The Guardian]], 30 January 2005|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1401737,00.html|accessdate=27 May 2007 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Townsend | date=2005-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently Hayb admitted fabricating his account of events. On 10 May 2004, Taysir Hayb's trial commenced on one charge of manslaughter in the death of Tom Hurndall, two counts of obstruction of justice, one count each of submitting false testimony, obtaining false testimony, and unbecoming behaviour. Hurndall's family pressed for a murder charge through the Israeli courts.&lt;ref name=Atkinson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/2003/04/11/statement-tom-hurndall-shooting/ ISM statement on the killing of Tom Hurndall]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/2003/04/12/ism-rafah-statement-hurndall/ ISM Rafah Statement on the shooting of Tom Hurndall]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, Sgt.

[[Australia]]n ISM volunteer Kate Edwards sustained internal injuries from a  bullet in [[Beit Jala]].    She and other volunteers marched on Israeli lines.     After the event,  Kate Edwards was quoted as stating &quot;We were walking up the hill from Bethlehem when a tank came down the hill towards us. I could see a man in the tank and he was shouting at us to go back.

I was very close to him when he was shot. I was only a few feet away. The demonstration had been going for several hours. It was wrapping up; it was almost over. Most people had already gone home. We were standing on some grass nearby a village mosque, and Tristan was taking pictures [when] he was shot in the head with the extended range tear gas canister.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/16/us_consul_general_says_awaiting_israeli Democracy Now! | US Consul General Says Awaiting Israeli Report on IDF Shooting of American Citizen], [[Democracy Now]], March 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==

{{see also|Defending_America_for_Knowledge_and_Action#Criticism_of_pro-Palestinian.2Fanti-Israel_groups}}

===Position of Israeli Foreign Ministry===
The Israeli [[Israel Foreign Affairs Ministry|Foreign Ministry]] reported that two terrorists involved in the [[Mike's Place suicide bombing]] forged &quot;links with foreign left wing activists and members of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM).&quot; The MFA also says that &quot;ISM members take an active part in illegal and violent actions against IDF soldiers. At times, their activity in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip is under the auspices of Palestinian terrorist organizations, and that sometimes, &quot;ISM members, who seek entry into Israel, often do so under false pretenses, via cover stories - entry for matrimonial, tourist, religious and other purposes - which they coordinate prior to arriving in Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2003/Details+of+April+30-+2003+Tel+Aviv+suicide+bombing.htm Details of April 30, 2003 Tel Aviv suicide bombing]&lt;/ref&gt; However, ISM reports that visitors at the border who identify as ISM volunteers, almost always will be denied entry by the Israeli border control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://palsolidarity.org/join/travel/ Travel Information &amp; Tips]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member's work with Hamas and Islamic Jihad===

The Israeli government asserted ISM activist Susan Barclay had &quot;ties with Palestinian terrorist groups&quot;. She stated she worked with representatives of [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] in organising a nonviolent protest.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Skolnik, [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/113302_shield20.shtml Activist's death focuses spotlight on Mideast struggle], [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] March 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadi Sukiya case===
{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}
On March 27, 2003, [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Shadi Sukiya]] was arrested in by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in ISM [[Jenin]]. The Israeli government claimed that Sukiya was a senior [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad|Islamic Jihad]] member, and that he was aided by two ISM activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2003/Senior%20Islamic%20Jihad%20terrorist%20arrested%20while%20hidi] [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2525513,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both parties stated that Sukiya arrived at the ISM's office as he was being pursued through the streets of Jenin by IDF soldiers during an Israeli-imposed curfew. According to the ISM's account, he had been going door to door looking for a place to go, arrived at the building (which is also used by the [[Red Cross]] and [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Medecins Sans Frontieres]]) cold and wet, and was offered a chance to dry and warm up by an ISM volunteer.

The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] originally suggested that two [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] [[assault rifle]]s and a handgun were found on the premises, but subsequently backtracked on the allegation.

In May 2003, [[Adam Shapiro (activist)|Adam Shapiro]] from ISM stated that Sukiya was not named a &quot;senior Islamic Jihad terrorist&quot; by any official Israeli military or government source, and was being held in administrative detention in Israel without any charge.
