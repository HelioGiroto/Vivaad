==Etymology==
Pronounced {{IPA|[[Australian English phonology|[əˈstɹæɪljə, -liə]]]}} in [[Australian English]],&lt;ref&gt;Australian pronunciations: ''[[Macquarie Dictionary|Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition]]'' (2005). Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. ISBN 1-876429-14-3&lt;/ref&gt; the name ''[[List of country name etymologies#A|Australia]]'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''australis'', meaning &quot;southern&quot;. The country has been referred to colloquially as ''Oz'' since the early 20th century.{{#tag:ref|The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records a first occurrence in 1908, in the form ''Oss''. ''Oz'' is often taken as an oblique reference to the fictional Land of Oz in the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (1900).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, H., ''In the Land of Oz'', Penguin, 1988, ISBN 0-14-010966-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Australians' &quot;image of Australia as a 'Land of Oz' is not new, and dedication to it runs deep&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Americana Annual: 1988'', Americana Corporation, vol.&amp;nbsp;13, 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;66, ISBN 0-7172-0220-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''Oz'' is likely to have been influenced by the 1939 film, though the pronunciation was probably always with a /z/, as it is also for ''Aussie'', sometimes spelt ''Ozzie''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Partridge|Partridge, Eric]], et al., ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006, ISBN 0-415-25938-X, entries &quot;Oz&quot; and &quot;Ozzie&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;1431.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baz Luhrmann]] film ''[[Australia (2008 film)#Recurring motifs|Australia]]'' (2008) makes repeated reference to ''The Wizard of Oz'', which appeared just before the wartime action of ''Australia''. Some critics have even speculated that Baum was inspired by Australia, in naming the ''Land of Oz'': &quot;In ''Ozma of Oz'' (1907), Dorothy gets back to Oz as the result of a storm at sea while she and Uncle Henry are travelling by ship to Australia. So, like Australia, Oz is somewhere to the west of California. Like Australia, Oz is an island continent. Like Australia, Oz has inhabited regions bordering on a great desert. One might almost imagine that Baum intended Oz to be Australia, or perhaps a magical land in the center of the great Australian desert.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, J., &quot;Australia as the Land of Oz&quot;, ''American Speech'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;65, No.&amp;nbsp;1, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;86–89.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;N&quot;|name=&quot;Oss&quot;}} ''[[Aussie]]'' is a common colloquial term for &quot;Australian&quot;. In neighbouring [[New Zealand]] the term &quot;Aussie&quot; is sometimes applied as a noun to the nation as well as its residents.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Harvey, [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10494046 Aussie farewell to life in &quot;Kiwi&quot;].

Legends of ''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Incognita]]''—an &quot;unknown land of the South&quot;—date back to Roman times and were commonplace in medieval geography, although not based on any documented knowledge of the continent. Following European discovery, names for the Australian landmass were often references to the famed ''Terra Australis''.

The earliest recorded use of the word ''Australia'' in English was in 1625 in &quot;A note of Australia del Espíritu Santo, written by Sir Richard Hakluyt&quot;, published by [[Samuel Purchas]] in ''Hakluytus Posthumus'', a corruption of the original Spanish name &quot;Tierra Austral del Espíritu Santo&quot; (Southern Land of the Holy Spirit)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63620938 |title=THE ILLUSTRATED SYDNEY NEWS. |newspaper=[[List of newspapers in Australia|Illustrated Sydney News (NSW : 1853 – 1872)]] |location=NSW |date=26 January 1888 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for an island in [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Purchas, vol. iv, pp. 1422–32, 1625.

The name ''Australia'' was popularised by the explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], who pushed for it to be formally adopted as early as 1804. When preparing his manuscript and charts for his 1814 ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'', he was persuaded by his patron, [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], to use the term ''Terra Australis'' as this was the name most familiar to the public. Flinders did so, but allowed himself the footnote: {{quote|&quot;Had I permitted myself any innovation on the original term, it would have been to convert it to Australia; as being more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Matthew|last=Flinders|year=1814|title=[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]|publisher=G. and W.

==States and territories==
{{Main|States and territories of Australia}}
{{Australia states imagemap}}

Australia has six [[federated state|states]] — [[New South Wales]] (NSW), [[Queensland]] (QLD), [[South Australia]] (SA), [[Tasmania]] (TAS), [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC), and [[Western Australia]] (WA) — and two major [[mainland]] territories — the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT). In most respects these two territories function as states, but the Commonwealth Parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments. By contrast, federal legislation overrides state legislation only in areas that are set out in [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution]]; state parliaments retain all residual legislative powers, including those over schools, state police, the state judiciary, roads, public transport, and local government, since these do not fall under the provisions listed in Section 51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-government/state-and-territory-government|title=State and Territory Government|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state and major mainland territory has its own [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|parliament]]—[[unicameralism|unicameral]] in the Northern Territory, the ACT, and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The [[lower house]]s are known as the [[Legislative Assembly]] (the [[House of Assembly]] in South Australia and Tasmania); the [[upper house]]s are known as the [[Legislative Council]]. The [[head of government|head of the government]] in each state is the [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]], and in each territory the [[Chief Minister]]. The [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen]] is represented in each state by a [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]]; and in the Northern Territory, the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|Administrator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/administrator.shtml|publisher=Government House Northern Territory|title=Role of the Administrator|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/category.php?id=2|publisher=Governor–General of the Commonwealth of Australia|title=Governor-General's Role|accessdate=30 March 2010| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080804130529/http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/category.php?id=2| archivedate = 4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal parliament directly administers the following territories:&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAfactbook&quot; /&gt;

* [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]]
* [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]
* [[Christmas Island]]
* [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]
* [[Coral Sea Islands]]
* [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]]
* [[Jervis Bay Territory]], a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales

[[Norfolk Island]] is also technically an external territory; however, under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 it has been granted more autonomy and is governed locally by its own legislative assembly. The Queen is represented by an [[List of administrative heads of Norfolk Island|Administrator]], currently [[Owen Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080806021653/http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Territories_of_AustraliaNorfolk_IslandAdministrator_of_Norfolk_Island|url=http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Territories_of_AustraliaNorfolk_Island |publisher=Australian Government Attorney-General's Department |title=Administrator of Norfolk Island|archivedate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign relations and military==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Australia|Australian Defence Force}}
Over recent decades, [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's foreign relations]] have been driven by a close association with the [[United States]] through the [[ANZUS|ANZUS pact]], and by a desire to develop relationships with Asia and the Pacific, particularly through [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the [[East Asia Summit]] following its accession to the [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia]], and in 2011 attended the [[Sixth East Asia Summit]] in Indonesia.

About 22 per cent of the population stated &quot;[[Irreligion in Australia|no religion]]&quot; (which includes [[secular humanism|humanism]], [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[rationalism]]). The largest non-Christian religion in Australia is [[Buddhism]] (2.5 per cent), followed by [[Islam]] (2.2 per cent), [[Hinduism]] (1.3 per cent) and [[Judaism]] (0.5 per cent).

Prior to European settlement in Australia, the animist beliefs of Australia's indigenous people had been practised for millennia. In the case of mainland [[Aboriginal Australians]], their spirituality is known as the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]] and it places a heavy emphasis on belonging to the land. The collection of stories that it contains shaped Aboriginal law and customs. [[Aboriginal art]], story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. In the case of the [[Torres Strait Islanders]] who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, spirituality and customs reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea. The 1996 Australian census counted more than 7000 respondents as followers of a traditional Aboriginal religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s790117.htm |title=Indigenous Traditions – Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=14 December 1999 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney1234.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney|St Mary's Catholic Cathedral]], Sydney, built to a design by [[William Wardell]]. About a quarter of Australians are Roman Catholic.]]
Since the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] of British ships  in 1788, Christianity has grown to be the major religion. Consequently, the Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are public holidays, the skylines of Australian cities and towns are marked by church and cathedral spires, and the Christian churches have played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services in Australia. The [[Catholic education in Australia|Catholic education]] system operates as the largest non-government educator, accounting for about 21 per cent of all secondary enrolments at the close of the 2000s (decade), with [[Catholic Health Australia]] similarly being the largest non-government provider. Christian welfare organisations also play a prominent role within national life, with organisations like the [[Salvation Army]], [[St Vincent de Paul Society]] and [[Anglicare]] enjoying widespread support. Such contributions are recognised on Australia's currency, with the presence of Christian pastors like Aboriginal writer [[David Unaipon]] ($50); founder of the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]], [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]] ($20); and [[Catherine Helen Spence]] ($5) who was Australia's first female candidate for political office. Other significant Australian religious figures have included St. [[Mary MacKillop]], who became the first Australian to be recognised as a [[saint]] by the Roman Catholic Church in 2010 and [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] pastor Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]], who, like [[Martin Luther King]] in the United States, led a movement against racial inequality in Australia and was also the first indigenous Australian to be appointed as a State Governor.

For much of Australian history the [[Church of England]] (now known as the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]) was the largest religious affiliation, however multicultural immigration has contributed to a decline in its relative position, with the Roman Catholic Church benefiting from the opening of post-war Australia to multicultural immigration and becoming the largest group. Similarly, [[Islam in Australia|Islam]], [[Buddhism in Australia|Buddhism]], [[Hinduism in Australia|Hinduism]] and [[History of the Jews in Australia|Judaism]] have all been expanding in the post war decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/CO-61?opendocument&amp;navpos=620|title=2011 Census reveals Hinduism as the fastest growing religion in Australia|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly attendance at church services in 2001 was about 1.5 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2250&amp;track=82083 NCLS releases latest estimates of church attendance], National Church Life Survey, Media release, 28 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; (about 7.8 per cent of the population).&lt;ref&gt;Australian population in 2001 was 19,358,000, according to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'s ''Book of the Year'' 2002, World Data, p548.&lt;/ref&gt;
