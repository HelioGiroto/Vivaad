The '''Audre Lorde Project''' is a [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]]-based organization for [[queer]] [[people of color]]. The organization concentrates on [[community organizing]] and radical [[nonviolent]] activism around [[Progressivism|progressive]] issues within [[New York City]], especially relating to [[queer]] and [[transgender]] communities, [[AIDS]] and [[HIV]] activism, pro-[[immigrant]] activism, [[prison reform]] and organizing among youth of color. It is named for the lesbian poet and activist [[Audre Lorde]] and was founded in 1994.

==History==
The purpose of the Project emerged from &quot;the expressed need for innovative and unified community strategies to address the multiple issues impacting LGBTST People of Color communities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Audre Lorde Project&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://alp.org/about About the Audre Lorde Project]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the organization moved into its permanent home in the [[Fort Greene]] neighborhood of Brooklyn, parish house of [[Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Audre Lorde Project&quot;/&gt;

The Project was begun to &quot;serve as a home base&quot; for queer peoples of African/Black/Caribbean, Arab, Asian and Pacific Islander, Latina/o and Native/Indigenous descent can work to further a collective history of struggle against discrimination and other forms of oppression.&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Audre Lorde Project&quot;/&gt;

===Radical politics and nonviolence===
The Project's decision-making structure seeks to be &quot;representative of our communities&quot; and acts to promote existing queer people of color organizations, cultural workers and activists. The organization also acts in an explicitly [[feminist]], [[anti-sexist]] practice because it believes women's leadership &quot;continues to be de-valued and discouraged in broader LGBTST organizations/communities.&quot; In the public arena, it often engages in nonviolent civil disobedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Audre Lorde Project&quot;/&gt;

==Campaigns and Working Groups==
===Safe OUTside the System: the SOS Collective===
The Collective is an anti-violence organization focusing on [[homophobic]], [[transphobia|transphobic]] and queerphobic violence targeting people of color, in particular in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of Brooklyn.{{fact|date=February 2012}} The Collective organizes outside of the existing judicial/policing system, declaring that &quot;strategies that increase the police presence and the criminalization of our communities do not create safety.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alp.org&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://alp.org/community/sos Safe OUTside the System: The SOS Collective]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally called the Working Group on Police and State Violence, it began in 1997 in response to a rise in street violence and police harassment the organization believed was connected to the &quot;[[quality of life]]&quot; policies of Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alp.org&quot;/&gt;

The group helped to found the [[Coalition Against Police Brutality]] and [[People's Justice 2000]] soon after the killings by police officers of unarmed men of color [[Amadou Diallo]] and [[Abner Louima]], as well as annual [[Racial Justice Day]]s, focusing on the appeals of families of color who suffered violence by the [[NYPD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alp.org&quot;/&gt;

The Collective manages the legal case for [[Jalea Lamot]], a [[trans woman]] who was arrested and brutalized by [[NYCHA]] police.&lt;ref name=&quot;alp.org&quot;/&gt;

As part of a broader anti-violence and [[Anti-oppressive practice|anti-oppression]] approach, the Collective has collaborated with other progressive organizations, including the [[Murder of Rashawn Brazell|Rashawn Brazell Memorial Fund]], the [[Third World Within-Peace Action Coalition]], [[Racial Justice 911]], [[Al-Fatiha Foundation]] and the [[American Friends Service Committee]], following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The Collective's &quot;war against terror meetings&quot; focused on how homophobia and [[transphobia]] are a part of the policies of the United States' [[war on terror]].{{fact|date=February 2012}} Following the start of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003, SOS helped to coordinate [[Operation Homeland Resistance]], civil disobedience protesting the war.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://alp.org/community Safe OUTside the System: The SOS Collective]&quot;. Also see &quot;[http://www.afsc.org/ht/d/ContentDetails/i/3835 AFSC Support of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) People]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===TransJustice===
TransJustice is an advocacy organization created by and for [[Transgender|trans]] and [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]] people of color. The group focuses on trans-related policies in jobs, housing and health care, including job training programs, resisting [[transphobic]] violence, HIV services and trans-sensitive medical services.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://alp.org/tj TransJustice]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working Group on Immigrant Rights===
The Working Group on Immigrant Rights consists of volunteers who are queer people of color born outside of the United States (including [[Puerto Rico]]). The working group seeks in particular to build the leadership of [[undocumented immigrants]], low-wage workers and trans, two-spirit and gender non-conforming immigrants. Every campaign is required to be relevant to these &quot;priority communities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Working Group on Immigrant Rights&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://alp.org/node/271 Working Group on Immigrant Rights]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also places itself within the global justice and peace movements, and acts in [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] with [[Oppression#Resistance|liberation struggles]] throughout the world. The working group's members &quot;reject the us/them divide of citizens and foreigners, and are working toward a US [[foreign policy]] rooted in [[nonviolence]], fair distribution of resources, and equity. We also recognize that the War on Terrorism is both a war abroad and a war at home, oppressing our communities in many places at once.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Working Group on Immigrant Rights&quot;/&gt;

The organization went on record in 2006 as opposing the three-tier &quot;path to legalization&quot; legislation (the [[S. 2611|Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act]]) and guest worker programs, declaring that &quot;full legalization is a nonnegotiable demand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://alp.org/whatwedo/statements/nooneisillegal For All The Ways They Say We Are, No One Is Illegal]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The group seeks to increase understanding of transphobia and homophobia within immigrants rights and social justice movements and immigrant communities within New York City.

In 2004, the working group published a report, &quot;Communities at a Crossroads: U.S. Right Wing Policies and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two Spirit and Transgender Immigrants of Color in New York City.&quot;

===Facilities Program===
The Audre Lorde Project acts to &quot;build capacity and support the organizational development&quot; of queer people of color organizations by making available the Project's meeting space, office infrastructure and training as well as offering technical assistance, networking and coalition-building opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://alp.org/about Facilities Program: Capacity-Building and Technical Assistance for LGBTSTGNC People of Color Groups]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000, then-executive director [[Joo-Hyun Kang]] was awarded the [[Union Square Award]] from the [[Fund for the City of New York]]. In its award, the fund declared the Audre Lorde Project to be &quot;an important cultural and information center in New York City.&quot;{{fact|date=February 2012}}
