'''Indirect election''' is a process in which voters in an [[election]] do not actually choose between [[candidate]]s for an office but rather elect persons who will then make the choice.  It is one of the oldest form of elections and is still used today for many [[upper house]]s and presidents. This process is also used in many [[trade union|union]] elections and sometimes in professional, civic, and fraternal organizations.

Some examples of indirectly elected bodies and individuals include:
*the [[United States presidential election|election of the US President]] is an indirect election. Voters elect the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]], which then elects the President. The [[President of Germany]] is similarly elected by a [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] convened for that purpose. [[President of India|India]] and several other countries have a President or other largely ceremonial [[head of state]] elected by their parliament.  
*the Parliamentary Assemblies of the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[Western European Union|WEU]] and [[NATO]] - in all of these cases, voters elect national parliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly
*the election of the government in most [[parliamentary system]]s - the voters elect the parliamentarians, who then elect the government including most prominently the [[prime minister]] from among themselves
*the German [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], where voters elect the [[Landtag]] members, who then elect the state government, which then appoints its members to the Bundesrat
*most bodies formed of representatives of national governments, e.g. the [[United Nations General Assembly]], can be considered indirectly elected (assuming the national governments are [[democratically elected]] in the first place)
*the Indian [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house of parliament) is indirectly elected, largely by state legislatures; [[Manmohan Singh]] was a member of the Rajya Sabha but chosen by the majority party in the [[Manmohan Singh#14th Lok Sabha|Lok Sabha]] (lower house of parliament) as the Prime Minister (2004- ); as such, Singh as Prime Minister had never won a direct or popular election; introduced as a &quot;[[technocracy|technocrat]]&quot;
*the [[US Senate]] was indirectly elected by state legislatures until, after a number of attempts over the previous century, the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th amendment to the constitution]] was ratified in 1913. 

Many countries with parliamentary systems elect their president indirectly ([[President of Germany|Germany]], [[President of Italy|Italy]], [[President of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[President of Estonia|Estonia]], [[President of Latvia|Latvia]], [[President of Hungary|Hungary]], [[President of India|India]], [[President of Israel|Israel]]).

In a [[Westminster system]], the leader of the majority party in the parliament almost always becomes the [[prime minister]]. Therefore, it could be said that the prime minister is elected indirectly.
*in the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister usually is a member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the lower, elected house of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]

In [[Spain]], the [[Congress of Deputies]] votes on a [[motion of confidence]] of the [[Monarchy of Spain|king's]] nominee ([[Constitutional convention (political custom)|customarily]] the party leader whose party controls the Congress) and the nominee's [[political manifesto]], an example of an indirect election of the [[Spanish Prime Minister|Prime Minister of Spain]].

Indirect political elections have been used for lesser national offices, as well.  In the United States, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] was elected by the legislatures of the states until 1913, when the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] instituted direct elections for those office-holders. In [[France]], election to the upper house of Parliament, the [[French Senate|Sénat]], is indirect, with the electors (called &quot;grands électeurs&quot;) being local elected representatives.

The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] of the [[United States]], whose task is to elect a president, is a form of indirect election. However, electors rarely change their actual vote from their pledged vote. Although historically some electors have changed their pledge vote (referred to as [[faithless elector]]s), including in the [[2000 United States Presidential Election|2000 election]], this factor has never made the difference in an election.
