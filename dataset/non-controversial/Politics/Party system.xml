      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25695">{{Party politics}}
A '''party system''' is a concept in comparative [[political science]] concerning the system of government by [[political party|political parties]] in a democratic country. The idea is that political parties have basic similarities: they control the [[government]], have a stable base of mass popular support, and create internal mechanisms for controlling funding, information and nominations.

The concept was originated by European scholars studying the United States, especially [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] and [[Moisey Ostrogorsky]], and has been expanded to cover other democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Sartori (1976); Lipset and Rokkan (1967); Karvonen and Kuhnle (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Giovanni Sartori]] devised the most widely used classification method for party systems. He suggested that party systems should be classified by the number of relevant parties and the degree of fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Sartori (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Party systems can be distinguished by the [[effective number of parties]].&lt;ref&gt;Golosov, Grigorii V. (2010): The Effective Number of Parties: A New Approach. ''Party Politics'', 16(2):171-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Party systems per country ==
=== Europe ===
==== European Union ====
Two structures of party system have been identified in the [[European Parliament]] since its first [[universal suffrage|universal]] direct election in 1979, albeit the main EU party groups remained the same&lt;ref&gt;Simon Hix, &quot;A supranational party system and the legitimacy of the European Union&quot;, ''The International Spectator'', 4/2002, pp.50-59&lt;/ref&gt;:
* 1979&amp;ndash;1994: a system split in two blocs on the left/right dimension, with the left bloc ([[Party of European Socialists|Socialists]], [[European United Left (1989–1993)|Radical Left]] and [[European Green Party|Greens]]) opposing a right bloc ([[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|Populars]], [[Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|Liberals]], [[European Democratic Union|Gaullists]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]])
* 1994-onwards: a system in which the three central parties ([[European People's Party|EPP]], [[Party of European Socialists|PES]] and [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party|ELDR]]) have voted as much with each other as with their smaller allies, thus 'governing' the system, and facing different oppositions from the left ([[Party of the European Left|European Left]] and [[European Green Party|Greens]] and leftist [[euroskeptic]]s) and from the right ([[European Democratic Union|Gaullists]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]], rightist [[euroskeptic]]s and [[Alliance of Independent Democrats in Europe|nationalists]]).

==== Italy ====
Italian party systems are usually considered only since the foundation of the [[Italian Republic]] (1946) as pre-[[fascist]] parties lacked a wide popular base.

The party system of the so-called ''First Republic'' (1946–1994), though based on a proportional electoral law, saw the dominance of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) and the ''conventio ad excludendum'' against the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI). DC and PCI together gathered around 85% of the votes in average. The system was thus a blocked bipolar system; governments were very short (in average lasting less than one year) and post-electoral, but the supporting parties and personnel could not change.
With time, some parties (especially the [[Italian Socialist Party]], PSI) gained momentum, till reaching the role of government-making in the 1980s. The system was completely destroyed by the bribery scandals of [[Tangentopoli]], which shattered DC and PSI.
According to [[Sartori]], the two possible degenerations of [[proportionalism]] (fragmentation and lack of party discipline) were reduced by two factors: the stron role of parties (&quot;''partitocrazia''&quot;) and the polarization between Christian-democrats and communists. Therefore, the ''first republic'' saw a maximum level of 5 effective parties, with only one dominant party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/editoriali/10_novembre_07/sartori-che-fare_602ef5ea-ea47-11df-acba-00144f02aabc.shtml Corriere della Sera], 8 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''Second Republic'' party system (since 1994) bears the following characteristic marks:
* a majoritarian electoral law, introduced by referendum in 1993, which brought about a bi-polarization of the game (although limited by the 1/4 of votes still gathered proportionally)
* the birth of [[Forza Italia]] as personal party of [[Silvio Berlusconi]], with a strong polarization effect
* the raise of new parties (the environmentalists [[Federation of the Greens|Verdi]] and the autonomist [[Lega Nord]] since the late 1980s, [[Alleanza Nazionale]] through a reform of the post-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]])
* the split of old parties (between reformed post-communist [[Democratic Party of the Left]] and neo-communists of [[Rifondazione Comunista]]; between left-wing and right-wing of old Christian Democrats and Socialists, siding with or against Berlusconi)
Though more fragmented in the number of parties, the system was bipolar in its functioning. With time, both sides saw a strengthening of coalitions (even if with ups and downs) and the birth of unified parties (the [[Ulivo]] federation and then the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] on the left, and the [[People of Freedom]] party on the right side).
The change in the electoral law in 2005 and the return to proportionality (although with a majority premium able to transform, in the lower chamber, the plurality in a 55% majority) didn't bring about a return to collusion, while still leaving such prospect open for the future.

==== Germany ====
The 2009 Bundestag election in Germany was characterized by widespread public apathy and record low voter turnout.  Weldon and Nüsser (2010) argue that it solidified a new stable, but fluid five-party system that they see as a defining feature of the emerging German political system. The three minor parties each achieved historical bests at the polls with steep losses for the two traditional Volksparteien.  They report that the increased volatility and fluidity of the party system is structured along the left-right ideological spectrum with the parties divided into two major camps and vote-switching much more likely within the respective camps rather than between them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Weldon and Andrea Nüsser, &quot;Bundestag Election 2009: Solidifying the Five Party System&quot;, ''German Politics and Society'', 9/30/2010, Vol. 28 Issue 3, pp 47-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 election also marked a devastating defeat for the SPD, leading some commentators to speculate about the end of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) as a &quot;catch-all party&quot; and, against the backdrop of recent poor performance of center-left parties all across Europe—perhaps even &quot;the end of social democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William E. Paterson, and James Sloam, &quot;The SPD and the Debacle of the 2009 German Federal Election: An Opportunity for Renewal&quot;, ''German Politics and Society'', 9/30/2010, Vol. 28 Issue 3, pp 65-81&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central and Eastern Europe ====
Four party systems have been identified in post-communist countries of Central-Eastern Europe&lt;ref&gt;Agh (1998) and Oppelland (2003), as quoted by Schmitt and Thomassed, &quot;The EU Party System after Eastern Enlargement&quot;, ''Political Science Series'' #105, ''Institute for Advanced Studies'', Vienna, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;:
* I system (late 1980s - early 1990s): dominated by the opposition between communists and anti-communists, i.e. from supporters and opponents of the old regime; spontaneous mass movements formed on idealistic bases and transformed into 'umbrella parties'
* II system (early 1990s): opposition between winners and losers of the economic transition to [[market economy]]. Anti-communist parties split and formed unstable coalition governments. Many parties, with a narrow political base, grew up
* III system (late 1990s): the social conflicts of market transition aggravated, and [[socialdemocratic]] post-communist parties took over. The party system concentrated, while electoral volatility was extremely high
* IV system (2000s): rise of a relatively stable and modestly concentrated party system, organized on a left-right dimension, including post-communist parties. Fragmentation did not rise again after the fall of many socialdemocratic parties from government.

==== Finland ====
[[History of Finland|Finland]] was a Grand Duchy controlled by Russia until 1918. Nationalistic demands from the peasants and workers for greater use of the Finnish language led to the first political party: the Finnish Party in 1860. In response, the Swedish-speaking aristocracy, landowners and businessmen formed their own political party. Thus emerged the first party system.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Siaroff, &quot;Democratic Breakdown and Democratic Stability: A Comparison of Interwar Estonia and Finland&quot;, ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' Vol. 32,No. 1 (Mar., 1999), pp. 103-124, esp. p 109 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3232774 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

According to recent scholarship there have been four party systems in Canada at the federal level since Confederation, each with its own distinctive pattern of social support, [[patronage]] relationships, leadership styles, and electoral strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gag07|Gagnon and Tanguay, 2007]]: 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Political scientists disagree on the names and precise boundaries of the eras, however.  Steve Patten identifies four party systems in Canada's political history&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pat07|Patten, 2007]]: 57-58&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first party system emerged from pre-Confederation colonial politics, had its &quot;heyday&quot; from 1896 to 1911 and lasted until the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], and was characterized by local patronage administered by the two largest parties, the [[Liberals (Canada)|Liberals]] and the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]].
* The second system emerged following the First World War, and had its heyday from 1935 and 1957, was characterized by regionalism and saw the emergence of several protest parties, such as the [[Progressives (Canada)|Progressives]], the [[Social Credit Party (Canada)|Social Credit Party]], and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]].
* The third system emerged in 1963 and had its heyday from 1968 to 1983 and began to unravel thereafter.  The two largest parties were challenged by a strong third party, the [[New Democratic Party]]. Campaigns during this era became more national in scope due to the [[electronic media]], and involved a greater focus on leadership. The dominant policy of the era was [[Keynesian]] economics.
* The fourth party system has involved the rise of the [[Reform Party of Canada]], the [[Bloc Québécois]], and the merger of the [[Canadian Alliance]] with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]]. It saw most parties move to one-member-one-vote leadership contests, and a major reform to campaign finance laws in 2004.  The fourth party system has been characterized by market-oriented policies that abandoned Keynesian policies, but maintained the welfare state.

Clarkson (2005) shows how the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] has dominated all the party systems, using different approaches. It began with a  &quot;clientelistic approach&quot; under [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier|Laurier]], which evolved into a &quot;brokerage&quot; system of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s under [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]. The 1950s saw the emergence of a &quot;pan-Canadian system&quot;, which lasted until the 1990s. The 1993 election — categorized by Clarkson as an electoral &quot;earthquake&quot; which &quot;fragmented&quot; the party system, saw the emergence of regional politics within a four party-system, whereby various groups championed regional issues and concerns. Clarkson concludes that the inherent bias built into the first-past-the-post system, has chiefly benefited the Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Clarkson, ''The Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States===

The concept of party system was introduced by English scholar [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] in ''[[American Commonwealth]]'' (1885).

''American Party Systems'' was a major textbook by [[Charles Merriam]] in 1920s. In 1967 the most important single breakthrough appeared, ''The American Party Systems. Stages of Political Development'', edited by [[William Nisbet Chambers]] and [[Walter Dean Burnham]]. It brought together historians and political scientists who agreed on a common framework and numbering system. Thus Chambers published ''The First Party System'' in 1972.  Burnham published numerous articles and books.
Closely related is the concept of ''critical elections'' (introduced by [[V. O. Key]] in 1955), and &quot;realignments.&quot;

A political science college textbook explains:
:&quot;Scholars generally agree that [[realignment theory]] identifies five distinct party systems with the following approximate dates and major parties: 1. 1796&amp;ndash;1816, First Party System: Jeffersonian Republicans and Federalists; 2. 1840&amp;ndash;1856, Second Party System: Democrats and Whigs; 	3. 1860&amp;ndash;1896, Third Party System: Republicans and Democrats; 4. 1896&amp;ndash;1932, Fourth Party System: Republicans and Democrats; 5. 1932-, Fifth Party System: Democrats and Republicans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Benedict, Matthew J. Burbank and Ronald J. Hrebenar, ''Political Parties, Interest Groups and Political Campaigns.'' Westview Press. 1999. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marjorie Hershey, there have been at least six different party systems throughout the history of the United States:

[[First Party System]]:  This system can be considered to have developed as a result of the factions in the [[George Washington]] administration.  The two factions were [[Alexander Hamilton]] and the [[Federalists]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]].  The Federalists argued for a strong national government with a national bank and a strong economic and industry system.  The Democratic-Republicans argued for a limited government, with a more emphasis on farmers and states' rights.  After the 1800 Presidential election, the Democratic-Republicans gained major dominance for the next twenty years, and the Federalists slowly died off.

[[Second Party System]]:  This system developed as a result of the one party rule of the Democratic-Republicans not being able to contain some of the most pressing issues of the time, namely slavery.  Out of this system came the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Party and [[Henry Clay]]'s [[American System]].  Wealthier people tended to support the Whigs, and the poorer tended to support the Democrats.  During the Jacksonian era, his Democrat Party evolved from Democratic-Republicans. The Whig party began to break apart into factions, mainly over the issue of slavery. This period lasted until 1860.

[[Third Party System]]:  Beginning around the time of the start of the Civil War, this system was defined by bitter conflict and striking party differences and coalitions.  These coalitions were most evidently defined by geography.  The South was dominated by the Democrats who opposed the ending of slavery, and the North, with the exception of some major political machines, was dominated by the Republicans, who supported ending slavery.  This era was a time of extreme industrial and economic expansion. The Third Party System lasted until 1896.

[[Fourth Party System]]:  This era was defined by Progressivism and immigration, as well as the political aftermath of the [[American Civil War]]. Northeastern business supported the Republicans while the South and West supported the Democrats. Immigrant groups were courted by both parties. The Fourth Party System came to an end around 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, Marjorie Randon. Party Politics in America 14th ed. 2011: Longman Classics in Political Science. pages 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fifth Party System]]:  This system was defined by the creation of the [[New Deal Coalition]] by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in response to the [[Great Depression]]. This coalition supporting new social welfare programs brought together many under-privileged, working class, and minority groups including unions, Catholics, and Jews. It also attracted African-Americans, who had previously largely supported the Republican Party due to Lincoln's freeing of the slaves. This era lasted approximately until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, Marjorie Randon. Party Politics in America 14th ed. 2011: Longman Classics in Political Science. page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sixth Party System]]: This system is currently developing.  It appears to have begun with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] the Democrat's subsequently losing their long dominance of the South in the late 1960s, leading to a Republican dominance as evidenced by election results.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, Marjorie Randon. Party Politics in America 12th ed. 2007: Longman Classics in Political Science. pages 119-123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argentina ===
Scholars of [[History of Argentina|Argentina]] identify two distinct party systems, one in place between 1912 and 1940, the other emerging after 1946. The first party system was not consistently class based, but the second was, with the [[Radical Party (Argentina)|Radical Party]] representing the middle classes and the [[Peronists]], workers and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Lupu and Susan C. Stokes, &quot;The Social Bases of Political Parties in Argentina, 1912–2003&quot;, ''Latin American Research Review''  Vol. 44#1, 2009 pp 58-87&lt;/ref&gt;
