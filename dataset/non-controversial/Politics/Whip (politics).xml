A '''whip''' is an official in a [[political party]] whose primary purpose is to ensure [[party discipline]] in a [[legislature]].  Whips are a party's &quot;enforcers&quot;, who typically offer [[wiktionary:inducements|inducements]] and threaten punishments for party members to ensure that they vote according to the official party policy.  A whip's role is also to ensure that the elected representatives of their party are in attendance when important votes are taken. The usage comes from the hunting term &quot;whipping in&quot;, i.e. preventing hounds from wandering away from the pack.

The term &quot;whip&quot; is also used to mean:
* the voting instructions issued to members by the whip,&lt;ref&gt;Pandiyan, M. Veera (May 14, 2006). [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/how-term-whip-came-to-be-used-in.htm How the term 'Whip' came to be used in Parliament]. ''[[The Star (Malaysia)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or
* in the UK and Ireland, a party's endorsement of a Member of Parliament (MP); to &quot;withdraw the whip&quot; is to expel an MP from his or her political party. (The elected member in question would retain his or her parliamentary seat, as an independent.)

== Australia ==
In the [[Parliament of Australia]], as well as in the parliaments of the six states and two self-governing territories, all political parties have whips to ensure party discipline and carry out a variety of other functions on behalf of the party leadership. The most important function of the whip's office is to ensure that all members and senators are present to take part in votes in the chamber (maintaining [[quorum]] and preventing [[censure motion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Education Office. [http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fss/fss26.html Fact Sheet 36: The Party Whip].&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the [[United Kingdom]], Australian whips do not hold official office, but they are recognised for parliamentary purposes. In practice, Australian whips play a lesser role than their counterparts in the United Kingdom, as [[party discipline]] in Australia tends to be tighter.&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library. [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/cib/2002-03/03cib01.htm Free Votes in Australian and some Overseas Parliaments].&lt;/ref&gt;

Their roles in the chamber include taking divisions, and maintaining a &quot;pairs book&quot; which controls the ability of members and senators to leave the parliament building during sittings, as well as the entitlement to be absent during divisions.

[[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] whips are appointed by the leader of the party, while [[Australian Labor Party]] whips are elected by the [[Caucus]]. Each Chief Whip is assisted by two Deputy Whips.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Education Office. [http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fss/fss26.html Fact Sheet 36: The Party Whip]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the coalition one of the Deputy Whips is always the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] whip. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Similar arrangements exist in the state and territory parliaments.

The timing of most votes are difficult to predict and TDs are expected to stay within reach of the division bell at all times. All TDs are required to vote with their party and to earn permission if they will to be absent from a vote. Free votes are not a feature of the Irish parliamentary tradition. 

From 1998, whips and assistant whips may be entitled to an allowance on top of their base legislator's salary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0005/sec0003.html Oireachtas (Allowances To Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act, 1998] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, these allowances varied proportional to the size of the group, with [[Fianna Fáil]]'s Dáil whip's allowance the highest at €19,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0347.html S.I. No. 347/2011 — Oireachtas (Allowances) (Members and Holders of Parliamentary and Certain Ministerial Offices) Order 2011] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greece ==
In [[Greece]], party discipline is normally very strict. However, a few governments have collapsed despite this strictness. The role of the whip is usually exercised by the [[party leader]] but [[Kostas Karamanlis]], the [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] from 2004 to 2009 and former leader of the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, mostly used Giannis Tragakis, General Secretary of his party parliamentary group, as a whip. Until November 2008, New Democracy, Karamanlis' party, had 152 MPs out of 300. When Petros Tatoulis, MP for [[Arcadia]] Prefecture, stated that Karamanlis was guilty of a few political scandals, Karamanlis immediately expelled him from both the [[parliamentary group]] and the party, as a result giving New Democracy a [[majority]] of only one seat. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== India ==
In [[Politics of India|India]], the concept of the whip was inherited from colonial British rule. Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party's discipline and behaviour on the floor of the [[Parliament of India|house]]. Usually, he/she directs the party members to stick to the party's stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770815|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=Outlook India|date=Aug 02, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leaders and chief whip act&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=leaders and chief whips of recognised parties and groups in parliament (facilities) act, 1998|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/msa_section/leader_chief1998.pdf|publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=3 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69dRYMQuE |archivedate=29 August 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some cases such as [[:Category:Indian presidential elections|Indian presidential election]] where no whip can be issued directing [[Member of Parliament]] or [[Member of Legislative Assembly]] on whom to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/india/32617646_1_presidential-poll-mps-and-mlas-electoral-college|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Jul 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
{{main|Chief Whip#United Kingdom|l1=Chief Whip (United Kingdom)}}

In British politics, the [[Chief Whip]] of the governing party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is customarily appointed as Parliamentary [[Secretary to the Treasury]] so that the incumbent, who represents the whips in general, has a seat and a voice in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. By virtue of holding the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, the Government Chief Whip has an official residence at 12 [[Downing Street]], although the Chief Whip's office is currently located at 9 Downing Street. Whips report to the Prime Minister on any possible back bench revolts and the general opinion of MPs within the party, and upon the exercise of the patronage which is used to motivate and reward loyalty.

In the United Kingdom, there are three categories of whip that are issued on particular business. An express instruction how to vote could constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege, so the party's wishes are expressed unequivocally but indirectly.  These whips are issued to MPs in the form of a letter outlining the Parliamentary schedule, with a sentence such as &quot;Your attendance is absolutely essential&quot; next to each debate in which there will be a vote, underlined one, two or three times according to the severity of the whip:
*A ''single-line whip'' is a guide to what the party's policy would indicate, and notification of when the vote is expected to take place; this is non-binding for attendance or voting.
*A ''two-line whip'', sometimes known as a ''double-line whip'', is an instruction to attend and vote; partially binding for voting, attendance required unless prior permission given by the whip.
*A ''three-line whip'' is a strict instruction to attend and vote, breach of which would normally have serious consequences. Permission not to attend may be given by the whip, but a serious reason is needed. Breach of a three-line whip can lead to expulsion from the parliamentary political group in extreme circumstances and may lead to expulsion from the party. Consequently, three-line whips are generally only issued on key issues, such as [[Motion of Confidence|votes of confidence]] and [[Loss of Supply|supply]]. The nature of three-line whips and the potential punishments for revolt vary dramatically among parties and legislatures. Disobeying a three-line whip is by definition a newsworthy event, indicating as it does a potential mutiny; an example was the decision on 10 July 2012 by 91 Conservative MPs to vote against Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] on the issue of [[reform of the House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2171447/Coalition-war-Lords-reform-Senior-Lib-Dems-vow-revenge-flagship-reform-scuppered-uprising-Tory-benches.html | work=Daily Mail | first=James | last=Chapman | title=Coalition suffers biggest rebellion yet as Tory backbenchers scupper Clegg's dream of Lords reform, leaving senior LibDems vowing revenge | date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{More footnotes|date=March 2012}}
In the United States there are legislatures at the local (city councils, town councils, county boards, etc.), state and federal level. The federal legislature (Congress), state legislatures, and many county and city legislative bodies are divided along party lines and have whips, as well as majority and minority leaders.

Both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], have majority and minority whips. They in turn have subordinate &quot;regional&quot; whips.  While members of Congress often vote along party lines, the influence of the whip is weaker than in the UK system.  For one thing, much money is raised by individual candidates, and members of Congress are almost never ejected from a party.  In addition, because [[preselection]] of candidates for office is generally done through [[primary election]]s open to a wide number of voters, it is difficult for the national party to deselect a member of Congress who defies his party in a way that pleases his or her constituency.

Because members of Congress cannot serve simultaneously in executive positions, a whip in the United States cannot bargain with a member by using as an inducement the possibility of promotion or demotion in a sitting administration. There is, however, a highly structured committee system in both houses of Congress, and a whip may be able to use promotion or demotion within that system instead. In the House of Representatives in particular, the influence of a single member individually is relatively small and therefore depends a great deal on the Representative's seniority —that is, in most cases, on the length of time he has held office (which usually depends on how well the Representative pleases his constituents, rather than on how well he pleases the other members of his party).

Whips in the United States, then, are less menacing in their techniques than in the United Kingdom. Even so, stepping too far outside the party's platform can limit political ambitions or ability to obtain favorable legislation.

In the Senate, the Majority Whip is the third-highest-ranking individual in the majority party (i.e., the party with a majority or, rarely, plurality of seats). The Majority Whip is outranked by the Majority Leader and, technically, the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]]. Because the office of President pro tempore is largely honorific, usually given to the longest-serving senator of the majority, the Majority Whip is in reality the second-ranking senator in the Majority Conference in terms of actual power. Similarly, in the House the Majority Whip is outranked by both the [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Unlike the Senate's presiding officer, the Speaker is the leader of his or her party's caucus in the House.

In both the House and the Senate, the Minority Whip is the second highest-ranking individual in the minority party (the party with the lesser number of legislators in a legislative body), outranked only by the [[Minority Leader]].

The Whip position was first created in the House of Representatives in 1897 by Speaker [[Thomas Brackett Reed|Thomas Reed]] (R-ME), who appointed [[James A. Tawney]] (R-MN) as the first whip.  The first [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] whip was appointed around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/dem_whips.html |title = Democratic Whips |publisher = Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate = April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://majoritywhip.house.gov/index.cfm?p=HistoryOfWhip |title=History of the Whip |publisher=Office of the House Majority Whip |accessdate=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Senate, the whip position was created in 1913 by [[John W. Kern]], chair of the Democratic caucus, when he appointed [[J. Hamilton Lewis]] (D-IL) as the first whip. Republicans chose [[James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr.|James Wadsworth]] (R-NY) as their first whip in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Most Exclusive Club |last=Gould |first=Lewis L. |year=2005 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02778-1 |pages=57, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
