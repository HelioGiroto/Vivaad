'''Section 28''' of the [[Local Government Act 1988]] caused the controversial addition of Section 2A to the [[Local Government Act 1986]] (affecting England, Wales and Scotland), enacted on 24 May 1988 and repealed on 21 June 2000 in Scotland, and on 18 November 2003 in the rest of Great Britain by section 122 of the [[Local Government Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Local+Government+Act+&amp;Year=2003&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=819204&amp;ActiveTextDocId=819364&amp;filesize=374 Local Government Act 2003 (c. 26) - Statute Law Database&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment stated that a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]] &quot;shall not intentionally promote [[homosexuality]] or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality&quot; or &quot;promote the teaching in any [[maintained school]] of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880009_en_5.htm Local Government Act 1988 (c. 9)], section 28. Accessed 1 July 2006 on opsi.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it did not create a criminal offence, no prosecution was ever brought under this provision, but its existence caused many groups to close or limit their activities or self-censor. For example, a number of [[lesbian]], [[gay]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] student support groups in schools and colleges across Britain were closed owing to fears by council legal staff that they could breach the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/gleanings2889.html |title=Knitting Circle 1989 Section 28 gleanings |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070818063344/http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/gleanings2889.html |archivedate=2007-08-18}} on the site of [[South Bank University]].

While going through Parliament, the amendment was constantly relabelled with a variety of clause numbers as other amendments were added to or deleted from the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]], but by the final version of the Bill, which received [[Royal Assent]], it had become Section 28. Section 28 is sometimes referred to as '''Clause 28''' – in the United Kingdom, [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] have sections, whereas in a Bill (which is put before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to pass) those sections are called clauses.&lt;ref name=&quot;4letter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC |title=When gay became a four-letter word |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/611704.stm | date=2000-01-20 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the effect of the amendment was to insert a new section '2A' into the previous Local Government Act, it was also sometimes referred to as '''Section 2A'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galha.org/glh/section28.html Section 28], Gay and Lesbian Humanist. Created 2000-05-07, Last updated Sunday, 2006-02-12. Accessed 1 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
Section 28 originated in the social transition in British society from homosexuality as &quot;illegal-but-discussed&quot;, to &quot;legal-but-not-always approved&quot;, following debate in the 1950s and the 1967 decriminalisation of homosexual acts for those over the age of 21 in the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1186262 Sexual Offences Act 1967 (c.60)], 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s was the era of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Government, which brought large-scale social changes (''see: [[Thatcherism]]''); it was also the era in which [[AIDS]] was first reported. The spread of AIDS brought about widespread fear, much of which was directed at homosexuals and bisexuals. The first recorded victims of the disease were a group of homosexual men,&lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{Cite journal

Given the domination of central government by conservative thinking, most gay rights activists were to be found in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] or the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} These campaigners and their supporters progressively managed to raise these issues in local party meetings, resulting in a number of local authorities changing their policies to include the words &quot;sexual orientation&quot; in a list of unacceptable discriminations. The large [[Metropolitan Borough]] councils outside the capital, the [[Inner London Education Authority]] and the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) regularly took out job adverts in the national press and elsewhere making a very public statement about the unacceptability of homophobic behaviour within their organisations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}The GLC also directly started funding gay groups. Between 1981 and 1984 grants totalling at least £292,548 were given by the GLC to a variety of small gay groups and another £751,000 was committed towards the setting up of the London Lesbian and Gay Community Centre in Islington.&lt;ref&gt;Tingle,Rachel &quot;Gay Lessons&quot;, Pickwick Books, 1986, p.8 and pp.44-45&lt;/ref&gt; About ten of the 32 local authorities in London, most prominently Islington and Haringey were also funding gay groups at that time, one report estimating that these boroughs and the GLC together donated more than £600,000 to gay projects and groups during 1984.&lt;ref&gt; Sunday Telegraph, 6th October, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983 the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', a British [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper, reported that a copy of a book entitled ''[[Jenny lives with Eric and Martin]]''&amp;mdash;portraying a little girl who lives with her father and his homosexual partner&amp;mdash;was provided in a school library run by the Labour-controlled [[Inner London Education Authority]]. More and more councils began to adopt wide-ranging anti-discrimination policies (particularly [[Ealing]], [[Islington]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and [[Manchester]] who employed officers to counter homophobia).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200041&amp;documentID=398&amp;pageNumber=2|title=LGBT History: Real problems for real people |publisher=Manchester City Council|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attention to this, and work within the political parties by activists, led to the adoption at the Labour Party Annual Conference in 1985 of a resolution calling for the end of all legal discrimination against homosexuals. In addition, the election to [[Manchester City Council]] of [[Margaret Roff]] (November 1985) as the UK's first openly homosexual Mayor and the publication of [[Changing The World]] by the GLC in 1985 all fuelled a heightened public awareness of the issues.

But it was not until 1986 that major controversy arose and widespread protest demonstrations made a major contribution towards the subsequent passing of Section 28.&lt;ref&gt;In autumn 1986 a group of parents in the north-east [[London Borough of Haringey]] began making complaints about a book that was available to school children. What started out as a request for the removal of one book, turned into a series of demonstrations (both for and against) on the streets of Wood Green and Tottenham and eventually on the streets of cities across the nation.&lt;br /&gt;Susanne Bosche [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,6000,130836,00.html Jenny, Eric, Martin ... and me], ''The Guardian'', January 31, 2000. Accessed online July 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A final factor was the tone taken by some activist groups such as the [[Gay Liberation Front]], cited by the Conservative MP [[Jill Knight, Baroness Knight of Collingtree|Jill Knight]], who introduced Section 28, and who in 1999 spoke about the purpose of that section:

{{cquote|Why did I bother to go on with it and run such a dangerous gauntlet? I was then Chairman of the Child and Family Protection Group. I was contacted by parents who strongly objected to their children at school being encouraged into homosexuality and being taught that a normal family with mummy and daddy was outdated. To add insult to their injury, they were infuriated that it was their money, paid over as council tax, which was being used for this. This all happened after pressure from the Gay Liberation Front. At that time I took the trouble to refer to their manifesto, which clearly stated: &quot;We fight for something more than reform. We must aim for the [[abolition of the family]]...&lt;br&gt;That was the motivation for what was going on, and was precisely what Section 28 stopped. ... Parents certainly came to me and told me what was going on. They gave me some of the books with which little children as young as five and six were being taught. There was [[Joani Blank|The Playbook for Kids about Sex]] in which brightly coloured pictures of little stick men showed all about homosexuality and how it was done. That book was for children as young as five. I should be surprised if anybody supports that. Another book called [[David Rees (author)|The Milkman's on his Way]] explicitly described homosexual intercourse and, indeed, glorified it, encouraging youngsters to believe that it was better than any other sexual way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Hansard]], [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo991206/text/91206-10.htm], 6 December 1999, Column 1102.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Legislation===
As a consequence, many [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[backbench]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s became concerned that [[left-wing]] councils were indoctrinating young children with what they considered to be homosexual propaganda. In 1986 [[John Anthony Hardinge Giffard, 3rd Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]] first tabled a [[Private Member's Bill]] in the [[House of Lords]] entitled ''An act to refrain local authorities from promoting homosexuality''. At the time, the incumbent Conservative government considered Halsbury's bill to be too misleading and risky. The bill successfully passed the House of Lords and was adopted by then-Conservative MP Jill Knight. However, overshadowed by the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], Halsbury's bill failed.

On 2 December 1987 in Committee, Conservative MP [[David Wilshire]] re-introduced an [[law|amendment]] to the 1988 Local Government Bill for a similar clause, entitled ''Clause 28''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-047.pdf |title=The ''Local Government Bill'' [HL]: the 'section 28' debate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government agreed to support the tabling of the amendment in exchange for Knight forgoing her place on the [[Health and Medicines Act 1988|Health and Medicines Bill]] [[Public bill committee|standing committee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Diary |first=John |last=Street |url= |newspaper=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] |date=25 December 1987 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the amendment received the support of the then-Minister for Local Government, [[Michael Howard]]. After being debated on 8 December 1987 it was presented to the House of Commons on 15 December 1987, shortly before the parliamentary Christmas recess.

Section 28 became law on 24 May 1988. The night before, several protests were staged by lesbian women, including [[abseiling]] into Parliament and a famous invasion of the [[BBC]]'s Six O'Clock News,&lt;ref name=&quot;4letter&quot; /&gt; during which one woman managed to chain herself to [[Sue Lawley]]'s desk and was sat on by the newscaster [[Nicholas Witchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1998 |publisher=BBC |title=Nicholas Witchell |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/news/nicholaswitchell.shtml}}{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over applicability===
After Section 28 was passed, there was some debate as to whether it actually applied in schools or whether it applied only to local authorities. Whilst head teachers and Boards of Governors were specifically exempt, schools and teachers became confused as to what was actually permitted and tended to err on the side of caution.

A [[National Union of Teachers]] (NUT) statement remarked that &quot;While Section 28 applies to local authorities and not to schools, many teachers believe, albeit wrongly, that it imposes constraints in respect of the advice and counselling they give to pupils. Professional judgement is therefore influenced by the perceived prospect of prosecution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.org.uk/story.php?id=2320 NUT on the Web&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]{{Dead link|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Science]] made the following statement in 1988 regarding Section 28:

{{cquote|Section 28 does not affect the activities of school governors, nor of teachers... It will not prevent the objective discussion of homosexuality in the classroom, nor the counselling of pupils concerned about their sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;briandeer.com&quot; /&gt;}}

It is said that when Knight heard this, she was somewhat upset, remarking that:
{{cquote|This has got to be a mistake. The major point of it was to protect children in schools from having homosexuality thrust upon them.&lt;ref name=&quot;briandeer.com&quot;&gt;Brian Deer, [http://briandeer.com/social/clause-28.htm Schools escape clause 28 in 'gay ban' fiasco] (Sunday Times).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to these criticisms, supporters claimed that the NUT and Department of Education were mistaken, and the section did affect schools.

Some local authorities continued to deliver training to their staff in their education system on how to deliver their services without discrimination against homosexuals. [[Manchester City Council]] continued to sustain four officer posts directly involved in policy making and implementation, contributing to the 1992 report (&quot;Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988: a Guide for Workers in the Education Service, produced by Manchester City Council, May 1992.&quot;) which proved that Section 28 did not prevent this work.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Their pioneering work was never once challenged by the act.

Before its repeal, Section 28 was already largely redundant: [[sex education]] in [[England and Wales]] has been regulated solely by the [[Secretary of State for Education]] since the [[Learning and Skills Act 2000]] and the [[Education Act 1996]]. Nevertheless, many liberal and conservative campaigners still saw Section 28 as a symbolic issue and continued to fight their own particular causes over it until its repeal.

===Political response===
The introduction of Section 28 served to galvanise the disparate British [[gay rights]] movement into action. The resulting protest saw the rise of now famous groups like [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]],&lt;ref name=&quot;4letter&quot; /&gt; started by, amongst other people, [[Ian McKellen]], and [[OutRage!]],&lt;ref name=&quot;4letter&quot; /&gt; subsequently led by [[Peter Tatchell]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}Schools OUT which had been formed back in 1974 worked tirelessly both against the act and supported and trained teachers on how to counter homophobia and make LGBT people visible in schools.

While the gay rights movement was united over Section 28, the issue began to divide the Conservative party, heightening divisions between party [[modernist]]s and [[traditional]]ists. In 1999 Conservative leader [[William Hague]] controversially sacked [[frontbencher]] [[Shaun Woodward]] for refusing to support the party line that Section 28 should not be repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC |title=Tory MP sacked over gay row |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/547508.stm | date=1999-12-03 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting pro-gay rights Conservatives, such as [[Steve Norris]], to speak out against the decision. 2000 saw gay Conservative advisor [[Ivan Massow]] defect to the Labour Party in response to the Conservative Party's continued support of Section 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC |title=Tory adviser defects to Labour |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/862683.stm | date=2000-08-02 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one case of Section 28 being used to bring a case to the courts against a council. In May, 2000&amp;mdash;the first and last case of its kind&amp;mdash;the [[Christian Institute]] unsuccessfully took [[Glasgow City Council]] to court for funding an AIDS support charity which the Institute alleged promoted homosexuality.

===Repeal===

On 7 February 2000, the first attempted legislation to repeal Section 28 was introduced by the Labour Government as part of the Local Government Act 2000, but was defeated by a House of Lords campaign led by [[Janet Young, Baroness Young|Baroness Young]].

In the newly [[devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish Parliament]] the repeal process was more successful. Various groups campaigned against the repeal. The Scottish millionaire businessman [[Brian Souter]] privately funded a [[postal ballot]] as part of his [[Keep the Clause campaign]], which returned an apparent 86% support for keeping the clause, from a response from slightly less than one third of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;million registered Scottish voters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC |title=Poll supports S28 retention |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/768882.stm | date=2000-05-30 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/jul2000/scot-j07.shtml Anti-gay legislation repealed in Scottish parliament&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Section 28 (although, more accurately, it was Section 2A of the relevant Scottish legislation) was repealed by MSPs as part of the [[Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] on 21 June 2000 with a 99 to 17 majority vote with only two abstentions.

On 24 July 2000 the Local Government Act 2000 was sent back to the Lords with an amendment re-introducing repeal. Concessions were made in the form of the new Learning and Skills Act 2000 which emphasised [[family values]] and which was hoped would win over opponents. However, the repeal was again defeated in the House of Lords.

Despite these successive defeats in the House of Lords of attempts to repeal Section 28 in [[England]] and [[Wales]], the Labour government passed legislation to repeal this section as part of the [[Local Government Act 2003]] by a vote of MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2003-03-10&amp;number=109|title=Local Government Bill - Repeal of prohibition on promotion of homosexuality|date=10 March 2003|publisher=[[Public Whip]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a part of the legal process (Standing Committee A) [[Edward Davey]] said &quot;In a liberal democracy, the need to protect minorities properly sometimes means that protection cannot be achieved through the ballot box and that some things are not appropriate for a vote.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st030213/am/30213s08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This passed the Lords, received [[Royal Assent]] on 18 September 2003, and the repeal became effective on 18 November 2003.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-run [[Kent County Council]], however, decided to create their own version of Section 28 to keep the effect of the now repealed law in their schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2003 |author=Action Network U523407 |publisher=Action Network BBC |title=Homophobic Section 28 is scrapped at last - except in Kent! |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/A1975827}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced on 16 December 2004 with provisions stating that heterosexual marriage and family relationships are the only firm foundations for society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queeryouth.org.uk/phpnews/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=88 Gay Times - Kent's Section 28 U-turn - Media Cuttings - Queer Youth Network - The UK Alliance of LGBT Young People, LGBT, Gay Youth, London, Manchester, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered, Gay Youth UK, Homophobia, Equality, Message Boards, News, The Queer Youth Alliance, Queer Youth Radio, Report as the Queer Youth Alliance claims victory in Kent when Kent County Council finally scrapped it's [sic] anti-gay 'Section 28' policy&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]{{Dead link|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement now says: &quot;We will ensure that sex education values family and marriage as the foundation of a civilised society, and a firm basis for the nurturing of children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Queer Youth|title=Queer Youth Forum citing from Gay Times UK|url=http://www.queeryouth.org.uk/community/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=81&amp;t=8118|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Section 28 was supported by religious groups such as the [[Salvation Army]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Salvation Army Letter to Scottish Parliament&quot;&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/historic/x-lg/reports-00/lgr00-06-08.htm#3 Salvation Army Letter to Scottish Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christian Institute]], the African and Caribbean [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Association, [[Christian Action Research and Education]], the [[Muslim Council of Britain]], and groups within the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Church of England]]. The Conservative Party, despite dissent within its ranks on the issue, [[Whip (politics)|whipped]] its members in support of Section 28 in 2000, but in 2003, after further dissent from within the party, allowed a free vote. In the House of Lords, the campaign against the repeal of Section 28 was led by the late Baroness [[Janet Young]]. Newspapers that strongly supported Section 28 included ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

In Scotland the most visible supporters of Section 28 were [[Brian Souter]] and the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' newspaper.

The main argument in support of Section 28 was to protect children from &quot;predatory homosexuals&quot; and advocates seeking to &quot;indoctrinate&quot; vulnerable young people into homosexuality. Various other arguments were also used in support of Section 28 which are summarised as follows:

* That promotion of homosexuality in schools undermines marriage.

==Opposition==
[[File:Section28-cropped.jpg|thumb|Activists target a bus operated by Brian Souter's Stagecoach company at a rally in Albert Square, Manchester, on 15th July 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20000716/ai_n13951409/ Gay rally attacks Stagecoach bus]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Gay rights]] advocates, such as [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]], [[OutRage!]], ''The [[Pink Paper]]'' and the ''[[Gay Times]]'' formed the major opposition to Section 28 and led the campaign for its repeal. Prominent individuals who spoke out for the repeal of Section 28 included [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Ivan Massow]], [[Mo Mowlam]], [[Simon Callow]], [[Annette Crosbie]], [[Michael Grade]], [[Jane Horrocks]], [[Michael Mansfield QC]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Claire Rayner]], [[Ned Sherrin]] and [[Alan Moore]]. 

A coalition of comic book creators, including [[Alan Moore|Moore]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Neil Gaiman]], and many others, produced a magazine called ''[[AARGH (Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia)]]'' and raised at least £20,000 to contribute to the fight against the legislation, according to Moore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/brought-to-light2.html Blather: The Alan Moore Interview: Brought to Light - deep politics / AARGH]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boy George]] wrote a song opposed to Section 28, entitled &quot;[[No Clause 28 (song)|No Clause 28]]&quot;. The band [[Chumbawamba]] recorded a single entitled &quot;Smash Clause 28! Fight The Alton Bill!&quot; which was an attack on Clause/Section 28 and a benefit for a gay rights group; it also featured 12 pages of hand printed notes relating to gay rights. The legislation was also opposed by some religious groups and leaders, such as [[Richard Harries]], [[Bishop of Oxford]]. Newspapers that came out in opposition included ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Daily Mirror]]''. 

Political parties that were opposed to Section 28 included the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]]. In the House of Lords the campaign for repeal was led by openly-gay peer [[Waheed Alli]]. Perhaps the most famous act of opposition to Section 28 came when [[Shaun Woodward]], a Conservative MP with a transgender sister, defected from the Conservative Party and his seat and joined the ruling Labour Party in opposition to the Conservatives' continued support of Section 28.

The main point of argument claimed by opponents of Section 28 was the complaint that it discriminated against homosexuals, and hence was an [[Toleration|intolerant]] and unjust law. Various other arguments were also used against Section 28 which are summarised as follows:

* That, by excluding homosexual support groups and appearing to prevent teachers from protecting victims of [[homophobia|homophobic]] bullying, Section 28 was actually endangering vulnerable children.
* The claim that Section 28 made the assumption that homosexuals were inherently dangerous to children, implying an association between homosexuality and [[pedophilia|paedophilia]], as obvious from the &quot;predatory homosexuals&quot; argument of the supporters of the law.
* Not only did Section 28 prevent the active promotion of homosexuality but also it appeared to give a legal reason to oppose it in schools and other forums if necessary.
* The claim that Section 28 was a law which gave an impression to the public that the government sanctioned homophobia.
* The idea that homosexuality could be &quot;promoted&quot; implied that homosexuality was a choice which people could be persuaded to make, in contrast to the Section's opponents' view that homosexuality is biologically determined.
* It was no longer relevant due to the Learning and Skills Act of 2000 and the Education Act of 1996.

==In retrospect==

Some prominent MPs who supported the bill when it was first introduced have since either expressed regret over their support, changed their stance due to different circumstances which have evolved over time, or have argued that the legislation is no longer necessary.

In an interview with gay magazine [[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]] during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]], [[Michael Howard]], then leader of the Conservative Party, commented:

:[Section 28] was brought in to deal with what was seen to be a specific problem at the time. The problem was the kind of literature that was being used in some schools and distributed to very young children that was seen to promote homosexuality..... I thought, rightly or wrongly, that there was a problem in those days. That problem simply doesn’t exist now. Nobody’s fussed about those issues any more. It’s not a problem, so the law shouldn’t be hanging around on the statute book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=629 Johann Hari - Archive&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2006, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Chairman [[Francis Maude]] told Pinknews.co.uk that the policy, which he had voted for, was wrong and a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC |title=Tories' gay stance 'was wrong' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4696236.stm | date=2006-02-09 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[David Cameron]] (at that time an unelected Conservative party member) repeatedly attacked the Labour government's plans to abolish Section 28, publicly criticising then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] as being &quot;anti-family&quot; and accused him of wanting the &quot;promotion of homosexuality in schools&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/cameron+toff+at+the+top/328047 Channel 4 - profile of David Cameron]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, once Cameron had been elected as Conservative [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Witney, he continued to support Section 28.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/02/david-cameron-gay-pride-apology The Guardian - David Cameron's history on Section 28]&lt;/ref&gt; As the Labour government were determined to remove Section 28 from law, Cameron voted in favour of a Conservative amendment that retained certain aspects of the clause, which gay rights campaigners described as &quot;Section 28 by the back door&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1196924/Cameron-apologises-gays-Section-28-Maggies-law-ban-promotion-homosexuality-schools-wrong-says-Tory-leader.html Daily Mail - Cameron apologises for Section 28]&lt;/ref&gt; This was unsuccessful, and Section 28 was repealed by the Labour government without concession (Cameron was absent for the vote on its eventual repeal). However, in June 2009, Cameron—then leader of the Conservative Party whilst campaigning to be the next Prime Minister—formally apologised for his party introducing the law, stating that it was a mistake and had been offensive to gay people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-sorry-for-section-28-1728003.html The Independent - David Cameron apologises for Section 28]&lt;/ref&gt; He restated this belief in January 2010 and proposed to alter the policy of the Conservative Party to reflect his belief that equality should be taught in British schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/28/david-cameron-gay-equality | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Teaching about gay equality should be 'embedded' in schooling, says David Cameron | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | date=2010-01-28 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
though he has yet to further this proposal since he became Prime Minister in May 2010.

==Model Funding Agreement for academies and free schools==
The stipulation that the benefits of marriage be taught in [[Academy (English school)|academies]] and [[Free school (England)|free schools]] was put forward by [[Michael Gove]] in Clause 28 of the Model Funding Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/freeschools/a0074737/free-schools-model-funding-agreement Free Schools model funding agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the clause does not explicitly mention sexual orientation, [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]] is not currently possible in the UK, which prompted ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (traditionally supportive of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) to draw comparisons between the two clauses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8933237/Free-schools-and-academies-must-promote-marriage.html Free schools and academies must promote marriage]&lt;/ref&gt;
