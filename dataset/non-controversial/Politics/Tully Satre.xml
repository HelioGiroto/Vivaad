'''Tully Meehan Satre''' (born 17 May 1989 in [[Dover, Delaware]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], writer and former gay rights youth activist based in Chicago and London.&lt;ref name=Twitter&gt;{{cite web|last=Satre|first=Tully|title=Tully Satre's Official Twitter|url=https://www.twitter.com/tullymeehan|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of the Art Institute of Chicago|url=http://my.saic.edu/?page=alumni_websites|publisher=School of the Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web|last=Satre|first=Tully|title=Curriculum Vitæ|url=http://www.tullysatre.com/cv.html|publisher=Tully Satre|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a current candidate for a postgraduate diploma from the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Arts]] in London,&lt;ref name=CV /&gt;&lt;ref name=Twitter /&gt; though he was refused a student visa.&lt;ref name=Limbo&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Andrew|title=Artist reveals life in &quot;Limbo&quot;|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Artist-reveals-life-in-Limbo/37975.html|publisher=Windy City Media Group|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Limbo2&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Andrew|title=May 31 art show reveals student's 'Limbo'|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/May-31-art-show-reveals-students-Limbo/37858.html|publisher=Windy City Media Group|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Satre was known for his involvement at a young age in gay rights activism in Virginia, which he put behind after moving to Chicago in 2007 for school, though he still wrote for ''[[The Advocate]]'' at the time.&lt;ref name=Queerty1&gt;{{cite news|last=Belonksy|first=Andrew|title=Gay Activist Curbs Activism, Keeps Pen In Hand|url=http://www.queerty.com/gay-activist-curbs-activism-keeps-pen-in-hand-20070731/|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Queerty|date=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Summer of 2006, Satre attended the NYU [[Tisch School of the Arts]] CAP 21 Studio for Musical Theatre.

In 2007, he attended one semester at the [[The Theatre Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts]] at [[Roosevelt University]], majoring in [[Musical Theater]].

==Activism==
===Fauquier and Culpeper Counties, Virginia===
In June 2005, Tully Satre founded Equality Fauquier-Culpeper in the rural suburbs of Greater Washington.&lt;ref name=WashPost1&gt;{{cite news|last=Jean|first=Aymar|title=Once Shunned, Student Knows He's No Longer Alone|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/07/AR2005090700081.html/|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its founding, Equality Fauquier-Culpeper gained wide media coverage in numerous national and local publications including [[The Washington Post]]&lt;ref name=WashPost1 /&gt;, [[Washington Blade|The Washington Blade]], and [[The Advocate]].&lt;ref name=AGLACAPHERO&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills|first=Kim|title=Capital Pride Announces 2006 Capital Pride Heroes|url=http://www.agla.org/news.phtml?item_id=214|publisher=Arlington Gay and Lesbian Alliance|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satre served as the Executive Director of Equality Fauquier-Culpeper, which was headquartered in Warrenton, Virginia, from its inception until June 2007 at which point he stepped down from his position with Equality Fauquier-Culpeper and moved to Chicago to attend school.&lt;ref name=InterstateQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Comer|first=Matt|title=Young Virginia activist steps down from leadership roles|url=http://www.interstateq.com/archives/2227/|publisher=InterstateQ|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''At 16 years of age, Tully Satre, is spearheading one of the most controversial equality groups in Culpeper and Fauquier counties.

&quot;We're living in two very conservative counties that have a great amount of discrimination with no policies or laws protecting gay citizens,&quot; Satre said. &quot;I am an activist, I'll always be an activist and age is just a number and can never define a person's capabilities.&quot; Satre, founder and executive director of Equality Fauquier/Culpeper (EFC), said the reason he wanted to create an organization that reached out to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered (GLBT) and questioning community is so that equal rights might one day be established.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Pamela Kulick / Staff Writer / Culpeper News / 18 August 2005''&lt;ref name=CULPNews1&gt;{{cite news|last=Kulick|first=Pamela|title=Equality is Key for Local Teen|url=http://www.agla.org/news.phtml?item_id=174|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Culpeper News|date=18 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tully Satre began a blog in 2006 on LiveJournal documenting his youth activism. Shortly after Satre's blog was launched, AMERICAblog's John Aravosis discovered Satre's online journal after the youth activist wrote about this experience confronting U.S. Senator George Allen at a town hall meeting in Culpeper&lt;ref name=Advocate1&gt;{{cite news|last=Satre|first=Tully|title=A Senator faces off with Gen Q|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/News_Features/A_senator_faces_off_with_Gen_Q/|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=The Advocate|date=29 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an encounter that drew the spotlight on Satre and his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spaulding|first=Pam|title=Gay 16-year old mops the floor with Sen. George Allen|url=http://pamshouseblend.firedoglake.com/2006/03/22/gay-16-year-old-mops-the-floor-with-sen-george-allen/|publisher=Pam's House Blend|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poulet|first=Maman|title=Youth is not wasted on the young|url=http://mamanpoulet.blogspot.com/2006/03/youth-is-not-wasted-on-young.html|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mistry|title=Hey Senator, Here's Your Ass|url=http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2006/03/hey-senator-heres-your-ass_22.html|publisher=Shakesville|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loudoun Times-Mirror&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=This kid’s got courage|url=http://www.equalityloudoun.org/2006/04/19/this-kids-got-courage/|publisher=Loudoun Times-Mirror|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The debacle about Allen's lack of support for a federal hate crimes bill protecting people based on their sexual orientation, drew nationwide attention on the young activist.&lt;ref name=GayCityNews1&gt;{{cite news|last=Humm|first=Andy|title=High Schooler at the Helm|url=http://204.2.109.187/gcn_515/highschooleratthehelm.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Gay City News|date=13-19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Satre's story flew across the social media stratosphere (from [[Andrew Sullivan]]'s blog, Pam's House Blend to ''The Advocate''{{'}}s online edition of their magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spaulding|first=Pam|title=Gay 16-year old mops the floor with Sen. George Allen|url=http://pamshouseblend.firedoglake.com/2006/03/22/gay-16-year-old-mops-the-floor-with-sen-george-allen/|publisher=Pam's House Blend|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate1 /&gt;) and was widely covered in local and national print. The [[New York Times]] described Satre as &quot;a pony-tailed 16-year-old&quot;&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|title=Testing Presidential Waters as Race at Home Heats Up|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/politics/26allen.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; who confronted Allen at the town hall meeting geared towards Allen's possible 2008 presidential bid. Local press such as the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star, and the Culpeper Star-Exponent also took to Satre's debacle with Senator Allen.&lt;ref name=FreeLanceStar&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Edie|title=Allen avoids 'the' question|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2006/032006/03222006/177410/index_html?page=1|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star|date=22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after Allen's run-in with Satre, the veteran Senator made a notorious comment while campaigning, contributing to Allen's notorious image with the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Macaca&quot; controversy|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Allen_%28U.S._politician%29#.22Macaca.22_controversy|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen lost the election and was succeeded by Senator Jim Webb.

With stronger local support following the media bliss for Equality Fauquier-Culpeper, Satre began sharing the story of his experiences as a gay youth from rural Virginia outside his hometown. He appeared on television and radio shows such as [[Gay USA]] with [[Andy Humm]]&lt;ref name=GayCityNews1&gt;{{cite news|last=Humm|first=Andy|title=High Schooler at the Helm|url=http://204.2.109.187/gcn_515/highschooleratthehelm.html|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Gay City News|date=13-19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;, OutQ on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] with [[Michelangelo Signorile]], and was the first student to appear on Richmond's Education Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comer|first=Matt|title=Teen activist to appear on OutQ radio|url=http://interstateq.com/archives/783/|publisher=InterstateQ|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statewide, Virginia===
In January 2006, Tully founded Commonwealth Education Equality Virginia (CEEVA), a statewide organization advocating for GLBT/Q youth.  He served as president from 2006-2007 but is no longer involved with the organization. In 2007, CEEVA was merged into the Virginia Safe Schools Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comer|first=Matt|title=Young Virginia activist steps down from leadership roles|url=http://interstateq.com/archives/2227/|publisher=InterstateQ|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay-Straight Alliances|url=http://www.virginia-organizing.org/magazine/jan07_marriage.php|publisher=Virginia Organizing Project|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satre was nominated to serve on the Board of Directors for [[Equality Virginia]], to become the first teenager to serve on a statewide gay rights organization in the United States but could not accept the position because he was under the age of 18.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Other===
In 2006 Satre founded The Voice Project for LGBTQI Equality, Support &amp; Inclusion&lt;ref&gt;[http://voiceproject.interstateq.com The Voice Project for LGBTQI Equality, Support &amp; Inclusion] Retrieved March 2011 {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an internet outreach program for GLBT/Q youth which also promotes civic participation among teens for equality. (TVP formed as a national web and community-based organization which sponsors the online network project known as [[Equality Myspace]].) 

In 2006 and 2007, Satre worked with the Creative Youth Theater Foundation and Loudoun Youth Initiative in an original production about bullying. The development of the show was covered in an article in The Washington Post, which highlighted Satre's involvement with the play:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Tully Satre, 17, says he knows what it's like to be bullied. He knows how it feels to be called names and ostracized.

&quot;I'm gay and I go to a Catholic school. You get the picture there,&quot; said the senior at Notre Dame Academy in Middleburg.

But through his involvement in &quot;Normal,&quot; a play about bullying and the teenage experience, he has come to understand that he's a bully, too.

&quot;What's so intense about this process is that we realize we've all been bullies, that some of the things we've said or done could have hurt other people. It's been very awakening,&quot; said Satre, one in a cast of 26 students from Loudoun and Fauquier county schools.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Arianne Aryanpur / Washington Post Staff Writer / The Washington Post / 25 January 2007''

In August 2007 Satre's &quot;The Voice Project&quot; changed leadership as Satre moved to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comer|first=Matt|title=Thousands strong queer youth support network grows; The Voice Project is launched|url=http://interstateq.com/archives/2248/|publisher=InterstateQ|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project no longer appears to be active.

Beginning in May 2010, Satre served for one year on the Associate Board for the Illinois Maternal &amp; Child Health Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associate Board Members|url=http://www.ilmaternal.org/abmembers.html|publisher=Illinois Maternal &amp; Child Health Coalition|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web|last=Satre|first=Tully|title=Curriculum Vitæ|url=http://www.tullysatre.com/cv.html|publisher=Tully Satre|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Northern Virginia Magazine featured Satre in an article about gay marriage in Virginia.&lt;ref name=NoVAmag&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chase|title=Polar Opposites|url=http://www.northernvirginiamag.com/family/family-features/2010/03/22/polar-opposites/|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Northern Virginia Magazine|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article mentions that Satre was told by police to leave a neighborhood (despite a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling) for canvassing against an anti-marriage amendment.

==Writing==
===''The Advocate''===
Fueled by the popularity of Satre's story, ''[[The Advocate]]'' began publishing weekly op-eds written by Satre in May 2006 written by the youth activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Satre|first=Tully|title=Out at 13, Activist at 16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CGUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=outed+at+13+activist+at+16+tully+satre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vBJ-Azkq4N&amp;sig=_kFlJ2aGeXiTpSltlC6U-693rOE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=saAnT-fPBKaE2wXshuzrAg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=outed%20at%2013%20activist%20at%2016%20tully%20satre&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=The Advocate|date=23 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Satre|first=Tully|url=http://www2.advocate.com/authors.asp?nav=2&amp;author=Tully%20Satre|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=The Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Satre's article on Bisexuality, (&quot;I'm no faggot, I'm bisexual&quot; Published on Advocate.com&lt;ref&gt;Satre, Tully, [http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid36192.asp I'm no Faggot, I'm Bisexual] August 2006, advocate.com. Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was the subject of much controversy for the young writer. After receiving an overwhelming response, Satre released a rebuttal to statements made against him in several online gay commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Tully, [http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid36456.asp I am not the enemy] September 2006, advocate.com.

Satre's last article for ''The Advocate'' was published October 2007. He has not published with the magazine since.

===Journalism===
In October 2007, Satre began writing new features for Chicago's [[Windy City Times]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=16428 Windy City Times - Trans-Rights Activists Picket Pelosi Appearance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] October 2007, windycitymediagroup.com. Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily objective reporting, Satre has published a few op-eds similar to his work with ''The Advocate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Satre|first=Tully|title=I'm From Driftwood: Gay true stories|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=30113|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Windy City Times|date=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
