A '''parent-teacher association''' (PTA) or '''Parent-Teacher-Student Association''' (PTSA) is a formal organization composed of parents, teachers and staff that is intended to facilitate parental participation in a school. They occur in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Japan]] and may occur in other countries.

==PTAs in the United States==
In the U.S., most public and private [[K-8 school]]s  have a PTA, a [[Parent Teacher Organization]] or an equivalent local organization. These organizations also occur (though less frequently) at high schools and preschools. 

Groups going by the '''PTA''' acronym are part of the National Parent Teacher Association (National PTA), a [[non-profit]] formerly based in [[Chicago]] (now in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]) that was founded on February 17, 1897, with membership open to anyone who believes in its mission and purposes. The first meeting was held in [[Marietta, Georgia]] by Alice McLellen Birney at [[Marietta High School (Georgia)|Marietta High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:195KSx2abKcJ:www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/b/Birney,Alice_McLellan.html+Alice+McLellan+Birney+marietta&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us Google cache search results] of Alice McLellan Birney Papers collection information&lt;/ref&gt; Every person who joins a local PTA automatically becomes a member of both the state and National PTAs. PTA membership — including the number of affiliated units and of individual members — has been declining for several decades. The group boasted more than 12 million members in the late 1960s; today membership is down below 5.2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;/&gt;

On June 28, 2009, '''Chuck Saylors''' became the 113 year old group's first male president. According to Saylors, only about 10% of the formerly all-female group's members are men.&lt;ref name=&quot;PTA Welcomes First Male President&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106027156 |title=PTA Welcomes First Male President |accessdate=2009-06-28 |work=NPR story }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local groups doing similar work but that are unassociated with the state and national structure of the National PTA are often known as [[Parent Teacher Organization]]s (PTOs). A number of other acronyms are used as well. In the United States, roughly 25% of parent groups are PTAs, while the remainder are independent. There are 23,000 local organizations recognized by the National PTA in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pta.org/1169.asp |title=FAQs / PTA Annual Report |accessdate=2009-03-09 |work=National PTA (United States) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PTAs in the United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom  Parent Teacher Associations are common, being present in the majority of schools (sometimes called Home School Associations). An [[NFER]] study &quot;How are schools involving parents in school life? Annual survey of trends in education 2007&quot; found that 83 per cent of primary schools,  and 60 per cent of secondary schools had a  &quot;PTA or equivalent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfer.ac.uk/nfer/publications/ASO01/ASO01part9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In England, Wales and Northern Ireland PTAs may choose to join [[PTA-UK]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pta.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; which describes itself as &quot;The national charity representing over 13,750 PTAs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland&quot; which seeks &quot;To advance education by encouraging the fullest co-operation between home and school, education authorities, central government and all other interested parties and bodies.&quot; Unlike the USA the fact that a body is called a PTA does not, in itself,  imply membership of any  national organisation. There is a separate, similar body for Scotland. &quot;The Scottish Parent Teacher Council&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sptc.info/&lt;/ref&gt; PTAs are, in general not involved in the Governance of Schools, that is a matter for the school governing bodies, but in practice parents who are active in the PTA will tend to engage in the elections of parent representatives (Parent Governors).
