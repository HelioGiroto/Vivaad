'''Turkey''' ({{lang-tr|Türkiye}}), known officially as the '''Republic of Turkey''' {{nowrap|({{Audio|Tur-Türkiye_Cumhuriyeti.ogg|''Türkiye Cumhuriyeti''}})}}, is a [[Eurasia]]n country located in [[Western Asia]] (mostly in the [[Anatolia|Anatolian peninsula]]) and in [[East Thrace]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: [[Bulgaria]] to the northwest; [[Greece]] to the west; [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the northeast; [[Armenia]], [[Iran]] and the [[Azerbaijan]]i [[exclave]] of [[Nakhchivan]] to the east; and [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] to the southeast. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Cyprus]] are to the south; the [[Aegean Sea]] is to the west; and the [[Black Sea]] is to the north. The [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosphorus]] and the [[Dardanelles]] (which together form the [[Turkish Straits]]) demarcate the boundary between [[East Thrace]] and [[Anatolia]]; they also separate Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatlGeoAtlas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=7th |year=1999 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |isbn=0-7922-7528-4}} &quot;Europe&quot; (pp. 68–69); &quot;Asia&quot; (pp. 90–91): &quot;A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey is one of the six independent [[List of Turkic states and empires|Turkic states]]. The country's official language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which is spoken by approximately 85% of the population as mother tongue.&lt;ref name=milliyet-languages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2007/03/22/guncel/agun.html |title=TÜRKİYE'NİN YÜZDE 85'İ 'ANADİLİM TÜRKÇE' DİYOR |publisher=Milliyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most numerous ethnic group are [[Turkish people|Turks]], who constitute between 70% and 75% of the population according to the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;
[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tu.html Turkey]. The World Factbook. CIA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] are the largest ethnic minority and, according to the same source, number around 18% of the population while other ethnic minorities are estimated to be at 7-12%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; The vast majority of the population is Muslim.

[[Oghuz Turks]] began migrating into the area now called Turkey (derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia'', i.e. &quot;Land of the Turks&quot;) in the 11th century. The process was greatly accelerated by the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] victory over the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/turkey/5.htm |title=Turkey – Turkish Origins |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several small [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] and the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]] ruled Anatolia until the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion. Starting from the 13th century, the [[Ottomans|Ottoman beylik]] united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. After the [[Ottoman Empire]] collapsed following its defeat in [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]], parts of it were occupied by the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. A cadre of young military officers, led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] and his colleagues, organized a successful resistance to the Allies; in 1923, they would establish the modern Republic of Turkey with Atatürk as its first president.

Turkey is a democratic, [[secular state|secular]], [[unitary state|unitary]], [[constitutional republic]] with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey has become increasingly integrated with the West through membership in organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] and the [[G-20 major economies]]. Turkey began [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|full membership negotiations]] with the [[European Union]] in 2005, having been an [[Ankara Agreement|associate member]] of the [[European Economic Community]] since 1963 and having joined the [[European Union Customs Union|EU Customs Union]] in 1995. Turkey has also fostered close cultural, political, economic and industrial relations with the Middle East, the [[List of Turkic states and empires|Turkic states]] of Central Asia and the African countries through membership in organisations such as the [[Turkic Council]], [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Economic Cooperation Organisation]]. 

Turkey's location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it a country of significant geostrategic importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atatürk&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atatürk|first=Andrew|last=Mango|publisher=Overlook|year=2000|isbn=1-58567-011-1}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey; Vol.1, Empire of the Gazis. the rise and decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1280–1808|first=Stanford Jay|last=Shaw|coauthors=Shaw, Ezel Kural|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=0-521-29163-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stratfor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20090317_turkey_and_russia_rise|title=Turkey and Russia on the Rise|publisher=Stratfor|date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its strategic location, Turkey's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a [[regional power]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stratfor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heptagon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heptagonpost.com/Dessi/can_turkey_be_a_source_of_stability_in_the_middle_east |title=Can Turkey Be a Source of Stability in the Middle East? |publisher=heptagonpost.com |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Turkey}}

The name of Turkey, ''Türkiye'' in the [[Turkish language]], can be divided into two components: the [[ethnonym]] ''[[Turkic peoples|Türk]]'' and the abstract suffix ''–iye'' meaning &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;land of&quot; or &quot;related to&quot; (derived from the [[Arabic grammar#Nisba|Arabic suffix]] ''–iyya'', which is similar to the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] suffixes ''–ia''). The first recorded use of the term &quot;Türk&quot; or &quot;Türük&quot; as an [[exonym and endonym|autonym]] is contained in the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon inscriptions]] of the [[Göktürks]] (''Celestial Turks'') of Central Asia (c. 8th century). The English word &quot;Turkey&quot; is derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia'' (c. 1369).&lt;ref name=&quot;TurkEtymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Turk|title=Turk|first=Douglas|last=Harper|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2011-05-24|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[cognate]] of this name, ''[[Name of Turkey|Tourkia]]'' ({{lang-el|Τουρκία}}) was originally used by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] to [[Holy Crown of Hungary#Corona Græca|describe medieval Hungary]]&lt;ref group=dn&gt;On the right side of the ''[[Holy Crown of Hungary#Corona Græca|Corona Græca]]'' in the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], there is a picture of the Hungarian King [[Géza I]] (1074–1077), with the Byzantine Greek inscription: &quot;ΓΕΩΒΙΤZΑC ΠΙΣΤΟC ΚΡΑΛΗC ΤΟΥΡΚΙΑC&quot; (''Geōvitzas pistós králēs Tourkías'', meaning &quot;[[Géza I]], faithful [[kralj]] of the [[Hungary|land of the Turks]]&quot;).

Similarly, the medieval [[Khazars|Khazar Empire]], a Turkic state on the northern shores of the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] seas, was referred to as ''Tourkia'' (''Land of the Turks'') in Byzantine sources. However, the Byzantines later began using this name to define the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]]-controlled parts of [[Anatolia]] in the centuries that followed the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071.

{{Main|History of Anatolia}}
[[File:Troy1.jpg|thumb|left|Portion of the legendary walls of [[Troy|Troy (VII)]], identified as the site of the [[Trojan War]] (ca. 1200 BCE.)]]

The [[Anatolia|Anatolian peninsula]], comprising most of modern Turkey, is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world.  [[Göbekli Tepe]] is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure, a temple dating to 10,000 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchMag&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov/Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Çatalhöyük]] is a very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BCE to 5700 BCE. It is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date and in July 2012 was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/catalhoyuk_world_heritage_list Çatalhöyük added to UNESCO World Heritage List] Global Heritage Fund blog article&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ephesus Celsus Library Façade .jpg|thumb|The [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], dating from 135 AD.]]

The settlement of [[Troy]] started in the Neolithic and continued into the [[Iron Age]]. Through recorded history, Anatolians have spoken [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Kartvelian languages]], as well as many languages of uncertain affiliation. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages radiated.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnatoliaIndoEuropean&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balter|first=Michael|title=Search for the Indo-Europeans: Were Kurgan horsemen or Anatolian farmers responsible for creating and spreading the world's most far-flung language family?|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=303|issue=5662|page=1323|date=2004-02-27|doi=10.1126/science.303.5662.1323|pmid=14988549}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest recorded inhabitants of Anatolia were the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]], non-Indo-European peoples who inhabited central and eastern Anatolia, respectively, as early as ca. 2300 BC. Indo-European [[Hittites]] came to Anatolia and gradually absorbed the Hattians and Hurrians ca. 2000–1700 BC. The first major empire in the area was founded by the [[Hittites]], from the eighteenth through the 13th century BC. The [[Assyria]]ns conquered and settled parts of southeastern Turkey as early as 1950 BC until the year 612 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.uakron.edu/ziyaret/timeline_3period.html |title=Ziyaret Tepe – Turkey Archaeological Dig Site |publisher=uakron.edu |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/assyrianidentity.pdf |title=Assyrian Identity In Ancient Times And Today' |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:İstanbul-Ayasofya.JPG|thumb|left|Originally a church, later a mosque, and now a museum, the [[Hagia Sophia]] was built by the Byzantines in the 6th century.]]

Following the collapse of the Hittite empire c. 1180 BC, the [[Phrygia]]ns, an Indo-European people, achieved ascendancy in Anatolia until their kingdom was destroyed by the [[Cimmerians]] in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;TroyHittiteEmpirePhrygians&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/03/waa/ht03waa.htm|title=Anatolia and the Caucasus, 2000–1000 B.C. in ''Timeline of Art History.''|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|authorlink=Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2006-12-21|month=October|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful of Phrygia's successor states were [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]]. The Lydians and Lycians spoke languages that were fundamentally Indo-European, but both languages had acquired non-Indo-European elements prior to the Hittite and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] periods.

Starting around 1200 BC, the coast of [[Anatolia]] was heavily settled by [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] and [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists, such as [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Smyrna]] (modern [[İzmir]]), and [[Byzantium]] (later [[Constantinople]] and [[Istanbul]].) The first state that was called [[Armenia]] by neighboring peoples was the state of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Orontid dynasty]], which included parts of eastern Turkey beginning in the 6th century BC.

The ''[[Seljuq dynasty|House of Seljuk]]'' was a branch of the ''Kınık'' [[Oghuz Turks|Oğuz Turks]] who resided on the periphery of the [[Muslim history#Abbasids - &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot;|Muslim world]], in the Yabghu [[Khagan]]ate of the Oğuz confederacy, to the north of the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea]]s, in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al Hind: The Making of the Indo Islamic World, Vol. 1, Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, 7th–11th Centuries|first=Andre|last=Wink|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=1990|isbn=90-04-09249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} In the 10th century the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into [[Persia]], which became the administrative core of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Great Seljuk Empire]]. 

In the latter half of the 11th century the Seljuks began penetrating into the eastern regions of [[Anatolia]]. The victory of the Seljuk sultan [[Alp Arslan]] against the Byzantine emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 gave rise to the [[Sultanate of Rum|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]], which developed as a separate branch of the Great Seljuk Empire that covered parts of Central Asia, Persia, Anatolia, the [[Levant]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|southeast Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|first=Cyril|last=Mango|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=2002|isbn=0-19-814098-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], causing the Seljuk Empire's power to slowly disintegrate. In its wake, one of the [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish principalities]] governed by [[Osman I]] would, over the next 200 years, evolve into the [[Ottoman Empire]], expanding throughout [[Anatolia]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Levant]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottomans&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire|first=Patrick|last=Kinross|publisher=Morrow|year=1977|isbn=0-688-03093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} In 1453, the Ottomans completed their conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire]] by [[Fall of Constantinople|capturing its capital]], [[Constantinople]].

In 1514, Sultan [[Selim I]] (1512–1520) successfully expanded the Empire's southern and eastern borders by defeating Shah [[Ismail I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]]. In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into [[Ottoman Algeria|Algeria]] and [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|Egypt]], and created a naval presence in the [[Red Sea]]. Subsequently, a competition started between the Ottoman and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires to become the dominant sea power in the [[Indian Ocean]], with [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|numerous naval battles]] in the Red Sea, the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived as a threat for the Ottoman monopoly over the ancient trading routes between [[East Asia]] and [[Western Europe]] (later collectively named the [[Silk Road]], a term coined by [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Approaches Old and New to the Silk Roads&quot; Vadime Eliseeff in: ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce''.

The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The empire was often at odds with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in its steady advance towards [[Central Europe]] through the [[Balkans]] and the southern part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|first=Stanford|last=Jay Shaw|coauthors=Kural Shaw, Ezel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=0-521-29163-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} At sea, the [[Ottoman Navy]] contended with several [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]]s (composed primarily of [[Habsburg Spain]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]], the [[Papal States]], the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]) for control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

From the beginning of the 19th century onwards, the Ottoman Empire [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|began to decline]].

The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|rise in nationalist sentiment among the various subject peoples]], leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the [[Hamidian Massacres]]. The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. During the war, an estimated 1.5 million [[Armenians]] were deported and exterminated in the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/genocide.html|title=FACT SHEET: ARMENIAN GENOCIDE|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Totten, Samuel, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L.

===Republic of Turkey===
{{Main|History of the Republic of Turkey|Atatürk's Reforms}}
[[File:MustafaKemalAtaturk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey.]]

The [[occupation of Constantinople]] and [[Occupation of Smyrna|Smyrna]] by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the [[establishment of the Turkish national movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot; /&gt; Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] [[Pasha]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atatürk&quot;/&gt;

By 18 September 1922, the occupying armies were expelled, and the new Turkish state was established. On 1 November, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|newly founded parliament]] formally abolished the [[Sultan]]ate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of 24 July 1923 led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed &quot;Republic of Turkey&quot; as the [[successor state]] of the Ottoman Empire, and the republic was officially proclaimed on 29 October 1923 in [[Ankara]], the country's new capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottoman_Turkey&quot; /&gt; The Lausanne treaty stipulated a [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], whereby 1.1 million Greeks left Turkey for Greece in exchange for 380,000 Muslims transferred from Greece to Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clogg&quot;&gt;Clogg, Richard, ''A Concise History of Greece'', page 101.

Turkey is a founding member of the United Nations (1945), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] (1961), the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] (1969), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] (1973), the [[Economic Cooperation Organization|ECO]] (1985), the [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation|BSEC]] (1992) and the [[G-20 major economies]] (1999).

Security Council in 1951–1952, 1954–1955 and 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hürriyet UN Security&quot;/&gt;

In line with its traditional Western orientation, relations with Europe have always been a central part of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey became a founding member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949, applied for associate membership of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] (predecessor of the [[European Union]]) in 1959 and became an [[Ankara Agreement|associate member]] in 1963. After decades of political negotiations, Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, became an associate member of the [[Western European Union]] in 1992, joined the [[European Union Customs Union|EU Customs Union]] in 1995 and has been in [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|formal accession negotiations]] with the EU since 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR_EUChrono&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abgs.gov.tr/en/tur-eu_relations_dosyalar/chronology.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070515022203/http://www.abgs.gov.tr/en/tur-eu_relations_dosyalar/chronology.htm|archivedate=2007-05-15|title=Chronology of Turkey-EU relations|publisher=Turkish Secretariat of European Union Affairs|accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1974, Turkey has not recognized the [[Republic of Cyprus]], but instead supports the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot community]] in the form of the de facto [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], which was established in 1983 and is recognized only by Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mardell&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6170749.stm |title=Turkey's EU membership bid stalls|first=Mark|last=Mardell|authorlink=Mark Mardell|work=BBC|accessdate=2006-12-17|date=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cyprus dispute]] complicates Turkey's relations with both NATO and the EU, and remains a major stumbling block to Turkey's [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|EU accession bid.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mardell&quot;/&gt;

The other defining aspect of Turkey's foreign relations has been its ties with the United States. Based on the common threat posed by the [[Soviet Union]], Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] throughout the [[Cold War]]. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Balkans]]. In return, Turkey has benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key issues such as the country's bid to join the European Union.

The independence of the [[Turkic states]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage, allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into [[Central Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkish Foreign Policy In Post Cold War Era|first=Idris|last=Bal|publisher=Universal Publishers|year=2004|isbn=1-58112-423-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vDzjkrTDKjYC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=turkey+cold+war }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus enabling the completion of a multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]] to the port of [[Ceyhan]] in Turkey.

Turkey has maintained forces in international missions under the United Nations and NATO since 1950, including [[peacekeeping]] missions in [[Somalia]] and former [[Yugoslavia]], and support to coalition forces in the [[First Gulf War]]. Turkey maintains 36,000 troops in northern Cyprus; their presence is supported and approved by the ''de facto'' local government, but the [[Republic of Cyprus]] and the international community regard it as an illegal occupation force, and its presence has also been denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;O.P.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Further|List of regions of Turkey|Provinces of Turkey|Districts of Turkey}}
[[File:Turkey districts.png|thumb|right|275px|[[Districts of Turkey]]]]
The capital city of Turkey is [[Ankara]]. The territory of Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. The provinces are organized into 7 [[Regions of Turkey|regions]] for [[Census#Turkey|census]] purposes; however, they do not represent an administrative structure. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 923 districts.

Provinces usually bear the same name as their provincial capitals, also called the central district; exceptions to this custom are the provinces of [[Hatay Province|Hatay]] (capital: [[Antakya]]), [[Kocaeli Province|Kocaeli]] (capital: [[İzmit]]) and [[Sakarya Province|Sakarya]] (capital: [[Adapazarı]]). Provinces with the largest populations are [[Istanbul]] (13 million), [[Ankara Province|Ankara]] (5 million), [[İzmir Province|İzmir]] (4 million), [[Bursa Province|Bursa]] (3 million) and [[Adana Province|Adana]] (2 million).

The biggest city and the pre-Republican capital [[Istanbul]] is the financial, economic and cultural heart of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;USLC_TRGeo&quot; /&gt; An estimated 75.5% of Turkey's population live in urban centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Turkish Statistical Institute|authorlink=Turkish Statistical Institute|publisher=Turkish Statistical Institute|url=http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=6178|title=2009 Census, population living in cities |accessdate=2010-01-25|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 19 provinces have populations that exceed 1 million inhabitants, and 20 provinces have populations between 1 million and 500,000 inhabitants. Only two provinces have populations less than 100,000.

The European section of Turkey, [[East Thrace]], forms the borders of Turkey with Greece and Bulgaria. The Asian part of the country, [[Anatolia]], consists of a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains, between the [[Köroğlu Mountains|Köroğlu]] and [[Pontic Mountains|Pontic]] mountain ranges to the north and the [[Taurus Mountains]] to the south. Eastern Turkey has a more mountainous landscape and is home to the sources of rivers such as the [[Euphrates]], [[Tigris]] and [[Aras River|Aras]], and contains [[Mount Ararat]], Turkey's highest point at 5,137 metres (16,854&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name=&quot;TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=4996|title=Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı), Turkey|author=NASA – Earth Observatory|authorlink=NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2006-12-27|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lake Van]], the largest lake in the country.

Turkey is divided into [[List of regions of Turkey|seven census regions]]: [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]], [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea]], [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolia]], [[East Anatolia Region, Turkey|Eastern Anatolia]], [[South Eastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Southeastern Anatolia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]]. The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turizm.net/turkey/info/geography.html|title=Geography of Turkey|author=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|publisher=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=2006-12-13|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey's varied landscapes are the product of complex earth movements that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions. The [[Bosphorus]] and the [[Dardanelles]] owe their existence to the [[geologic fault|fault lines]] running through Turkey that led to the creation of the Black Sea. There is an earthquake fault line across the north of the country from west to east, which caused [[1999 İzmit earthquake|a major earthquake]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/civil_eng/structural_lab/eq-rp/seismicity.html|title=Brief Seismic History of Turkey|publisher=University of South California, Department of Civil Engineering|accessdate=2006-12-26}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marmaris TURKEY.JPG|thumb|left|[[Marmaris]] on the [[Turkish Riviera|Turquoise Coast]] of Turkey, which is famous for its [[Blue Cruise]] voyages with [[gulet]] type [[schooner]]s.]]

The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea have a [[temperate]] [[Mediterranean climate]], with hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters. The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Black Sea have a temperate [[Oceanic climate]] with warm, wet summers and cool to cold, wet winters. The Turkish Black Sea coast receives the greatest amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and is the only region of Turkey that receives high precipitation throughout the year. The eastern part of that coast averages 2,500 millimetres annually which is the highest precipitation in the country.

The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Sea of Marmara (including Istanbul), which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate Oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow does occur on the coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but it usually lies no more than a few days. Snow on the other hand is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.

[[File:Pamukkale Turkey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pamukkale]]]]

Conditions can be much harsher in the more arid interior. Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean influences from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian [[plateau]] of the interior of Turkey a [[continental climate]] with sharply contrasting seasons.

Winters on the eastern part of the plateau are especially severe. Temperatures of −30 [[Celsius|°C]] to −40 °C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F to −40 °F) can occur in eastern Anatolia, and snow may lie on the ground at least 120 days of the year. In the west, winter temperatures average below 1 °C (34 °F). Summers are hot and dry, with temperatures generally above 30 °C (86 °F) in the day. Annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] averages about 400 millimetres (15&amp;nbsp;in), with actual amounts determined by elevation. The driest regions are the Konya plain and the Malatya plain, where annual rainfall frequently is less than 300 millimetres (12&amp;nbsp;in). May is generally the wettest month, whereas July and August are the driest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080419130806/http://www.meteor.gov.tr/2006/english/eng-climateofturkey.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070110140758/http://www.meteor.gov.tr/2006/english/eng-climateofturkey.aspx|archivedate=2007-01-10|title=Climate of Turkey|author=Turkish State Meteorological Service|authorlink=Turkish State Meteorological Service|publisher=Turkish State Meteorological Service|accessdate=2006-12-27|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey has mostly adhered to a quasi-[[statism|statist]] approach with strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over private sector participation, foreign trade, flow of foreign currency, and [[foreign direct investment]]. However, in 1983 Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, [[market economy|market]]-based model.&lt;ref name=&quot;80sLiberalization&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics and Politics of Turkish Liberalization|first=Tevfik F.|last=Nas|publisher=Lehigh University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-934223-19-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey has gradually opened up its markets through economic reforms by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment and the [[privatization|privatisation]] of publicly owned industries, and the liberalisation of many sectors to private and foreign participation has continued amid political debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR_Eco&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6103008.stm|title=Robust economy raises Turkey's hopes|first=Jorn|last=Madslien|work=BBC|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=2006-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public debt to GDP ratio, while well below its levels during the recession of 2001, reached 46% in 2010 Q3.

Turkey's economy is becoming more dependent on industry in major cities, mostly concentrated in the western provinces of the country, and less on agriculture.  However, traditional agriculture is still a major pillar of the Turkish economy. In 2010, the agricultural sector accounted for 9% of GDP, while the industrial sector accounted for 26% and the services sector 65%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; However, agriculture still accounted for 24.7% of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/enlargement/countries/turkey/profile_en.pdf |title=Turkey – Agriculture and Enlargement |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, it was estimated that 46% of total disposable income was received by the top of 20% income earners, while the lowest 20% received 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.die.gov.tr/ENGLISH/SONIST/GELIR/k_270206.xls|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061014214703/http://www.die.gov.tr/ENGLISH/SONIST/GELIR/k_270206.xls|archivedate=2006-10-14|title=The result of Income Distribution|author=Turkish Statistical Institute|authorlink=Turkish Statistical Institute|publisher=Turkish Statistical Institute|accessdate=2006-12-11|date=2006-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eurostat]] data, Turkish PPS GDP per capita stood at 49% of the EU average in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-13122011-BP/EN/2-13122011-BP-EN.PDF|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey has taken advantage of the [[European Union – Turkey Customs Union]], signed in 1995, to increase its industrial production destined for exports, while at the same time benefiting from EU-origin foreign investment into the country. Turkey now has also opportunity of a free trade agreement with the European Union (EU) – without full membership – that allows it to manufacture for tarif-free sale throughout the EU market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morning |first=Money |url=http://www.europeanbusiness.gr/page.asp?pid=829 |title=The CIVETS: Windfall Wealth From the ′New′ BRIC Economies |publisher=Europeanbusiness.gr |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/05/03/000016406_20060503112446/Rendered/PDF/wps3908.pdf |format=PDF|title=Turkey's evolving trade integration into Pan-European markets|author=Bartolomiej Kaminski|coauthors=Francis Ng|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=2006-12-27|date=2006-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009 exports were $110 bn and in 2010 it was $117 bn (main export partners in 2009: Germany 10%, France 6%, UK 6%, Italy 6%, Iraq 5%).

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Turkey}}

[[File:Orhan Pamuk 2009 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Orhan Pamuk]] is one of the leading contemporary Turkish novelists and the recipient of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].]]

Turkey has a very diverse culture that is a blend of various elements of the [[Turkic peoples|Oğuz Turkic]], [[Anatolia]]n, [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (which was itself a continuation of both [[Greco-Roman]] and Islamic cultures) and [[Western culture]] and traditions, which started with the [[Tanzimat|Westernisation of the Ottoman Empire]] and still continues today. This mix originally began as a result of the encounter of Turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during [[Turkic migration|their migration]] from Central Asia to the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR_culture&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turks.org.uk/index.php?pid=8|title=Turks – A Journey of a Thousand Years: 600–1600|author=Royal Academy of Arts|authorlink=Royal Academy of Arts|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|accessdate=2006-12-12|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Turkey successfully transformed from the religion-based former Ottoman Empire into a modern nation-state with a very strong separation of state and religion, an increase in the modes of artistic expression followed. During the first years of the republic, the government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts; such as museums, theatres, opera houses and architecture. Diverse historical factors play important roles in defining the modern Turkish identity. Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a &quot;modern&quot; Western state, while maintaining traditional religious and historical values.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR_culture&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Theory and Later Modernities: The Turkish Experience|first=İbrahim|last=Kaya|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-85323-898-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0Iy7pJBRgjYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Turkish+culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mix of cultural influences is dramatized, for example, in the form of the &quot;new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures&quot; enacted in the works of [[Orhan Pamuk]], recipient of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm|title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|work=BBC|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sertab Erener 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sertab Erener]] and [[Demir Demirkan]]]]

[[Music of Turkey|Turkish music]] and [[Turkish literature|literature]] form great examples of such a mix of cultural influences, which were a result of the interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe, thus contributing to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkmusikisi.com/osmanli_musikisi/the_ottoman_music.htm|title=The Ottoman music|author=Cinuçen Tanrıkorur|authorlink=Cinuçen Tanrıkorur|publisher=turkmusikisi.com|accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish literature was heavily influenced by [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Arabic literature]] during most of the Ottoman era, though towards the end of the Ottoman Empire, particularly after the [[Tanzimat]] period, the effect of both Turkish folk and European literary traditions became increasingly felt. The Tanzimat reforms of 1839–1876 brought changes to the language of Ottoman written literature, and introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the novel and the short story. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal|Nâmık Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''İntibâh'' (Awakening), while the journalist [[İbrahim Şinasi|Şinasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy &quot;''Şair Evlenmesi''&quot; (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the ''Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde'' (New Literature) movement; the ''Fecr-i Âtî'' (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the ''Millî Edebiyyât'' (National Literature) movement. The ''Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde'' (New Literature) movement began with the founding in 1891 of the magazine ''Servet-i Fünûn'' (''Scientific Wealth''), which was largely devoted to progress (both intellectual and scientific) along the Western model. Accordingly, the magazine's literary ventures, under the direction of the poet [[Tevfik Fikret]], were geared towards creating a Western-style &quot;[[High culture|high art]]&quot; in Turkey. 

[[File:DolmabahceMainGate.JPG|thumb|One of the main entrance gates of the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] in Istanbul.]]

The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was taken by [[Nâzım Hikmet]], who introduced the [[free verse]] style. Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the [[Garip Movement]] led by [[Orhan Veli Kanık]], [[Melih Cevdet Anday]] and [[Oktay Rıfat]]. Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art. They employed not only a variant of the free verse introduced by Nâzım Hikmet, but also a highly colloquial language, and wrote primarily about mundane daily subjects and the ordinary man on the street. The reaction was immediate and polarized: most of the academic establishment and older poets vilified them, while much of the Turkish population embraced them wholeheartedly.

Architectural elements found in Turkey are also testaments to the unique mix of traditions that have influenced the region over the centuries. In addition to the traditional [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine elements]] present in numerous parts of Turkey, many artifacts of the later [[Ottoman architecture]], with its exquisite blend of local and Islamic traditions, are to be found throughout the country, as well as in many former territories of the Ottoman Empire. [[Mimar Sinan]] is widely regarded as the greatest architect of the classical period in Ottoman architecture. Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by Western styles, and this can be particularly seen in Istanbul where buildings like [[Dolmabahçe Palace|Dolmabahçe]] and [[Çırağan Palace]]s are juxtaposed next to numerous modern skyscrapers, all of them representing different traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Ottoman Architecture|first=Godfrey|last=Goodwin|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2003|isbn=0-500-27429-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]] was won by singer [[Sertab Erener]] with the song &quot;[[Everyway That I Can]]&quot; which was written by Erener and [[Demir Demirkan]].
