{{About|the international law describing a territory in which two sovereign powers have equal rights|the form of housing|Condominium}}

In [[international law]], a '''condominium''' (plural either ''condominia'', as in Latin, or condominiums) is a political territory (state or border area) in or over which two or more sovereign powers formally agree to share equally ''dominium'' (in the sense of sovereignty) and exercise their rights jointly, without dividing it up into 'national' zones.

Although a condominium has always been recognized as a theoretical possibility, condominiums have been rare in practice. A major problem, and the reason why so few have existed in practice, is the difficulty of ensuring co-operation between the sovereign powers; once the understanding fails, the status is likely to become untenable.

The word is recorded in English since c.1714, from Modern Latin, apparently coined in Germany c.1700 from Latin ''com-'' &quot;together&quot; + ''dominium'' &quot;right of ownership&quot; (compare [[demesne|domain]]).

== Current condominia ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
* The [[Moselle River]], and its tributaries the Sauer and the Our, comprise a condominium between [[Luxembourg]] and Germany, who share bridges and at least the tip of one island (near [[Schengen, Luxembourg|Schengen]]). The condominium was established by treaty in 1816.
* [[Pheasant Island]] (also known as Conference Island, ''Konpantzia'' in Basque, ''Île de la Conférence'' in French or ''Isla de los Faisanes'' in Spanish) in the [[Bidassoa|River Bidassoa]] between France and Spain. It was established by the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659.
* A small area ([[Hadf]] and surroundings) on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is jointly ruled by [[Oman]] and the [[United Arab Emirates|Emirati]] member state of [[Ajman]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
* Parts of the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] and of the territorial sea outside its mouth comprise a unique tridominium between [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* The main part of [[Lake Constance]] (without islands) is considered by Austria to be a tridominium between Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This view is not shared by Germany or Switzerland.
* The part of the [[Paraná River]] between the [[Salto Grande de Sete Quedas]] and the mouth of the [[Iguassu River]] is shared in condominium by Brazil and [[Paraguay]].
* [[Brčko District]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] forms part of both the [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

* It has been proposed by Iran that the [[Caspian Sea]] be a pentadominium of Russia, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] (its five [[littoral]] states), but it is not in fact.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Co-principality ==
Under French law, [[Andorra]] was once considered to be a French&amp;ndash;Spanish condominium, although it is more commonly classed as a [[co-principality]], since it is itself a sovereign state, not a possession of one or more foreign powers, even though the quality of Head of State is shared ''ex officio'' by two foreigners.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Former condominia ==
* In 688 the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian II]] and the Arab [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reached  an unprecedented agreement to establish a condominium (the  concept did not yet exist) over [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages#Arab Condominium|Cyprus]], with the collected taxes from the island being equally divided between the two parties. The arrangement lasted for some 300 years, despite the fact that in the same time there  was nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland.
* [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] was legally an [[Egypt]]ian-British condominium from 1899 until 1956, although in reality Egypt played no role in its government other than providing some administrators in the country, all political decisions were made by the UK and all Governs of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan were British. Though the system was resented by Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists, and would later be disavowed by the Egyptian Government, it persisted due to the United Kingdom's effective control over Egypt itself, which began from 1882 and continued until at least 1936.
* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was a condominium of [[Cisleithania|Cisleithanian Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] between 1908 and 1918, while both countries were parts of the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].
* The [[Independent State of Croatia]] during World War II from 1941 to 1943 was a condominium of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] until the collapse of the Italian Fascist regime in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Jozo Tomasevich. &quot;The Chetniks&quot;.

Pp. 153-154. &quot;After the Axis attack on Yugoslavia in 1941, Mussolini and Hitler installed the Ustašas in power in Zagreb, making them the nucleus of a dependent regime of the newly created Independent State of Croatia, an Italo-German condominium predicated on the abolition of Yugoslavia.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=4bjt2g6zFcIC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Italo-German+condominium&amp;lr=]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Günay Göksu Özdoğan, Kemâli Saybaşılı.

* [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] were a British&amp;ndash;[[USA|American]] condominium from 1939 until 1979 when they became part of [[Kiribati]]
* [[Couto Misto]] was shared until 1864 between Spain and Portugal, even though in its final decades of existence it was ''[[de facto]]'' independent.
* Countship of [[Friesland]] ([[West Frisia (historical)|West Frisia]]), since 1165 under Imperial administration, was from 1165 to 1493 a joint condominium of the [[Count of Holland]] and the [[Prince-bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Utrecht]], then again until 25 October 1555 under Imperial administration
* [[History_of_Egypt_under_the_Muhammad_Ali_dynasty#Dual_control|Egypt from 1876-1882]], under France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minefe.gouv.fr/fonds_documentaire/notes_bleues/nbb/nbb270/entente_cordiale.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* The City of [[Erfurt]] from 12th century until the [[Thirty Years' War]] was shared between the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]] and the Counts of [[Gleichen]], the latter replaced by the city council in 1289 (Concordata Gebhardi), the Landgrave of [[Thuringia]] in 1327 and the [[House of Wettin]] in 1483 (Treaty of Weimar)
* The [[Free City of Kraków]] was a protectorate of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] from 1815 until 1846, when it was annexed by Austria
* [[Maastricht]], was a condominium for 5 centuries until 1794. It was shared between the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the latter replaced by the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1632
* [[Nauru]] a tripartite condominium [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] territory administered by Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom from 1923 to 1942 and again in 1947 as a [[trust territory]] until independence in 1968
* The village of [[Nennig]] was a condominium of the [[Electorate of Trier|Trier bishopric]], [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] (the [[Early Modern France|Kingdom of France]] from 1766) and [[County, Duchy and Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] until its annexation by [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]] in 1794
* [[Neutral Moresnet]] was shared from 1816 until 1919 between the Netherlands (later Belgium) and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]
* [[New Hebrides]] formed a French&amp;ndash;British condominium in 1906 until independence in 1980 as a republic, now called [[Vanuatu]]
* [[Northern Dobruja]] by the Central powers (German-Austrian-Bulgarian) during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danstopicals.com/bulgaria.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oregon Country]] was an Anglo-American condominium from 1818 until 1846
* [[Samoan Islands]] from 1889 to 1899 were a rare tripartite condominium under joint [[protectorate]] of Germany, Britain and the USA.
* The [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]] was at first administered jointly by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] following the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War]] until its partition according to the [[Gastein Convention]] in the next year
* The [[County of Sponheim]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was ruled since the 15th century by the [[Margraviate of Baden|Margraves of Baden]], the [[Palatinate of the Rhine|Counts Palatine of the Rhine]]  and the [[County of Veldenz|Counts of Veldenz]], later [[Palatinate-Simmern]], [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]] and [[Palatinate-Birkenfeld]] as heirs of Veldenz.
* [[Togoland]], formerly a German protectorate, was an Anglo-French condominium, from when the United Kingdom and France occupied it on 26 August 1914 until its partition on 27 December 1916 into French and British zones. The divided Togoland became two separate [[League of Nations mandate]]s on 20 July 1922: [[British Togoland]], which joined Gold Coast (present day [[Ghana]]) in 1956, and [[French Togoland]], which is now the nation of [[Togo]].
* [[Zaporozhian Sich]], a brief Russo-Polish condominium, was established in 1667 by the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]].
* The term is sometimes even applied to a similar arrangement between members of a Monarch's countries in (personal or formal) union, as was the case for the district of [[Fiume]] (Rijeka), shared between Hungary and [[Croatia]] within the Habsburg Empire since 1868.
* Between 1913 and 1920 [[Spitsbergen]] was a neutral condominium. The [[Svalbard Treaty|Spitsbergen Treaty]] of February 9, 1920, recognises the full and absolute sovereignty of Norway over all the arctic archipelago of [[Svalbard]]. The exercise of sovereignty is, however, subject to certain stipulations, and not all Norwegian law applies. Originally limited to nine signatory nations, over 40 are now signatories of the treaty. Citizens of any of the signatory countries may settle in the archipelago. Currently, only Norway and Russia make use of this right.

==Proposed condominium==
* In 2001, the British government held discussions with Spain with a view to putting a proposal for joint sovereignty to the people of [[Gibraltar]]. This initiative was pre-emptively rejected by Gibraltarians in the [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|2002 referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gi.html CIA - The World Factbook -- Gibraltar] US Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3851047.stm#overview BBC News | Europe | Country profiles | Regions and territories: Gibraltar] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, the Canadian and Danish governments were close to an agreement to declare [[Hans Island]] a condominium, after decades in dispute. Another considered alternative was to divide the island in half. Negotiations are still in progress.
