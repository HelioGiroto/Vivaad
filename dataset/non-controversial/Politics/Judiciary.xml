''[http://books.google.com/books?id=AwwH0F8iC9QC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=%22lady+justice%22+symbol&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=uXb8Se-IC4GuyATlm5SPBg The challenge of chanf for judicial systems]'', page 137 (IOS Press 2000): “the judicial system is intended to be apolitical, its symbol being that of a blindfolded Lady Justice holding balanced scales.”&lt;/ref&gt; (statue at Shelby County Courthouse, Memphis, TN, United States)]]

The '''judiciary''' (also known as the '''judicial system''') is the system of  [[court]]s that interprets and applies the [[law]] in the name of the [[State (polity)|state]].  The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the [[dispute resolution|resolution of disputes]]. Under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], the judiciary generally does not make law (that is, in a plenary fashion, which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case.
This branch of the state is often tasked with ensuring [[equal justice under law]].  It usually consists of a court of final appeal (called the &quot;[[Supreme court]]&quot; or &quot;[[Constitutional court]]&quot;), together with lower courts.

In many jurisdictions the judicial branch has the power to change laws through the process of [[judicial review]]. Courts with judicial review power may annul the laws and rules of the state when it finds them incompatible with a higher norm, such as [[primary legislation]], the provisions of the [[constitution]] or [[international law]]. Judges constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution, thus ''de facto'' in [[common law]] countries creating the body of constitutional law.

During last decades the judiciary became active in economic issues related with economic rights established by  constitution because &quot;economics may provide insight into questions that bear on
the proper legal interpretation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Posner R. The Constitution as an Economic Document. The George
Washington Law Review. November 1982
. Vol. 56. No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
Since many a country with a transitional political and economic system continues treating its constitution as an abstract legal document disengaged from the economic policy of the state, practice of judicial review of economic acts of executive and legislative branches began to grow.

In the 1980s, the [[Supreme Court of India]] for almost a decade had been encouraging [[public interest litigation]] on behalf of the poor and oppressed by using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the [[Indian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cooper, ''Poverty and Constitutional Justice'', in ''Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings'', edited by Larry May and Jeff Brown, Wiley-Blackwell, UK, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Budget]] of the judiciary in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]].
It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;judiciary&quot; is also used to refer collectively to the personnel, such as [[judge]]s, [[magistrate]]s and other adjudicators, who form the core of a judiciary (sometimes referred to as a &quot;[[bench (law)|bench]]&quot;), as well as the staffs who keep the system running smoothly.&lt;/small&gt;

==History==
After the [[French Revolution]], lawmakers stopped interpretation of law by judges, and the legislature was the only body permitted to interpret the law; this prohibition was later overturned by the [[Code Napoléon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cappelletti, Mauro et al.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=gC2sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Napoleon+and+%22interpret+the+law%22+code&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=qIj8Sc3wLKqMygTunqS6Dg#PPA150,M1 The Italian Legal System]'', page 150 (Stanford University Press 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

In civil law jurisdictions at present, judges interpret the law to about the same extent as in common law jurisdictions{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} &amp;ndash; however it is different than the common law tradition which directly recognizes the limited power to make law. For instance, in [[France]], the ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'' of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] or the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] is equivalent in practice with [[case law]]. However, the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines:  a single [[legal opinion|court decision]] can provide sufficient foundation for the common law doctrine of ''stare decisis'', however, &quot;a
series of [[case law|adjudicated cases]], all in accord, form the basis for ''jurisprudence constante''.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

==Various functions==
{{Politics}}
*In common or provinces{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;!-- meaning of &quot;provinces&quot; or a more layman's term --&gt;, courts interpret law, including constitutions, statutes, and regulations. They also make law (but in a limited sense, limited to the facts of particular cases) based upon prior [[case law]] in areas where the legislature has not made law. For instance, the [[tort]] of [[negligence]] is not derived from statute law in most common law jurisdictions. The term ''common law'' refers to this kind of law.
*In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts interpret the law, but are prohibited from ''creating'' law, and thus do not issue rulings more general than the actual case to be judged. [[Jurisprudence]] plays a similar role to case law.
* In the [[Courts of the United States|United States court system]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] is the final authority on the interpretation of the federal Constitution and all statutes and regulations created pursuant to it, as well as the constitutionality of the various state laws; in the [[United States federal courts|US federal court system]], federal cases are tried in [[trial court]]s, known as the [[United States district court|US district courts]], followed by [[appellate court]]s and then the Supreme Court.

* In [[France]], the final authority on the interpretation of the law is the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] for administrative cases, and the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] for civil and criminal cases.
* In the People's Republic of China, the final authority on the interpretation of the law is the [[National People's Congress]].
* Other countries such as [[Argentina]] have mixed systems that include lower courts, appeals courts, a cassation court (for criminal law) and a Supreme Court. In this system the Supreme Court is always the final authority, but criminal cases have four stages, one more than civil law does. On the court sits a total of nine justices. This number has been changed several times.
