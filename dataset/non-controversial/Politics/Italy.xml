To the north, it borders [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], and [[Slovenia]] along the [[Alps]]. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the [[Italian Peninsula]], [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]]–the two largest islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]–and many other smaller islands. The independent states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are [[enclave]]s within Italy, while [[Campione d'Italia]] is an Italian [[exclave]] in Switzerland. The territory of Italy covers some {{convert|301338|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and is influenced by a [[temperate climate|temperate seasonal climate]]. With 60.8 million inhabitants, it is the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe by population|fifth most populous country in Europe]], and the [[List of countries by population|23rd]] most populous in the world.

Rome, the capital of Italy, has for centuries been a political and religious centre of [[Western world|Western civilisation]] as the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] and site of the [[Holy See]]. After the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Italy endured numerous invasions by foreign peoples, from [[Germanic tribes]] such as the [[Lombards]] and [[Ostrogoths]], to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and later, the [[Normans]], among others. Centuries later, Italy became the birthplace of [[Maritime republics]] and the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Through much of its post-Roman history, Italy was fragmented into numerous city and regional states (such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Church State]]), but was [[Italian unification|unified]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/TQ0312582/unification.html |title=Unification of Italy |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date=4 April 2003 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, through World War I, and to World War II, Italy possessed [[Italian Colonial Empire|a colonial empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allempires.com&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=italian_colonial |title=The Italian Colonial Empire |publisher=All Empires |accessdate=17 June 2012 |quote=At its peak, just before WWII, the Italian Empire comprehended the territories of present time Italy, Albania, Rhodes, Dodecaneses, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, 2/3 of Somalia and the little concession of Tientsin in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Italia'' originally applied only to a part of what is now [[Southern Italy]] – according to [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula (modern [[Calabria]]: province of [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], and part of the provinces of [[Catanzaro]] and [[Vibo Valentia]]). But by his time [[Oenotria]] and Italy had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name &quot;Italia&quot; to a larger region, but it was during the reign of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]] (end of the first century BC) that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;Pallottino, M., History of Earliest Italy, trans.

ISBN 0-306-46463-2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anatomically modern humans|modern Humans]] arrived about 40,000 years ago. The [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Ancient peoples]] of pre-Roman Italy – such as the [[Umbri]]ans, the [[Latins]] (from which the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] emerged), [[Volsci]], [[Samnites]], the [[Celts]] and the [[Ligures]] which inhabited northern Italy, and many others – were [[Indo-European]] peoples; the main historic peoples of non-Indo-European heritage include the [[Etruscans]], the [[Elymians]] and [[Sicani]] in Sicily and the [[history of Sardinia|prehistoric Sardinians]].

Between the 17th and the 11th century BC [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] established contacts with Italy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/research/projects/mycenaeansitaly/ The [[Mycenaeans]] and Italy: the archaeological and archaeometric ceramic evidence], University of Glasgow, Department of Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Peruzzi, ''Mycenaeans in early Latium'', (Incunabula Graeca 75), Edizioni dell'Ateneo &amp; Bizzarri, Roma, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord William Taylour, Mycenaean Pottery in Italy and Adjacent Areas (Cambridge 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gert Jan van Wijngaarden, ''Use and Appreciation of Mycenaean Pottery in the Levant, Cyprus and Italy (1600–1200 B.C.): The Significance of Context'', Amsterdam Archaeological Studies, Amsterdam University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Vianello, ''Late Bronze Age Mycenaean and Italic Products in the West Mediterranean: A Social and Economic Analysis'', (British Archaeological Reports International Series), British Archaeological Reports&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miriam S.

Also the [[Phoenicia]]ns established colonies on the coasts of Sardinia and Sicily.

Ancient Rome was at first a small agricultural community founded around the 8th century BC, that grew over the course of the centuries into a colossal [[Roman empire|empire]] encompassing the whole [[Mediterranean Sea]], in which Ancient Greek and Roman cultures merged into one civilization. This civilization was so influential that its legacy is profound in the world. Ancient Rome heavily influenced and left its mark in modern government, law, politics, administration, cities, engineering, philosophy, architecture and arts, forming the ground that [[Western world|Western civilization]] is based upon. In a slow decline since the late 2nd century AD, the empire finally broke into two parts in 395 AD: the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The western part – under the pressure of the [[Franks]], the [[Vandals]], the [[Huns]], the [[Goths]] and other populations from Eastern Europe – finally dissolved in 476 AD, when [[Romulus Augustulus|the last western Emperor]] was deposed by the Barbarian chief [[Odoacer]].

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Italy in the Middle Ages}}

[[File:Naval Jack of Italy.svg|thumb|right|Italy's [[Naval Jack]], featuring the coats of arms of the four major [[Maritime Republics]]. Clockwise from upper left: [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]].]]

After the fall of Rome, Italy was conquered by the Germanic Tribe of the [[Ostrogoths]], but in the 6th century the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] [[Gothic War (535–554)|reconquered it]]. The invasion of another [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] (the [[Lombards]]) late in the same century reduced the Byzantine presence to a strip of land between [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Ravenna]] and Rome plus other lands in southern Italy, breaking the unity of the peninsula until 1870.

The Lombard reign of northern and central Italy was absorbed into the [[Frankish Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the late 8th century. The Frankish kings also helped the formation of the [[Papal States]] in central Italy, extending from Rome to Ravenna, although for most of the Middle Ages the Papacy effectively controlled only [[Latium]]. The existence of this theocratic state hindered for centuries the unification of the peninsula. Until the 13th century, Italian politics were dominated by the relationship between the German [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the popes, with most of the Italian cities siding for the former (''[[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellini]]'') or for the latter (''Guelfi'') from momentary convenience.

It was during this vacuum of authority that the Italy saw the rise of a peculiar institution, the [[medieval commune]]. In the anarchic conditions that often prevailed in medieval Italian city-states, people organised themselves to restore order and disarm the feuding elites. In the 12th century, a league of comuni, the [[Lombard League]], defeated the German emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], leading to a process granting effective independence to most of northern and central Italian cities. Despite the devastation of the numerous wars, Italy maintained, especially in the north and center, a relatively developed urban civilization.

During the same period, Italy saw the rise of numerous [[Repubbliche Marinare|Maritime Republics]], the most notable being [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Amalfi]]. Heavily involved in the [[Crusades]], they took advantage of political and trading opportunities. Venice and Genoa soon became Europe's main gateways to trade with the East, establishing colonies as far as the [[Black Sea]] and often controlling most of the trade with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Islamic Mediterranean world. The [[county of Savoy]] expanded its territory into the peninsula in the [[late Middle Ages]], while Florence developed into a highly organized commercial and financial city-state, becoming for many centuries the European capital of silk, wool, banking and jewelry.

In the south, Byzantine [[Sicily]] had become an [[Islamic conquest of Sicily|Islamic emirate]] in the 9th century, thriving until the [[Italo-Normans]] conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the Lombard and Byzantine states of southern Italy. Through a complex series of events, southern Italy developed as a unified kingdom, first under the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], then under the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and, from the 15th century, the [[house of Aragon]] (although Sicily was a separate Aragonese kingdom from the late 13th to the 15th century). In [[Sardinia]], the former Byzantine provinces became independent states known as [[giudicati]], although most of the island was under Genoese or Pisan control until the Aragonese conquered it in the 15th century.

===Early Modern===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance|Italian Wars|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy}}

[[File:Vitruvian.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The [[Vitruvian man]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], representing the ideal human proportions as described by Roman architect [[Vitruvius]], is a quintessential masterpiece of the Renaissance.]]

The [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] in 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing one third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, &quot;The Biggest Epidemics of History&quot; (La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire), in L'Histoire n° 310, June 2006, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/effects/death_toll.shtml Plague]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&quot;. Brown University.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recovery from the disaster of the Black Death led to a resurgence of cities, trade and economy which greatly stimulated the successive phases of [[Humanism]] and [[Renaissance]], cultural movements both born in the peninsula, and later spread in Europe.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, Northern and upper Central Italy were divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger Papal States and Naples. The strongest among these city-states annexed the surrounding territories giving birth to the [[Signoria|Signorie]], regional states led by merchant families which founded local dynasties. Dominated by merchant [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], they enjoyed a relative freedom and nurtured academic and artistic advancement. Warfare between the states was common, invasion from outside Italy confined to intermittent sorties of [[Holy Roman Emperors]]. These wars were primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, but especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades of fighting eventually saw [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] emerge as the dominant players that agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries. This peace would hold for the next forty years, and Venice's unquestioned hegemony over the sea also led to unprecedented peace for much of the rest of the 15th century. The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]]. However, the ideas and ideals of the Renaissance endured and even spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the [[Northern Renaissance]], and the [[English Renaissance]]. In the meantime, the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]], the new routes to Asia discovered by the Portuguese and the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]]—all factors which eroded the traditional Italian dominance in trade with the East – started the economic decline of the peninsula.

[[File:Lejeune - Bataille de Marengo.jpg|thumb|right|The triumph of [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Marengo]] placed Italy under French control and paved him the way to become Emperor.]]

Following the Italian Wars (1494 to 1559), Italy saw a long period of relative peace, first under [[Habsburg Spain]] (1559 to 1713) and then under [[Habsburg Austria]] (1713 to 1796). The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Italy throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. In the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims, or about 14% of Italy’s population.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Julius Beloch, ''Bevölkerungsgeschichte Italiens'', volume 3, pp. 359–360.&lt;/ref&gt; As Spain declined in the 17th century, so did its Italian possessions in Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and Milan. Southern Italy was impoverished, stagnant, and cut off from the mainstream of events in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas James Dandelet, John A. Marino|title=Spain in Italy: politics, society, and religion 1500–1700|year=2007|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-15429-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, Italy kept making its contribution to the European culture, giving birth to the [[Baroque]] Style.

In the 18th century, as a result of the [[War of Spanish Succession]], [[Empire of Austria|Austria]] replaced Spain as the dominant foreign power, while the [[House of Savoy]] emerged as a major regional power expanding to [[Piedmont]] and [[Sardinia]]. In this century, the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] influenced the Italian rulers, paving the way to reforms which started an economic recovery in northern Italy and Tuscany.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the northern and central parts of the country were invaded and later partly annexed to the Empire and partly reorganized as a new [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]—essentially a [[client state]] of the [[Napoleonic France|French Empire]] —&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, &quot;The Economy of the Empire in Italy: Instructions from Napoleon to Eugène, Viceroy of Italy,&quot; ''Exploring the European Past: Texts &amp; Images'', Second Edition, ed.

Gregory (Mason: Thomson, 2007), 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by [[Joachim Murat]], Napoleon's brother-in-law, who was crowned as [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]]. The 1814 [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] could not be eradicated.

===Italian unification and Liberal Italy===
{{Main|Italian unification|Military history of Italy during World War I}}

[[File:With Victor Emmanuel.jpg|thumb|left|The legendary &quot;handshake of [[Teano]]&quot; between [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]: on 26 October 1860, General Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy.]]

The creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united state encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]]. In the context of the [[revolutions of 1848|1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence|war]] was declared on [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. The [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] again attacked the Austrian Empire in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859, with the aid of [[Second French Empire|France]], resulting in liberating Lombardy.

In 1860–61, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, Denis (1997). ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. ISBN 0-472-10895-6&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the Sardinian government led by the [[Camillo Benso|Count of Cavour]] to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861. In 1866, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annex Venetia. Finally, as France during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 abandoned its garrisons in Rome, the Savoy rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the Papal States.

[[File:Italian troops at Isonzo river.jpg|thumb|right|Italian infantry at the [[Battle of Isonzo]]. More than 650,000 Italian soldiers lost their lives on the battlefields of World War I.]]

The Sardinian [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, provided for basic freedoms, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialized, the South and rural areas of North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad, while the [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.

Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing [[Somalia]], Eritrea and later [[Libya]] and the [[Dodecanese]] under its rule.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (2005), pp. 49.)&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, Italy at first stayed neutral, but in 1915 signed the secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], entering the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] on the promise of receiving [[Trento]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy obtained most of the promised territories, including the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as &quot;mutilated&quot;.

===Fascist regime===
{{Main|Italian Fascism|Military history of Italy during World War II}}

[[File:Hitler and Mussolini June 1940.jpg|left|thumb|[[Benito Mussolini]] with [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1940.]]

The turbulence that followed the devastation of World War I, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], led to turmoil and anarchy. The liberal establishment, fearing a socialist revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the fascists attempted a [[coup d'état|coup]] (the &quot;[[March on Rome]]&quot;), supported by king [[Victor Emmanuel III]]. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship.

In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]. Consequently, Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported Franco in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy occupied [[Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades, and entered World War II in June 1940 on the side of the [[Axis powers]]. Mussolini, wanting a quick victory like Hitler's [[Blitzkrieg]]s in Poland and France, invaded [[Greek-Italian War|Greece]] in October 1940, but was forced to accept a humiliating stalemate after a few months. At the same time, after initially conquering [[British Somalia]] and parts of [[Egypt]], the Italians saw an allied counter-attack lead to the loss of all their possessions in Africa.

Italy was then [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|invaded by the Allies]] in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini. In September 1943, Italy [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|surrendered]]. The country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war, as the allies were moving up from the south as the north was the base for loyalist Italian fascist and German Nazi forces, fought also by the [[Italian resistance movement]]. The hostilities ended on 2 May 1945. Nearly half a million Italians (including civilians) died in the conflict,&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy# |title=Italy – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian economy had been all but destroyed; per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Lyttelton (editor), ''&quot;Liberal and fascist Italy, 1900–1945&quot;'', Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Italy|Republican Constitution]] was approved on 1 January 1948. Under the [[Paris Peace Treaties]] of 1947, most of [[Venezia Giulia]] was lost to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and, later, the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was divided between the two states.

Fears in the Italian electorate of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948, when the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], obtained a landslide victory. Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of [[NATO]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the &quot;[[Italian economic miracle|Economic Miracle]]&quot;. In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993.

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|left|thumb|In 1957 Italy was among the [[EEC]]'s six founding members. The country signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterized by economic crisis (especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]]), widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite web | title=Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi (Parliamentary investigative commission on terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify the perpetrators) | year=1995 | accessdate=2 May 2006 | url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060819211212/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 19 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Docs&quot;&gt;{{en icon}}/{{it icon}}/{{fr icon}}/{{de icon}} {{cite web | title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies | accessdate=2 May 2006 | publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology / International Relation and Security Network | url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060425182721/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 25 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |title=Clarion: Philip Willan, Guardian, 24 June 2000, page 19 |publisher=Cambridgeclarion.org |date=24 June 2000 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978 and in the [[Bologna massacre|Bologna railway station massacre]] in 1980, where 85 people died; these events had deeply affected the whole country.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one liberal ([[Giovanni Spadolini]]) and one socialist ([[Bettino Craxi]]); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth largest industrial nation, gaining entry into the [[G7]] Group. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the GDP.

In the early 1990s, Italy faced significant challenges, as voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and the extensive corruption system (known as ''[[Tangentopoli]]'') uncovered by the '[[Mani Pulite|Clean Hands]]' investigation – demanded radical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions. The Communists reorganized as a [[social-democratic]] force. During the 1990s and the 2000s (decade), centre-right (dominated by media magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) and centre-left coalitions alternatively governed the country, which entered a prolonged period of economic stagnation.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Italy}}
[[File:Italy topographic map-blank.svg|thumb|175px|Topographic map of Italy.]]

Italy is located in Southern Europe and comprises the boot-shaped [[Italian Peninsula]] and a number of islands including the two largest, [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]. It lies between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian east|6°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

The country's total area is 301,230&amp;nbsp;km², of which 294,020&amp;nbsp;km² is land and 7,210&amp;nbsp;km² is water. Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of 7,600&amp;nbsp;km on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]], [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas (740&amp;nbsp;km), and borders shared with France (488&amp;nbsp;km), Austria (430&amp;nbsp;km), Slovenia (232&amp;nbsp;km) and Switzerland (740 km). San Marino (39&amp;nbsp;km) and Vatican City (3.2&amp;nbsp;km), both enclaves, account for the remainder.

[[File:MountBlanc04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mont Blanc]] is the highest point in Italy and the [[European Union]].]]

The [[Apennine Mountains]] form the peninsula's backbone and the [[Alps]] form its northern boundary, where Italy's highest point is located on [[Mont Blanc]] (4,810 m/15,782&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Official French maps show the border detouring south of the main summit, and claim the highest point in Italy is Mont Blanc de Courmayeur (4,748&amp;nbsp;m), but these are inconsistent with an 1861 convention and topographic watershed analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Po river|Po]], Italy's longest river (652&amp;nbsp;km/405&amp;nbsp;mi), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the [[Padan plain]] on its way to the Adriatic Sea.
The five largest lakes are, in order of diminishing size:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.to.cnr.it/limnol/cicloac/lagit.htm|title=Morphometric and hydrological characteristics of some important Italian lakes|publisher=Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi|accessdate=3 March 2010|location=Largo Tonolli 50, 28922 Verbania Pallanza }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Garda|Garda]] ({{convert|367.94|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}), [[Lake Maggiore|Maggiore]] ({{convert|212.51|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}, shared with Switzerland), [[Lake Como|Como]] ({{convert|145.9|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}), [[Trasimeno Lake|Trasimeno]] ({{convert|124.29|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}) and [[Lake Bolsena|Bolsena]] ({{convert|113.55|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}).

The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, leading to considerable [[List of earthquakes in Italy|seismic]] and [[Volcanism in Italy|volcanic activity]]. There are [[List of volcanoes in Italy|14 volcanoes in Italy]], four of which are active: [[Mount Etna|Etna]] (the traditional site of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]’s smithy), [[Stromboli]], [[Vulcano]] and [[Vesuvius]]. Vesuvius is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculanum]]. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active [[caldera]], the [[Campi Flegrei]] north-west of Naples.

Although the country comprises the Italian peninsula and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the [[Eurasia]]n continental shelf. These territories are the ''comuni'' of: [[Livigno]], [[Sexten]], [[Innichen]], [[Toblach]] (in part), [[Chiusaforte]], [[Tarvisio]], [[Graun im Vinschgau]] (in part), which are all part of the [[Danube#Drainage basin|Danube's drainage basin]], while the [[Lago di Lei|Val di Lei]] constitutes part of the [[Rhine]]'s basin and the islands of [[Lampedusa]] and [[Lampione]] are on the African [[continental shelf]].

Extensive traffic and congestion in the largest metropolitan areas continue to cause severe environmental and health issues, even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s, and the presence of smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of [[sulphur dioxide]] are decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/document/hms/ehiexes_e.pdf]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity, while due to rising water levels, [[Venice]] has been regularly flooded throughout recent years. Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas, as in the case of the [[Seveso disaster]]. The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but, after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and a [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987|referendum on the issue]] the nuclear program was terminated, a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008, planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with French technology.

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of Italy}}

Thanks to the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Rigutti, Meteorologia, Giunti, p, 95, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Blair, Climatology: General and Regional, Prentice Hall pages 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal areas of [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]] and most of the [[Southern Italy|South]] generally fit the [[Mediterranean climate]] stereotype ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa). Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to 
{{convert|12|C|lk=on}} in Sicily, like so the average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C|lk=on}} to over {{convert|30|C|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Atlas of Italy|url=http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|publisher=Network of the Air Force Meteorological Service|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Italy}}
[[File:Giorgio Napolitano-M.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Giorgio Napolitano]], 11th [[President of the Italian Republic]].]]

Italy has been a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] since 2 June 1946, when the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|monarchy]] was abolished by a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|constitutional referendum]]. The [[President of the Italian Republic]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Giorgio Napolitano]] since 2006, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Howard McGaw [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0043-4078(194809)1%3A3%3C205%3AIFFTTR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943–1946)] ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205–222), September 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===

Italy has a parliamentary government based on a [[proportional representation|proportional]] voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] (that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]]) and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] (that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]]), have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic, but must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to become in office.

While the office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems, the Italian prime minister has less authority than some of his counterparts. The prime minister is not authorized to request the dissolution of Parliament or dismiss ministers (that are exclusive prerogatives of the President of the Republic) and must receive a vote of approval from the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power—to execute most political activities.

[[File:Aula Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Montecitorio]], seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]].]]
After the resignation of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] on 12 November 2011, economist [[Mario Monti]] has been appointed as a technocratic Prime Minister. The Italy's four major political parties are the [[People of Freedom]], the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], the [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] and the [[Italy of Values]]. During the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general elections]] these four parties won 590 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 308 out of 315 seats available in the Senate of the Republic.

Most of the remaining seats were won by minor parties that only contest election in one part of Italy, like the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] and the [[Movement for Autonomies]]. However, during the last 3 years, a so-called &quot;[[New Pole for Italy|Third Pole]]&quot; emerged, merging the Christian Democrats of [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats|UDC]] with some dissident MPs coming from Mr. Berlusconi's cabinet.

A peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]]. In addition, the Italian Senate is characterized also by a small number of [[senator for life|senators for life]], appointed by the President &quot;for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field&quot;. Former Presidents of the Republic are ''ex officio'' life senators.

===Law and criminal justice===
{{Main|Judiciary of Italy|Law enforcement in Italy}}

[[File:Roma 2011 08 07 Palazzo di Giustizia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]].]]

The Italian judicial system is based on [[Roman law]] modified by the [[Napoleonic code]] and later statutes. The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] (''Corte Costituzionale'') rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a post–World War II innovation. Since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, [[Organized crime in Italy|Italian organized crime]] and criminal organizations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in [[Southern Italy]], the most notorious of which being the [[Sicilian Mafia]], which would later expand into some foreign countries including the [[United States]].

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Italy}}

[[File:Obama Napolitano.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] and Giorgio Napolitano in Rome.]]

Italy is a founding member of the [[European Community]], now the [[European Union]] (EU), and of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and strong supporter of a wide number of international organizations, such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]/[[World Trade Organization]] (GATT/WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Initiative]]. Its recent turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the [[Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (CSCE), the forerunner of the OSCE, in 1994; [[G8]]; and the EU in 2009 and from July to December 2003.

Italy strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its [[international security]] activities. Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in [[UNITAF|Somalia]], [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor|East Timor]] and provides support for NATO and UN operations in [[IFOR|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo]] and [[Operation Sunrise (Albania)|Albania]]. Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) from February 2003. Italy still supports international efforts to reconstruct and stabilize [[Iraq]], but it has withdrawn its [[Multinational force in Iraq#2006 withdrawals|military contingent]] of some 3,200 troops as of November 2006, maintaining only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel.
In August 2006 Italy deployed about 2,450 troops in Lebanon for the United Nations' [[peacekeeping|peacekeeping mission]] [[UNIFIL]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsMax&quot; &gt;&quot;[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/08_Agosto/29/libano.shtml Italian soldiers leave for Lebanon] Corriere della Sera, 30 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Army is the national ground defense force, numbering 109,703 in 2008. Its best-known combat vehicles are the [[Dardo IFV|Dardo]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]], the [[Centauro]] [[tank destroyer]] and the [[Ariete]] [[tank]], and among its aircraft the [[Agusta A129 Mangusta|Mangusta]] [[attack helicopter]], recently deployed in UN missions. It also has at its disposal a large number of [[Leopard 1]] and [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] armored vehicles.

[[File:Eurofighter Typhoon 02.jpg|thumb|A [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] operated by the [[Italian Air Force]].]]

The Italian Navy in 2008 had 35,200 active personnel with 85 commissioned ships and 123 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/ |title=Marina Militare (Italian military navy website) |publisher=Marina.difesa.it |accessdate=30 May 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now equipping itself with a bigger [[aircraft carrier]], (the ''[[Italian aircraft carrier Cavour (550)|Cavour]]''), new [[destroyer]]s, submarines and multipurpose [[frigate]]s. In modern times the Italian Navy, being a member of the NATO, has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations around the world.

The Italian Air Force in 2008 had a strength of 43,882 and operated 585 aircraft, including 219 combat jets and 114 helicopters. As a stopgap and as replacement for leased [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] ADV interceptors, the AMI has leased 30 [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]A Block 15 ADF and four F-16B Block 10 Fighting Falcons, with an option for more. The coming years also will see the introduction of 121 [[Eurofighter Typhoon|EF2000 Eurofighter Typhoons]], replacing the leased F-16 Fighting Falcons. Further updates are foreseen in the Tornado IDS/IDT and [[AMX International AMX|AMX]] fleets. A transport capability is guaranteed by a fleet of 22 [[C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J]]s and [[Aeritalia G.222]]s of which 12 are being replaced with the newly developed G.222 variant called the [[C-27J Spartan]].

An autonomous corps of the military, the [[Carabinieri]] are the [[gendarmerie]] and [[military police]] of Italy, policing the military and civilian population alongside [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italy's other police forces]]. While the different branches of the Carabinieri report to separate ministries for each of their individual functions, the corps reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs when maintaining public order and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/GoverningBodies/|title=The Carabinieri Force is linked to the Ministry of Defence|publisher=Carabinieri|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Regions of Italy|Provinces of Italy|Municipalities of Italy|Metropolitan cities of Italy}}

Italy is subdivided into 20 regions (''regioni'', singular ''regione''), five of these regions having a [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|special autonomous status]] that enables them to enact legislation on some of their local matters. The country is further divided into 110 provinces (''province'') and 8,100 municipalities (''comuni''). There are also 15 metropolitan cities (''città metropolitane''), established in 2009, but this administrative division is not yet operational.

[[File:2012-03-07 Motorshow Geneva 4309.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Ferrari F12berlinetta]]. Italy is the world's 7th largest exporter of goods.]]

Italy has a [[free market economy]] characterized by high per capita GDP and low unemployment rates. In 2010, it was the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|eighth-largest]] economy in the world and the fourth-largest in Europe in terms of nominal GDP,&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|tenth-largest]] economy in the world and fifth-largest in Europe in terms of [[purchasing power parity|PPP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP_PPP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is a founding member of the [[Group of Eight|G8]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[OECD]].

After World War II, Italy was [[Italian economic miracle|rapidly transformed]] from an agriculture based economy into one of the world's most industrialized nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careersineurope.hobsons.com/country_italy.aspx |title=Hobsons Careers in Europe &amp;#124; Country profiles |publisher=Careersineurope.hobsons.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a leading country in [[international trade|world trade and exports]]. It is a [[developed country]], with the world's 8th highest [[quality of life]] in 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot;/&gt; and the 24th [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].

[[File:Eurozone.svg|thumb|left|Italy is part of a monetary union, the [[Eurozone]] (dark blue), and of the [[Internal Market (European Union)|EU single market]].]]

Italy has a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size, but there is a large number of [[small and medium-sized enterprises]], notoriously clustered in several [[industrial district]]s, which are the backbone of the [[Italian industry]]. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of [[niche market]] and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21808326~menuPK:258604~pagePK:2865106~piPK:2865128~theSitePK:258599,00.html|title=Knowledge Economy Forum 2008: Innovative Small And Medium Enterprises Are Key To Europe &amp; Central Asian Growth|publisher=The World Bank|date=19 May 2005|accessdate =17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its largest EU trade partners, in order of market share, are Germany (12.9%), France (11.4%), and Spain (7.4%).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=[[CIA]] |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, tourism is one of the fastest growing and profitable sectors of the national economy: with 43.6&amp;nbsp;million international tourist arrivals and total receipts estimated at $38.8&amp;nbsp;billion in 2010, Italy is both the fifth most visited country and highest tourism earner in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights11enhr_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these important achievements, the Italian economy today suffers from many and relevant problems. After a strong GDP growth of 5–6% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to the EU's statistics body Eurostat, Italian public debt stood at 116% of GDP in 2010, ranking as the second biggest debt ratio after [[Greece]] (with 126.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europolitics.info/economy-monetary-affairs/deficits-increase-in-eurozone-and-eu-artb287086-50.html |title=Europolitics |publisher=Europolitics.info |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the biggest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/37207942/Could_Italy_Be_Better_Off_than_its_Peers |title=Could Italy Be Better Off than its Peers? |publisher=CNBC |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Italian living standards have a considerable [[Italian economy|north-south divide]].

More specifically, Italy suffers from structural weaknesses due to its geographical conformation and the lack of raw materials and energy resources: in 2006 the country imported more than 86% of its total energy consumption (99.7% of the solid fuels, 92.5% of oil, 91.2% of natural gas and 15% of electricity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-DK-08-001/EN/KS-DK-08-001-EN.PDF|title=Energy, transport and environment indicators|author=[[Eurostat]]|accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-GH-09-001/EN/KS-GH-09-001-EN.PDF|title=Panorama of energy|author=[[Eurostat]]|accessdate =10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian economy is weakened by the lack of infrastructure development, market reforms and research investment, and also high public deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;dev.prenhall.com&quot;/&gt; In the [[Index of Economic Freedom]] 2008, the country ranked 64th in the world and 29th in Europe, the lowest rating in the Eurozone. Italy still receives [[development aid|development assistance]] from the European Union every year. Between 2000 and 2006, Italy received €27.4&amp;nbsp;billion from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/informat/country2009/it_en.pdf |title=European Cohesion Policy in Italy |format=PDF |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has an inefficient state bureaucracy, low property rights protection and high levels of corruption, heavy taxation and public spending that accounts for about half of the national GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;economicfreedom&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?ID=Italy|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080503060552/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?ID=Italy|archivedate=3 May 2008 |title=Index of Economic Freedom |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the most recent data show that Italy's spending in [[R&amp;D]] in 2006 was equal to 1.14% of GDP, below the EU average of 1.84% and the [[Lisbon Strategy]] target of devoting 3% of GDP to research and development activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-091/EN/KS-SF-08-091-EN.PDF|title=R&amp;D Expenditure and Personnel|author=[[Eurostat]]|accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[:it:Confesercenti|Confesercenti]], a major business association in Italy, [[organized crime in Italy]] represented the &quot;biggest segment of the Italian economy&quot;, accounting for €90 billion in receipts and 7% of Italy's GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;mafia-7&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title= Mafia crime is 7% of GDP in Italy, group reports | first= Peter | last= Kiefer | date= 22 October 2007 |work=New York Times | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/world/europe/22iht-italy.4.8001812.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Transport in Italy}}

In 2004 the transport sector in Italy generated a turnover of about 119.4&amp;nbsp;billion euros, employing 935,700 persons in 153,700 enterprises. Regarding the national road network, in 2002 there were {{convert|668721|km|mi|abbr=on}} of serviceable roads in Italy, including {{convert|6487|km|mi|abbr=on}} of motorways, state-owned but privately operated by [[Atlantia (company)|Atlantia]]. In 2005, about 34,667,000 [[Automobile|passenger cars]] (590 cars per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the national road network.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Commission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-DA-07-001/EN/KS-DA-07-001-EN.PDF|title=Panorama of Transport|format=PDF|author=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national railway network, state-owned and operated by [[Ferrovie dello Stato]], in 2003 totalled {{convert|16287|km|mi|abbr=on}} of which 69% is electrified, and on which 4,937 locomotives and railcars circulated. The national inland [[waterways]] network comprised {{convert|1477|km|mi|abbr=on}} of navigable rivers and channels in 2002. In 2004 there were approximately 30 main airports (including the two [[Airline hub|hubs]] of [[Malpensa International Airport|Malpensa International]] in Milan and [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport|Leonardo Da Vinci International]] in Rome) and 43 major seaports (including the seaport of [[Genoa]], the country's largest and second largest in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]). In 2005 Italy maintained a civilian air fleet of about 389,000 units and a merchant fleet of 581 ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Commission&quot;/&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demography of Italy}}
[[File:Popolazione Italia 1861 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Population 1861–2008. Number of inhabitants.]]

Italy has 60,626,442 inhabitants according to 1 January 2011 municipal records (''Anagrafe'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?lang=en|title=Resident population on 1st January |author=Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its population density, at 201/km² (520/sq. mile), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated.

The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950–1960s. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. According to the Italian government, there were 4,570,317 foreign residents in Italy as of January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?lang=en|title=Foreign resident population on 1st January|author=Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they start to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the 2000s (decade), one in five Italians was over 65 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF|title=Ageing characterises the demographic perspectives of the European societies – Issue number 72/2008|author=[[EUROSTAT]]|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, thanks mainly to the massive immigration of the last two decades, in recent years Italy experienced a significant growth in birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_1.pdf|title=Crude birth rates, mortality rates and marriage rates 2005–2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_4.pdf |title=Average number of children born per woman 2005–2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postwar economic miracle, ending many decades of poverty and emigration, induced big social changes such as lower birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce. Under these circumstances, starting from the late 1970s, Italy became to attract increasing flows of foreign immigrants. The present-day figure of about 4.6 million foreign residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign-born populaton resident in Italy on January the 1st, 2011|url=http://www.istat.it/it/files/2011/09/ReportStranieriResidenti.pdf?title=Popolazione+straniera+residente+in+Italia+-+22%2Fset%2F2011+-+Testo+integrale.pdf|publisher=Istat|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  making up some 7.5% of the total population, include more than half a million children born in Italy to foreign nationals—second generation immigrants, but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian nationality; this applied to 53,696 people in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istat.it/salastampa/comunicati/non_calendario/20091008_00/testointegrale20091008.pdf |title=La popolazione straniera residente in Italia al 1° gennaio 2009|publisher= [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]| pages = 1–3|language = Italian|trans_title = The Foreign Population Resident in Italy on 1 January 2009|format=PDF |date= 8 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants, whose numbers are very difficult to determine; they are estimated to be at least 670,000.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosenthal, &quot;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2008/05/16/italy_cracks_down_on_illegal_immigration/ Italy cracks down on illegal immigration]&quot;. [[The Boston Globe]]. 16 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and, more recently, the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2007]] enlargements of the European Union, the main waves of migration have originated from former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (especially [[Romania]], Albania, [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]). The second most important area of immigration to Italy has always been the neighbouring North Africa (in particular, [[Morocco]], Egypt and [[Tunisia]]), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the [[Arab Spring]]. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from the Far East (notably, [[People's Republic of China|China]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6550725.stm Milan police in Chinatown clash]&quot;. BBC News. 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines]]) and Latin America ([[Ecuador]], Peru) have been recorded.

Currently, about one million [[Romanians]] (around one tenth of them being [[Romani people|Roma]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42404 EUROPE: Home to Roma, And No Place for Them]&quot;. [[Inter Press Service|IPS]] ipsnews.net.&lt;/ref&gt;) are officially registered as living in Italy, representing thus the most important individual country of origin, followed by Albanians and Moroccans with about 500,000 people each. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested that in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birn.eu.com/en/111/15/5745/ |title=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network |publisher=Birn.eu.com |date=08 11 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to Mitrica, an October 2005 Romanian report estimates that 1,061,400 Romanians are living in Italy, constituting 37% of 2.8&amp;nbsp;million immigrants in that country&lt;ref&gt;Mitrica, Mihai [http://web.archive.org/web/20071023072029/http://evz.ro/article.php?artid=201813 Un milion de romani s-au mutat in Italia] (&quot;One million Romanians have moved to Italy&quot;).

The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 13% live in the southern half of the peninsula.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Italy}}

[[File:Map Italophone World - updated.png|right|thumb|300px|&quot;Italophone&quot; world. {{legend|#0c5eb1|Official language.}}{{legend|#00ff00|Secondary, widely spoken or understood.}}{{legend|#9fceff|Understood by some due to former colonisation.}}]]

Italy's official language is Italian. [[Ethnologue]] has estimated that there are about 55&amp;nbsp;million speakers of the language in Italy and a further 6.7&amp;nbsp;million outside of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue.com&quot; &gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita Ethnologue report for language code:ita (Italy)] – Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version&lt;/ref&gt; However, between 120 and 150&amp;nbsp;million people use Italian as a second or cultural language, worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/Italian_language::sub::Geographic_Distribution Italian Language: Geographic Distribution] ''Discovery Media''. Retrieved 16 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian, adopted by the state after the [[unification of Italy]], is based on the [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] variety of [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and is somewhat intermediate between the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages]] and the [[Gallo-Romance languages]]. Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the [[Migration period|post-Roman invaders]].

Italy has numerous dialects spoken all over the country and some Italians cannot speak Italian at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297241/Italian-language |title=Italian language – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of a national education system has led to decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television (the state broadcaster [[RAI]] helped set a standard Italian).

Several linguistic groups are legally recognized,&lt;ref&gt;[L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 4, Statuto speciale per la Valle d'Aosta; L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 5, Statuto speciale per il Trentino-Alto Adige; L.cost. 31 gennaio 1963, n. 1, Statuto speciale della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of minority languages have co-official status alongside Italian in various parts of the country. French is co-official in the [[Valle d’Aosta]]—although in fact [[Franco-Provencal]] is more commonly spoken there. German has the same status in the province of [[South Tyrol]] as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring [[Trentino]], does [[Ladin language|Ladin]]. [[Slovene language|Slovene]] is officially recognised in the provinces of [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] and [[Province of Udine|Udine]] in [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]].

In these regions official documents are bilingual (trilingual in Ladin communities), or available upon request in either Italian or the co-official language. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d’Aosta where – with the exception of [[Aosta]] itself which has retained its Latin form in Italian (as in English) – French toponyms are generally used, attempts to [[Fascist Italianization|italianise]] them during the Fascist period having been abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.

[[Roman Catholicism]] is by far the largest religion in the country, although Catholicism is no longer officially the [[state religion]]. The proportion of Italians that identify themselves as Roman Catholic is 87.8%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Italian|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/01_Gennaio/17/cattolici.shtml|title=Italy: 88% of Italians declare themselves Catholic|work=Corriere della Sera |date=18 January 2006|accessdate =10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%). Most Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |title=ReportDGResearchSocialValuesEN2.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'.

The Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope, [[curia]] in Rome, and the [[Conference of Italian Bishops]]. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, the [[Enclave and Exclave|enclaves]] of San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy]].

Italy has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic [[saint]]s, [[martyr]]s and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 87.8% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/countrynow.htm#Top |title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Living cardinals arranged by country |publisher=Fiu.edu |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.&lt;ref name=&quot;kwintessential.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/italy-country-profile.html |title=Italy – Italian Language, Culture, Customs and Business Etiquette |publisher=Kwintessential |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are relevant minorities of [[Waldensians]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and other Christian churches. In the 20th century, [[Pentecostalism]], non-denominational [[Evangelicalism]], were the fastest-growing Protestant churches, as well as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mormonism]]. Starting from the 1980s, Immigration from [[Subsaharan Africa]] has increased the size of [[Baptist]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Pentecostal]] and [[Evangelical]] communities in Italy, while immigration from Eastern Europe has established large Eastern Orthodox communities.

At the beginning of 21st century, there were more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians in Italy, including 180,000 [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ortodossia.it/The%20Holy%20Orthodox%20Archdiocese%20of%20Italy%20ed%20Malta.htm |title=The Holy Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta |publisher=Ortodossia – Arcidiocesi Ortodossa d'Italia e Malta |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 550,000 Pentecostals and Evangelists (0.8%), of whom 400,000 are members of the [[Assemblies of God]], 235,685 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.4%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/religioni_italia/t/testimoni_geova_02.htm |title=Le religioni in Italia: I Testimoni di Geova (Religions in Italy: The Jehovah's Witnesses)|publisher=[[CESNUR|Center for Studies on New Religions]] |accessdate=30 May 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30,000 Waldensians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/storia/dove_viviamo.php |title=Chiesa Evangelica Valdese – Unione delle chiese Metodiste e Valdesi (Waldensian Evangelical Church – Union of Waldensian and Methodist churches)|language=Italian |publisher=Chiesa Evangelica Valdese – Unione delle chiese Metodiste e Valdesi (Waldensian Evangelical Church – Union of Waldensian and Methodist churches |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25,000 [[Seventh-day Adventists]], 22,000 [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 [[Lutherans]], 4,000 [[Methodists]] (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/regions/europe/italy/evangelical-methodist-church-in-italy.html |title=World Council of Churches – Evangelical Methodist Church in Italy |publisher=World Council of Churches |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the longest-established religious faiths in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in [[Ancient Rome]] before the birth of Christ. Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as [[Shabbethai Donnolo]] (died 982), prime minister [[Luigi Luzzatti]], who took office in 1910, and [[Ernesto Nathan]], outstanding mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913. During the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Italy took in many Jewish refugees from [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet [[Italian Social Republic]], about 15% of Italy's Jews were killed, despite the Fascist government's refusal to deport Jews to Nazi death camps. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.

Rising immigration has been accompanied by an increase in non-Christian faiths. In 2009, there were 1.0&amp;nbsp;million Muslims in Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.0.3202304679 |title=Italy: Country's muslims raise funds to help quake victims – Adnkronos Religion |publisher=Adnkronos |date=7 April 2003 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming 1.6 percent of population, although only 50,000 hold [[Italian citizenship]].

==Culture==

[[File:Venezia-punta della dogana.jpg|thumb|right|The city of [[Venice]], built on 117 islands.]]

Italy did not exist as a state until the country's unification in 1861. Due to this comparatively late unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the [[Italian Peninsula]], many traditions and customs that are now recognized as distinctly Italian can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social distinction of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world remain immense. Italy is home to the greatest number of [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|World Heritage Sites]] ([[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|47]]) to date, and has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many different periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the [[Italian diaspora]]. Furthermore, the nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains).&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyewitness Travel 2005, pg. 19&quot;&gt;Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, due to Italy's division into several city-states until 1861. However, this has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs. Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp Architecture in Italy], ItalyTravel.com&lt;/ref&gt; such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during [[ancient Rome]], the founding of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architectural movement]] in the late-14th to 16th century, and being the homeland of [[Palladianism]], a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of [[Neoclassical architecture]], and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late-17th to early 20th centuries. Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the [[Colosseum]], the [[Milan Cathedral]] and [[Florence cathedral]], the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and the building designs of [[Venice]] are found in Italy.

Italian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world. British architect [[Inigo Jones]], inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th century England, being inspired by [[Andrea Palladio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jones_inigo.shtml BBC - History - Historic Figures: Inigo Jones (1573 - 1652)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Italianate architecture]], popular abroad since the 19th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style, especially modelled on [[Renaissance architecture]].

===Visual art===
{{Main|Art of Italy}}

Over the centuries, Italian art has gone through many stylistic changes. Italian painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of [[Caravaggio]] and [[Titian]], and a preoccupation with religious figures and motifs. Italian painting enjoyed preeminence in Europe for hundreds of years, from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods, and through the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in Italy. Other notable artists who fall within these periods include [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Donatello]], [[Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Bernini]], and [[Raphael]].

Thereafter, Italy was to experience a continual subjection to foreign powers which caused a shift of focus to political matters, leading to its decline as the artistic authority in Europe. Not until 20th century [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], would Italy recapture any of its former prestige as a seminal place of artistic evolution. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of [[Giorgio de Chirico]], who exerted a strong influence on the [[Surrealists]] and generations of artists to follow.

===Literature and theatre===
{{Main|Literature of Italy}}
[[File:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the famous incipit ''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita'' in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence 1465.]]

The basis of the modern [[Italian language]] was established by the [[Florentine]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], whose greatest work, the [[Divine Comedy]], is considered amongst the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. There is no shortage of celebrated literary figures in Italy: [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Giacomo Leopardi]], [[Alessandro Manzoni]], [[Torquato Tasso]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and [[Francesco Petrarca|Petrarch]], whose best-known vehicle of expression, the [[sonnet]], was invented in Italy.

Prominent philosophers include [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Marsilio Ficino]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Giambattista Vico]]. Modern literary figures and Nobel laureates are nationalist poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] in 1906, realist writer [[Grazia Deledda]] in 1926, modern theatre author [[Luigi Pirandello]] in 1936, poets [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] in 1959 and [[Eugenio Montale]] in 1975, satirist and theatre author [[Dario Fo]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/|title=All Nobel Prizes in Literature |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian theatre can be traced back to the Roman tradition which was heavily influenced by the Greek; as with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists tended to adapt and translate from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''Phaedra'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]]. During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]], and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the [[symphony]], concerto, and [[sonata]], can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th and 17th century Italian music.

Italy's most famous composers include the [[List of Renaissance composers#Italian|Renaissance composers]] [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], the [[List of Baroque composers|Baroque composers]] [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], the [[List of Classical era composers|Classical composers]] [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and the [[List of Romantic composers|Romantic composers]] [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]. Modern Italian composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]] proved significant in the development of [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[electronic music]]. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as [[La Scala]] of Milan and [[Teatro di San Carlo|San Carlo]] of Naples, and performers such as the pianist [[Maurizio Pollini]] and the late tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.

[[File:Luciano Pavarotti 15.06.02 cropped2.jpg|thumb|[[Luciano Pavarotti]], one of the most famous tenors of all time.]]

Italy is widely known for being the birthplace of opera.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot; &gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=C37Gq2GagZIC&amp;dq=Italian+opera&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q= |title=Italian Opera |publisher=Google Books |date= 29 April 1994|accessdate=20 December 2009|isbn=978-0-521-46643-1|author1=Kimbell, David R. B}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian opera]] was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in Italian cities such as [[Mantua]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot; /&gt; Later, works and pieces composed by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as [[Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Donizetti]], [[Verdi]] and [[Puccini]], are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Alessandro Bonci]].

Introduced in the early 1920s, [[jazz]] took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centers of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the [[progressive rock]] movement of the 1970s, with bands like [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|PFM]] and [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]]. Italy was also an important country in the development of [[disco music|disco]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] music, with [[Italo disco]], known for its futuristic sound and prominent usage of synthesizers and [[drum machine]]s, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco music aside from [[Euro disco]] (which later went on to influence several genres such as [[Eurodance]] and [[Nu-disco]]).

Producers/songwriters such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], who won three [[Academy Award]]s for his music, were highly influential in the development of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] (electronic dance music). Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]]. Singers such as [[traditional pop|pop]] [[diva]] [[Mina (singer)|Mina]], classical crossover artist [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], and European chart-topper [[Eros Ramazzotti]] have attained international acclaim.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Italy}}
[[File:Cage Mendes Herzog Venice Film Festival 2009.jpg|thumb|lright|[[Nicolas Cage]], [[Eva Mendes]] and [[Werner Herzog]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].]]

The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing [[Pope Leo XIII]] giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by [[Benito Mussolini]], who founded Rome's renowned [[Cinecittà]] studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |title=The Cinema Under Mussolini |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s. [[List of film directors from Italy|Notable Italian film directors]] from this period include [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Dario Argento]]. Movies include world cinema treasures such as ''[[La dolce vita]]'', ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' and ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]''. The mid-1940s to the early 1950s was the heyday of [[Italian neorealism|neorealist films]], reflecting the poor condition of post-war Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Independent-Film-Road-Movies/Neorealism-HISTORICAL-ORIGINS-OF-ITALIAN-NEOREALISM.html |title=Historical origins of italian neorealism – Neorealism – actor, actress, film, children, voice, show, born, director, son, cinema, scene |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/explore/6-italian-neorealism |title=Italian Neorealism – Explore – The Criterion Collection |publisher=Criterion.com |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other [[film genre]]s, such as [[sword-and-sandal]] followed as [[spaghetti western]]s, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like ''[[La vita è bella]]'' directed by [[Roberto Benigni]] and ''[[Il postino]]'' with [[Massimo Troisi]].

Through the centuries, Italy has given birth to some notable scientific minds. Amongst them, and perhaps the most famous polymath in history, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made several contributions to a variety of fields including art, biology, and technology. [[Galileo Galilei]] was a [[physicist]], [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]] who played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and support for [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]]. The physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], a Nobel prize laureate, was the leader of the team that built the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

A brief overview of some other notable figures includes the astronomer [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]], who made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]; the physicist [[Alessandro Volta]], inventor of the [[battery (electricity)|electric battery]]; the mathematicians [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Fibonacci]], and [[Gerolamo Cardano]], whose [[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]] is generally recognized as the first modern treatment on mathematics, made fundamental advances to the field.

[[Marcello Malpighi]], a doctor and founder of [[microscopic anatomy]]; the biologist [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who conducted important research in bodily functions, animal reproduction, and cellular theory; the physician, pathologist, scientist, and Nobel laureate [[Camillo Golgi]], whose many achievements include the discovery of the [[Golgi complex]], and his role in paving the way to the acceptance of the [[Neuron doctrine]]; and [[Guglielmo Marconi]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the [[invention of radio]].

Italy has a long sporting tradition. In numerous sports, both individual and team, Italy has good representation and many successes. The most popular sport is by far [[Association football|football]]. Basketball and volleyball are the next most popular/played, with Italy having a rich tradition in both. Italy's [[Squadra Azzurra]] won the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and is currently the second most successful football team in the world, after Brazil, having won four [[FIFA World Cup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/index.html |title=Previous FIFA World Cups |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has also got strong traditions in cycling, tennis, [[track and field athletics|athletics]], [[fencing]], [[winter sport]]s and [[Rugby football|rugby]]. Italian [[Scuderia Ferrari]] is the oldest surviving team in [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] racing, having competed since 1948, and statistically the most successful [[Formula One]] team in history with a record of 15 drivers' championships and 16 constructors' championships.

According to the 2009 [[Global Language Monitor]], Milan was nominated the true fashion capital of the world, even surpassing other major capitals, such as New York, Paris, London and Tokyo, while Rome came 4th.&lt;ref name=&quot;languagemonitor.com&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |title=The Global Language Monitor &quot; Fashion |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Italian fashion labels, such as [[Gucci]], [[Prada]], [[Versace]], [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Armani]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[Missoni]], [[Fendi]], [[Moschino]], [[Max Mara]] and [[Ferragamo]], to name a few, are regarded as amongst the finest fashion houses in the world. Also, the fashion magazine [[Vogue Italia]], is considered the most important and prestigious fashion magazine in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=pkeaOOxb_isC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=JJmC6YC-Hmmm6Z5P2Cfbvz_jrSA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Your Modeling Career: You Don't Have to be a Supermodel to Succeed - Debbie Press, Skip Press - Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy is also prominent in the field of design, notably interior design, [[architectural design]], [[industrial design]] and [[urban design]]. The country has produced some well-known furniture designers, such as [[Gio Ponti]] and [[Ettore Sottsass]], and Italian phrases such as ''&quot;Bel Disegno&quot;'' and ''&quot;Linea Italiana&quot;'' have entered the vocabulary of furniture design.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2005) p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of classic pieces of Italian [[white goods]] and pieces of furniture include [[Zanussi]]'s [[washing machine]]s and [[fridge]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Insight Guides 2004 p.220&quot;&gt;Insight Guides (2004) p.220&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;New Tone&quot; sofas by Atrium,&lt;ref name=&quot;Insight Guides 2004 p.220&quot;/&gt; and the post-modern bookcase by Ettore Sottsass, inspired by [[Bob Dylan]]'s song &quot;[[Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insight Guides 2004 p.220&quot;/&gt;

Today, [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] are the nation's leaders in [[architectural design]] and [[industrial design]]. The city of Milan hosts the [[FieraMilano]], Europe's biggest design fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiley.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470026839.html |title=Design City Milan |publisher=Wiley |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milan also hosts major design and architecture-related events and venues, such as the &quot;''Fuori Salone''&quot; and the [[Salone del Mobile]], and has been home to the designers [[Bruno Munari]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Enrico Castellani]] and [[Piero Manzoni]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/milan_turin |title=Frieze Magazine – Archive – Milan and Turin |publisher=Frieze |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.jpg|thumb|right|[[Parmigiano Reggiano]] cheese, one of the over 200 Italian traditional specialities [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU)|protected]] under European law.]]

Modern Italian [[cuisine]] has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots as far back as the 4th century BCE. Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences, including [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Ancient Greek cuisine|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient Roman cuisine|ancient Roman]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], and  [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inmamaskitchen.com/ITALIAN_COOKING/rome_Lazio/Rome_LAZIO.html |title=Italian Cooking: History of Food and Cooking in Rome and Lazio Region, Papal Influence, Jewish Influence, The Essence of Roman Italian Cooking |publisher=Inmamaskitchen.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the [[New World]] with the introduction of items such as [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[bell pepper]]s and [[maize]], now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurean.com/articles/making-of-italian-food.html |title=The Making of Italian Food...From the Beginning |publisher=Epicurean.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Related Articles |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/718430/Italian-cuisine |title=Italian cuisine - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indigoguide.com/italy/food.htm |title=Italian Food - Italy's Regional Dishes &amp; Cuisine |publisher=Indigoguide.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusticocooking.com/regions.htm |title=Regional Italian Cuisine |publisher=Rusticocooking.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; abundance of difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooking-advices.com/in/77 |title=Cooking World » The most popular cuisines of the world (Part 1) |publisher=Cooking-advices.com |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with influences abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Nancy |url=http://www.sallybernstein.com/food/cuisines/us/ |title=American Food, Cuisine |publisher=Sallybernstein.com |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian cuisine is characterized by its extreme simplicity, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;The Silver Spoon ISBN 88-7212-223-6, 1997 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Batali Simple Italian Food: Recipes from My Two Villages (1998), ISBN 0-609-60300-0&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes and recipes are often the creation of grandmothers rather than of chefs, which makes many recipes ideally suited for home cooking.

This is one of the main reasons behind the ever increasing popularity of this cuisine, as cooking magazines in foreign countries popularize Italian recipes targeted at the home cook. Ingredients and dishes vary by [[Regions of Italy|region]].  Many dishes that were once regional, however, have proliferated with variations throughout the country.

Cheese, ham and [[Italian wine|wine]] are a major part of the cuisine, with many variations and [[Denominazione di origine controllata]] (DOC) (regulated appellation) laws. [[Coffee]], specifically [[espresso]], has become important in Italian cuisine.
