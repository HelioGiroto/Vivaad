[[File:Herbert Marcuse in Newton, Massachusetts 1955.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|[[Herbert Marcuse]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], is celebrated as the &quot;Father of the New Left&quot;.&lt;ref name=kellner12&gt;Douglas Kellner. &lt;http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''New Left''' was a range of [[social activism|activists]], [[educator]]s, [[agitators]] and others in the 1960s and 1970s who focused their attention on [[social exclusion|marginal identities]] and, eventually, [[identity politics]].&lt;ref&gt;

* Grant Farred. &quot;Endgame Identity? Mapping the New Left Roots of Identity Politics.&quot; ''New Literary History'' 31.4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected involvement with the [[labor movement]] and [[Marxism]]'s historical theory of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W. Coker. ''Confronting American Labor: The New Left Dilemma''. Univ of Missouri Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoning the Marxist goals of educating the [[proletariat]], the New Left turned to [[student activism]] as its reservoir of power.

In both the U.S. and Japan, the &quot;New Left&quot; was associated with the [[Hippie|Hippie movement]] and college campus protest movements. The American New Left in particular opposed what it saw as the prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed &quot;[[The Establishment]]&quot;, and those who rejected this authority became known as &quot;[[Anti-establishment|anti-Establishment]]&quot;.

==Historical origins==
The seeds of the New Left were planted in the [[de-Stalinization]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s February 1956 speech &quot;[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]&quot;, and the subsequent [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], confused the [[Communist Party of the USA]], the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], and the [[Japanese Communist Party]], none of whom were able to present a unified response. Young Marxist intellectuals, seeing the failure of their political organizations, began to develop a more democratic approach to politics, opposed to what they saw as the centralised and authoritarian politics of the pre-war leftist parties. Those Communists who became disillusioned with Communism due to its authoritarian character eventually formed the &quot;new left&quot;, first among dissenting Communist Party intellectuals and campus groups in the United Kingdom, and later alongside campus radicalism in the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kenny ''The First New Left:  British Intellectuals After Stalin'' London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;nouvelle gauche&quot; was already current in France in the 50s, associated with ''[[France Observateur]]'', and its editor [[Claude Bourdet]], who attempted to form a third position, between the dominant [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and [[Social Democratic]] tendencies of the left, and the two Cold War blocs. It was from this French &quot;new left&quot; that the &quot;First New Left&quot; of Britain borrowed the term.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Stuart [http://newleftreview.org/?page=article&amp;view=2826 &quot;Life and Times of the First New Left&quot;], ''New Left Review'', 61, January–February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;New Left&quot; was popularised in an open letter written in 1960 by sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] (1916–62) entitled ''Letter to the New Left''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Wright Mills |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/humanism/mills-c-wright/letter-new-left.htm |title=Letter to the New Left by C. Wright Mills 1960 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mills argued for a new [[left-wing politics|leftist]] ideology, moving away from the traditional &quot;labor metaphysic&quot;, towards issues such as opposing [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[anomie]], and [[authoritarianism]]. Mills argued for a shift from traditional leftism, toward the values of the [[counter-culture]], and emphasized an international perspective on the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Geary,  &quot;'Becoming International Again': C. Wright Mills and the Emergence of a Global New Left, 1956-1962,&quot; ''Journal of American History,'' Dec 2008, Vol. 95 Issue 3, pp 710-736&lt;/ref&gt;  According to David Burner, C Wright Mills claimed that the proletariat were no longer the revolutionary force; the new agent of revolutionary change were young intellectuals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;David Burner, ''Making Peace with the 60s'', (Princeton University Press, 1996), 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the journal ''[[New Left Review]]'' was founded in 1960, representing a theoretical synthesis of a [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]], [[humanism|humanist]], and [[socialist]] Marxism, departing from [[orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] theory. This publishing effort made the ideas of culturally oriented theorists available to an undergraduate reading audience. In this early period, many on the New Left were involved in the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], formed in 1957. According to [[Robin Blackburn]], &quot;The decline of CND by late 1961, however, deprived the New Left of much of its momentum as a movement, and uncertainties and divisions within the Board of the journal led to the transfer of the Review to a younger and less experienced group in 1962.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=history ROBIN BLACKBURN &quot;A BRIEF HISTORY OF NEW LEFT REVIEW&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and philosophy==
The German-Jewish critical theorist [[Herbert Marcuse]] is referred to as the &quot;Father of the New Left&quot;. He rejected the theory of class struggle and the Marxist concern with labor, instead claiming, according to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], that since  &quot;all questions of material  existence  have  been solved,  moral commands  and prohibitions  are no  longer  relevant.&quot; He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of [[Jerry Rubin]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent New Left thinker, [[Ernst Bloch]], believed that socialism would prove the means for all human beings to become immortal and eventually create God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|pages=436–440}}, quoting ''Dans Prinzip Hoffnung'' pp. 1380-1628.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student movement==
In the United States, student protests called the [[Free Speech Movement]] took place during the 1964–1965 academic year on the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under the informal leadership of students [[Mario Savio]], Brian Turner, [[Bettina Aptheker]], Steve Weissman, Art Goldberg,  [[Jackie Goldberg]], and others. In protests unprecedented in this scope at the time, students insisted that the university administration lift the ban of on-campus political activities and acknowledge the students' right to [[free speech]] and [[academic freedom]]. In particular, on 2 December 1964 on the steps of [[Sproul Hall]] Mario Savio gave a speech: &quot;There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious&amp;mdash;makes you so sick at heart&amp;mdash;that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mariosaviosproulhallsitin.htm American Rhetoric - Mario Savio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the relative success in 1964-5 of student organizing as opposed to the failure of [[community organizing]], in 1966 the New Left began to overturn the traditional Marxist focus on the proletariat, arguing that the Left should answer the needs of students and tap student power. One SDS publication stated that &quot;the revolution may come from the universities after all if Berkeley is any indication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wini Breines. ''Community and Organization in the New Left, 1962-1968: The Great Refusal''. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1967 pamphlet, ''[[The Student as Nigger]]'', attempted to cast students as a marginalized class. Other pamphlets and movement periodicals warned students not to get into discussions with their teachers about politics, since professors were part of the academic establishment attempting to oppress the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|page=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the campus orientation of the American New Left became clear in the mid to late 1960s, the student sections of the British New Left began taking action. The [[London School of Economics]] became a key site of British student militancy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch and Schoenbach, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of protests against the [[Vietnam War]] and of the [[May 1968 events]] in France were also felt strongly throughout the British New Left. Some within the British New Left joined the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]], which later became [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] while others became involved with groups such as the [[International Marxist Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams, ''Ideology and politics in Britain today'' (1998) p, 191&lt;/ref&gt;  The politics of the British New Left can be contrasted with [[Solidarity, UK]], which continued to focus primarily on industrial issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]] ''Street-Fighting Years: An Autobiography of the Sixties'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the theory was developed further by [[Nicos Poulantzas]], [[André Gorz]], et al.

===1968 protests===
{{main|Protests of 1968}}
The student activism of the New Left came to a head around the world in 1968. The [[May 1968 protests in France]] temporarily shut down the city of [[Paris]], while the [[German student movement]] did the same in [[Bonn]]. Universities were simultaneously occupied in May in Paris, in the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]], and in Japanese student strikes. Shortly thereafter, Swedish students [[Occupation of the Student Union Building|occupied a building at Stockholm University]]. However, all of these protests were shut down by police authorities without achieving their goals, which caused the influence of the student movement to lapse in the 1970s.

==United States New Left==
Many New Left thinkers in the U.S. were influenced by the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]].  Like the British New Left, they recognized problems in the communism of the Soviet Union, but unlike the British New Left, they did not turn to [[Trotskyism]] or [[social democracy]]. Some in the U.S. New Left argued that since the Soviet Union could no longer be considered the world center for proletarian revolution, new revolutionary Communist thinkers had to be substituted in its place, such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bacciocco, ''The New Left in America: reform to revolution, 1956 to 1970'' (1974)  p 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd Gitlin]] in ''The Whole World Is Watching'' in describing the movement's influences stated, &quot;The New Left, again, refused the self-discipline of explicit programmatic statement until too late - until, that is, the Marxist-Leninist sects filled the vacuum with dogmas, with clarity on the cheap.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Todd Gitlin]], ''The Whole World Is Watching: Mass Media in the Making &amp; Unmaking of the New Left'', University of California Press, 2003, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Other elements of the U.S. New Left were [[anarchist]] and looked to [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] traditions of American [[Far left|radicalism]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and union militancy.  This group coalesced around the historical journal ''Radical America''. American [[Autonomist Marxism]] was also a child of this stream, for instance in the thought of [[Harry Cleaver]]. [[Murray Bookchin]] was also part of the anarchist stream of the New Left, as were the [[Yippies]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Avrich, ''Anarchist voices: an oral history of anarchism in America'' (2005) p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. New Left drew inspiration from black radicalism, particularly the [[Black Power]] movement and the more explicitly [[Maoist]] and militant [[Black Panther Party]]. The Panthers in turn influenced other similar militant groups, like the [[Young Lords]], the [[Brown Berets]] and the [[American Indian Movement]]. The New Left was also inspired by [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee. Students immersed themselves into poor communities building up support with the locals.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left sought to be a broad based, grass roots movement.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by John McMillian &amp; Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vietnam war]] conducted by liberal President [[Lyndon Johnson]] was a special target across the worldwide New Left. Johnson and his top officials became unwelcome on American campuses.  The [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-war movement]] escalated the rhetorical heat, as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]].

It could be argued that the New Left's most successful legacy was the rebirth of [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 295.&lt;/ref&gt; As the leaders of the New Left were largely white men, women reacted to the lack of progressive gender politics with their own social intellectual movement.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by John McMillian &amp; Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately though the New Left disintegrated, largely because members of the SDS dissatisfied with the pace of change, incorporated violent tendencies towards social transformation. After 1969, the New Left degenerated into radicals and moderate factions, and that same year, the Weathermen, a surviving faction of SDS, attempted to launch a guerrilla war in an incident known as the &quot;Days of Rage.&quot; Finally, in 1970 three members of the Weathermen blew themselves up in a Greenwich Village brownstone trying to make a bomb out of a stick of dynamite and an alarm clock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=376 America in Ferment: The Tumultuous 1960s], ''The New Left'', Digital History University of Houston, updated 30-Jun-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Left was also marked by the invention of the modern environmentalist movement, which clashed with the Old Left's disregard for the environment in favor of preserving the jobs of union workers. Environmentalism also gave rise to various other social justice movements such as the environmental justice movement, which aims to prevent the toxification of the environment of minority and disadvantaged communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3nJUwFqRLTwC&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;ots=R6I8p1E-Mu&amp;dq=new%20left%20cynthia%20kaufman&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20justice&amp;f=false] Cynthia Kaufman ''Ideas For Action: Relevant Theory For Radical Change''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Students for a Democratic Society===
{{Main|Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)}}
The organization that really came to symbolize the core of the New Left was the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). By 1962, the SDS had emerged as the most important of the new campus radical groups; soon it would be regarded as virtually synonymous with the ‘New Left’.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman, If I Had a Hammer: The Death of the Old Left and the Birth of the New Left (New York: Basic Books Inc Publishers, 1987) 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Tom Hayden]] wrote its founding document, the [[Port Huron Statement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/huron.html |title=Port Huron Statement of the Students for a Democratic Society, 1962 |publisher=Coursesa.matrix.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which issued a call for &quot;participatory democracy&quot; based on non-violent civil disobedience. This was the idea that individual citizens could help make ‘those social decisions determining the quality and direction’ of their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;/&gt; The SDS marshalled anti-war, pro-civil rights and [[Free Speech Movement|free speech]] concerns on campuses, and brought together liberals and more revolutionary leftists.
[[File:Flower Power demonstrator.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police at an [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protest]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]], 21 October 1967]]
The SDS became the leading organization of the anti-war movement on college campuses during the [[Vietnam War]]. As the war escalated the membership of the SDS also increased greatly as more people were willing to scrutinise political decisions in moral terms.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 170.&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the war, the people became increasingly [[militant (disambiguation)|militant]].  As opposition to the war grew stronger, the SDS became a nationally prominent political organization, with opposing the war an overriding concern that overshadowed many of the original issues that had inspired SDS. In 1967, the old statement in Port Huron was abandoned for a new call for action,&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 172.&lt;/ref&gt; which would inevitably lead to the destruction of the SDS.

In 1968 and 1969, as its radicalism reached a fever pitch, the SDS began to split under the strain of internal dissension and increasing turn towards [[Maoism]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Along with adherents known as the [[New Communist Movement]], some extremist illegal factions also emerged, such as the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground Organization]].

The SDS suffered the difficulty of wanting to change the world while 'freeing life in the here and now.' This caused confusion between short term and long term goals. The sudden growth due to the successful rallies against the Vietnam War meant there were more people wanting action to end the Vietnam war, whereas the original New Left had wanted to focus on critical reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by John McMillian &amp; Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it was the anti-war sentiment that dominated the SDS.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacking liberalism===
Kazin (1998) says, &quot;The liberals who anxiously turned back the assault of the postwar Right were confronted in the 1960s by a very different adversary: a radical movement led, in the main, by their own children. The white New Left.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, ''The populist persuasion: an American history'' (1998) p 196&lt;/ref&gt;  Kazin concludes, &quot;For the young moralists of the 1960s — missionaries of a secular persuasion — only a self-conscious rebellion from below could topple the corrupted liberal order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kazin, ''Populist persuasion'' p 197&lt;/ref&gt;  

Singh (2007) says the attack originated from &quot;thinkers the political left and those associated with the new social movements of the 1960s and 1970s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nikhil Pal Singh, &quot;Liberalism&quot; in Bruce Burgett and Glenn Hendler, eds. ''Keywords for American Cultural Studies'' (2007) p 144&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a worldwide phenomenon, as a [[Culture war]] broke out on university campuses between the older established liberals and the younger radicals of the New Left.  [[Herbert Marcuse]], a philosopher of the New Left, said that &quot;The new radicalism militates against the centralized bureaucratic communist as well as against the semi- democratic liberal organization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jeremi Suri, ''Power and protest: global revolution and the rise of detente'' (2005) [http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22against+the+centralized%22+inauthor:suri&amp;num=10 p 129 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Isserman (2001) reports that the New Left&quot; &quot;came to use the word 'liberal' as a political epithet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman, ''The other American: the life of Michael Harrington'' (2001) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Richard Ellis (1998) says that the SDS's search for their own identity &quot;increasingly meant rejecting, even demonizing, liberalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Ellis, ''The dark side of the Left: illiberal Egalitarianism in America'' (1998) p 129&lt;/ref&gt;  As Wolfe (2010) notes, &quot;no one hated liberals more than leftists.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wolfe, &quot;Jeremiah, American-style,&quot; ''New Republic, May 13, 2010, P.  31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese New Left==
{{main|New Left (Japan)}}
The [[New Left (Japan)|New Left in Japan]] began simultaneously with the British and American movements and rose to prominence in the country by occupying college campuses for several years in the 1960s. After 1970, they splintered into several violent terrorist groups including the [[United Red Army]] who tortured their own members and the [[Japanese Red Army]] which murdered civilians and hijacked aircraft. They also invented the political ideology of [[Anti-Japaneseism]].

==Continental European New Left==
American influence on the European New Left appeared first in West Germany, which became a prototype for European student radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Rothman and S. Robert Lichter, ''Roots of radicalism: Jews, Christians, and the Left'' (1996) p  354&lt;/ref&gt; German students protesting against the Vietnam war often wore discarded US military uniforms, and they made influential contacts with dissident GIs—draftees who did not like the war either.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Hohn and Seungsook Moon, ''Over There: Living with the U.S. Military Empire from World War Two to the Present'' (2010) p 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prague Spring]] was legitimised by the Czechoslovak government as a socialist reform movement. The 1968 events in the Czechoslovakia were driven forward by [[industry|industrial]] workers, and were explicitly theorized by active Czechoslovak unionists as a revolution for workers' control. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The driving force of [[May 1968 in France|near-revolution in France in May 1968]] were students inspired by the ideas of the [[Situationist International]], which in turn had been inspired by [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].  Both of these groups emphasised culture as a form of production. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Situationist.jpg|thumb|240px|May 1968 slogan. [[Paris]]. &quot;It is forbidden to forbid.&quot;]]
While the [[Autonomia]] in Italy have been called New Left, it is more appropriate to see them as the result of traditional, industrially oriented, communism re-theorising its ideas and methods.  Unlike most of the New Left, Autonomia had a strong blue-collar arm, active in regularly occupying factories. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The [[Provo (movement)|Provos]] were a Dutch [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] movement of mostly young people with anarchist influences.
