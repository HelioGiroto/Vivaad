      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48327">{{Hindu politics}}

'''Hindu nationalism''' has been collectively referred to as the expressions of social and political thought, based on the native spiritual and cultural traditions of historical [[India]]. Some scholars have argued that the use of the term &quot;Hindu nationalism&quot; to refer to ''Hindū rāṣṭravāda'' is a simplistic translation and is better described by the term &quot;Hindu polity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jain&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hindu Phenomenon | publisher=UBS Publishers' Distributors | author=Jain, Girilal | year=1994 | location=New Delhi | isbn=81-86112-32-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The native thought streams became highly relevant in the Indian history when they helped form a distinctive identity to the Indian polity&lt;ref name=chatterjee&gt;Chatterjee Partha (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a basis for questioning colonialism.&lt;ref name=Veer&gt;Peter van der Veer, Hartmut Lehmann, Nation and religion: perspectives on Europe and Asia, Princeton University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; They inspired the freedom movements against the British rule based on armed struggle,&lt;ref name=li&gt;Li Narangoa, R.

The term Hinduism derives from a Persian word that refers to the Sindhu (or Indus) river in northwest India; &quot;Hindu&quot; was first used in the 14th century by Arabs, Persians, and Afghans to describe the peoples of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hinduism Beginnings | work=[[Patheos Library]] | url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Hinduism/Origins/Beginnings.html | accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the word 'Hindu' to describe the native polity of India have been found in the historical accounts of medieval India. These usages show that the word Hindu, until the early nineteenth century was emphasized by nativity rather than by religion.&lt;ref name=wilfred&gt;On Understanding Islam: Selected Studies, By Wilfred Cantwell Smith, Published by Walter de Gruyter, 1981, ISBN 90-279-3448-7, ISBN 978-90-279-3448-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent among the southern Indian rulers of the fourteenth century were the Sangama rulers of [[Vijayanagara empire]] who were hailed as 'Hinduraya suratana', the best among the Hindu rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Carla M. Sinopoli, The political economy of craft production: crafting empire in South India, c. 1350-1650, Published by Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Sangama rulers were in constant conflict with the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]], and this usage of the word 'Hindu' in the title, was obviously to distinguish them as native rulers as against the Sultans who were &quot;perceived to be foreign in origin&quot;.

In the sixteenth century in north India, in the year 1556, [[Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], native of [[Rewari]], Haryana established vedic 'Hindu Raj' from Delhi after defeating Akbar's Mughal forces at [[Agra]] and [[Delhi]], albeit for a short period. Prior to his coronation on 7th October,1556, at [[Purana Quila]] ( Pandvon Ka Quila ) Delhi, Hemu had won 22 battles, between 1553-1556, against Afghans and Mughals from Punjab to Bengal, without losing any. Hem Chandra was killed in the [[Second Battle of Panipat]].&lt;ref&gt; L.Colonel H.C.Kar, Military History of India, Calcutta (1980), p.283 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; John Clark Marshman, The History of India from the Earliest Period to the Present Time, London (1837), p.50 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; R.K.Bhardwaj, Hemu-Napoleon of Medieval India,p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Palmer-Fernandez &quot;Hindus&quot; did not conceive themselves as a religious unity in any sense except in opposition to foreign rule. For example, the early seventeenth-century Telugu work, 'Rayavachakamu', condemns the Muslim rulers for being foreign and barbarian and only rarely for specifically religious traits.&lt;ref name=gabriel&gt;Gabriel Palmer-Fernandez, Hinduism Modern, Encyclopedia of religion and war&lt;/ref&gt;

The other references include the glorification of the Chauhana heroes of [[Jalor]]  as 'Hindu' by [[Padmanabha]] in his epic poem, Kanhadade-prabandha, which he composed in AD 1455. The Rajput ruler, [[Maha Rana Pratap]] became renowned with the title of 'Hindu-kula-kamala-divakara' for his relentless fight against the [[Mughals]].&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Chitkara, Hindutva, Published by APH Publishing, 1997, ISBN 81-7024-798-5, ISBN 978-81-7024-798-2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pratapaditya|Maharaja Pratap Aditya]] was the most prominent of the Hindu rulers of Bengal. He declared independence from the Mughals and established an independent Hindu state in Bengal. '[[Hindavi Swarajya]]' (self rule of the natives) was how the rule of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]], the most notable of the rulers of the seventeenth century was described. The usage of 'Hindavi' (translated as 'of Hindus' in Marathi){{Request quotation|reason:Is Hindavi related to Hind or India or Hindu?|date=March 2012}} in 'Hindavi Swarajya' is considered to mean Indian Independence rather than the rule by a religious sect or a community.&lt;ref name=wilfred/&gt;

==Hindu Renaissance in the late 19th century==
[[File:Raja Ram Mohan Roy.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] endeavored to create from the ancient [[Upanishad]]ic texts a vision of rationalist modern India.]]
Many Hindu reform movements originated in the late nineteenth century. These movements led to the fresh interpretations of the ancient scriptures of Upanishads and Vedanta and also emphasized on social reform.&lt;ref name=bhatt/&gt; The marked feature of these movements was that they countered the notion of western superiority and white supremacy propounded by the colonizers as a justification for British colonialism in India. This led to the upsurge of patriotic ideas that formed the cultural and an ideological basis for the freedom struggle in India.&lt;ref name=Veer/&gt;

===Brahmo Samaj===
The [[Brahmo Samaj]] was one of the earliest Hindu renaissance movements in India under the British rule. It was started by a Bengali scholar, [[Ram Mohan Roy]] in 1828. Ram Mohan Roy endeavored to create from the ancient [[Upanishadic]] texts, a vision of rationalist 'modern' India. Religiously he criticized [[idolatry]] and believed in a monotheistic religion devoid of any idolatry and religious customs. His major emphasis was social reform. He fought against [[Discrimination#Caste discrimination|Caste discrimination]] and advocated [[equal rights for women]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Metcalf, A Concise History of India, Cambridge University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Brahmos found favorable response from the British Government and the Westernized Indians, they were largely isolated from the larger Hindu society due to their intellectual Vedantic and Unitarian views. But their efforts to systematize Hindu spirituality based on rational and logical interpretation of the ancient Indian texts would be carried forward by other movements in Bengal and across India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Veer&quot;/&gt;

===Arya Samaj===
[[File:Dayanand Swami.jpg|thumb|right|x180px| text| [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati|Maharishi Dayananda Saraswati]]]]
[[Arya Samaj]] is considered one of the overarching Hindu renaissance movements of the late nineteenth century. [[Swami Dayananda]], the founder of Arya Samaj, rejected idolatry, caste restriction and untouchability, child marriage and advocated equal status and opportunities for women. He opposed &quot;Brahmanism&quot; (which he believed had led to the corruption of the knowledge of Vedas) as much as he opposed Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref name=bhatt&gt;Chetan Bhatt (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Arya Samaj was a social movement, many revolutionaries and political leaders of the [[Indian Independence movement]] like [[Ramprasad Bismil]],&lt;ref&gt;Bhagat Singh, Why I am an atheist, Selected Writings of Shaheed Bhagat Singh by Bhagat Singh, Shiv Verma, National Book Centre, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagat Singh[[Shyamji Krishnavarma]], [[Bhai Paramanand]] and [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] were to be inspired by it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Francis O'Dwyer, India as I knew it, 1885-1925, Published by Constable, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swami Vivekananda===
[[File:Swami Vivekananda at Parliament of Religions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Swami Vivekananda]] on the Platform of the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]].]]

Another 19th century Hindu reformer was [[Swami Vivekananda]]. Vivekananda as a student was educated in contemporary Western thought.&lt;ref name=Veer/&gt; He joined Brahmo Samaj briefly before meeting Ramakrishna, who was a priest in the temple of the mother goddess Kali in Calcutta and who was to become his Guru.&lt;ref name=Veer/&gt; Vivekananda's major achievement was to ground Hindu spirituality in a systematic interpretation of Vedanta. This project started with [[Ram Mohan Roy]] of Brahmo Samaj and which had produced rational Hinduism was now combined with disciplines such as yoga and the concept of social service to attain perfection from the ascetic traditions in what Vivekananda called the &quot;practical Vedanta&quot;. The practical side essentially included participation in social reform.&lt;ref name=Veer/&gt;

He made Hindu spirituality, intellectually available to the Westernized audience. His famous speech at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at Chicago on September 11, 1893, followed huge reception of his thought in the West and made him a celebrity in the West and subsequently in India too.&lt;ref name=Veer/&gt;

A major element of Vivekananda's message was nationalist. He saw his effort very much in terms of a revitalization of the Hindu nation, which carried Hindu spirituality and which could counter Western materialism. The notions of White supremacy and Western superiority, strongly believed by the colonizers, were to be questioned based on Hindu spirituality. This kind of spiritual Hinduism was later carried forward by [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]. It also became a main inspiration for the current brand of Hindu nationalism today.&lt;ref name=Veer/&gt; One of the most revered leaders of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), Baba Saheb Apte's lifelong pet sentence was &quot;Vivekananda is like Gita for the RSS.&quot; Historians have observed that this helped the nascent Independence movement with a distinct national identity and kept it from being the simple derivative function of European nationalisms.&lt;ref name=chatterjee/&gt;

===Sri Aurobindo===
[[File:Sri aurobindo.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Sri Aurobindo]]
[[Sri Aurobindo]] was a nationalist and one of the first to embrace the idea of complete political independence for India. He was inspired by the writings of Swami Vivekananda and the novels of [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]].&lt;ref name=william&gt;William Theodore De Bary, Stephen N Hay, Sources of Indian Tradition, Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publisher, 1988, ISBN 81-208-0467-8&lt;/ref&gt; He “based his claim for freedom for India on the inherent right to freedom, not on any charge of misgovernment or oppression”. He believed that the primary requisite for national progress, national reform, is the free habit of free and healthy national thought and action and that it was impossible in a state of servitude.&lt;ref name=peter&gt;Peter Heehs, Religious nationalism and beyond, August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the revolutionary group [[Anushilan Samiti]] and was involved in armed struggle against the British&lt;ref&gt;Elleke Boehmer, Empire, the National, and the Postcolonial, 1890-1920: Resistance in Interaction
Published by Oxford University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-19-818445-X, 9780198184454&lt;/ref&gt; In his brief political career spanning only four years, he led a delegation from Bengal to the [[Indian National Congress]] session of 1907 &lt;ref name=peter/&gt; and contributed to the revolutionary newspaper [[Bande Mataram (publication)|Bande Mataram]].

In his famous ''Uttarpara Speech'', he outlined the essence and the goal of India's nationalist movement thus:

:''&quot;I say no longer that nationalism is a creed, a religion, a faith; I say that it is the Sanatan Dharma which for us is nationalism. This Hindu nation was born with the Sanatan Dharma, with it it moves and with it it grows. When the Sanatan Dharma declines, then the nation declines, and if the Sanatan Dharma were capable of perishing, with the Sanatan Dharma it would perish.&quot;''

In the same speech, he also gave a comprehensive perspective of Hinduism, which is at variance with the geocentric view developed by the later day Hindu nationalist ideologues such as Veer Savarkar and Deendayal Upadhyay:

:''&quot;But what is the Hindu religion ? What is this religion which we call Sanatan, eternal ? It is the Hindu religion only because the Hindu nation has kept it, because in this Peninsula it grew up in the seclusion of the sea and the Himalayas, because in this sacred and ancient land it was given as a charge to the Aryan race to preserve through the ages.

:''But it is not circumscribed by the confines of a single country, it does not belong peculiarly and for ever to a bounded part of the world. That which we call the Hindu religion is really the eternal religion, because it is the universal religion which embraces all others. If a religion is not universal, it cannot be eternal. A narrow religion, a sectarian religion, an exclusive religion can live only for a limited time and a limited purpose. This is the one religion that can triumph over materialism by including and anticipating the discoveries of science and the speculations of philosophy.&quot;''
''
In 1910, he withdrew from political life and spent his remaining life doing spiritual exercises and writing.&lt;ref name=william/&gt; But his works kept inspiring revolutionaries and struggles for freedom, including the famous [[Chittagong armoury raid|Chittagong Uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Manini Chatterjee, Do and Die: The Chittagong Uprising, 1930-34, Published by Penguin Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Both Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo are credited with having founded the basis for a vision of freedom and glory for India in the spiritual richness and heritage of Hinduism.

==Independence movement==

The influence of the Hindu renaissance movements was such that by the turn of the 20th century, there was a confluence of ideas of the Hindu cultural nationalism with the ideas of Indian nationalism.&lt;ref name=bhatt/&gt; Both could be spoken synonymous even by tendencies that were seemingly opposed to sectarian communalism and Hindu majoritism.&lt;ref name=bhatt/&gt; The Hindu renaissance movements held considerable influence over the revolutionary movements against the British rule and formed the philosophical basis for the struggles and political movements that originated in the first decade of the twentieth century.

===Revolutionary movements===
====Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar====
[[Anushilan Samiti]] was one of the prominent revolutionary movements in India in the early part of twentieth century. It was started as a cultural society in 1902, by Aurobindo and the followers of Bankim Chandra to propagate the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita. But soon the Samiti had its goal to overthrow the British rule in India.&lt;ref name=li/&gt; Various branches of the Samiti sprung across India in the guise of suburban fitness clubs but secretly imparted arms training to its members with the implicit aim of using them against the British administration&lt;ref name=johari&gt;By J. C. Johari, Voices of Indian Freedom Movement, Published by Akashdeep Pub. House&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1908 at Muzaffarpur, two revolutionaries, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki threw bombs at a British convoy aimed at British officer Kingsford. Both were arrested trying to flee. Aurobindo was also arrested on 2 May 1908 and sent to Alipore jail. The report sent from Andrew Fraser, the then Lt Governor of Bengal to Lord Minto in England declared that although Sri Aurobindo came to Calcutta in 1906 as a Professor at the National College, “he has ever since been the principal advisor of the revolutionary party. It is of utmost importance to arrest his potential for mischief, for he is the prime mover and can easily set tools, one to replace another.” But charges against Aurobindo were never proved and he was acquitted. Many members of the group faced charges and were transported and imprisoned for life. Others went into hiding.&lt;ref name=guha&gt;Arun Chandra Guha Aurobindo and Jugantar, Published by Sahitya Sansad, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, when, Aurobindo withdrew from political life and decided to live a life of renounciate,&lt;ref name=william/&gt; the Anushilan Samiti declined. One of the revolutionaries, Jatindra Das Mukherjee, who managed to escape the trial started a group which would be called [[Jugantar]]. Jugantar continued with its armed struggle with the British, but the arrests of its key members and subsequent trials weakened its influence. Many of its members were imprisoned for life in the notorious Andaman Cellular jail.&lt;ref name=guha/&gt;[[File:Savarkar-2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Savarkar (above) and Gandhi politely agreed to disagree on whether [[Ramayana]] justified the use of violence in freedom struggle.]]

====India House====
A revolutionary movement was started by [[Shyamji Krishnavarma]], a Sanskritist and an Arya Samajist, in London, under the name of [[India House]] in 1905. The brain behind this movement was said to be [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar|V D Savarkar]]. Krishnaverma also published a monthly &quot;[[Indian Sociologist]]&quot;, where the idea of an armed struggle against the British was openly espoused.&lt;ref name= Anthony&gt;Anthony Parel, Hind Swaraj and other writings By Gandhi, Published by Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-521-57431-5, ISBN 978-0-521-57431-0&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had  become well known for its activities in the Indian expatriates in London. When Gandhi visited London in 1909, he shared a platform with the revolutionaries where both the parties politely agreed to disagree, on the question of violent struggle against British and whether [[Ramayana]] justified such violence. Gandhi, while admiring the &quot;patriotism&quot; of the young revolutionaries, had dissented vociferously from their violent blueprints for social change. In turn the revolutionaries disliked his adherence to constitutionalism and his close contacts with moderate leaders of Indian National Congress. Moreover they considered his method of &quot;passive resistance&quot; effeminate and humiliating.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger, Gandhi's dilemma: nonviolent principles and nationalist power, Published by Macmillan, 2000, ISBN 0-312-22177-0, ISBN 978-0-312-22177-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The India House had soon to face a closure following the assassination of [[William Hutt Curzon Wyllie]] by the revolutionary [[Madan Lal Dhingra]], who was close to [[India House]]. [[Veer Savarkar]] also faced charges and was transported. Shyamji Krishnaverma fled to Paris.&lt;ref name= Anthony/&gt; India House gave formative support to ideas that were later formulated by Savarkar in his book named '[[Hindutva]]'. Hindutva was to gain relevance in the run up to the Indian Independence and would also form the core to the political party named [[Hindu Mahasabha]] started by Savarkar.&lt;ref name=bhatt/&gt;

===Indian National Congress===
====“Lal-Bal-Pal”====
“[[Lal-Bal-Pal]]” is the phrase that is used to refer to the three nationalist leaders Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal who held the sway over the Indian Nationalist movement and the freedom struggle in the early parts of twentieth century.
[[File:Lal Bal Pal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A rare photograph of the three leaders who changed the political discourse of the Independence movement]]
[[Lala Lajpat Rai]] belonged to the northern province of Punjab. He was influenced greatly by the Arya Samaj and was part of the Hindu reform movement.&lt;ref name=bhatt/&gt; He joined the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1888 and became a prominent figure in the Indian Independence Movement.&lt;ref name=collected&gt;Lajpat Rai, Bal Ram Nanda,  The collected works of Lala Lajpat Rai, Published by Manohar, 2005, ISBN 81-7304-660-3, ISBN 978-81-7304-660-5&lt;/ref&gt; He started numerous educational institutions. The [[National College]] at [[Lahore]] started by him became the centre for revolutionary ideas and was the college where revolutionaries like [[Bhagat Singh]] studied.&lt;ref&gt;Haṃsarāja Rahabara,  Bhagat Singh and His Thought. Published by Manak Publications, 1990, ISBN 81-85445-07-9, ISBN 978-81-85445-07-6&lt;/ref&gt; While leading a procession against the [[Simon Commission]], he was fatally injured in the lathi charge by the British police. His death led the revolutionaries like [[Chandrashekar Azad]] and Bhagat Singh to kill the British officer [[J.P. Saunders]], who they believed was responsible for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai.&lt;ref name=collected/&gt;

[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] was a nationalist leader from the Central Indian province of Maharashtra.  He has been widely acclaimed the “Father of Indian unrest” who used the press and Hindu occasions like [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and symbols like the Cow to create unrest against the British administration in India.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Mackenzie Brown, The Nationalist movement: Indian political thought from Ranade to Bhave,  Published by University of California Press, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilak joined the Indian National Congress in 1890. Under the influence of such leaders, the political discourse of the Congress moved from polite accusation that imperial rule was “un-British” to the forthright claim of Tilak that “Swaraj is my birthright and I will have it”.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Omvedt,
Reinventing revolution: new social movements and the socialist tradition in India, Published by M.E. Sharpe, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bipin Chandra Pal]] of Bengal was another prominent figure of the Indian nationalist movement, who is considered a modern Hindu reformer, who stood for Hindu cultural nationalism and was opposed to sectarian communalism and Hindu majoritism.&lt;ref name=bhatt/&gt; He joined the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1886 and was also one of the key members of revolutionary [[India House]].&lt;ref&gt;Saral Kumar Chatterji , Bipin Chandra Pal, Published by Publications were divided, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gandhi and Ramarajya====
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] never called himself a Hindu nationalist, but he always was a big preacher of Hindu [[Dharma]].]]

Though [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] never called himself a “Hindu nationalist”, he believed in and propagated concepts like [[Dharma]] and &quot;Rama Rajya” (Rule of [[Lord Rama]]) as part of his social and political philosophy. Gandhi said “By political independence I do not mean an imitation to the British House of commons, or the soviet rule of Russia or the Fascist rule of Italy or the Nazi rule of Germany. They have systems suited to their genius. We must have ours suited to ours. What that can be is more than I can tell. I have described it as Ramarajya i.e., sovereignty of the people based on pure moral authority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harijan, 2-1-1937&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that “Rama Rajya” to him meant peace and justice. “Whether Rama of my imagination ever lived or not on this earth, the ancient ideal of Ramarajya is undoubtedly one of true democracy in which the meanest citizen could be sure of swift justice without an elaborate and costly procedure.”&lt;ref&gt;Young India, 19-9-1929&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasized that it meant respect for all religions: “My Hinduism teaches me to respect all religions. In this lies the secret of Ramarajya.”&lt;ref&gt;Harijan 19-10-1947&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madan Mohan Malviya]], an educationist and a politician with the [[Indian National Congress]] was also a vociferous proponent of the philosophy of Bhagavad-Gita. He was the president of the Indian National Congress in the year 1909 and 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He was seen as a 'moderate' in the Congress and was also considered very close to Gandhi. He popularized the Sanskrit phrase &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; (Truth alone triumphs), which today is the national motto of the Republic of India.&lt;ref&gt;Ranganathan Magadi, India Rises in the West, Published by Lulu.com, 2006 ISBN 1-4303-0105-8, ISBN 978-1-4303-0105-9&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the [[Benaras Hindu University]] in 1919 and became its first Vice-Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;Aparna Basu, The Growth of Education and Political Development in India, 1898-1920, Published by Oxford University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subhas Bose====
[[File:Subhas Bose.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Subhas Chandra Bose]]]]
Apart from Gandhi, revolutionary leader Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] referred to Vedanta and the Bhagavad-Gita as sources of inspiration for the struggle against the British.&lt;ref&gt;Li Narangoa, R.

Another leader of prime importance in the ascent of Hindu nationalism was Dr [[K. B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]] of Nagpur. Hedgewar as a medical student in Calcutta had been part of the revolutionary activities of the Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar.&lt;ref name=chitkara&gt;Chitkara M G, Hindutva, Published by APH Publishing, 1997 ISBN 81-7024-798-5, ISBN 978-81-7024-798-2&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with sedition in 1921 by the British Administration and served a year in prison. He was briefly a member of Indian National Congress.&lt;ref name=chitkara/&gt; In 1925, he left the Congress to form the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]], which would become the focal point of Hindu movements in Independent India. After the formation of the RSS too, Hedgewar was to take part in the Indian National Congress led movements against the British rule. He joined the Jungle Satyagraha agitation in 1931 and served a second term in prison.&lt;ref name=chitkara/&gt; The [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] started by him became one of the most prominent Hindu organization with its influence ranging in the social and political spheres of India.

==Partition of India==
{{main|Partition of India}}
The [[Partition of India]] outraged many majority Hindu nationalist politicians and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Part.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Savarkar]] and members of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] were extremely critical of [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boloji.com/opinion/0022.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They accused him of appeasing the Muslims to preserve a unity that in their opinion, did not exist; Savarkar endorsed the concept of the [[Two-nation theory]] while disagreeing with it in practice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacw.net/partition/IshtiaqAhmed2002.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu nationalists also blamed Gandhi for conceding [[Pakistan]] to the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] via appeasement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/itihas/partition.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they were further inflamed when Gandhi conducted a fast-unto-death for the Indian government to give Rs. 55 crores which were due to the Pakistan government, but were being held back due to the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]].&lt;ref&gt;http://san.beck.org/20-5-GandhiandIndia1919-33.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi]] by [[Nathuram Godse]], the Sangh Parivar was plunged into distress when the RSS was accused of involvement in his murder. Along with the conspirators and the assassin, [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] was also arrested. The court acquitted Savarkar, and the RSS was found be to completely unlinked with the conspirators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Mahatma Gandhi 1970, page 165&quot;&gt;Report of Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to Murder Mahatma Gandhi, By India (Republic). Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to Murder Mahatma Gandhi, Jeevan Lal Kapur, Published by Ministry of Home affairs, 1970,page 165&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hindu Mahasabha]], of which Godse was a member, lost membership and popularity. The effects of public outrage had a permanent effect on the Hindu Mahasabha, which is now a defunct Hindutva party.

==Evolution of ideological terminology==
The word 'Hindu', throughout history, had been used as an inclusive description which lacked a definition and was used to refer to the native traditions and people of India. It was only in the late eighteenth century that the word 'Hindu' came to be used extensively with religious connotation, while still being used as a [[synecdoche]] describing the indigenuous traditions.&lt;ref name=wilfred/&gt;

===Hindutva and Hindu Rashtra===
{{main|Hindutva}}

====Savarkar====
{{Main|Vinayak Damodar Savarkar}}
Savarkar was one of the first in the twentieth century to attempt a definitive description of the term 'Hindu' in terms of what he called ''Hindutva'' meaning Hinduness.&lt;ref name=savarkar&gt;Savarkar, Vinayak Damodar: Hindutva, Bharati Sahitya Sadan, Delhi 1989 (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; The coinage of the term 'Hindutva' was an attempt by Savarkar who was an atheist and a rationalist, to de-link it from any religious connotations that had become attached to it. He defined the word Hindu as: &quot;He who considers India as both his Fatherland and Holyland&quot;. He thus defined Hindutva (&quot;Hindu-ness&quot;) or Hindu as different from Hinduism.&lt;ref name=savarkar/&gt; This definition kept the [[Abrahamic religions]] (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) outside its ambit and considered only native religious denominations as Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elst|first=Koenraad |authorlink=Koenraad Elst |title=Decolonizing the Hindu mind |year=2005 |publisher=Rupa |location=India |isbn=81-7167-519-0 |pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction was emphasized on the basis of territorial loyalty rather than on the religious practices. In this book that was written in the backdrop of the [[Khilafat Movement]] and the subsequent [[Malabar Rebellion]], Savarkar wrote &quot;Their (Muslims' and Christians') holy land is far off in Arabia or Palestine. Their mythology and Godmen, ideas and heroes are not the children of this soil. Consequently their names and their outlook smack of foreign origin. Their love is divided&quot;.&lt;ref name=savarkar/&gt;

Savarkar, also defined the concept of Hindu Rashtra (translated as &quot;Hindu polity&quot;).&lt;ref name=jain&gt;The Hindu Phenomenon by Girilal Jain, ISBN no. 81-86112-32-4&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Hindu Polity called for the protection of Hindu people and their culture and emphasized that political and economic systems should be based on native thought rather than on the concepts borrowed from the West.

====Golwalkar====
[[File:Golwalkar.jpg|thumb|left|150px|]]
{{Main|Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar}}
M S Golwalkar, the second head of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), was to further this non-religious, territorial loyalty based definition of 'Hindu' in his book 'Bunch of thoughts'. 'Hindutva' and 'Hindu Rashtra' would form the basis of Golwalkar's ideology and that of the RSS.

While emphasizing on religious pluralism, Golwalkar believed that Semitic monotheism and exclusivism were incompatible with and against the native Hindu culture. He wrote &quot;Those creeds (Islam and Christianity) have but one prophet, one scripture and one God, other than whom there is no path of salvation for the human soul. It requires no great intelligence to see the absurdity of such a proposition&quot;. He added &quot;As far as the national tradition of this land is concerned, it never considers that with a change in the method of worship, an individual ceases to be the son of the soil and should be treated as an alien. Here, in this land, there can be no objection to God being called by any name whatever. Ingrained in this soil is love and respect for all faiths and religious beliefs. He cannot be a son of this soil at all who is intolerant of other faiths.&quot; &lt;ref name=bunch&gt;MS Golwalkar, Bunch of thoughts, Sahitya Sindhu Prakashan, 19262&lt;/ref&gt;

He further would echo the views of Savarkar on territorial loyalty, but with a degree of inclusiveness, when he wrote &quot;So, all that is expected of our Muslim and Christen co-citizens is the shedding of the notions of their being 'religious minorities' as also their foreign mental complexion and merging themselves in the common national stream of this soil.&quot;&lt;ref name=bunch/&gt;

====Deendayal Upadhyaya====
{{Main|Deendayal Upadhyaya}}

Deendayal Upadhyaya, another RSS ideologue, presented the [[Integral Humanism]] as the political philosophy of the erstwhile Bharatiya Jana Sangh in the form of four lectures delivered in Bombay on April 22–25, 1965 as an attempt to offer a third way, rejecting both communism and capitalism as the means for socio-economic emancipation.

====Contemporary descriptions====
Later thinkers of the RSS, like H V Sheshadri and K S Rao, were to emphasize on the non theocratic nature of the word &quot;Hindu Rashtra&quot;, which they believed was often inadequately translated, ill interpreted and wrongly stereotyped as a theocratic state. In a book, [[H. V. Sheshadri]], the senior leader of the RSS writes &quot;As Hindu Rashtra is not a religious concept, it is also not a political concept. It is generally misinterpreted as a theocratic state or a religious Hindu state. Nation (Rashtra) and State (Rajya) are entirely different and should never be mixed up. State is purely a political concept. The State changes as the political authority shifts from person to person or party to party. But the people in the Nation remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;K.S. Rao in H. V. Seshadri, ed.:''Why Hindu Rashtra?'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt; They would maintain that the concept of Hindu Rashtra is in complete agreement with the principles of secularism and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elst|first=Koenraad |authorlink=Koenraad Elst |title=Decolonizing the Hindu mind |year=2005 |publisher=Rupa |location=India |isbn=81-7167-519-0|pages=480–486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of 'Hindutva' is continued to be espoused by the organizations like the RSS and political parties like the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP). But the definition, does not have the same rigidity with respect to the concept of 'holy land' laid down by Savarkar, and stresses on inclusivism and patriotism. BJP leader and the then leader of opposition, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], in 1998, articulated the concept of 'holy land' in Hindutva as follows &quot;Mecca can continue to be holy for the Muslims but India should be holier than the holy for them. You can go to a mosque and offer namaz, you can keep the roza. We have no problem. But if you have to choose between Mecca or Islam and India you must choose India. All the Muslims should have this feeling: we will live and die only for this country.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, January 24, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article written by Hindutva thinker and journalist Dipin Damodharan, Hindu nation:The Unddisputed Legacy of Every Indian published in American Chronicle, he writes &quot; The word Hindu stands for India´s entire society, those who live in this country and admit the fact that this is a primeval nation with a long history and an ancient tradition are all roofed by that word; they are all members of the Hindu Rashtra&quot;. He also quotes a mantra from ''Vishnu Purana'' to support his view.

:''Uttaram yat samudrassya''

:''Himadreschaiva dakshinam''

:''Varsham tad Bharata nama''

:''Bharati yetr santatihi''

It tells India as the one extending to the north of the seas and lying to the south of the Himalayas and calls it Bharat (India) and her children as Bharatis (Indians).


In 1995, in a landmark judgment the [[Supreme Court of India]] observed that &quot;Ordinarily, Hindutva is understood as a way of life or a state of mind and is not to be equated with or understood as religious Hindu fundamentalism. A Hindu may embrace a non-Hindu religion without ceasing to be a Hindu and since the Hindu is disposed to think synthetically and to regard other forms of worship, strange gods and divergent doctrines as inadequate rather than wrong or objectionable, he tends to believe that the highest divine powers complement each other for the well-being of the world and mankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsanalysisindia.com/supremcourt.htm  Supreme Court on Hindu Hindutva and Hinduism]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sardar.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] in front of the temple]]
The [[Somnath temple]] is an ancient temple at Prabhas Patan in the coastal Indian province of [[Gujarat]], which had been destroyed several times by the Muslim foreign invaders, starting with Mahmud Ghaznavi in 1025 AD. The last of such destructions took place in 1706 AD when Prince Mohammad Azam carried out the orders of Moghul ruler [[Aurangzeb]] to destroy the temple of Somnath beyond possible repair. A small mosque was put in its place.&lt;ref&gt;Ram Gopal, Hindu culture during and after Muslim rule: survival and subsequent challenges, Published by M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd., 1994, ISBN 81-85880-26-3, ISBN 978-81-85880-26-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Independence, Prabhas Pattan where Somnath is located was part of the [[Junagarh]] State, ruled by the Nawab of Junagarh. On the eve of Independence the Nawab announced the accession of Junagarh, which had over 80% Hindu population, to [[Pakistan]]. The people of Junagarh rose in revolt and set up a parallel government under Gandhian leader and freedom fighter, Shri [[Samaldas Gandhi]]. The Nawab, unable to resist the popular pressure, bowed out and escaped to Pakistan. The provincial government under [[Samaldas Gandhi]] formally asked Government of India to take over.&lt;ref&gt;Vapal Pangunni Menon, The Story of the Integration of the Indian States, Published by Macmillan, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Prime Minister of India, [[Sardar Patel]] came to Junagadh on November 12, 1947 to direct the occupation of the state by the Indian army and at the same time ordered the reconstruction of the Somanath temple.&lt;ref&gt;Hindustan Times, 15 Nov, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sardar Patel, [[K M Munshi]] and other leaders of the Congress went to Gandhiji with the proposal of reconstructing the Somnath temple, Gandhiji blessed the move, but suggested that the funds for the construction should be collected from the public and the temple should not be funded by the state. He expressed that he was proud to associate himself to the project of renovation of the temple&lt;ref name=marie&gt;Marie Cruz Gabriel, Rediscovery of India, A silence in the city and other stories, Published by Orient Blackswan, 1996, ISBN 81-250-0828-4, ISBN 978-81-250-0828-6&lt;/ref&gt; But soon both Gandhiji and Sardar Patel died and the task of reconstruction of the temple was now continued under the leadership of K M Munshi, who was the Minister for Food and Civil, supplies in the Nehru Government.&lt;ref name=marie/&gt;

The ruins were pulled down in October 1950 and the mosque was moved to a different location. In May 1951, Rajendra Prasad, the first President of the Republic of India, invited by K M Munshi, performed the installation ceremony for the temple&lt;ref&gt;Peter Van der Veer, Ayodhya and Somnath, eternal shrines, contested histories, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Rajendra Prasad said in his address &quot;It is my view that the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple will be complete on that day when not only a magnificent edifice will arise on this foundation, but the mansion of India's prosperity will be really that prosperity of which the ancient temple of Somnath was a symbol.&quot;.&lt;ref name=munshi&gt;Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, Indian constitutional documents,Published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; He added &quot;The Somnath temple signifies that the power of reconstruction is always greater than the power of destruction&quot;&lt;ref name=munshi/&gt;

This episode created a serious rift between the then Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who saw in movement for reconstruction of the temple an attempt at Hindu revivalism and the President [[Rajendra Prasad]] and Union Minister K M Munshi, saw in its reconstruction, the fruits of freedom and the reversal of injustice done to Hindus.&lt;ref name=munshi/&gt;

===The emergence of the Sangh Parivar===
{{main|Sangh Parivar}}
The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which was started in 1925, had grown as a huge organisation by the end of British rule in India. But the assassination of Gandhi and a subsequent ban on the organisation plunged it into distress. The ban was revoked when it was absolved of the charges and it led to the resumtion of its activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Mahatma Gandhi 1970, page 165&quot;/&gt;

The 1960s saw the volunteers of the RSS join the different social and political movements. Movements that saw a large presence of volunteers included the [[Bhoodan]], a land reform movement led by prominent Gandhian [[Vinoba Bhave]]&lt;ref&gt;Suresh Ramabhai, Vinoba and his mission, Published by Akhil Bharat Sarv Seva Sangh, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sarvodaya]] led by another Gandhian [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].&lt;ref name=martha&gt;Martha Craven Nussbaum, The Clash Within: Democracy, Religious Violence, and India's Future, Published by Harvard University Press, 2007 ISBN 0-674-02482-6, ISBN 978-0-674-02482-3&lt;/ref&gt; RSS supported trade union, the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]] and political party [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]] also grew into considerable prominence by the end of the decade.

Another prominent development was the formation of the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), an organisation of Hindu religious leaders, supported by the RSS, with the aim of uniting the various Hindu religious denominations and to usher social reform. The first VHP meeting at Mumbai was attended among others by all the Shankaracharyas, Jain leaders, Sikh leader Master [[Tara Singh Malhotra]], the [[Dalai Lama]] and contemporary Hindu leaders like [[Swami Chinmayananda]]. From its initial years, the VHP led a concerted attack on the social evils of untouchability and casteism while launching social welfare programmes in the areas of education and health care, especially for the Scheduled Castes, backward classes and the tribals.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, David James, Hinduism and Modernity P189, Blackwell Publishing ISBN 0-631-20862-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizations started and supported by the RSS volunteers came to be known collectively as the [[Sangh Parivar]]. Next few decades saw a steady growth of the influence of the Sangh Parivar in the social and political space of India.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;
