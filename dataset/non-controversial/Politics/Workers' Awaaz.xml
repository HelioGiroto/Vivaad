      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4613">'''Workers' Awaaz''' (or '''&quot;Workers' Voice&quot;''') is a [[nonprofit]], [[nonpartisan]] female [[domestic worker]]s' group based in [[New York City]]. Although the group supports all women in domestic services, its primary focus is on women from [[South Asia]] ([[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Nepal]]).

Workers' Awaaz was founded in June 1997 by Gulnahar Ahmed, a Bangladeshi woman who came to the [[United States]] in 1993 to work as a domestic. Workers' Awaaz assists workers in ensuring that they are paid the [[Minimum wage#United States|minimum wage]], receive [[overtime]] pay, are aware of their rights under [[workers' compensation]] laws, and receive training in basic employee rights and protection under state and federal law. The organization also sues employers on behalf of domestic workers for violations of federal and state laws, and organizes [[Picketing (protest)|pickets]] and demonstrations against abusive employers.

Workers' Awaaz also works to build public awareness of the sometimes abusive conditions under which many South Asian domestic workers labor in the U.S.

Since many immigrant domestics are isolated by language, working conditions and restrictions placed on them by employers, Workers' Awaaz uses a variety of outreach efforts to reach workers in need. It places advertisements in various South Asian-related newspapers, sets up tables at South Asian community events, and engages in face-to-face conversations in markets and stores.

==Lawsuits==
Workers' Awaaz has won several lawsuits filed on behalf of workers against employers who did not pay minimum wage, withhold taxes or make [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and other required government payments.

In 1998, Workers' Awaaz, working with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], won a $20,000 back pay settlement. In January 2000, the organization won a back pay award for $50,000 from physicians who refused to pay a domestic worker for nearly three years.

==Awards and grants==
In 1997, Workers' Awaaz won a $5,000 grassroots grant from the Ben &amp; Jerry's Foundation.[http://www.benjerry.com/foundation/grl_oct1997.html] 

In 1998, Ahmed was honored as a fellow of the Petra Foundation for her advocacy work with Workers' Awaaz. In 2000, the organization was awarded a Union Square Award from the Tides Center for its grassroots activism and strengthening of immigrant communities in New York City.[http://www.unionsquareawards.org/v2/awardees/bio.asp?aID=69]
