[[File:NashvilleProtest2006.jpg|thumb|Thousands gather in favor of immigrants rights in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] on March 29, 2006]]

In 2006, millions of people participated in protests over a proposed change to U.S. immigration policy. The protests began in response to proposed legislation known as [[H.R. 4437]], which would raise penalties for [[Illegal immigration]] and classify undocumented immigrants and anyone who helped them enter or remain in the US as felons. As part of the wider [[United States immigration debate|immigration debate]], most of the protests not only sought a rejection of this bill, but also a comprehensive reform of the country's immigration laws that included a path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants.

A major demonstration in Chicago on March 10, 2006 estimated at 100,000 people was the initial impetus for protests throughout the country.&lt;ref name=chicago060310&gt;{{Citation | title=A Show of Strength: Thousands March to Loop for Immigrants' Rights | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | date = March 11, 2006 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-03-11/news/0603110130_1_immigration-debate-pro-immigrant-illegal-immigrants | first1=Oscar | last1=Avila | first2=Antonio | last2=Olivo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest single demonstration occurred in Los Angeles on March 25, 2006 with a march of more than 500,000 people through downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=500,000 Pack Streets to Protest Immigration  Bills; The rally, part of a massive mobilization of immigrants and their supporters, may be the largest L.A. has seen. | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = March 26, 2006 | page = A1 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/26/local/me-immig26 | first1=Teresa | last1=Watanabe | first2=Hector | last2=Becerra}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest nationwide day of protest occurred on April 10, 2006, in 102 cities across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Updated 64&amp;nbsp;minutes ago |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11442705/ |title=500,000 rally immigration rights in L.A. - Politics |publisher=MSNBC |date=March 25, 2006 |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/03/28/immigration/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com – Protests precede Senate immigration battle – Mar 28, 2006 | accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 350,000–500,000 in [[Dallas]] and around 300,000 in Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;suntimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-immigcrowd02.html | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the protests were peaceful and attracted considerable media attention. Additional protests took place on May Day.

==Role of Spanish-language media==
Spanish-language media outlets, in particular [[Univision]], [[Telemundo]], Azteca America and various Spanish-language radio stations across the country, in large part aided in mobilizing people for the protests. [[Eddie &quot;Piolín&quot; Sotelo]], a Spanish-language radio personality from Los Angeles, persuaded eleven of his counterparts from Spanish-language radio stations based in Los Angeles to also rally listeners to attend planned protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/03/29/spanish_language_media_credited_on_pro_immigrant_rallies/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+National+News | work=The Boston Globe | first1=Gillian | last1=Flaccus | title=Spanish-language media credited on pro-immigrant rallies | date=March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Block, [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5307593 NPR-All Things Considered: &quot;Spanish D.J.

== Controversy and backlash over flag symbolism and protests ==
The initial protests caused much controversy after some protesters waved [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican]] and Central American flags instead of American flags. Various talk-radio hosts and conservative columnists played up the contentious nature of displaying non-U.S. flags during the protests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.page14apr14,0,6713595.story?coll=bal-oped-headlines &quot;The foreign flag rule&quot;] by Clarence Page, ''The Baltimore Sun'', April 14, 2006. Retrieved April 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; One particular incident referred to involved a protest at [[Montebello High School]] in California, where a Mexican flag was raised on a flagpole over a United States flag flying in the distressed (or upside-down) position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whittierdailynews.com/search/ci_3661910 Student punished for American flag incident] by Tracy Garcia, ''Whittier Daily News'', April 1, 2006, and [http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm &quot;The American Flag Comes Second&quot;] by Michelle Malkin, posted March 29, 2006 01:15&amp;nbsp;AM. Both accessed April 14, 2006.{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the backlash over the protests and the controversy over the flag symbolism issue, a group calling themselves &quot;Border Guardians&quot; burned a Mexican flag in front of the Mexican Consulate in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on April 9, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kvoa.com/Global/story.asp?S=4755663&amp;nav=HMO6HMaY &quot;Mexico says U.S. group burning Mexican flag is unacceptable&quot;] KVOA TV, Tucson, AZ, April 11, 2006. Retrieved April 14, 2006.{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day the group proceeded to burn two Mexican flags during protest in Tucson which was estimated to have had 15,000 participants. After the police seized a student who had thrown a water bottle at the &quot;Border Guardians&quot;, they followed the police officers calling for them to let the student go. As the situation escalated violence broke out and 6 were arrested with dozens being pepper-sprayed. The next day the police arrested the leader of the Border Guardians, Roy Warden, for charges including assault and starting a fire in a public park.

Because of the controversy, organizers of the protests encouraged protesters to leave their Mexican flags at home, with [[Cardinal Roger Mahony]] telling Los Angeles protesters to not fly any flag other than the United States flag because, &quot;...they do not help us get the legislation we need.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://presstelegram.com/news/ci_3696093 &quot;Protesters work to change image&quot;]
by Peter Prengaman, Associated Press, Long Beach Press-Telegram, April 11, 2006. Retrieved April 14, 2006.{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this controversy later protests featured fewer Mexican flags and more protesters carrying American flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/13/AR2006041301663.html | accessdate =April 14, 2006 | work=The Washington Post | first=Charles | last=Krauthammer | title=Immigrants Must Choose | date=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact, though, did not end the controversy over the protests, with conservative blogger Michelle Malkin questioning the statements on signs held by some protesters, describing them as &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;[[anti-American]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004967.htm &quot;The Signs You Don't See...&quot;] by Michelle Malkin, posted April 11, 2006 12:14&amp;nbsp;PM. Retrieved April 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, California's [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] Unified School District banned flags and signs from its campuses after &quot;Mexican flag-wavers clashed with U.S. flag-wavers.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Backlash==
The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that, in the Washington D.C. suburb of Herndon, a day labor center at which suspected undocumented immigrants gathered was closed and its mayor and two aldermen lost reelection, in part due to immigration concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201805.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Labor Site Backlash Felt at Polls In Herndon | first1=Bill | last1=Turque | first2=Nikita | last2=Stewart | date=May 3, 2006 | accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201728.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Hill Impasse Spurs States to Tackle Illegal Immigration | first=T.R. | last=Reid | date=May 3, 2006 | accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in the [[Minuteman Project]] increased due in part to backlash from the protests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section_id=9&amp;screen=news&amp;news_id=49693 {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 3, responding to the May 1 boycotts, the Minutemen embarked on a caravan across the United States in an effort to bring attention to a perceived need for border enforcement. The caravan was expected to reach Washington D.C. on May 12.

Regarding the Tucson-based anti-immigration movement: In 2006 the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote: &quot;Roy Warden, 59, emerged this spring as one of the country's most controversial, volatile, and, many believe, dangerous characters of the anti-immigration movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2006/fall/deadly-force?page=0,0 |title=Deadly Force &amp;#124; Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Splcenter.org |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''May 25''': The [[United States Senate]] passes [[S. 2611]] which includes a path to citizenship for up to 8.5 million undocumented immigrants. The bill eventually failed and was never enacted.&lt;ref&gt;http://usgovinfo.about.com/b/2006/03/26/immigration-reform-act-hr-4437.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
{{main|H.R. 4437}}
[[H.R. 4437]] (''The Border Protection, Anti terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005'') was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] on December 16, 2005 by a vote of 239 to 182.  It is also known as the &quot;Sensenbrenner Bill,&quot; for its sponsor in the House of Representatives, [[Jim Sensenbrenner]]. H.R. 4437 was seen by many as the catalyst for the 2006 U.S. immigration reform protests.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

[[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] previously gave &quot;amnesty&quot; to 2.7 million undocumented immigrants. Proponents of the measure, including then-President Regan, said the measure, paired with with stricter employer rules and a better path for legal entry, would reduce illegal immigration.

The companion bill passed by the [[United States Senate]] is [[S. 2611]], which never passed [[conference committee]]. The House Republican leadership, stated that it rejects S. 2611 wholly and will pass legislation that only addresses border security. The end of the 109th Congress marked the death of this bill.

==Kennedy ruling==
The USA Supreme Court on June 16, 2008, per ponente Justice Kennedy ruled (5–4) &quot;that someone who is here illegally may withdraw his voluntarily agreement to depart and continue to try to get approval to remain in the United States.&quot; The lawsuit is about 2 seemingly contradictory provisions of immigration law. One prevents deportation by voluntary departure from the country. The other sectition allows immigrants who are here illegally but whose circumstances changed to build their case to immigration officials, and must remain in the US. In the case, Samson Dada, a Nigerian citizen, overstayed beyond the expiration of his tourist visa in 1998. Immigration authorities ordered him to leave the country as he agreed to leave voluntarily, to allow his legal re-entry than if he had been deported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1181.pdf supremecourt.gov, Dada vs. Mukasey, No 06-1181, June 16, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iFvCMGfUQz-s6KsYpvzkWlX8kbXwD91B7U500 ap.google.com, Top court eases rules for foreigners to try to stay in US] {{Wayback|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iFvCMGfUQz-s6KsYpvzkWlX8kbXwD91B7U500|date =20081029000806}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
The following organizations mobilized from hundreds ([[Federation for American Immigration Reform|FAIR]]) to millions of people ([[Great American Boycott]]) around immigration reform in the United States during 2006.
* May 1, 2006  'A Day Without Immigrant' National Mobilization Endorsers' – national coalition of 215 organizations that mobilized one million protesters across the U.S. on May 1, 2006 for the [[Great American Boycott]].
* [http://weareamericaalliance.org We Are America Alliance] – national network of hundreds of regional coalitions that mobilized 2 million protesters across the U.S. on April 10, 2006 and coordinated protests in the May 1 national protests
* [http://daywithoutanimmigrant.com El Paro and the Day Without and Immigrant Coalition]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} (Philadelphia Region) [[Philadelphia]] regional coalition of dozens of organizations invited and mobilized thousands of protesters in 7 marches from February 14 to April 10, 2006.
* [http://www.kcirr.org Kentucky Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights]   [[Kentucky]] coalition that mobilized an estimated 10,000 people in downtown Lexington, KY on April 10, 2006 with other mobilizations around the state.
* March 25 Coalition – [[Southern California]] based coalition that mobilized 750,000 protesters in Los Angeles on March 25, 2006
* [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR) – mobilized dozens of people in various counter-protests
* [[Minuteman Project]] – held sporadic counter-protests in some major US cities

===Recruiting Methods===
Typically anti illegal immigration movements focus on [[Grassroots]] recruiting tactics; the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps and Minuteman Project use these methods to boost membership. After the 2006 immigration reform protest membership in anti-immigration movement participation increased by 600%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anti Immigration&quot;&gt;Larsen, Solana The Anti-Immigration Movement: From Shovels to Suits. NACLA news, May 9, 2007. Web. Nov. 9, 2009 http://news.nacla.org/2007/05/09/the-anti-immigration-movement-from-shovels-to-suits {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cooperation between anti-illegal immigration groups====
Anti-illegal immigration groups often do not pursue the same agenda in the same ways; however, they do form [[Coalitions]] when their agendas match other movements. One of the major joint efforts that these groups engage in is access to mailing lists for individuals who have donated money in the past to support the movement; Federation for American Immigration Reform  and Minutemen Civil Defense Corps have shared lists of mailers with one another in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anti Immigration&quot; /&gt;
