'''Theology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:Θεός|Θεός]]}} meaning &quot;God&quot; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]]}}, ''[[-logy]]'', meaning &quot;study of&quot;) is the systematic and rational study of [[religion]] and its influences and of the nature of religious truths, or the learned profession acquired by completing specialized training in [[religious studies]], usually at a [[university]] or [[school of divinity]] or [[seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=theology&amp;h=000&amp;j=0#c theology]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

[[Augustine of Hippo]] defined the [[Latin]] equivalent, ''theologia'', as &quot;reasoning or discussion concerning the Deity&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cityof&quot;&gt;''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' [http://logicmuseum.googlepages.com/civitate-8.htm Book VIII. i.] &quot;de divinitate rationem sive sermonem&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hooker]] defined &quot;theology&quot; in [[English language|English]] as &quot;the science of things divine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/hooker/3/368-377.pdf ''Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity'', 3.8.11]&lt;/ref&gt; The term can, however, be used for a variety of different disciplines or forms of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alistair. 1998. Historical Theology: An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Theologians use various forms of analysis and argument ([[philosophy|philosophical]], [[ethnography|ethnographic]], [[history|historical]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and others) to help [[understanding|understand]], [[explanation|explain]], test, [[critique]], defend or promote any of myriad [[List of religious topics|religious topics]]. Theology might be undertaken to help the theologian:
* understand more truly his or her own religious [[tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Daniel L. Migliore]], ''Faith Seeking Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Theology'' 2nd ed.(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
* understand more truly another religious tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Michael S. Kogan, 'Toward a Jewish Theology of Christianity' in ''The Journal of Ecumenical Studies'' 32.1 (Winter 1995), 89–106; available online at [http://www.icjs.org/scholars/kogan.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* make [[comparative religion|comparisons]] among religious traditions,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., David Burrell, ''Freedom and Creation in Three Traditions'' (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[apologetics|defend]] or justify a religious tradition,
* facilitate reform of a particular tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., John Shelby Spong, ''Why Christianity Must Change or Die'' (New York: Harper Collins, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
* assist in the [[proselytism|propagation]] of a religious tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Duncan Dormor et al (eds), ''Anglicanism, the Answer to Modernity'' (London: Continuum, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; or
* draw on the resources of a tradition to address some present situation or need,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Timothy Gorringe, ''Crime'', Changing Society and the Churches Series (London:SPCK, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
* draw on the resources of a tradition to explore possible ways of interpreting the world,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Anne Hunt Overzee's gloss upon the view of [[Paul Ricœur|Ricœur]] (1913–2005) as to the role and work of 'theologian': &quot;Paul Ricœur speaks of the theologian as a hermeneut, whose task is to interpret the multivalent, rich metaphors arising from the symbolic bases of tradition so that the symbols may 'speak' once again to our existential situation.&quot; Anne Hunt Overzee ''The body divine: the symbol of the body in the works of Teilhard de Chardin and Rāmānuja'', Cambridge studies in religious traditions 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), ISBN 0-521-38516-4, ISBN 978-0-521-38516-9, p.4; Source: [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=EiYEktsURVAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] (accessed: Monday 5 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; or
* explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition.
* challenge (ex. [[biblical criticism]]) or oppose (ex. [[irreligion]]) a religious tradition or the religious [[world-view]].

==History of the term==
{{Main|History of theology}}
''Theology'' translates into English from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''theologia'' (θεολογία) which derived from ''theos'' (θεός), meaning God, and ''logia'' (λόγια)&lt;ref&gt;The accusative plural of the neuter noun λόγιον; cf. Walter Bauer, William F. Arndt, F. Wilbur Gingrich, Frederick W. Danker, ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament,'' 2nd ed., (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1979), 476. For examples of λόγια in the New Testament, cf. Acts 7:38; Romans 3:2; 1 Peter 4:11.&lt;/ref&gt;, meaning utterances, sayings, or oracles (a word related to ''logos'' [λόγος], meaning word, [[discourse]], account, or [[reasoning]]) which had passed into Latin as ''theologia'' and into French as ''théologie''. The English equivalent &quot;theology&quot; (Theologie, Teologye) had evolved by 1362.&lt;ref&gt;Langland, [[Piers Plowman]] A ix 136&lt;/ref&gt; The sense the word has in English depends in large part on the sense the Latin and Greek equivalents had acquired in [[patristics|Patristic]] and [[history of theology#Medieval Christian theology|medieval]] Christian usage, though the English term has now spread beyond Christian contexts.

* Greek ''theologia'' (θεολογια) was used with the meaning &quot;discourse on god&quot; in the fourth century B.C. by [[Plato]] in [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]], Book ii, Ch. 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057;query=entry%3D%2348216;layout=;loc=qeolo%2Fgia1 Liddell and Scott's ''Greek-English Lexicon']'.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] divided theoretical philosophy into ''mathematike'', ''physike'' and ''theologike'', with the latter corresponding roughly to [[metaphysics]], which, for Aristotle, included discourse on the nature of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/mirror/classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.6.vi.html Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book Epsilon.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drawing on Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] sources, the [[Latin]] writer [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] distinguished three forms of such discourse: mythical (concerning the myths of the Greek gods), rational (philosophical analysis of the gods and of cosmology) and civil (concerning the rites and duties of public religious observance).&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Augustine, ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120106.htm Book 6], ch.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Theologos'', closely related to theologia, appears once in some [[biblical manuscript]]s, in the heading to the [[book of Revelation]]: ''apokalypsis ioannoy toy theologoy'', &quot;the revelation of John the ''theologos''.&quot; There, however, the word refers not to John the &quot;theologian&quot; in the modern English sense of the word but—using a slightly different sense of the root ''logos'', meaning not &quot;rational discourse&quot; but &quot;word&quot; or &quot;message&quot;—one who speaks the words of God, ''logoi toy theoy''.&lt;ref&gt;This title appears quite late in the manuscript tradition for the Book of Revelation: the two earliest citations provided in David Aune's ''Word Biblical Commentary 52: Revelation 1–5'' (Dallas: Word Books, 1997) are both 11th century – Gregory 325/Hoskier 9 and Gregory 1006/Hoskier 215; the title was however in circulation by the 6th century – see Allen Brent ‘John as theologos: the imperial mysteries and the Apocalypse’, ''Journal for the Study of the New Testament'' 75 (1999), 87–102.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some Latin Christian authors, such as [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], followed Varro's threefold usage,&lt;ref&gt;See Augustine, ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120106.htm Book 6], ch.5. and Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.viii.ii.i.html ''Ad Nationes'', Book 2], ch.1.&lt;/ref&gt; though Augustine also used the term more simply to mean 'reasoning or discussion concerning the deity'&lt;ref name=&quot;Cityof&quot; /&gt;

* In [[Church Fathers|Patristic]] Greek Christian sources, ''theologia'' could refer narrowly to devout and inspired knowledge of, and teaching about, the essential nature of God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory of Nazianzus]] uses the word in this sense in his fourth-century [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-07/Npnf2-07-42.htm#P4178_1277213 ''Theological Orations'']; after his death, he was called &quot;the Theologian&quot; at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] and thereafter in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]—either because his ''Orations''were seen as crucial examples of this kind of theology, or in the sense that he was (like the author of the Book of Revelation) seen as one who was an inspired preacher of the words of God. (It is unlikely to mean, as claimed in the [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-07/Npnf2-07-41.htm#P4162_1255901 ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers''] introduction to his ''Theological Orations'', that he was a defender of the divinity of Christ the Word.) See John McGukin, ''Saint Gregory of Nazianzus: An Intellectual Biography'' (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2001), p.278.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In some [[medieval]] Greek and Latin sources, ''theologia'' (in the sense of &quot;an account or record of the ways of God&quot;) could refer simply to the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh of St. Victor]], ''Commentariorum in Hierarchiam Coelestem'', Expositio to Book 9: &quot;theologia, id est, divina Scriptura&quot; (in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne's]] ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol.175, 1091C).&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Latin author [[Boethius]], writing in the early 6th century, used ''theologia'' to denote a subdivision of philosophy as a subject of academic study, dealing with the motionless, incorporeal reality (as opposed to ''physica'', which deals with corporeal, moving realities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pvspade.com/Logic/docs/BoethiusDeTrin.pdf De Trinitate 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Boethius' definition influenced medieval Latin usage.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Evans, ''Old Arts and New Theology: The Beginnings of Theology as an Academic Discipline'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[scholasticism|scholastic]] Latin sources, the term came to denote the rational study of the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Christian religion]], or (more precisely) the academic [[discipline]] which investigated the coherence and implications of the language and claims of the Bible and of the theological tradition (the latter often as represented in [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]'', a book of extracts from the Church Fathers).&lt;ref&gt;See the title of [[Peter Abelard]]'s [http://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/resources/abelard/Theologia_christiana.txt ''Theologia Christiana''], and, perhaps most famously, of [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa Theologica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

* It is in this last sense, theology as an academic discipline involving rational study of Christian teaching, that the term passed into English in the fourteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;See the 'note' in the Oxford English Dictionary entry for 'theology'.&lt;/ref&gt; though it could also be used in the narrower sense found in Boethius and the Greek patristic authors, to mean rational study of the essential nature of God – a discourse now sometimes called [[Theology Proper]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Charles Hodge, ''Systematic Theology'', vol. 1, part 1 (1871).&lt;/ref&gt;

* From the 17th century onwards, it also became possible to use the term 'theology' to refer to study of religious ideas and teachings that are not specifically Christian (e.g., in the phrase '[[Natural Theology]]' which denoted theology based on reasoning from natural facts independent of specifically Christian revelation &lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], sense 1&lt;/ref&gt;), or that are specific to another religion (see below).

* &quot;Theology&quot; can also now be used in a derived sense to mean &quot;a system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid) ideology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1989 edition, 'Theology' sense 1(d), and 'Theological' sense A.3; the earliest reference given is from the 1959 ''Times Literary Supplement'' 5 June 329/4: &quot;The 'theological' approach to Soviet Marxism ... proves in the long run unsatisfactory.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various religions==
In academic theological circles there is some debate as to whether theology is an activity peculiar to the Christian religion, such that the word &quot;theology&quot; should be reserved for [[Christian theology]], and other words used to name analogous discourses within other religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the initial reaction of Dharmachari Nagapriya in his [http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol3/buddhisttheology.html review] of Jackson and Makrasnky's ''Buddhist Theology'' (London: Curzon, 2000) in ''Western Buddhist Review 3''&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen by some to be a term only appropriate to the study of religions that worship a [[deity]] (a ''theos''), and to presuppose belief in the ability to speak and [[reason]] about this deity (in ''logia'')—and so to be less appropriate in religious contexts that are organized differently (religions without a deity, or that deny that such subjects can be studied logically). (&quot;[[Hierology]]&quot; has been proposed as an alternative, more generic term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., by Count E. Goblet d'Alviella in 1908; see Alan H. Jones, ''Independence and Exegesis: The Study of Early Christianity in the Work of Alfred Loisy (1857–1940), Charles Guignebert (1857 [i.e. 1867]–1939), and Maurice Goguel (1880–1955)'' (Mohr Siebeck, 1983), p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Analogous discourses===
Some academic inquiries within [[Buddhism]], dedicated to the rational investigation of a Buddhist understanding of the world, prefer the designation [[Buddhist philosophy]] to the term Buddhist theology, since Buddhism lacks the same conception of a ''theos''. Jose Ignacio Cabezon, who argues that the use of &quot;theology&quot; ''is'' appropriate, can only do so, he says, because &quot;I take theology not to be restricted to discourse on God ... I take 'theology' not to be restricted to its etymological meaning. In that latter sense, Buddhism is of course ''a''theological, rejecting as it does the notion of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jose Ignacio Cabezon, 'Buddhist Theology in the Academy' in Roger Jackson and John J. Makransky's ''Buddhist Theology: Critical Reflections by Contemporary Buddhist Scholars'' (London: Routledge, 1999), pp. 25–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Hindu philosophy]], there is a solid and ancient tradition of philosophical speculation on the nature of the universe, of God (termed &quot;[[Brahman]]&quot; in some schools of Hindu thought) and of the [[atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul). The [[Sanskrit]] word for the various schools of Hindu philosophy is [[Darshana]] (meaning &quot;view&quot; or &quot;viewpoint&quot;). [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava theology]] has been a subject of study for many devotees, philosophers and scholars in [[India]] for centuries, and in recent decades also has been taken on by a number of academic institutions in Europe, such as the [[Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies]] and [[Bhaktivedanta College]].&lt;ref&gt;See Anna S. King, 'For Love of Krishna: Forty Years of Chanting' in Graham Dwyer and Richard J. Cole, ''The Hare Krishna Movement: Forty Years of Chant and Change'' (London/New York: I.B. Tauris, 2006), pp. 134–167: p. 163, which describes developments in both institutions, and speaks of Hare Krishna devotees 'studying Vaishnava theology and practice in mainstream universities.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also: [[Krishnology]]''

[[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] discussion that parallels Christian theological discussion is named &quot;[[Kalam]]&quot;; the Islamic analogue of Christian theological discussion would more properly be the investigation and elaboration of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], or &quot;[[Fiqh]]&quot;. &quot;Kalam ... does not hold the leading place in Muslim thought that theology does in Christianity. To find an equivalent for 'theology' in the Christian sense it is necessary to have recourse to several disciplines, and to the usul al-fiqh as much as to kalam.&quot; (L. Gardet)&lt;ref&gt;L. Gardet, '[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ei2/kalam.htm Ilm al-kalam]' in ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', ed. P.J. Bearman et al (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers|Koninklijke Brill NV, 1999]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]], the historical absence of political authority has meant that most theological reflection has happened within the context of the Jewish community and [[synagogue]], rather than within specialized academic institutions. Nevertheless, [[Jewish theology]] historically has been very active and highly significant for Christian and Islamic theology. It is sometimes claimed, however, that the Jewish analogue of Christian theological discussion would more properly be [[Rabbinical]] discussion of [[Jewish law]] and [[Midrash|Jewish Biblical commentaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Randi Rashkover, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2096/is_4_49/ai_58621576 'A Call for Jewish Theology'], ''Crosscurrents'', Winter 1999, starts by saying, &quot;Frequently the claim is made that, unlike Christianity, Judaism is a tradition of deeds and maintains no strict theological tradition. Judaism's fundamental beliefs are inextricable from their halakhic observance (that set of laws revealed to Jews by God), embedded and presupposed by that way of life as it is lived and learned.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology as an academic discipline==
The history of the study of theology in institutions of higher education is as old as the [[University#History|history]] of such institutions themselves. For example, [[Taxila]] was an early centre of Vedic learning, possible from the 6th century BC or earlier;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Reagan, ''Non-Western Educational Traditions: Alternative Approaches to Educational Thought and Practice'', 3rd edition (Lawrence Erlbaum: 2004), p.185 and Sunna Chitnis, 'Higher Education' in Veena Das (ed), ''The Oxford India Companion to Sociology and Social Anthropology'' (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 1032–1056: p.1036 suggest an early date; a more cautious appraisal is given in Hartmut Scharfe, ''Education in Ancient India'' (Leiden: Brill, 2002), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Platonic Academy]] founded in Athens in the 4th century BC seems to have included theological themes in its subject matter;&lt;ref&gt;John Dillon, ''The Heirs of Plato: A Study in the Old Academy, 347–274BC (Oxford: OUP, 2003)''&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese [[Taixue]] delivered Confucian teaching from the 2nd century BC;&lt;ref&gt;Xinzhong Yao, ''An Introduction to Confucianism'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2000), p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[School of Nisibis]] was a centre of Christian learning from the 4th century AD;&lt;ref&gt;Adam H. Becker, ''The Fear of God and the Beginning of Wisdom: The School of Nisibis and the Development of Scholastic Culture in Late Antique Mesopotamia'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006); see also [http://www.nestorian.org/the_school_of_nisibis.html The School of Nisibis] at Nestorian.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nalanda]] in India was a site of Buddhist higher learning from at least the 5th or 6th century AD;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Scharfe, ''Education in Ancient India'' (Leiden: Brill, 2002), p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Moroccan [[University of Al-Karaouine]] was a centre of Islamic learning from the 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;The Al-Qarawiyyin mosque was founded in 859 AD, but 'While instruction at the mosque must have begun almost from the beginning, it is only ... by the end of the tenth-century that its reputation as a center of learning in both religious and secular sciences ... must have begun to wax.' Y. G-M. Lulat, ''A History of African Higher Education from Antiquity to the Present: A Critical Synthesis'' (Greenwood, 2005), p.71&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Beattie, ''Cairo: A Cultural History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Western universities evolved from the [[monastic]] institutions and (especially) cathedral schools of [[Western Europe]] during the [[High Middle Ages]] (see, for instance, the [[University of Bologna]], [[Paris University]] and [[Oxford University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Rüegg, ''[[A History of the University in Europe]]'', vol.1, ed. H. de Ridder-Symoens, ''Universities in the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, Christian theological learning was therefore a central component in these institutions, as was the study of Church or [[Canon law]]): universities played an important role in training people for ecclesiastical offices, in helping the church pursue the clarification and defence of its teaching, and in supporting the legal rights of the church over against secular rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Rüegg, “Themes” in Walter Rüegg, ''A History of the University in Europe'', vol.1, ed. H. de Ridder-Symoens, ''Universities in the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 3–34: pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; At such universities, theological study was initially closely tied to the life of faith and of the church: it fed, and was fed by, practices of [[preaching]], [[prayer]] and celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gavin D'Costa]], ''Theology in the Public Square: Church, Academy and Nation'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005), ch.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the High Middle Ages, theology was therefore the ultimate subject at universities, being named &quot;The Queen of the Sciences&quot; and serving as the capstone to the [[trivium (education)|Trivium]] and [[Quadrivium]] that young men were expected to study. This meant that the other subjects (including [[Philosophy]]) existed primarily to help with theological thought.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Albert Howard, ''Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p.56: '[P]hilosophy, the ''scientia scientarum'' in one sense, was, in another, portrayed as the humble &quot;handmaid of theology&quot;.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theology’s preeminent place in the university began to be challenged during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], especially in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Albert Howard, ''Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006):&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects gained in independence and prestige, and questions were raised about the place in institutions that were increasingly understood to be devoted to independent reason of a discipline that seemed to involve commitment to the authority of particular religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Albert Howard’s work already cited, and his discussion of, for instance, Immanuel Kant’s ''Conflict of the Faculties'' (1798), and J.G. Fichte’s ''Deduzierter Plan einer zu Berlin errichtenden höheren Lehranstalt'' (1807).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early nineteenth century, various different approaches have emerged in the West to theology as an academic discipline. Much of the debate concerning theology's place in the university or within a general higher education curriculum centres on whether theology's methods are appropriately theoretical and (broadly speaking) scientific or, on the other hand, whether theology requires a pre-commitment of faith by its practitioners, and whether such a commitment conflicts with academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Albert Howard, ''Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006); Hans W. Frei, ''Types of Christian Theology'', ed. William C. Placher and George Hunsinger (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1992); Gavin D'Costa, ''Theology in the Public Square: Church, Academy and Nation'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2005); James W. McClendon, ''Systematic Theology 3: Witness'' (Nashville, TN: Abingdon, 2000), ch.10: 'Theology and the University'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology and ministerial training===
In some contexts, theology has been held to belong in institutions of higher education primarily as a form of professional training for Christian ministry. This was the basis on which [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], a liberal theologian, argued for the inclusion of theology in the new University of Berlin in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schleiermacher, ''Brief Outline of Theology as a Field of Study'', 2nd edition, tr. Terrence N. Tice (Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen, 1990); Thomas Albert Howard, ''Protestant Theology and the Making of the Modern German University'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), ch.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in [[Germany]], theological faculties at state universities are typically tied to particular denominations, Protestant or Roman Catholic, and those faculties will offer denominationally bound (konfessionsgebunden) degrees, and have denominationally bound public posts amongst their faculty; as well as contributing ‘to the development and growth of Christian knowledge’ they ‘provide the academic training for the future clergy and teachers of religious instruction at German schools.’&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard G. Kratz, 'Academic Theology in Germany', ''Religion'' 32.2 (2002): pp.113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, several prominent colleges and universities were started in order to train Christian ministers. [[Harvard]],&lt;ref&gt;'The primary purpose of Harvard College was, accordingly, the training of clergy.’ But ‘the school served a dual purpose, training men for other professions as well.’ George M. Marsden, ''The Soul of the American University: From Protestant Establishment to Established Nonbelief'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgetown University]],&lt;ref&gt;Georgetown was a Jesuit institution founded in significant part to provide a pool of educated Catholics some of whom who could go on to full seminary training for the priesthood. See Robert Emmett Curran, Leo J. O’Donovan, ''The Bicentennial History of Georgetown University: From Academy to University 1789–1889 (Georgetown: Georgetown University Press, 1961), Part One.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;Boston University emerged from the Boston School of Theology, a Methodist seminary. Boston University Information Center, 'History – The Early Years' [http://www.bu.edu/dbin/infocenter/content/index.php?pageid=923&amp;topicid=13]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yale]],&lt;ref&gt;Yale’s original 1701 charter speaks of the purpose being 'Sincere Regard &amp; Zeal for upholding &amp; Propagating of the Christian Protestant Religion by a succession of Learned &amp; Orthodox' and that 'Youth may be instructed in the Arts and Sciences (and) through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.' 'The Charter of the Collegiate School, October 1701' in Franklin Bowditch Dexter, ''Documentary History of Yale University, Under the Original Charter of the Collegiate School of Connecticut 1701–1745'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1916); available online at [http://www.archive.org/stream/documentaryhisto00dextrich]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]&lt;ref&gt;At Princeton, one of the founders (probably Ebeneezer Pemberton) wrote in c.1750, ‘Though our great Intention was to erect a seminary for educating Ministers of the Gospel, yet we hope it will be useful in other learned professions – Ornaments of the State as Well as the Church. Therefore we propose to make the plan of Education as extensive as our Circumstances will admit.’ Quoted in Alexander Leitch, [http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/founding_princeton.html ''A Princeton Companion''] (Princeton University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; all had the theological training of clergy as a primary purpose at their foundation.

Seminaries and bible colleges have continued this alliance between the academic study of theology and training for Christian ministry. There are, for instance, numerous prominent US examples, including The [[Catholic Theological Union]] in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ctu.edu/About_Us/Our_Story 'Our Story'] at the Catholic Theological Union website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'lay men and women, religious sisters and brothers, and seminarians have studied alongside one another, preparing to serve God’s people'.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in Berkeley,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gtu.edu/about 'About the GTU'] at the Graduate Theological Union website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'dedicated to educating students for teaching, research, ministry, and service'.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criswell College]] in Dallas,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.criswell.edu/news--events/about-us/ 'About Us'] at the Criswell College website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'Criswell College exists to serve the churches of our Lord Jesus Christ by developing God-called men and women in the Word (intellectually and academically) and by the Word (professionally and spiritually) for authentic ministry leadership'.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in Louisville,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.sbts.edu/about/truth/mission/ 'Mission Statement'] at the SBTS website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'the mission of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary is ... to be a servant of the churches of the Southern Baptist Convention by training, educating, and preparing ministers of the gospel for more faithful service.'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]] in Deerfield, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.tiu.edu/divinity/connect/whoarewe/ 'About Trinity Evangelical Divinity School'] at their website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (TEDS) is a learning community dedicated to the development of servant leaders for the global church, leaders who are spiritually, biblically, and theologically prepared to engage contemporary culture for the sake of Christ's kingdom'&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dallas Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dts.edu/about/ 'About DTS'] at the Dallas Theological Seminary website (Retrieved 29 August 2009): 'At Dallas, the scholarly study of biblical and related subjects is inseparably fused with the cultivation of the spiritual life. All this is designed to prepare students to communicate the Word of God in the power of the Spirit of God.'&lt;/ref&gt;
Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in Springfield, Missouri.

===Theology as an academic discipline in its own right===
In some contexts, theology is pursued as an academic discipline without formal affiliation to any particular church (though individual members of staff may well have affiliations to different churches), and without ministerial training being a central part of their purpose. This is true, for instance, of many departments in the [[United Kingdom]], including the Department of Theology and Religion at the [[University of Exeter]], and the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://huss.exeter.ac.uk/theology/undergrad/ 'Why Study Theology?'] page at the University of Exeter (Retrieved 1 September 2009), and the [http://www.leeds.ac.uk//trs/aboutus.htm 'About us'] page at the University of Leeds.&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional academic prizes, such as the [[University of Aberdeen]]'s [[Lumsden and Sachs Fellowship]], tend to be awarded for performance in theology (or [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] as it is known at Aberdeen) and religious studies.  But see below, [[Theology#Critics of theology as an academic discipline|Critics of theology as an academic discipline]].

===Theology and religious studies===
In some contemporary contexts, a distinction is made between theology, which is seen as involving some level of commitment to the claims of the religious tradition being studied, and [[religious studies]], which is not.  By contrast religious studies is normally seen as requiring that the question of the truth or falsehood of the religious traditions studied is kept outside its field.  Religious studies involves the study of the historical or contemporary practices or ideas those traditions using intellectual tools and frameworks that are not themselves specifically tied to any religious tradition, and that are normally understood to be neutral or secular.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Donald Wiebe, ''The Politics of Religious Studies: The Continuing Conflict with Theology in the Academy'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillian, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In contexts where 'religious studies' in this sense is the focus, the primary forms of study are likely to include:
* [[Anthropology of religion]]
* [[Comparative religion]]
* [[History of religion]]s
* [[Philosophy of religion]]
* [[Psychology of religion]]
* [[Sociology of religion]]
Theology and religious studies are sometimes seen as being in tension;&lt;ref&gt;See K.L. Knoll, [http://chronicle.com/article/The-Ethics-of-Being-a/47442/?utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en 'The Ethics of Being a Theologian'], ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; they are sometimes held to coexist without serious tension;&lt;ref&gt;See David Ford, 'Theology and Religious Studies for a Multifaith and Secular Society' in D.L. Bird and Simon G. Smith (eds), ''Theology and Religious Studies in Higher Education'' (London: Continuum, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and it is sometimes denied that there is as clear a boundary between them as the brief description here suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald, ''The Ideology of Religious Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is an ancient tradition of [[skepticism]] about theology, followed by a more modern rise in [[secularism|secularist]] and [[atheism|atheist]] criticism.

===Criticism by philosophers===
Whether or not reasoned discussion about the divine is possible has long been a point of contention.

[[Protagoras]], as early as the fifth century BC, who is reputed to have been exiled from Athens because of his agnosticism about the existence of the gods, said that &quot;Concerning the gods I cannot know either that they exist or that they do not exist, or what form they might have, for there is much to prevent one's knowing: the ''obscurity of the subject'' and the shortness of man's life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Protagoras, fr.4, from ''On the Gods'', tr. Michael J. O'Brien in ''The Older Sophists'', ed. Rosamund Kent Sprague (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1972), 20, emphasis added. Cf. Carol Poster, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/protagor/ &quot;Protagoras (fl. 5th C. BCE)&quot;] in ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''; accessed: 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]] the American revolutionary, wrote in his two part work ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', &quot;The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion. Not anything can be studied as a science, without our being in possession of the principles upon which it is founded; and as this is the case with Christian theology, it is therefore the study of nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Paine]], [[The Age of Reason]], from &quot;The Life and Major Writings of Thomas Paine&quot;, ed. [[Philip S. Foner]], (New York, The Citadel Press, 1945) p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Feuerbach]], the atheist philosopher sought to dissolve theology in his work ''[[Principles of the Philosophy of the Future]]'': &quot;The task of the modern era was the realization and humanization of God – the transformation and dissolution of theology into anthropology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Principles of the Philosophy of the Future]], trans. Manfred H. Vogel, (Indianapolis, Hackett Publishing Company, 1986) p5&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrored his earlier work ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (pub. 1841), for which he was banned from teaching in Germany, in which he had said that theology was a &quot;web of contradictions and delusions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Feuerbach]], ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'', trans. [[George Eliot]], (Amherst, New York, Prometheus Books, 1989) Preface, XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A.J. Ayer]] the logical-positivist, sought to show in his essay &quot;Critique of Ethics and Theology&quot; that all statements about the divine are nonsensical and any divine-attribute is unprovable. He wrote: &quot;It is now generally admitted, at any rate by philosophers, that the existence of a being having the attributes which define the god of any non-animistic religion cannot be demonstratively proved... [A]ll utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.J. Ayer]], [[Language, Truth and Logic]], (New York, Dover Publications, 1936) pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] the philosopher, in his essay &quot;Against Theology&quot;, sought to differentiate theology from religion in general. &quot;Theology, of course, is not religion; and a great deal of religion is emphatically anti-theological... An attack on theology, therefore, should not be taken as necessarily involving an attack on religion. Religion can be, and often has been, untheological or even anti-theological.&quot; However, Kaufmann found that &quot;Christianity is inescapably a theological religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], [[The Faith of a Heretic]], (Garden City, New York, Anchor Books, 1963) pp. 114, 127–128, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] felt the [[Earth]], the [[Solar system]], the [[sun]] and even the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] are all insignificant in the vast [[universe]], therefore it is highly improbable that the universe was created for [[human|mankind]].  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/theolNightmare.htm The Theologian's Nightmare]&lt;/ref&gt;  Russell further believed the various arguments for the existence of God were unsound and the vindictiveness of Jesus towards those who did not accept his teachings suggested moral weakness rather than Godlike perfection. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charliewagner.net/russell.htm Bertrand Russell]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics of theology as an academic discipline===
Critics dating back to the [[18th century]] have questioned the suitability of theology as an [[academic discipline]] and In the [[21st century]] criticism continues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol9780521871860_CCOL9780521871860A011 Theology in the university]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Dr. Maarten Boudry, a [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and outspoken [[atheism|atheist]] in 2012 persuaded two theology conferences to accept meaningless [[word salad]] as serious theology.  This illustrates the difficulty of telling meaningful theology from what is meaningless.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/a-sokal-style-hoax-by-an-anti-religious-philosopher-2/ A Sokal-style hoax by an anti-religious philosopher];[http://freethoughtblogs.com/dispatches/2012/09/28/philosopher-pulls-a-sokal-on-theology-conferences/ Philosopher Pulls a Sokal on Theology Conferences];[http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html Atheist philosopher pulls Sokal-style hoax on theology conference]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jerry Coyne]] feels theology is “beliefs that have no basis in fact.”  Coyne suspects theologians are deliberately obscure and baffling.  He suggests asking theologians how they know reality corresponds to what they say and how they know they personally are closer to understanding reality than other theologians.  
Coyne feels theology confuses ordinary people.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/scientists-debate-philosophers-and-theologians-at-cern-but-why/ Scientists debate philosophers and theologians at CERN—but why?];[http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/why-am-i-doing-this/ Why am I reading theology?];[http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/642023-why-am-i-reading-theology Why am I reading theology?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]], a prominent member of the [[New Atheism]] movement, believes that theology is not a suitable subject for a [[university]] because it is not [[Science|scientific]], saying that &quot;a positive case now needs to be made that it has any real content at all, and that it has any place in today's universities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/articles/1698 Letters: Theology has no place in a university]&lt;/ref&gt; Science enabled spectacular achievements ranging from [[space exploration]] through to development of [[vaccine]]s and other life saving treatments for [[infection]]s while in Dawkins' opinion theology has achieved nothing. &lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/articles/88-the-emptiness-of-theology The Emptiness of Theology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PZ Myers]] has described theology as &quot;smart old white guys&quot; inventing rationalizations for what they personally want to believe. Myers sees no difference in principle between the mutually contradictory theologies of different [[Religious denomination|denominations]] and [[sect]]s or even religious [[cult]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/07/09/more-sophisticated-theology/ More sophisticated theology]&lt;/ref&gt; He also believes that answers to important questions have come from outside theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/12/31/an-end-of-theology/ An end of theology?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===General criticism===
[[Charles Darwin]] used theology to show that in Darwin's opinion living organisms are not the way an intelligent designer would have made them.  Therefore in Darwin's opinion theology supports [[natural selection]].  Steven Dilley, a philosopher of science educated at Arizona State University claims the above. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutionnews.org/2011/05/charles_darwin_theologian_majo046391.html Major New Article on Darwin's Use of Theology in the Origin of Species]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Bradlaugh]] believed theology prevented human beings achieving liberty. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/bradlaugh.htm Charles Bradlaugh (1833-1891)]&lt;/ref&gt; Bradlaugh noted theologians of his time stated that modern scientific research contradicted sacred scriptures therefore the scriptures must be wrong. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/bradlo01.htm Humanity's Gain from Unbelief]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert G. Ingersoll]] stated that when theologians had power the majority of people lived in hovels while a privileged few had palaces and cathedrals. In Ingersol's opinion science rather than theology improved people's lives.  Ingersol maintained further that trained theologians reason no better than a person who assumes the devil must exist because pictures resemble the devil so exactly. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/ingersoll.htm Robert Green Ingersoll]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mark Twain]] stated that several mutually incompatible religions claimed to be the True Religion and that people cut each the throats of others for following a different theology. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twainquotes.com/Religion.html Directory of Mark Twain's maxims, quotations, and various opinions]&lt;/ref&gt;
