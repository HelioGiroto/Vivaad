      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25402">A '''dual mandate''' is the practice in which elected officials serve in more than one elected or other public position simultaneously. This practice is known as '''double jobbing''' in Britain and distinguished from '''double dipping''' in the United States, which refers to being employed and collecting retirement from the same public authority at the same time.

For example, suppose a candidate wins a seat on a local authority at an election. If the same person then wins a seat in the national legislature in a separate general election, this is a dual mandate. 

Dual mandates are sometimes prohibited by law. For example, in [[federal state]]s, federal office holders are often not permitted to hold state office. In states with [[separation of powers]], members, whether elected or not, of the [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], and [[judiciary]] are separate. In states with [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures, one cannot simultaneously be a member of both houses. The holder of one office who wins election to another where a dual mandate is prohibited must either resign the former office or refuse the new one.

==European Parliament==
A member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) may not be a member of the legislature of a [[Member State of the European Union|member state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eu32002D0772&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Council Decision of 25 June 2002 and 23 September 2002 amending the Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, annexed to Decision 76/787/ECSC, EEC, Euratom|work=Official Journal of the European Communities |volume=L 283 |date=21/10/2002 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002D0772:EN:NOT |pages=1–4 |id=2002/772/EC,Euratom}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dates from a 2002 [[European Union decision]], which came into effect at the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European elections]] in most member states,&lt;ref name=&quot;eu32002D0772&quot;/&gt; at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 national election]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]],&lt;ref name=&quot;eu32002D0772&quot;/&gt; and at the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European elections]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eu32002D0772&quot;/&gt;

Originally, MEPs were nominated by national parliamentarians from among their own membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;manning74&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= The problems of dual parliamentary loyalty|first=Maurice|last=Manning|work=The Irish Times |date=February 27, 1975|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to [[European Parliament election, 1979|the first direct elections in 1979]], the dual mandate was discussed.&lt;ref name=&quot;manning74&quot;/&gt;  Some advocated banning it, arguing that MEPs who were national MPs were often absent from one assembly due to being at the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;manning74&quot;/&gt; The early death of [[Peter Michael Kirk]] was blamed by his [[election agent]] on overwork resulting from his dual mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Dual Mandate |work=The Irish Times |date=April 21, 1977|page=9|quote=Sir Peter's own election agent has stated categorically that he died from pressure and overwork caused by his dual mandate as an MP at Westminster and a member in Strasbourg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others countered that dual mandate members enhanced communication between national and European assemblies.&lt;ref name=&quot;manning74&quot;/&gt; The [[Eurosceptic]] [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democrats]] supported compulsory dual mandate, to ensure the state's MEPs expressed the same views as the national legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/european_parliament/ep.htm|title=An analysis of the European Parliament’s electoral arrangement(s).

==Australia==
Dual mandates are rare in [[Australia]]. It is illegal to be a member of any [[state parliament]] and the [[Australian parliament]] simultaneously. A member of a state parliament seeking federal office must resign before seeking election to the [[Government of Australia|Federal]] [[Parliament]]. It is possible, but unusual, to be a member of a [[local government]] and another [[parliament]]. 

Since 2004 [[Clover Moore]] has been both the [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[member for Sydney]] in the [[NSW Parliament]] and the [[Lord Mayor of Sydney]]. The issue of Moore holding both positions has brought the issue to the forefront in Australia and has led the premier of [[New South Wales]] in 2012 to propose a new law, dubbed in the media as the &quot;Get Clover bill&quot;, which would ban this dual office. If the law passes, it will force Moore and a number of other local Councillors who also hold state office to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Premier Barry O'Farrell's new law will force Lord Mayor Clover Moore to have less |publisher= The Daily Telegraph  | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-news/premier-barry-ofarrells-s-new-law-will-force-lord-mayor-clovermoore-to-have-less/story-e6freuzi-1226297530297 | accessdate= 09 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada, dual mandates are rare and frequently barred by legislation; section 39 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] prevents a [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] from being elected as a [[House of Commons of Canada|Member of Parliament]]; similarly, s. 65(c) of the [[Canada Elections Act]] makes members of provincial or territorial legislatures ineligible to be candidates to the House of Commons.

In other circumstances, an elected official almost always resigns their first post when elected to another. Dual representation has occurred occasionally when the member was elected to a second office shortly before their other term of office was due to expire anyway and whereby the short time frame would not merit the cost of a special [[by-election]]. In 1996, for example, [[Jenny Kwan]] continued to be a [[Vancouver]] city councillor after being elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|provincial legislature]]. The British Columbia legislature had debated a &quot;Dual Office Prohibition Act&quot; which failed to pass [[second reading]].

In the first few years after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, however, double mandates were common. In the first [[House of Commons (Canada)|House of Commons]], there were fifteen Members of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] from [[Quebec]] who simultaneously held provincial seats, including the [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]]; there were also four members of Parliament from [[Ontario]] who also held provincial seats, including the first two [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]]s, [[John Sandfield Macdonald]] and [[Edward Blake]].  Other prominent federal politicians with double mandates included [[George-Étienne Cartier]], [[Christopher Dunkin]], [[Hector Langevin]], the second [[Premier of British Columbia]] [[Amor de Cosmos]], and two members from [[Manitoba]], [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] and [[Pierre Delorme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ex Uno Plures: Federal-Provincial Relations in Canada, 1867-1896 |author=Garth Stevenson |page=330 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-7735-1633-6 |edition=paperback |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=3mbJIbrmfgUC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous example is that of the ''de facto'' leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], who ran for both federal and provincial seats in 1867.  Brown lost both elections, and soon thereafter began campaigning for the prohibition of double mandates.

The double mandate was prohibited from the start in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]; it was abolished in Ontario in 1872, in Manitoba in 1873, and in 1873 the federal parliament passed a law against it; Quebec passed its own law abolishing it in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The French-Canadian idea of Confederation, 1864-1900 |author=A.

The House of Commons and Its Members |isbn=2-89461-378-4 |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dual mandates within a province remained legal. From 1867 to 1985, 305 mayors were also members of the Quebec legislative assembly (MLA). The two best-known cases were those of S.N. Parent who was simultaneously mayor of Quebec City (1894-1906), MLA and Premier of Quebec (1900-1905). Longtime Montreal Mayor Camilien Houde (1928-32, 1938-40) was also simultaneously MLA for a total of 2 /1/2 years during his mandates as mayor. However that type of dual mandate had virtually ceased when laws adopted in 1978 and 1980 prohibited MLAs from holding any local mandate.

==Finland==
It is common for the MPs of the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]] to hold a mandate as a member of their local municipal council as well. 79 per cent of the MPs elected to the parliament in 2011 were also municipal council members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kunnat.net/fi/Kuntaliitto/media/tiedotteet/2011/04/Sivut/eduskunnassa-yha-enemman-kunnanvaltuutettuja.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
{{Main|cumul des mandats}}
[[File:Fête de la Fraternité 2009 - Guillaume Garot by Mikani.JPG|thumb|left|The ubiquitous ''député-maire'': Guillaume Garot (PS) is mayor of Laval, deputy of Mayenne, and ''Ministre délégué à l'agroalimentaire'']]
The dual mandate is a common practice in the [[French Fifth Republic]] (1958–present) and holding up to five offices at once was at least theoretically possible until recently. Legislation was introduced in 2000 to limit the practice, known as ''[[cumul des mandats]]'', but 85% of all members of parliament (both chambers included) still held another mandate (typically at the [[Communes of France|communal]] or [[Departments of France|departmental]] level) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/world/europe/13france.html?_r=1&amp;th=&amp;emc=th&amp;pagewanted=all French Cabinet Position Not Enough? Then Try Mayor], [[The New York Times]], January 13, 2008. Accessed March 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

No other Western country comes close to France as regard the phenomenon of double or multiple mandates. Despite routine talk about prohibiting multiple mandates, the ubiquitous 'député-maire' (deputy and mayor) is still a familiar figure of the French political scene. Currently, in the aftermath of the June 2012 legislative elections, fully 75% of all National Assembly members (438 deputies out of 577) hold a double mandate (often as mayor of a mid- to large-size city) and 33 are cumulating 4 mandates.&lt;ref&gt;http://bigbrowser.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/07/11/pastiche-le-cumul-des-mandats-une-addiction-qui-se-soigne/&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, out of 348 senators, 152 are also mayors.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeandumonteil.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/05/14/lengagement-de-la-fin-du-cumul-des-mandats-sera-t-il-tenu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, dual mandate is common for members of the territory's [[Legislative Council]], who serve concurrently as members of one of the territory's eighteen district councils. Before the abolition of the two municipal councils in the territory in 1999, it was common for politicians to serve concurrently at all three levels.

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the dual mandate of [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local councillors]] having [[Oireachtas]] seats was abolished by the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003, an amendment to the [[Local Government Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0017/print.html#sec2 |title=Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 |date=2003 June 2 |series=Irish Statute Book |chapter=§2 Amendment of Principal Act — insertion of new section 13A |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to include it in the 2001 Act failed after a rebellion by [[Fianna Fáil]] [[backbencher]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/no-political-will-to-rock-the-cosy-boat-that-is-the-seanad-502066.html |title=No political will to rock the cosy boat that is the Seanad |last=Murphy |first=John A |date=14 July 2002|work=Sunday Independent |quote=The councillor lobby which stymied Noel Dempsey's plans to end the dual mandate |accessdate=16 April 2010|location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2003 Act passed after a compensation package was agreed for those losing out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/news-in-brief-215369.html |title=Local government needs independent 'fiscal autonomy' |last=Geaney |first=Louise |date=2 June 2003 |work=Irish Independent |quote=The Local Government Bill 2000 proposed to abolish the dual mandate but the Act dropped the idea, only for it to be re-introduced — with a handy €12,800 sweetener — in 2003. |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 Act prohibited being a member of multiple county/city councils, or multiple [[List of cities, boroughs and towns in the Republic of Ireland|town council]]s, or both a town and city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/sec0014.html |title=Local Government Act 2001 |year=2001 |series=Irish Statute Book |chapter=§14.

The 2003 Act provides that a candidate elected simultaneously to a forbidden combination of local councils has three days to choose which seat to take up, with the others being considered vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0017/sec0006.html |title=Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 |date=2003 June 2 |series=Irish Statute Book |chapter=§6 Amendment of Local Elections Regulations 1995 |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Per the [[Spanish Constitution]], legislators in the [[List of Spanish regional legislatures|regional assemblies]] of the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]] are barred from being elected to a seat in the [[Congress of Deputies]], the lower house of the [[Cortes Generales]]. More precisely, regional legislators can run for the seat, but if elected they must choose between the regional and national parliaments. Nevertheless, members of lower tiers of the Spanish decentralized structure, such as provincial councillors or members of local councils, including mayors, can and have held seats in the Congress of Deputies. The rule barring regional legislators does not apply to the upper house of the Cortes, the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]]: in fact, regional legislatures are entitled to appoint a varying number of members from their ranks to the Senate, according to the population of the region. Currently, the Autonomous Communities appoint 56 Senators, the other 208 being directly elected in [[Elections in Spain|general elections]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], prior to the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament elections]], there were a small number of [[Member of the European Parliament|members of the European Parliament]] who were also members of the [[House of Lords]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahl2004/downloads/decisionandact.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As it is impossible to disclaim a [[life peerage]], it has been ruled that peers must take a &quot;leave of absence&quot; from the Lords in order to be an MEP. 

There have also been members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] also holding seats in the devolved bodies in [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]], [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]]. The November 2009 report by the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] into [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|the controversy surrounding MPs' expenses]] noted that &quot;double jobbing&quot; was &quot;unusually ingrained in the political culture&quot; of Northern Ireland, where 16 of 18 MPs were MLAs, compared to one Scottish MP being an MSP ([[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]]), and no Welsh MPs being AMs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSPL&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/Library/MP_expenses_main_report.pdf#page=97  |title=MPs' expenses and allowances; Supporting Parliament, safeguarding the taxpayer |date=November 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2010 |author=Committee on Standards in Public Life |series=House of Commons papers 2009 |volume=7724 |others=Chaired by Sir [[Christopher Kelly]] |page=95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee recommended that Westminster ban multiple mandates from the 2011 assembly elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSPL&quot;/&gt; Parties in Northern Ireland agreed to a ban from the 2015 elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSPL&quot;/&gt;  

At a lower level, it is common for people to hold seats on both [[administrative geography of the United Kingdom|a district ouncil and a county council]]. Several MPs have also retained their council seats until the expiration of their term.&lt;!--John Hemming, for three years; Craig Whittaker, for one--&gt;

==United States==
The practice is banned by the constitutions of many [[U.S. state]]s, but as of 1992 it was still legal in [[Connecticut]], [[Illinois]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York]].

===Florida===
In April 1984, [[Governor of Florida]] [[Bob Graham]] received legislation that passed unanimously in both houses of the [[Florida Legislature]] that would forbid public officials from receiving retirement pay and regular pay simultaneously for the same position.&lt;ref&gt;via ''[[Associated Press]]''.

Accessed May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illinois===
In August 2008, [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Rod Blagojevich]] proposed legislation that would prohibit dual-office holding as part of changes to the state's ethics bill, stating that &quot;dual government employment creates the potential for a conflict of interest because a legislator's duties to his or her constituents and his or her public employer are not always consistent.&quot; Critics, such as Representative [[Susana Mendoza]], called the actions &quot;spite&quot; on the part of the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Fusco, Chris.

===New Jersey===
Fulfilling a campaign pledge that he had made when first running for the [[New Jersey Legislature]], [[Jack Sinagra]] sponsored a bill passed by the [[New Jersey Senate]] in 1992 that would ban the practice. At the time that the legislation first passed, there were some twenty elected officials who served in the New Jersey Legislature and another elected office, including Assemblyman [[Bill Pascrell]], who was also mayor of [[Paterson, New Jersey]]; State Senator [[Ronald Rice]], who also served on the [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] City Council; and Assemblyman [[John E. Rooney]], who was also mayor of [[Northvale, New Jersey|Northvale]]. These officials protested the proposed ban as interfering with the will of voters to elect officials as they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;Strum, Charles.

Accessed May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper called former State senator [[Wayne R. Bryant]] the &quot;king of double dipping&quot; because he was collecting salaries from as many as four public jobs he held simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/050406/commLittleHopeForChange.html Little hope for change with the foxes still in charge], ''[[New Jersey Jewish News]]'', May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Jon Corzine]] signed legislation in September 2007 that banned the practice statewide, but the 19 legislators holding multiple offices as of February 1, 2008, were grandfathered into the system and allowed to retain their positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008ban&quot;&gt;[http://www.nj.com/south/index.ssf/2008/03/doubledipping_continues_increa.html &quot;Double-dipping continues, increases after ban&quot;], ''South Jersey Media Group'', March 24, 2008. Accessed Sep 7, 2012. &quot;Since Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed a ban on dual-office holding in September, the number of lawmakers who hold more than one office has actually increased -- from 17 to 19 -- according to a report by The Star-Ledger of Newark. This is because a grandfather clause allows any lawmaker holding two offices as of Feb. 1 to keep both.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  As of October 2012, only four of the nineteen (listed in bold) continue to hold a dual mandate.&lt;ref name=update&gt;Arca, Matthew.
