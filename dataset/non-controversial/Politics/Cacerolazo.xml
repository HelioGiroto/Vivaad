[[File:CasserolesRosemont1.jpg|thumb|right|Casserole protest in Montreal, Canada on May 24, 2012.]]

A '''cacerolazo''', '''cacerolada''' or '''casserole''' is a form of popular [[protest]] practised in certain [[Spanish-language|Spanish]]-speaking countries – in particular [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]], [[Spain]] – and most recently [[English-language|English]]-speaking countries which consists in a group of people creating noise by banging pots, pans, and other utensils in order to call for attention. What is peculiar about this type of demonstration is that the people protest from their own homes, thus achieving a high level of support and participation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The word comes from Spanish ''cacerola'', which means &quot;stew pot&quot;. The [[derivation (linguistics)|derivative]] [[Affix|suffix]] ''-azo'' denotes a hitting (punching or striking) action,&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=azo Definición de -azo], Diccionario RAE.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been extended [[metaphor]]ically to any sort of shock demonstration{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. This type of manifestation started in 1971 in Chile, against the shortages of industrial products during the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|administration of Salvador Allende]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. When this manner of protest was practised in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/story/2012/05/30/mb-casserole-quebec-protest-winnipeg.html&lt;/ref&gt; in English it was referred to by most media as &quot;casseroles&quot; rather than the Spanish term ''cacerolazo''.

==Argentina==

===2001-2002===
{{Argentine economic crisis}}

One of the largest and most recent cacerolazos occurred in [[Argentine economic crisis|Argentina during 2001]], consisting largely of protests and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] by [[middle class|middle-class]] people who had seen their savings trapped in the so-called ''[[corralito]]'' (a set of restrictive economic measures that effectively froze all [[bank account]]s, initially as a short-term fix for the massive draining of [[bank deposit]]s). The ''corralito'' meant that many people who needed a large amount of cash immediately, or who simply lived off the interests from their deposits, suddenly found their savings unavailable. As court appeals were slow and ineffective, people resorted to protest in the streets.

As the Argentine peso quickly [[devaluation|devalued]] and foreign currency fled the country, the government decreed a forced conversion of [[United States dollar|dollar]]-denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary [[exchange rate]] of 1.4 pesos per dollar. At this point the unavailability of cash for people trapped in the ''corralito'' compounded with the continuous loss of value of their savings, and the unresponsiveness of the appeal authorities (minor courts and the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]] itself) further angered the protesters.
[[Image:Cacerolazo en Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A ''cacerolazo'' in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina during the night of December 19, 2001.]]

The first ''cacerolazos'' were spontaneous and non-partisan. While in Argentina most demonstrations against government measures are customarily organized by [[labour union]] activists and low-level political recruiters among the lower classes, and often featuring an assortment of large banners, drums and pyrotechnic devices, ''cacerolazos'' were composed mostly of spontaneously gathered middle-class workers, housewives and professionals, who used not to be involved in [[grassroots]] political action of any kind.

After a time, however, the ''cacerolazo'' became an organized phenomenon, often of a violent nature, directed against the banks. Many of these were attacked, their facades spray-painted, their windows broken, their entrances blocked by tire fires, or even their facilities occupied by force at times.

In order to avoid further violence, especially with the deadly [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|December 2001 riots]] still fresh in the memories of Argentines, the government decided not to use active police force against the ''cacerolazos'' unless absolutely necessary, and to restrict most police presence to barricades in critical spots, a policy that was followed also with ''[[piquetero]]'' marches of unemployed people asking for state welfare and jobs.

Isolated ''cacerolazos'' also featured during the ''[[apagón]]'' (&quot;blackout&quot;) of September 24, 2002, to protest against increases in public service fees requested by the providers.
As the financial and macroeconomic conditions became more stable, the government loosened the restrictions on the withdrawal of deposits, and the ''cacerolazos'' died out.

===2008===
On March 25,  a group led by Luis D'Elia, a supporter of the Kirchner administration, and a cacerolazo violently faced each other during the demonstrations pro and against the export tax policy of [[Cristina Kirchner]]'s government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La policía observó, pero no intervino|publisher=''La Nacion''|date=27 March 2008|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/nota.asp?nota_id=999067&amp;origen=relacionadas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacería para ganar la Plaza.

{{Main|2012 cacerolazo in Argentina}}
[[File:Cacerolazo en Avenida Santa Fe y Callao (Jueves 19 de Septiembre) 2.jpg|thumb|The [[2012 cacerolazo in Argentina|2012 cacerolazo]] at the Santa Fe and Callao streets, Buenos Aires.]]
On May 31, a cacerolazo, with a following far less reduced than those of 2001-2, but generalized among middle-class neighborhood, organized through the internet protested against the introduction of controls on the foreign currency exchange market by [[Cristina Kirchner]]'s government, rampant insecurity, a sense of disruption and infringement of civil right’s due to a new control of the afip(irs) to Argentine travelers which is not on its organic mandate, fiscal reform in the most populated Argentine province that would more than triple current land property tax and many allegedly corruption charges against government and policymakers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacerolazo en contra del Gobierno en la Capital|publisher=''La Nacion''|date=31 May 2012|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1478106-los-cacerolazos-volvieron-a-los-barrios-portenos}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacerolazos en algunas esquinas|publisher=''Página 12''|date=31 May 2012|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-195394-2012-06-01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2012/05/31/noticia_0037.html], [[Diario Perfil]], 01-06-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 01, there was another cacerolazo in similar conditions.

On June 7, 2012 there was a big cacerolazo. A very big concentration which was in the several thousand people showed up in plaza de Mayo, also widespread among the city’s important avenues intersection.

The following week, June 14, another concentration in Plaza de Mayo was attended by a few hundred. &lt;ref&gt;{{ |publisher=''Minutouno''|date=14 June 2012|url=http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/168208-poca-convocatoria-en-marcha-a-plaza-de-mayo/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 31 and June 1, cacerolazos in high class neighbourhoods were organized through the internet in protest to a diversity of reasons, not existing a single cohesive one. The most prominent was the introduction of controls on the foreign currency exchange market by [[Cristina Kirchner]]'s government. With a lesser extent it was a protest against crime, fiscal reform on land property tax and allegedly national government corruption cases &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacerolazo en contra del Gobierno en la Capital|publisher=''La Nacion''|date=31 May 2012|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1478106-los-cacerolazos-volvieron-a-los-barrios-portenos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cacerolazos en algunas esquinas|publisher=''Página 12''|date=31 May 2012|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-195394-2012-06-01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2012/05/31/noticia_0037.html], [[Diario Perfil]], 01-06-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 7, there was a cacerolazo with a concentration of around a thousand people in Plaza de Mayo and in Buenos Aires's avenues intersections of high class neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La guerra (virtual) por el Cacerolazo|publisher=''Microsoft''|date=13 June 2012|url=http://noticias.latam.msn.com/AR/ciencia_tecnologia/blog/post.aspx?post=642f5c9f-6a51-49c3-86a1-0cf2c1213e48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, June 14, another concentration in Plaza de Mayo was attended by a just a few hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poca convocatoria en marcha a Plaza de Mayo|publisher=''Minutouno''|date=14 June 2012|url=http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/168208-poca-convocatoria-en-marcha-a-plaza-de-mayo/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, thousands of Argentines marched in the largest protests [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|since 2008]] against the government of President Cristina Fernandez, who, according to an opinion poll by Management &amp; Fit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2012/10/01/cfk-s-positive-image-at-a-record-low-of-25.5-according-to-latest-poll|title= CFK’s positive image at a record low of 25.5%, according to latest poll|trans_title= |language= |author= |date= October 1, 2012|work= |publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has lost popularity since her landslide re-election the previous year (this point of view is not shared by public opinion research company Equis, whose CEO Artemio López said that the popularity indexes remain stable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.tn.com.ar/politica/la-imagen-de-cristina-kirchner_274716|title=La imagen de Cristina Kirchner|trans_title= |language=|author=|date= October 2, 2012|work= |publisher=TN Todo Noticias|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The event raised a noticeable polemic, as news coverage from most government-aligned newspapers and TV broadcasters was reduced to a minumun, and government officials' claim ragarding that the cacerolazo only represented a small and minoritary portion of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina sees largest anti-government protests yet|publisher=''Washington Post''|date=13 September 2012|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/argentina-sees-largest-anti-government-protests-yet-many-disapprove-of-economic-management/2012/09/13/c14e07d2-fe11-11e1-98c6-ec0a0a93f8eb_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another protest was made on November 8, commonly known as '''[[8N]]''' amongst the country, principally in the [[Obelisco]] and the [[Plaza de Mayo]], and around the world in the major cities of Spain, the US, Canada, Brazil, France, the UK and bordering countries. The latter was also called within [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], though in contrast  to the one on September 13, to which assisted over 50,000 people, 250,000 were present at the 8N. The main complaints were, again the February rail accident victims, the inflation and the reject to the possible &quot;re-re-election&quot; of Kirchner, but also insecurity and the [[Relation_of_Kirchnerism_with_the_press#Law_about_media|Ley de Medios]]. Again, [[Todo Noticias]] dedicated to transmit it completely, while other media supporting the president, such as [[América TV]] and [[C5N]], in which a reporter was knocked down &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Durante la marcha, golpearon a un movilero de C5N|publisher=''La Nación''|date=9 November 2012|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1524852-durante-la-marcha-agredieron-a-un-movilero-de-c5n}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also present.

==Canada==
{{further|2012 Quebec student protests|Bill 78}}
[[File:CasserolesRosemont2.jpg|thumb|right|Casserole protest against Bill 78 in Montreal, Canada on May 24, 2012.]]
In 2012 in [[Québec]], a province of [[Canada]], citizens were using cacerolazo after the adoption on 18 May of [[Bill 78]], an act which restricts rights to assemble after violent riots erupted in [[Montreal]] and [[Victoriaville]]. Bill 78, aimed at restoring access to education for peaceful students and at protecting businesses and citizens from violence by some student protesters, has been criticized by the [[United Nations]], the [[Quebec Bar Association]], [[Amnesty International]], and others. The controversial UN criticism has been sharply rebuked by both the Quebec and federal governments as out of line. Court challenges against the bill are underway.

Several &quot;Casseroles&quot; or &quot;Pots and pans demonstrations&quot; were held in towns and cities across the province, primarily concentrated in Montreal's various neighbourhoods.
,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Groups+over+cynical+Bill/6647459/story.html#ixzz1vzqE8LOM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/quebec-law-breaches-canada-s-international-human-rights-obligations-2012-05-26]&lt;/ref&gt; though smaller protests outside the Province of Quebec were held in solidarity with the student protesters, including cities such as Calgary,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2012/05/31/calgary-casserole-rally-protest-bill-78.html&lt;/ref&gt; Saskatoon,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2012/05/30/sk-casserole-regina-saskatoon.html&lt;/ref&gt; Winnipeg,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/story/2012/05/30/mb-casserole-quebec-protest-winnipeg.html&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/hamilton/news/story/2012/05/31/hamilton-casserole-protest.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Sudbury.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3576068&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chile==

===1971-1989===
Cacerolazos began in Chile in 1971 in protest at shortages during the Salvador Allende administration. By 1973 they had become commonplace as protests against the administration intensified amid increasing shortages. After [[Augusto Pinochet]] seized power in 1973 cacerolazos disappeared for a time until the [[Crisis of 1982|economic crisis of 1982-83]] set in. Thereafter cacerolazos continued up until the Pinochet regime lost a plebiscite in 1988 that put him out of office two years later.

===2011===
''Cacerolazos'' were organized in 2011 for two different reasons. On 15 May there was pot-banging in several cities in protest of the [[HidroAysén]] dam project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2011/05/680-365977-9-cacerolazos-contra-hidroaysen-se-realizan-en-distintas-ciudades-del-pais.shtml |title=Realizan 'cacerolazos' contra HidroAysén en distintas ciudades del país &amp;#124; Nacional |publisher=La Tercera |date=2011-05-15 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in August there were two ''cacerolazos'' across the country in support of [[2011 student protests in Chile|student protests]], the first in August 4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=post |url=http://latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2011/08/680-384316-9-cacerolazos-se-oyen-en-santiago-en-apoyo-a-demandas-estudiantiles.shtml |title='Cacerolazos' se oyen en Santiago en apoyo a demandas estudiantiles &amp;#124; Nacional |publisher=La Tercera |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second one in August 8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tercera.com/noticia/nacional/2011/08/680-385319-9-cacerolazos-se-registran-en-todo-el-pais-en-nueva-jornada-de-manifestaciones.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iceland==
The protests following the financial crisis that started in 2008 are sometimes called [[2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests|The Kitchenware Revolution]], because people took to the streets banging on pots and pans and other household utensils.

==Mexico==
In 2006, during the Oaxaca protests that saw thousands occupy their city following the police repression of teachers' strikes, 5000 women marchers banged pots and pans with spoons and meat tenderizers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.protestcamps.org&lt;/ref&gt; Their march took them through the city squares and to outside the state-run television station channel 9. The women demanded a one hour slot to report on the people's story of what was happening in Oaxaca; a story that was censored and skewed by government propaganda against the protesters. When the station refused the women, still carrying their pots and pans, entered the building and took over the station. They carried out live broadcasts of the people's struggles.&lt;ref&gt;'The Taking of Channel 9' http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyid=115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
More than 90% of the Spaniards were against the [[Iraq War]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/03/29/sprj.irq.spain/ |title=Polls: 90 percent of Spaniards against war |publisher=CNN |date=2003-03-29 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provoked during 2003 cacerolazo-fashioned protests against the government decision to support it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldo.es/guerrairaq/28032003/diario/noticia5.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People protested from their homes turning lights on and off, making noise with [[whistles]] and [[klaxon]]s and hitting stew pots. In Huesca [[street light|lamp posts]] of 16 streets were turned off in protest during 15 minutes.
