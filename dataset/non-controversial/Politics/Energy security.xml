''' Energy security ''' is a term for an association between [[national security]] and the availability of [[natural resource]]s for [[energy]] consumption. Access to cheap [[energy]] has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. 

[[Renewable energy]] resources and significant opportunities for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ETP2012SUM.pdf |title=Energy Technology Perspectives 2012 |author= International Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy security threats==
The modern world relies on a vast energy supply to fuel everything from transportation to communication, to security and health delivery systems. Perhaps most alarmingly, [[peak oil]] expert [[Mike Ruppert]] has claimed that for every calorie of food produced in the industrial world, ten calories of oil and gas energy are invested in the forms of fertilizer, pesticide, packaging, transportation, and running farm equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHvd7WHQZ78|title=[[Collapse (film)|Collapse]]|people=[[Michael Ruppert]]|year=2009|language=English|quote=There are ten calories of hydrocarbon energy in every calorie of food consumed in the industrialized world.|time=27:50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy plays an important role in the national security of any given country as a fuel to power the economic engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=/published/emeraldfulltextarticle/pdf/3280010106.pdf |title=Emerald: Article Request - Sino-Indian cooperation in the search for overseas petroleum resources: Prospects and implications for India |publisher=Emeraldinsight.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sectors rely on energy more heavily than others; for example, the Department of Defense relies on petroleum for approximately 77% of its energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parthemore|first=C.|title=Fueling the Force: Preparing the Department of Defense for a Post-Petroleum Era|publisher=Center for  New American Security|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to '''energy security''' include the political instability of several energy producing countries, the manipulation of energy supplies, the competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents, natural disasters, rising terrorism, and dominant countries reliance to the foreign oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |title=Power plays: Energy and Australia's security |publisher=Aspi.org.au |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Foreign oil supplies are vulnerable to unnatural disruptions from in-state conflict, exporters’ interests, and non-state actors targeting the supply and transportation of oil resources. The political and economic instability caused by war or other factors such as [[strike action]] can also prevent the proper functioning of the energy industry in a supplier country. For example, the nationalization of oil in Venezuela has triggered strikes and protests in which Venezuela’s oil production rates have yet to recover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Issues&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Issues|year=2009|publisher=CQ Researchers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exporters may have political or economic incentive to limit their foreign sales or cause disruptions in the supply chain. Since Venezuela’s nationalization of oil, anti-American Hugo Chávez has threatened to cut off supplies to the United States more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Issues|year=2009|publisher=CQ Researcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1973 oil embargo against the U.S. is a historical example in which oil supplies were cut off to the US due to US support of Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. This has been done to apply pressure during economic negotiations—such as during the [[Russia-Belarus energy dispute]]. Terrorist attacks targeting oil facilities, pipelines, tankers, refineries, and oil fields are so common they are referred to as “industry risks”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luft|first=G|coauthors=Korin, A.|title=Terrors Next Target|journal=Journal of International Security Affairs|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure for producing the resource is extremely vulnerable to sabotage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Issues&quot;/&gt;  One of the worst risks to oil transportation is the exposure of the five ocean chokepoints, like the Iranian controlled Strait of Hormuz. Anthony H. Cordsman, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington warns, “It may take only one asymmetric or conventional attack on a [[Ghawar]] Saudi oil field or tankers in the Strait of Hormuz to throw the market into a spiral.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cordsman|first=A.|title=Global Oil Security|journal=Center for Strategic and International Studies|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to an article by the [[RAND Corporation]], oil export revenues are used to finance terrorist groups, like [[Hamas]] and [[Hizballah]].  Former CIA director, [[Jim Woosley]] reports, “Except for our own Civil War, this [the war on terror] is the only war that we have fought where we are paying for both sides. We pay Saudi Arabia $160 billion for its oil, and $3 or $4 billion of that goes to the Wahhabis, who teach children to hate. We are paying for these terrorists with our SUVs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crane|first=K.|title=Imported Oil and U.S. National Security|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG838.|publisher=RAND Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

New threats to energy security have emerged in the form of the increased world competition for energy resources due to the increased pace of [[industrialization]] in  countries such as [[India]] and [[China]]. Although still a minority concern, the possibility of price rises resulting from the [[Hubbert peak theory|peaking of world oil production]] is also starting to attract the attention of at least the [[France|French]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Porter |first=Adam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077802.stm |title='Peak oil' enters mainstream debate |publisher=BBC News |date=2005the -06-10 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased competition over energy resources may also lead to the formation of security compacts to enable an equitable distribution of oil and gas between major powers. However, this may happen at the expense of less developed economies. The [[Group of Five]], precursors to the [[G8]], first met in 1975 to coordinate economic and energy policies in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Arab oil embargo]], a rise in inflation and a global economic slowdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maavak.net/maavak/maavak070.html Panoptic World: &quot;Globocops of Energy Security&quot;] Mathew Maavak, originally published in The Korea Herald on July 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[NATO]] leaders meeting in Bucharest in April 2008 may discuss the possibility of using the military alliance &quot;as an instrument of energy security.&quot; One of the possibilities include placing troops in the Caucasus region to police oil and gas pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/mar/10/eu.climatechange &quot;Climate change may spark conflict with Russia, EU told&quot;] Guardian, March 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010|12|13}}

==Long term security==
Long term measures to increase energy security center on reducing dependence on any one source of imported energy, increasing the number of suppliers, exploiting native [[fossil fuel]] or [[renewable energy]] resources, and reducing overall demand through [[energy conservation]] measures. It can also involve entering into international agreements to underpin international energy trading relationships, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] in Europe.  All the concern coming from security threats on oil sources long term security measures will help reduce the future cost of importing and exporting fuel into and out of countries without having to worry about harm coming to the goods being transported.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The impact of the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the emergence of the [[OPEC]] [[cartel]] was a particular milestone that prompted some countries to increase their energy security. Japan, almost totally dependent on imported oil, steadily introduced  the use of [[natural gas]], [[nuclear power]], high-speed [[mass transit]] systems, and implemented [[energy conservation]] measures,&lt;ref name=&quot;bennett2000&quot;&gt;[http://bennett.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=226465 Oil Crisis, US Senator Bob Bennett, September 27, 2000]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become one of the world leaders in the use of [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/japanenv.html US Energy Information Administration Country Analysis Briefs, Japan: Environmental Issue, January 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] began exploiting [[North Sea oil]] and gas reserves, and became a net exporter of energy into the 2000s.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In other countries energy security has historically been a lower priority. The [[United States]], for example, has continued to increase its dependency on imported oil&lt;ref name=&quot;bennett2000&quot; /&gt; although, following the [[oil price increases since 2003]], the development of [[biofuels]] has been suggested as a means of addressing this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/15/news/companies/bush_biofuel.reut/index.htm CNN: Oil majors question Bush biofuel plan, February 15, 2007]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing energy security is also one of the reasons behind a block on the development of natural gas imports in Sweden. Greater investment in native renewable energy technologies and energy conservation is envisaged instead. [[Energy policy of India|India]] is carrying out a major hunt for domestic oil to decrease its dependency on [[OPEC]], while [[renewable energy in Iceland|Iceland]] is well advanced in its plans to become energy-independent by 2050 through deploying 100% renewable energy.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Short term security==

===Petroleum===
Petroleum or otherwise known as &quot;crude oil&quot; has become the resource most used by countries all around the world including Russia, China and the United States of America.  With all the oil wells located around the world energy security has become a main issue to ensure the safety of the petroleum that is being harvested.  In the middle east oil fields become main targets for sabotage because of how heavily countries rely on oil.  Many countries hold [[global strategic petroleum reserves|strategic petroleum reserves]] as a buffer against the [[economy|economic]] and political impacts of an [[energy crisis]]. All 28 members of the [[International Energy Agency]] hold a minimum of 90 days of their oil imports, for example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2002/beijing/KUOLT2.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Margaret Baker |url=http://www.agiweb.org/gap/legis106/reauthspr.html |title=Reauthorization of the Energy Policy &amp; Conservation Act |publisher=Agiweb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of such reserves was demonstrated by the relative lack of disruption caused by the 2007 [[Russia-Belarus energy dispute]], when [[Russia]] indirectly cut exports to several countries in the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Due to the theories in [[peak oil]] and need to curb demand, the United States military and Department of Defense had made significant cuts, and have been making a number of attempts to come up with more efficient ways to use oil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=183:energy-security-as-national-security-defining-problems-ahead-of-solutions1&amp;catid=92:issuecontent&amp;Itemid=341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
Compared to [[petroleum]], reliance on imported [[natural gas]] creates significant short term vulnerabilities. Many European countries saw an immediate drop in supply when Russian gas supplies were halted during the [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]] in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Natural gas has been a viable source of energy in the world.  Consisting of mostly methane natural gas is produced using two methods, biogenic and thermogenic.  Biogenic comes from methogenic organisms located in marshes and landfills where thermogenic comes from buried material that is heated up from the earths core.  Russia is the current leading country in production of natural gases.  

One of the biggest problems currently with natural gas is the ability to storage and transport it.  With its low density it becomes harder to have pipelines in North America to transport enough natural gas as the demand increases.  These pipelines are reaching near capacity and even at full capacity do not produce the amount of gas needed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Nuclear power===
[[Image:2007 EU Uranium sources.png|thumb|300px|Sources of uranium delivered to EU utilities in 2007, from the [http://ec.europa.eu/euratom/ar/last.pdf 2007 Annual report] of the [[Euratom]] Supply Agency]] Uranium for [[nuclear power]] is [[Uranium mining|mined]] and [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] in diverse and &quot;stable&quot; countries.  These include Canada (23% of the world's total in 2007), Australia (21%), Kazakhstan (16%) and more than 10 other countries.  Uranium is mined and fuel is manufactured significantly in advance of need.  Nuclear fuel is considered by some to be a relatively reliable power source, though a debate over the timing of [[peak uranium]] does exist.  

Although a very viable resource nuclear power comes under fire a lot of times because of the danger that people associate to it, nuclear power is stable but if something were to happen there are very little options that have been proposed to fix that problem.  Another big factor in the debate with nuclear power is that many people or companies do not want this high waste energy solution near them due to possible radiation leaks, nuclear runoff into streams and lakes and also the nuclear power plant ruins how appealing a city or state looks to other people in the country.  

Currently, nuclear power provides only a fraction of the world's total electricity, and an even smaller fraction of the United States' electricity. The most notable use of nuclear power within the United States is in US Navy aircraft carriers, cruisers, and submarines, which have been exclusively nuclear-powered for several decades. These classes of ship provide the core of the Navy's power, and as such are the single most noteworthy application of nuclear power.

===Renewable energy===
{{Main|Energy security and renewable technology}}
The deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. For those countries where growing dependence on imported gas is a significant energy security issue, renewable technologies can provide alternative sources of electric power as well as displacing electricity demand through direct heat production. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]].&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf |title=Contribution of renewables to Energy Security |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As the resources that have been so crucial to survival in the world to this day start declining in numbers, countries will begin to realize that the need for renewable fuel sources will be as vital as ever.  With the production of new types of energy including, solar, geothermal, hydro-electric, biofuel and wind power.  With the amount of sun that hits the world in one hour there is enough energy to power the world for one year.  With the addition of solar panels all around the world a little less pressure is taken off the need to produce more oil.  

Geothermal can potentially lead to other sources of fuel, if companies would take the heat from the inner core of the earth to heat up water sources we could essentially use the steam creating from the heated water to power machines, this option is one of the cleanest and efficient options.  Hydro-electric which has been incorporated into many of the dams around the world produces a lot of energy and is very easy to produce the energy as the dams control the water that is allowed through seams which power turbines located inside of the dam.  [[Biofuels]] have been researched using many different sources including ethanol and algae, these options are substantially cleaner than the consumption of petroleum. &quot;Most LCA results for per- ennial and ligno-cellulosic crops conclude that biofuels can supplement anthropogenic energy demands and mitigate [[GHG emissions]] to the atmosphere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Sarah|title=Life-cycle analysis and the ecology of biofuels|url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/delucia/Publications/Davis%20LCA%20TiPS.pdf|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Cell Press|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
