[[Nationalism]] was an important factor in the development of [[Europe]]. In the 19th century, a wave of [[romantic nationalism]] swept the continent of Europe transforming the countries of the continent.  Some new countries, such as Germany and Italy were formed by uniting smaller states with a common &quot;national identity&quot;.  Others, such as [[Romania]], Greece, Poland and Bulgaria, were formed by winning their independence.

[[Image:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|right|350px|thumb|The storming of the Bastille, 14 July 1789.]]
The [[French Revolution]] paved the way for the modern [[nation-state]]. Across Europe radical [[intellectuals]] questioned the old [[monarchy|monarchial]] order and encouraged the development of a popular nationalism committed to re-drawing the [[political]] map of the [[europe|continent]]. By 1814 the days of multi-national [[empire]]s were numbered. The [[French Revolution]], by destroying the traditional structures of power in [[France]] and territories conquered by [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], was the instrument for the [[political]] transformation of Europe. Revolutionary armies carried the slogan of &quot;liberty, equality and brotherhood&quot; and ideas of [[liberalism]] and national self-determinism. National awakening also grew out of an [[intellectual]] reaction to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that emphasized [[national identity]] and developed a [[National romanticism|romantic view]] of [[cultural]] self-expression through [[nationhood]]. The key exponent of the modern idea of the [[nation-state]] was the German [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]. He argued that a sense of [[nationality]] was the cement that held modern [[society|societies]] together in the age when [[dynastic]] and [[religious]] allegiance was in decline. In 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]], the major powers of Europe tried to restore the old [[dynastic]] system as far as possible, ignoring the principle of [[nationality]] in favour of &quot;[[legitimism]]&quot;, the assertion of [[traditional]] claims to royal authority. With most of Europe's peoples still loyal to their local [[province]] or [[city]], nationalism was confined to small groups of [[intellectuals]] and [[political]] radicals.  Furthermore, [[political repression]], symbolized by the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] published in [[Austria]] in 1819, pushed [[nationalist]] agitation underground.

== The struggle for independence ==
[[Image:Giuseppe Mazzini.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]], campaigner for Italian unification.]]
A strong resentment of what came to be regarded as [[colonialism|foreign]] rule began to develop. In [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Norway]] local hostility to alien [[dynastic]] [[authority]] started to take the form of [[nationalist]] agitation. [[Nationalism]] came to be seen as the most effective way to create the symbols of resistance and to unite in a common cause. First national revolution was in [[Serbian revolution|Serbian]] (1804–1817) which created the first [[nation-state]] in [[Central Europe]]. Success came in [[Greece]] where an eight-year [[Greek War of Independence|war]] (1821–1829) against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule led to an [[Greece|independent Greek state]]; in 1831 [[Belgium]] obtained [[Belgian Revolution|independence]] from the [[Netherlands]]. Over the next two decades [[nationalism]] developed a more powerful voice, spurred by [[nationalist]] writers championing the cause of nationalist self-determination. In 1848, [[revolution]]s broke out across [[Europe]], sparked by a severe [[famine]] and [[economic crisis]] and mounting popular demand for [[politics|political]] change. In [[Italy]] [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] used the opportunity to encourage a war for [[Italian unification|national unity]]. In 1861 he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;No people ever die, nor stop
short upon their path, before they have achieved the ultimate aim of their existence, before having completed and fulfilled their mission. A people destined to achieve great things for the welfare of humanity must on day or other be constituted a nation&quot;.
[[Image:Berliner kongress.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Congress of Berlin]] 1878.]]
&lt;/blockquote&gt; In [[Hungary]], [[Lajos Kossuth]] led a national revolt against [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule; in [[Transylvania]], [[Avram Iancu]] (also known as ''Craisorul Muntilor'', which means ''The Prince of the Mountains'') led the [[Romanians|Romanian]] revolt against the Hungarian rule; in the [[German Confederation]] a National Assembly was elected at [[Frankfurt]] and debated the creation of a [[Germany|German nation]].  None of the [[nationalist]] revolts in 1848 were successful, any more than the two attempts to win [[List of Polish wars|Polish independence]] from [[Russia]]n rule in 1831 and 1846 had been.  [[Conservative]] forces proved too strong, while the majority of the populations little understood the meaning of [[nationalism|national struggle]].  But the 1848 crisis had given [[nationalism]] its first full public airing, and in the thirty years that followed no fewer than seven new national states were created in [[Europe]].  This was partly the result of the recognition by [[conservative]] forces that the old order could not continue in its existing form. Conservative reformers such as [[Cavour]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] made common cause with [[liberalism|liberal]] political modernizers to create a consensus for the creation of [[conservative]] nation-states in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]].  In the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg empire]] a compromise was reached with [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nationalists in 1867 granting them a virtually [[Hungary|independent state]]. In the [[Balkans]] the [[Serbian revolution|Serbian]] example had inspired other national awakenings. Native [[history]] and [[culture]] were rediscovered and appropriated for the [[nationalism|national]] struggle.  Following a conflict between [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]], the [[Congress of Berlin|Great Powers met at Berlin]] in 1878 and granted independence to [[Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] and a limited autonomy to [[Bulgaria]].

== Nationalism's growth and export ==
[[Image:Herzl.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Theodor Herzl]].]]
The invention of a symbolic [[Nation|national identity]] became the concern of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[ethnic groups|ethnic]] or [[language|linguistic]] groups throughout [[Europe]] as they struggled to come to terms with the rise of [[mass politics]], the decline of the [[Elitism|traditional social elites]], popular [[discrimination]] and [[xenophobia]]. Within the [[Habsburg empire]] the different peoples developed a more mass-based, violent and exclusive form of [[nationalism]]. This developed even among the [[German people|Germans]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]], who actually benefited from the power-structure of the [[empire]]. On the [[Europe]]an periphery, especially in [[Ireland]] and [[Norway]], campaigns for national [[independence]] became more strident. In 1905 [[Norway]] won independence from [[Sweden]], but attempts to grant [[Ireland]] the kind of [[autonomy]] enjoyed by [[Hungary]] foundered on the national divisions on the [[Ireland|island]] between the [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The Polish attempts to win independence from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had previously proved to be unsuccessful, with [[Congress Poland|Poland]] being the only country in Europe whose autonomy was gradually limited rather than expanded throughout the 19th century, as a punishment for the failed uprisings; in 1831 Poland lost its status as a formally independent state and was merged into Russia as a [[real union]] country and in 1867 she became nothing more than just another Russian province. Faced with internal and external resistance to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], as well as increased xenophobic [[anti-Semitism]], radical demands began to develop among the stateless [[Jew]]ish population of [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] and [[central Europe]] for their own national home and refuge.  In 1897, inspired by the Hungarian-born Jewish nationalist [[Theodor Herzl]], the [[First Zionist Congress]] was held in [[Basel|Basle]], and declared their national 'home' should be in [[Palestine]]. By the end of the period, the ideals of [[Europe]]an [[nationalism]] had been exported worldwide and were now beginning to develop, and both compete and threaten the empires ruled by [[Colonialism|colonial]] European nation-states.
