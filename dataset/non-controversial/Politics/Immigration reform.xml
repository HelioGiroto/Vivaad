'''Immigration reform''' is a term used in political discussion regarding changes to current [[immigration policy]] of a country. In its strict definition, &quot;reform &quot; means to change into an improved form or condition, by amending or removing faults or abuses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reform&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the political sense, '''immigration reform''' may include promoted, expanded, or [[open immigration]], as well as reduced or eliminated immigration.

== Immigration reform in the United States ==

{{Main|History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States}}
This term is also widely used to describe proposals to increase legal immigration while decreasing illegal immigration, such as the [[guest worker]] proposal supported by [[George W. Bush]]. Illegal immigration is a controversial issue in the United States. Proponents of greater immigration enforcement argue that illegal immigrants cost taxpayers an estimated $338.3 billion dollars and jeopardize the safety of law enforcement officials and citizens, especially along the Mexican border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://averagepolitics.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/cost_of_illegal_aliens Ilegal Immigration: How much does it cost?] 2008 May 7. 30 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Mexican president, [[Vicente Fox]], writes that in 2001, President George W. Bush, and the leadership of both parties of Congress were about to pass significant immigration reform legislation benefiting Mexican emigration to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Vicente. &quot;Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President”, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] made it illegal to hire or recruit illegal immigrants.

In 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the [[Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005]], and in 2006 the U.S. Senate passed the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006]]. Neither bill became law because their differences could not be reconciled in [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fears |first= Darrylnfdn |title=Immigration Reform Revisited |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-03-23 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201840.html |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative negotiations and national activism behind immigration reform from 2001-2007 is the subject of 12-part documentary film series [[How Democracy Works Now]].

In 2009 the immigration reform became a hot topic, since the [[Barack Obama]] administration recently signaled interest in beginning a discussion on comprehensive immigration reform before year's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A 2010 academic study has shown that when immigration issues receive national media attention, established residents living in places that have seen influx of new immigrants suddenly become much more politicized against immigration. This suggests that it is not the influx of new residents or new proximity to established residents that stir anti-immigrant sentiments; rather, resentment is spurred by the heated and prominent nature of the debate itself. The study, done by Georgetown University and published in the ''American Political Science Review'', “Politicized Places: Explaining Where and When Immigrants Provoke Local Opposition,” examined more than twelve different surveys relating to immigration and local anti-immigration ordinances, spanning the years 1992 to 2009. During a period of high national attention to immigration, anti-immigration attitudes among established residents in fast-changing counties increase by 9.9%. The study’s author states that ethnic and racial surroundings appear to affect Americans’ political attitudes far less than previously thought: “Those who live near larger proportions of immigrants do not consistently exhibit more negative attitudes.” Rather, the author concludes, “day-to-day encounters can be shaped by salient national issues.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/immigration/politicized-provoke-opposition/ |title = Politicized Places: When Immigrants Provoke Opposition |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona SB 1070===
In 2009, services provided to illegal immigrants, including incarceration, cost the state of Arizona an estimated $2.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes | first= Ed |title= Cost of Illegal Immigration Rising Rapidly in Arizona Study Finds | publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2010-05-17 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/17/immigration-costs-rising-rapidlty-new-study-says/&gt; |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Citing Congress’ failure to enforce U.S. immigration laws, the state of Arizona confronted reform and on April, 23, 2010 Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed the [[Arizona SB 1070|Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (Arizona SB 1070)]], the broadest and strictest immigration reform imposed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Archibold |first=Randel |title= Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration |date=2010-04-23 |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2010/04/30/20100430arizona-immigration-law-governor-signs-revised-bill.html |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SB1070 Arizona immigration law directs law enforcement officials to ask for immigration papers on a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that a person might be an illegal immigrant and make arrests for not carrying ID papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioproject.org/2010/11/arizonas-sb-1070-the-battle-for-immigrants-rights/ &quot;Arizona's SB-1070: the Battle for Immigrant's Rights&quot;] Making Contact, produced by National Radio Project. November 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, police could not stop and check identification papers on a mere suspicion that someone might be an illegal immigrant. Police could only ask about an individual's immigration status if they are suspected of involvement in another crime.&lt;ref&gt;Randel Archibold, Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration, 23 April 2010, 29 November 2010 &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2010, the US Department of Justice filed suit against Arizona. The intent of the suit is to prevent Arizona from enforcing the law and asks the court to find certain sections of the legislation null and void.&lt;ref&gt;Obama's Key Promises, 29 November 2010 &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/obamas-promises/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States Congress has left this issue untouched as many feared such a vote could threaten their chances at reelection{{citation}}.

Being the first state to pass such legislation, Arizona has set a precedent for other states, but this legislation has also caused Arizona to carry a large burden. Arizonans have faced boycotts and protests from their commercial businesses to sporting events and concert. Although the response has cost the state between $7 million and $52 million, some in the state still feel that this outcome will outweigh the initial cost.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Barnes, Cost of Illegal Immigration Rising Rapidly in Arizona, Study Finds, 17 May 2010, 29 November 2010 &lt;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/17/immigration-costs-rising-rapidlty-new-study-says/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Due to conflict and protest, the week after she signed SB 1070, Governor Brewer signed the Arizona legislature passed House Bill 2162 (HB 2162) amending text in the original document. HB 2162 includes that race, color, and national origin would not play a role in prosecution; in order to investigate an individual's immigration status, he or she must be “lawfully stopped, arrested or detained.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Casey Newton and Ginger Rough, Arizona governor signs bill revising new immigration law, 1 May 2010, 20 November 2010 &lt;http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2010/04/30/20100430arizona-immigration-law-governor-signs-revised-bill.html&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Opponents of the law say that it will ultimately cost the state “$26.4 billion in economic activity, $11.7 billion in gross state product and approximately 140,024 jobs” if all illegal immigrants are removed from the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Barnes, Cost of Illegal Immigration Rising Rapidly in Arizona, Study Finds, 17 May 2010, 29 November 2010 &lt;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/17/immigration-costs-rising-rapidlty-new-study-says/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration Court Reform===

In the absence of comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level, many advocacy groups have focused on improving the fairness and efficiency of the [[immigration court|immigration court system]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association. &quot;[http://apps.americanbar.org/abanet/media/release/news_release.cfm?releaseid=870 Reforming the Immigration System],&quot; February 2010. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS). &quot;[http://www.acus.gov/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/01/ACUS-Immigration-Removal-Adjudication-Draft-Report-1_12_12.pdf Taking Steps to Enhance Quality and Timeliness in Immigration Removal Adjudication],&quot; June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They propose incremental steps the executive branch can take to stop an “assembly line approach”&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; to deportation proceedings. These groups have identified several issues that threaten the due process rights of immigrants, including reliance on low quality videoconferencing to conduct hearings, inadequate language interpretation services for non-English speakers, and limited access to court records.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; pp. 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt; They also focus on problems arising out of the recent increase in immigration law enforcement without a commensurate boost in resources for adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration Judges and DHS Trial Attorneys are overworked,&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; pp. 33-49.&lt;/ref&gt; and the pro bono community has been unable to meet the demand for representation: 49% of individuals facing removal proceedings in 2011 were unrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other calls for reform include increased transparency at the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt; and more diversity of experience among Immigration Judges, the majority of whom previously held positions adversarial to immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Appleseed Foundation|Appleseed]]. &quot;[http://www.appleseednetwork.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mJKC4zjewhI%3d&amp;tabid=157 Reimagining the Immigration Court Assembly Line],&quot; p 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The differed action process President Obama announced on June 15, 2012 is one example of the incremental reform these groups seek. Under the program, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. before age fifteen can apply for a work permit and a two-year deferment from deportation proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD US Citizenship and Immigration Sevices Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The policy expands the Department of Homeland Security’s prosecutorial discretion policy, focusing finite resources on criminals and other threats to public safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf June 2012 Memo from Secretary of Homeland Security Jane Napolitano.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigration reform in the United Kingdom ==
As of 2010, in the [[United Kingdom]], there is some cross-party support for immigration reform, largely under the auspices of the [[Strangers into Citizens]] campaign. Although the [[Liberal Democrats]] are the only major party to fully support reform, some Labour MPs (including former leadership candidate [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonald]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.john4leader.org.uk/2007/05/strangers-into-citizens-demonstration.html&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[IPPR]] (a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-leaning think-tank) and [[Boris Johnson]] (the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Mayor of London]]) also support a selective amnesty for illegal immigrants. Under the Liberal Democrat proposal, this would involve regularisation for illegal immigrants who have lived in the country for at least ten years and who do not have a criminal record.

It is argued that bringing many of these (estimates varying widely from 300,000 to 800,000&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Call for immigrant amnesty in UK |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2007-07-16 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6899348.stm |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) individuals into the legal economy would allow police to concentrate resources on tackling people traffickers and criminals - and would raise billions in tax revenue - whereas deporting them would cost £4.7 billion and take 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; This issue is still a matter of political debate today in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mayoral candidates unite in call for illegal immigration amnesty |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2008-04-09 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mayoral-candidates-unite-in-call-for-illegal-immigration-amnesty-806310.html |accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | first=Amol | last=Rajan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Charles [http://www.immigrationmatters.co.uk/uk-immigrant-amnesty-worth-3bn-say-lse.html &quot;UK immigrant amnesty ‘worth £3bn’ say LSE&quot;] ''Immigration Matters'', 2009-06-16.
