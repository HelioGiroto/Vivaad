'''Theories of political behavior''', as an aspect of [[political science]], attempt to quantify and explain the influences that define a person's political views, [[ideology]], and levels of political participation. Theorists who have had an influence on this field include [[Karl Deutsch]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].

==Long-term influences on political orientation==
There are three main sources of influence that shape political orientation which creates long-term effects. Generally, the primary influence originates from [[family]]. As stated previously, children will often adopt their parents' [[ideology|ideological values]]. Some theorists have argued that family tends to be the strongest, most influential force which exists over the lifetime; one essay has credited the majority of the [[student activism]] of the 1930s to the influence of parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newdeal.feri.org/students/essay02.htm Activist Impulses: Campus Radicalism in the 1930s (Cohen)&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, [[teacher]]s and other educational authority figures have a significant impact on political orientation. From as early as age 4 up until 18, children spend about 25% of their time involved in educational processes.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} [[Post-secondary education]] significantly raises the impact of political awareness and orientation; an October 2004 study of 1,202 college [[undergraduates]] across the [[United States]] showed that 87% of college students were [[voter registration|registered to vote]], compared to a national average of 64% of American adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;scu.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/submitted/simas/politicalbehaviour.html Ethics and Political Behavior: A Portrait of the Voting Decisions of Santa Clara Students&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A study at [[Santa Clara University]] also showed that 84% of students there were registered to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;scu.edu&quot;/&gt; Also consider that childhood and adolescent stages of personal growth have the highest level of impressionability.

Thirdly, peers also affect political orientation. Friends often, but not necessarily, have the advantage of being part of the same generation, which collectively develops a unique set of societal issues; Eric L. Dey has argued that &quot;socialisation is the process through which individuals acquire knowledge, habits, and value orientations that will be useful in the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dey, Eric L., ''Undergraduate Political Attitudes: Peer Influence in Changing Social Contexts'', Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 68, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to relate on this common level is where the means to shape ideological growth.

==Short-term influences on political orientation==
Short-term factors also affect [[voting behavior]]; the [[mass media|media]] and the impact of individual [[election]] issues are among these factors. These factors differ from the long-term factors as they are often short-lived. However, they can be just as crucial in modifying political orientation. The ways in which these two sources are interpreted often relies on the individuals specific political ideology formed by the long-term factors.

Most [[political scientist]]s agree that the mass media have a profound impact on voting behavior. One author asserts that &quot;few would argue with the notion that the institutions of the mass media are important to contemporary politics ... in the transition to liberal democratic politics in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] the media was a key battleground.&quot;

Second, there are election issues. These include campaign issues, debates and commercials. Election years and political campaigns can shift certain political behaviors based on the candidates involved, which have different degrees of effectiveness in influencing voters.

==The influence of social groups on political outcomes==
Recently, some political scientists have been interested in many studies which aimed to analyze the relation between the behavior of social groups and the political outcomes. Some of the social groups included in their studies have been age demographics, [[gender]], and [[ethnic groups]].

For example, in [[U.S. politics]], the effect of ethnic groups and gender has a great influence on the political outcomes.

[[Latin Americans]] have a profound social impact on the political outcome of their vote and are emerging as a strong up-and-coming political force. The most noticeable increase in Latin American voting was in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], although the votes did not share a socially common political view at that time. In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], the Latin American vote aided tremendously in the election of [[Florida]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Mel Martinez]], although in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], about 44% of Latin Americans voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]]. Latin Americans have been seen to be showing an increasing trend in the issues on which they vote for, causing them to become more united when faced with political views. Currently illegal immigration has been claiming most attention and Latin Americans, although not completely unanimous, are concerned with the education, employment and deportation of illegal immigrants in the United States.

Over seven decades ago, women earned the right to vote and since then they have been making a difference in the outcomes of political election. Given that the right to be politically active has granted them the opportunity to expand their knowledge and influence in current affairs, they are now considered one of the main components in the country's decision-making in both politics and economy. According to [[The American Political Science Association]], over the past 2004 presidential election, the women's vote may have well decided the outcome of the race. [[Susan Carroll]], the author of ''Women Voters and the Gender Gap'', states that the increase of women influence on political behaviors is due to four main categories: women outnumber men among voters; significant efforts are underway to increase registration and turnout among women; a gender gap is evident in the 2004 election as it has been in every presidential election since 1980; and women constitute a disproportionately large share of the [[undecided voters]] who will make their decision late in the campaign.

== Biology and political science ==
Interdisciplinary studies in [[biology and political science]] aim to identify correlates of political behavior with biological aspects, for example the linkage of [[biology and political orientation]], but also with other aspects like [[partisanship]] and [[voting behavior]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SomitPeterson2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Somit|author2=Steven A. Peterson|title=Biology and Political Behavior: The Brain, Genes and Politics - The Cutting Edge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=__M0gG5kWg8C&amp;pg=PA232|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-85724-580-9|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study is sometimes called [[biopolitics]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Blank2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Blank|title=Biology and Political Science|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rAXYIkbWxawC|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20436-1|quote=This book demonstrates the increasing convergence of interest of some social scientists in the theories, research and findings of the life sciences in building a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of politics. It discusses the development of biopolitics as an academic perspective within political science, reviews the growing literature in biopolitics, and presents a coherent view of biopolitics as a framework for structuring inquiry across the current subfields of political science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term has other meanings.
