{{Slavery}}

'''Wage slavery''' refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Books/P&amp;C-Book.pdf David P. Ellerman, Property and Contract in Economics]&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam-webster.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave Wage slave]. Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave Wage slave]. Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]], and to highlight similarities between [[slavery|owning]] and [[employment|employing]] a person. The term ''wage slavery'' has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages,  e.g. in [[sweatshops]]),&lt;ref&gt;Sandel, Michael J. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183 Democracy's Discontent]''. p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;globetrotter.berkeley.edu&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;socialissues.wiseto.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialissues.wiseto.com/Articles/161500532/ |title=From wage slaves to wage workers: Cultural opportunity structures and the evolution of the wage demands of the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor, 1880–1900. – Crime |publisher=Socialissues.wiseto.com |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spunk.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their &quot;species character&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Avineri, Shlomo.

The exchange of [[money]] and [[debt]] for prolonged and unfulfilling work choices traces back to the disintegration of [[hunter-gatherer]] [[gift economies]] and the origin of [[prostitution]] as a &quot;fundamental feature of human civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Debt: The First 5,000 Years, David Graeber&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarities between wage labor and slavery were noted in ancient Rome by [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labor, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery.''&quot; – [[De Officiis]] [http://www.constitution.org/rom/de_officiis.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  while the pervasive practice of [[voluntary slavery]] in medieval Russia indicates the previous historical coexistence of slavery and voluntary choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Slavery in Russia, 1450–1725 |author=Klein, MA |journal=American Journal of Sociology |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[American Civil War]], Southern defenders of [[African American]] slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foner |first=Eric |title= Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men|page=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jensen |first=Derrick |title= The Culture of Make Believe}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], thinkers such as [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Marx, Ch. 7 of Theories of Surplus Value, a critique of Linguet, Théorie des lois civiles, etc., Londres, 1767.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/ProProp.html Proudhon, Pierre Joseph. What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government.]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines.

The introduction of wage labor in 18th century Britain was met with resistance – giving rise to the principles of [[syndicalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;English Working Class p. 599&quot;&gt;''The Making of the English Working Class'', p. 599&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;English Working Class p. 912&quot;&gt;''The Making of the English Working Class'', p. 912]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133&quot;&gt;Ostergaard, Geoffrey. ''The Tradition of Workers' Control'', p. 133]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shop Floor p. 37&quot;&gt;Competitive Advantage on the Shop Floor, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, some labor organizations and individual social activists have espoused [[workers' self-management]] or [[worker cooperative]]s as possible alternatives to wage labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialissues.wiseto.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The view that working for wages is akin to slavery was already present in the ancient world, beginning with the notion of prostitution as temporary slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civilliberty.about.com/od/gendersexuality/tp/History-of-Prostitution.htm &quot;History of Prostitution&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
At a time when [[self-sale]] contracts were one of the most direct ways to become a citizen in ancient Rome,&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''. Geoffrey W. Bromiley. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995. ISBN 0-8028-3784-0. p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero wrote in his De Officiis that
{{quote |whoever gives his labor for money sells himself and puts himself in the rank of slaves.}}

The first articulate description of wage slavery was made by [[Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet|Simon Linguet]] in 1763:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm |title=Chapter 7 |work=Theories of Surplus Value |author=Engels, Frederick |year=1847 |publisher=Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote |The slave was precious to his master because of the money he had cost him… They were worth at least as much as they could be sold for in the market… It is the impossibility of living by any other means that compels our farm labourers to till the soil whose fruits they will not eat and our masons to construct buildings in which they will not live… It is want that compels them to go down on their knees to the rich man in order to get from him permission to enrich him… what effective gain [has] the suppression of slavery brought [him ?] He is free, you say. Ah! That is his misfortune… These men… [have] the most terrible, the most imperious of masters, that is, need. … They must therefore find someone to hire them, or die of hunger. Is that to be free?}}

The view that wage work has substantial similarities with [[chattel slavery]] was actively put forward in the late 18th and 19th centuries by defenders of chattel slavery (most notably in the Southern states of the US), and by opponents of capitalism (who were also critics of chattel slavery).&lt;ref name=&quot;schalkenbach1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/Marx_Capital_Vol_1.pdf Capital: Volume One]&lt;/ref&gt; Some defenders of slavery, mainly from the [[Confederate States of America|Southern slave states]] argued that Northern workers were &quot;free but in name – the slaves of endless toil,&quot; and that their slaves were better off.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Hireling and the Slave – Antislavery Literature Project&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antislavery.eserver.org/proslavery/graysonhireling |title=The Hireling and the Slave – Antislavery Literature Project |work= |accessdate=09-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/lincolns-wage/ Wage Slavery], PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; This contention has been partly corroborated by some modern studies that indicate slaves' material conditions in the 19th century were &quot;better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JStor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Margo|first=Robert A.|coauthors=Steckel, Richard H.|title=The Heights of American Slaves: New Evidence on Slave Nutrition and Health|journal=Social Science History|date=Autumn 1982|volume=6|issue=4|pages=516–538|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0145-5532(198223)6%3A4%3C516%3ATHOASN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Height of American Slaves: New Evidence of Slave Nutrition and Health&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Fogel&quot;&gt;Fogel &amp; Engerman, ''Without Consent or Contract'', New York: Norton, 1989, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote that “[i]t is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself.”&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David. ''Walden'', Penguin, 1983, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of wage workers as wage slaves was not without controversy. Many [[abolitionist]]s in the United States regarded the analogy as spurious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner, Eric 1998. p. 66&quot;&gt;Foner, Eric. 1998. ''The Story of American Freedom''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that wage workers were &quot;neither wronged nor oppressed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNall 95&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=McNall |first=Scott G. |coauthors=et al.|title=Current Perspectives in Social Theory|page=95|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0h68KhoQ6RgC | isbn=978-0-7623-0762-3 | year=2002 | publisher=Emerald Group Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abolitionist and former slave [[Frederick Douglass]] declared &quot;Now I am my own master&quot; when he took a paying job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Douglass 95&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Douglass |first=Frederick |coauthors=Gates, Henry Louis |title=Autobiographies : Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the republicans &quot;did not challenge the notion that those who spend their entire lives as wage laborers were comparable to slaves&quot;, though they argued that the condition was different, as laborers were likely to have the opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving [[self-employment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183 p.181-184 Democracy's Discontent By Michael J. Sandel]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CottonNegrosSouth.jpg|right|thumb|[[African American]] wage workers picking cotton on a plantation in the South.]]

However, self-employment became less common as the [[artisan]] tradition slowly disappeared in the later part of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallgrimsdottir&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hallgrimsdottir|first=Helga Kristin|date=March 2007|title=From Wage Slaves to Wage Workers: Cultural Opportunity Structures and the Evolution of the Wage Demands of Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor, 1880–1900|journal=Social Forces |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=1393–1411 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/social_forces/v085/85.3hallgrimsdottir.html |accessdate=2009-01-04|doi=10.1353/sof.2007.0037|last2=Benoit|first2=Cecilia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://socialissues.wiseto.com/Articles/161500532 From Wage Slaves to Wage Workers – Free text]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the system of wage labor as &quot;a system of slavery as absolute if not as degrading as that which lately prevailed at the South&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; [[E. P. Thompson]] notes that for British workers at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the &quot;gap in status between a 'servant,' a hired wage-laborer subject to the orders and discipline of the master, and an artisan, who might 'come and go' as he pleased, was wide enough for men to shed blood rather than allow themselves to be pushed from one side to the other. And, in the value system of the community, those who resisted degradation were in the right.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;English Working Class p. 599&quot;/&gt; A &quot;Member of the Builders' Union&quot; in the 1830s argued that the trade unions &quot;will not only strike for less work, and more wages, but will ultimately abolish wages, become their own masters and work for each other; labor and capital will no longer be separate but will be indissolubly joined together in the hands of workmen and work-women.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;English Working Class p. 912&quot;/&gt; This perspective inspired the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]] of 1834 which had the &quot;two-fold purpose of syndicalist unions – the protection of the workers under the existing system and the formation of the nuclei of the future society&quot; when the unions &quot;take over the whole industry of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133&quot;/&gt; &quot;Research has shown&quot;, summarises [[William Lazonick]], &quot;that the 'free-born Englishman' of the eighteenth century – even those who, by force of circumstance, had to submit to agricultural wage labour – tenaciously resisted entry into the capitalist workshop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shop Floor p. 37&quot;/&gt;

The use of the term '''wage slave''' by labor organizations may originate from the labor protests of the [[Lowell Mill Girls]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Bruce. ''Artisans Into Workers: Labor in Nineteenth-century America''&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery of wage slavery was widely used by labor organizations during the mid-19th century to object to the lack of workers' self-management. However, it was gradually replaced by the more neutral term &quot;wage work&quot; towards the end of the 19th century, as labor organizations shifted their focus to raising wages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallgrimsdottir&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Karl Marx described Capitalist society as infringing on individual [[autonomy]], by basing it on a materialistic and commodified concept of the body and its liberty (i.e. as something that is sold, rented or [[Social alienation|alienated]] in a [[class society]]). According to [[Friedrich Engels]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm |author=Engels, Friedrich |date=1820-85 |publisher=Marxists.org |title=The Principles of Communism }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote |The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly.

Criticisms of wage work in the literature draw several similarities with slavery:

# Since the chattel slave is property, his value to an owner is in some ways higher than that of a worker who may quit, be fired or replaced. The chattel slave's owner has made a greater investment in terms of the money he paid for the slave. For this reason, in times of recession, chattel slaves could not be fired like wage laborers. A &quot;wage slave&quot; could also be harmed at no (or less) cost. American chattel slaves in the 19th century had improved their standard of living from the 18th century&lt;ref name=&quot;JStor&quot;/&gt; and, according to historians Fogel and Engerman plantation records show that slaves worked less, were better fed and whipped only occasionally – their material conditions in the 19th century being &quot;better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogel&quot; /&gt; This was partially due to slave psychological strategies under an economic system different from capitalist wage slavery. According to Mark Michael Smith of the Economic History Society: &quot;although intrusive and oppressive, paternalism, the way masters employed it, and the methods slaves used to manipulate it, rendered slaveholders' attempts to institute capitalistic work regimens on their plantation ineffective and so allowed slaves to carve out a degree of autonomy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Debating Slavery: Economy and Society in the Antebellum American South'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, various strategies and struggles adopted by wage laborers contributed to the creation of [[labor unions]] and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] institutions, etc. that helped improve standards of living since the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]]. Nevertheless, worldwide, work-related injuries and illnesses still kill at least 2.3 million workers per year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/global/publications/magazines-and-journals/world-of-work-magazine/issues/WCMS_099048/lang--en/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with &quot;between 184 and 208 million workers suffer[ing] from work-related diseases&quot; and about &quot;270 million&quot; non-lethal injuries of varying severity &quot;caused by preventable factors at the workplace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/2005/105B09_281_engl.pdf Decent Work: Safe Work]&lt;/ref&gt;—a number that may or may not compare favorably with chattel slavery's.
# Unlike a chattel slave, a wage laborer can (barring [[unemployment]] or lack of job offers) choose between employers, but they usually constitute a minority of owners in the population for which the wage laborer must work, while attempts to implement [[workers' control]] on employers' businesses may be met with violence or other unpleasant consequences. The wage laborer's starkest choice is to work for an employer or face poverty or starvation. If a chattel slave refuses to work, a number of punishments are also available; from beatings to food deprivation – although economically rational slave owners practiced positive [[reinforcement]] to achieve best results and before losing their investment (or even friendship) by killing an expensive slave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradocollege.edu/dept/HY/HY243Ruiz/Research/Antebellum.html Slavery in the Antebellum South]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&amp;id=3089 The Gray Area: Dislodging Misconceptions about Slavery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.triad.rr.com/warfford/Roman_Empire/slavery.html Roman Household Slavery]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Historically, the range of occupations and status positions held by chattel slaves has been nearly as broad as that held by free persons, indicating some similarities between chattel slavery and wage slavery as well.&lt;ref&gt;''The highest position slaves ever attained was that of slave minister… A few slaves even rose to be monarchs, such as the slaves who became sultans and founded dynasties in Islām. At a level lower than that of slave ministers were other slaves, such as those in the Roman Empire, the Central Asian Samanid domains, Ch’ing China, and elsewhere, who worked in government offices and administered provinces. … The stereotype that slaves were careless and could only be trusted to do the crudest forms of manual labor was disproved countless times in societies that had different expectations and proper incentives.''[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548305/slavery/24172/Slave-occupations The sociology of slavery: Slave occupations Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Arguably, wage slavery, like chattel slavery, does not stem from some immutable &quot;human nature,&quot; but represents a &quot;specific response to material and historical conditions&quot; that &quot;reproduce[s] the inhabitants, the social relations… the ideas… [and] the social form of daily life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon.com&quot;&gt;Perlman, Fredy. [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0934868174 Reproduction of Daily Life]. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
# Similarities were blurred by the fact that proponents of wage labor won the [[American Civil War]], in which they competed for legitimacy with defenders of chattel slavery. Both presented an over-positive assessment of their system, while denigrating the opponent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner, Eric 1998. p. 66&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McNall 95&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzhugh, George. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ECdb7EjiBnEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cannibals+all&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cannibals All!]&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarities between chattel and wage slavery were noticed by the workers themselves. For example, the 19th century [[Lowell Mill Girls]], who, without any reported knowledge of European [[marxism]] or [[anarchism]], condemned the &quot;degradation and subordination&quot; of the newly emerging industrial system, and the &quot;new spirit of the age: gain wealth, forgetting all but self&quot;, maintaining that &quot;those who work in the mills should own them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. ''Rogue States''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. ''[[Profit over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order|Profit Over People]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
They expressed their concerns in a protest song during their 1836 strike:

&lt;poem&gt;:Oh! isn't it a pity, such a pretty girl as I
:Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die?
:Oh! I cannot be a slave, I will not be a slave,
:For I'm so fond of liberty,
:That I cannot be a slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/americanstudies/lavender/liberty.html |title=Liberty |work=American Studies |publisher=CSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

[[Image:Portrait Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: &quot;The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman: A Documentary History of the American Years&lt;/ref&gt;]]
However, the structural changes associated with the later stages of industrial capitalism, including &quot;increased centralization of production... declining wages... [an] expanding... labor pool... intensifying competition, and... [t]he loss of competence and independence experienced by skilled labor&quot; meant that &quot;a critique that referred to all [wage] work as slavery and avoided demands for wage concessions in favor of supporting the creation of the producerist republic (by diverting strike funds towards funding... co-operatives, for example) was far less compelling than one that identified the specific conditions of slavery as low wages...&quot; Thus, &quot;wage slavery&quot; was gradually replaced by the more pragmatic term &quot;wage work&quot; towards the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallgrimsdottir&quot; /&gt;

Defenses of wage labor and chattel slavery in the literature have linked the subjection of man to man with the subjection of man to nature; arguing that hierarchy and a social system's particular relations of production represent human nature and are no more coercive than the reality of life itself. According to this narrative, any well-intentioned attempt to fundamentally change the status quo is naively utopian and will result in more oppressive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Carsel, Wilfred. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2192167 The Slaveholders' Indictment of Northern Wage Slavery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reactor-core.org/cannibals-all.html |title=Cannibals All |publisher=Reactor Core}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Norberg |first=Johan |title=In Defense of Global Capitalism |publisher=Cato Institute |location=Washington |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-930865-47-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosses in both of these long-lasting systems argued that their system created a lot of wealth and prosperity. Both did, in some sense create jobs and their investment entailed risk. For example, slave owners might have risked losing money by buying expensive slaves who later became ill or died; or might have used those slaves to make products that didn't sell well on the market. Marginally, both chattel and wage slaves may become bosses; sometimes by working hard. It may be the &quot;rags to riches&quot; story which occasionally occurs in capitalism, or the &quot;slave to master&quot; story that occurred in places like colonial Brazil, where slaves could buy their own freedom and become business owners, self-employed, or slave owners themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Alida C. Family and Frontier in Colonial Brazil, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Metcalf |first=Alida |title=Family and Frontier in Colonial Brazil |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-292-70652-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social mobility, or the hard work and risk that it may entail, are thus not considered to be a redeeming factor by critics of the concept of wage slavery.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain. B.7.2 Does social mobility make up for class inequality? An Anarchist FAQ: Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[David Graeber]] has noted that, historically, the first wage labor contracts we know about – whether in ancient Greece or Rome, or in the Malay or Swahili city states in the Indian ocean – were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money, and the slave, another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses.) Such arrangements, according to Graeber, were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or Brazil. C. L. R. James argued that most of the techniques of human organization employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prickly-paradigm.com/paradigm14.pdf Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology p. 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-capitalist thinkers claim that the [[elite]] maintain wage [[slavery]] and a divided working class through their influence over the media and entertainment industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/19/144225 |title=Democracy Now |date=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1992----02.htm |title=Interview |year=1992 |author=Chomsky, Noam}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational institutions, unjust laws, nationalist and corporate [[propaganda]], pressures and incentives to internalize values serviceable to the power structure, [[State (polity)|state]] violence, fear of [[unemployment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://question-everything.mahost.org/Socio-Politics/thoughtcontrol.html |title=Thought Control |work=Socio-Politics |publisher=Question Everything}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a historical legacy of exploitation and profit accumulation/transfer under prior systems, which shaped the development of economic theory:

[[Adam Smith]] noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won-b5-c1-article-2-ss3.htm Adam Smith – An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations – The Adam Smith Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The interest of the dealers... in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public… [They] have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public… We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate… It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms.}}

===Capitalism===
The concept of wage slavery could conceivably be traced back to pre-capitalist figures like [[Gerrard Winstanley]] from the radical Christian [[Diggers]] movement in England, who wrote in his 1649 pamphlet, ''The New Law of Righteousness'', that there &quot;shall be no buying or selling, no fairs nor markets, but the whole earth shall be a common treasury for every man,&quot; and &quot;there shall be none Lord over others, but every one shall be a Lord of himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham-2005&quot;&gt;[[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], ''[[Anarchism - A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] – Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', Black Rose Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] made the statement &quot;...the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life (for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue), nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil（for leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active participation in politics.)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] 1328b-1329a, H. Rackham trans.&lt;/ref&gt; (often paraphrased as &quot;all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;quotationspage.com&quot;&gt;http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/1097.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] wrote in 44 BC that &quot;…vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[De Officiis]] Liber I XI.II&lt;/ref&gt;
Somewhat similar criticisms have also been expressed by some proponents of [[liberalism]], like [[Henry George]],&lt;ref name=&quot;schalkenbach1&quot; /&gt; [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Thomas Paine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html Social Security Online History Pages]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Distributism|Distributist]] school of thought within the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

To [[Marx]] and anarchist thinkers like [[Bakunin]] and [[Kropotkin]] their concept of wage slavery was as a [[class (social)|class condition]] in place due to the existence of [[private property]] and the [[Sovereign state|state]]. This class situation rested primarily on:

#the existence of property not intended for active use,
#the concentration of ownership in few hands,
#the lack of direct access by workers to the [[means of production]] and consumption goods
#the perpetuation of a [[Reserve army of labour|reserve army of unemployed workers]].

and secondarily on:

#the waste of workers' efforts and resources on producing useless luxuries;
#the waste of goods so that their price may remain high; and
#the waste of all those who sit between the producer and consumer, taking their own shares at each stage without actually contributing to the production of goods.

[[Wage labor]]ers and their families sometimes borrow from [[financial institutions]] to compensate for insufficient earnings or improve their societal status. According to economist [[Steve Keen]], the &quot;[[deleveraging]]&quot; moments when they (or the governments they live under) pay down debt instead of spending on consumption or investment in real-economy infrastructure, result in [[economic crises]] or even depressions (such as [[The Great Depression]]). The lack of [[aggregate demand]] caused by low wages and low unionization, as well as the higher wages that create inflation – as capitalists pass increased labor costs onto consumers – are important factors in the creation of the [[business cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://debunkingeconomics.com/ Debunking Economics – Revised and Expanded Edition: The Naked Emperor Dethroned?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communism===
[[Image:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|lright|200px|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt]] [[libertarian socialist]] &quot;wage slavery&quot; critics who had demanded among other things that &quot;handicraft production be authorized provided it does not utilize wage labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/brendel/1971/kronstadt.htm Kronstadt:Proletarian Spin-Off of The Russian Revolution]&quot; Cajo Brendel&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Both American and Russian media described the [[USSR]] as communist and socialist society. Thus Soviet state brutality and destruction of workers' councils became identified with [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. This helped to vilify these political movements and portray capitalist wage labor as the only alternative to the soviet model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Chomsky, Noam |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1986----.htm |title=The Soviet Union Versus Socialism, by Noam Chomsky |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Media and Cultural Studies&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Durham |first=Meenakshi Gigi |others=Douglas Kellner |title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keyworks (Keyworks in Cultural Studies) |isbn=978-0-631-22095-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascism===
Fascism was more discriminating of trade unions than modern economies in Europe or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;De Grand, Alexander J. ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'', Routledge, 1995. pp. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist economic policies were widely accepted in the 1920s and 1930s and foreign (especially US) corporate investment in Italy and Germany increased after the fascist take over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/thistle/www/v13/3/oil.html A People's History of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, this foreign investment, in conjunction with Hitler's economic policies, led to economic growth and an increase in the standard of living of some Germans,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww2.shtml Nazi Germany 1939–1945 and World War 2 (WW2) – History of Hitler and Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; though critics like Noam Chomsky do not believe that such improvements justify fascism nor wage slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube1&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFxYyXGMfZM YouTube – Noam Chomsky: Is Capitalism Making Life Better?]&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing largely on US support for the Latin American &quot;National Security States,&quot; Chomsky and [[Edward S. Herman]] argue that U.S. corporations support (and in many instances create) fascist (or &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;neo&quot;-fascist) terror states in order to create a favorable investment climate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascism has been perceived by some notable critics, like [[Buenaventura Durruti]], to be a last resort weapon of the privileged to ensure the maintenance of wage slavery:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No government fights fascism to destroy it. When the [[bourgeoisie]] sees that power is slipping out of its hands, it brings up fascism to hold onto their privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Quote from an interview with Pierre van Paassen (24 July 1936), published in the ''Toronto Daily Star'' (5 August 1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opinions on psychological effects==
[[Image:WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|290px|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]]]

According to [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era. In his 1791 book ''[[On the Limits of State Action]]'', classical liberal thinker [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] explained how &quot;whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness&quot; and so when the laborer works under external control, &quot;we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.zcommunications.org/chomsky/year/year-c01-s06.html Year 501: Chapter One [6/12&amp;#93;&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram]] and [[Stanford experiment]]s have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.&lt;ref&gt;Social Psychology of the Workplace By Shane R. Thye, Edward J. Lawler&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-identity problems and stress===

According to research, modern work provides people with a sense of personal and social identity that is tied to

1) the particular work role, even if unfulfilling; and

2) the social role it entails e.g. family bread-winning, friendship forming etc.

Thus job loss entails the loss of this identity.&lt;ref&gt;Job Loss: Hard Times, Eroded Identity Price, R.H., Friedland, D.S., &amp; Vinokur, A.D. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychiatrist Dayal Mirchandani thinks this problem has become important enough that humans should &quot;divorce [their] self-image from  [their] job and from the perks it provides.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifepositive.com/Mind/self-love/Living_Beyond_Job_Identity.asp Self Love – Living Beyond Job Identity]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] noted that if a person perceives himself as being what he owns, then when that person loses (or even thinks of losing) what he &quot;owns&quot; (e.g. the good looks or sharp mind that allow him to sell his labor for high wages), then, a fear of loss may create anxiety and authoritarian tendencies because that person's sense of identity is threatened. In contrast, when a person's sense of self is based on what he experiences in a state of ''being'' (creativity, love, sadness, taste, sight etc.) with a less materialistic regard for what he once had and lost, or may lose, then less authoritarian tendencies prevail. The state of being, in his view, flourishes under a worker-managed workplace and economy, whereas self-ownership entails a materialistic notion of self, created to rationalize the lack of worker control that would allow for a state of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JvG85s966koC&amp;dq=to+have+or+to+be&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AbpnS7-aGJyysQOe0fjVBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=To Have Or To Be? |last=Fromm |first=Erich |page={{page needed|date=May 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7GpHrdXOFI Erich Fromm Interview Excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this lack of control, the exploited worker, according to [[Marx]], &quot;puts his life into the object... [and thus] the greater his activity...the less he possesses...[H]is labour becomes an object...[and] the life which he has given to the object sets itself against him as an alien and hostile force&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoshop.org/library/Fredy_Perlman:_Intro_Commodity_Fetishism#_ref-5 Fredy Perlman: Intro Commodity Fetishism – Infoshop Library&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; And since the worker could be working for wages or saving money instead of enjoying life or having fun, (which in a capitalist society often costs money), &quot;all passions and all activity is submerged in avarice...[and] the less you are, the less you express your own life, the more you have, i.e., the greater is your alienated life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/needs.htm |title=Human Requirements and Division of Labour, Marx, 1844 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative journalist [[Robert Kuttner]] in Everything for Sale, analyzes the work of public-Health scholars Jeffrey Johnson and Ellen Hall about modern conditions of work, and concludes that &quot;to be in a life situation where one experiences relentless demands by others, over which one has relatively little control, is to be at risk of poor health, physically as well as mentally.&quot; Under wage labor, &quot;a relatively small elite demands and gets empowerment, self-actualization, autonomy, and other work satisfaction that partially compensate for long hours&quot; while &quot;epidemiological data confirm that lower-paid, lower-status workers are more likely to experience the most clinically damaging forms of stress, in part because they have less control over their work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kuttner, ''Op. Cit.'', pp. 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Wage slavery, and the educational system that precedes it &quot;implies power held by the leader. Without power the leader is inept. The possession of power inevitably leads to corruption… in spite of… good intentions … [Leadership means] power of initiative, this sense of responsibility, the self-respect which comes from expressed manhood, is taken from the men, and consolidated in the leader. The sum of their initiative, their responsibility, their self-respect becomes his … [and the] order and system he maintains is based upon the suppression of the men, from being independent thinkers into being 'the men' … In a word, he is compelled to become an autocrat and a foe to democracy.&quot; For the &quot;leader&quot;, such marginalisation can be beneficial, for a leader &quot;sees no need for any high level of intelligence in the rank and file, except to applaud his actions. Indeed such intelligence from his point of view, by breeding criticism and opposition, is an obstacle and causes confusion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Miners' Next Step'', pp. 15, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Wage slavery &quot;implies erosion of the human personality… [because] some men submit to the will of others, arousing in these instincts which predispose them to cruelty and indifference in the face of the suffering of their fellows.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Jose Peirats, The CNT in the Spanish Revolution, vol. 2, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological control===

====Higher wages====

In 19th century discussions of labor relations, it was normally assumed that the threat of starvation forced those without property to work for wages. Proponents of the view that modern forms of employment constitute wage slavery, even when workers appear to have a range of available alternatives, have attributed its perpetuation to a variety of social factors that maintain the [[cultural hegemony|hegemony]] of the employer class.&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, A. (1992) ''Prison Notebooks''. New York : Columbia University Press, pp.233–38&lt;/ref&gt; These include efforts at [[manufacturing consent]] and eliciting [[false consciousness]].

Harriet Hanson Robinson in an account of the [[Lowell Mill Girls]] wrote that generously high wages were offered to overcome the degrading nature of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the time the Lowell cotton mills were started the caste of the factory girl was the lowest among the employments of women....She was represented as subjected to influences that must destroy her purity and self­respect. In the eyes of her overseer she was but a brute, a slave, to be beaten, pinched and pushed about. It was to overcome this prejudice that such high wages had been offered to women that they might be induced to become mill­girls, in spite of the opprobrium that still clung to this degrading occupation....&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Harriet H. &quot;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/robinson-lowell.asp Early Factory Labor in New England],&quot; in Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Fourteenth Annual Report (Boston: Wright &amp; Potter, 1883), pp. 380­82, 387­88, 391­92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In his book, ''[[Disciplined Minds]]'', [[Jeff Schmidt (writer)|Jeff Schmidt]] points out that professionals are trusted to run organizations in the interests of their employers. Because employers cannot be on hand to manage every decision, professionals are trained to “ensure that each and every detail of their work favors the right interests–or skewers the disfavored ones” in the absence of overt control:
{{quote|''The resulting professional is an obedient thinker, an intellectual property whom employers can trust to experiment, theorize, innovate and create safely within the confines of an assigned ideology.''&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Jeff. ''[http://disciplinedminds.tripod.com/ Disciplined Minds – A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals And The Soul-Battering System That Shapes Their Lives]'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2000, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Parecon]] theory posits a social class &quot;between labor and capital&quot; of higher paid professionals such as &quot;doctors, lawyers, engineers, managers and others&quot; who monopolize empowering labor and constitute a class above wage laborers who do mostly &quot;obedient, rote work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parecon and Anarcho-Syndicalism: An Interview with Michael Albert|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/parecon-and-anarcho-syndicalism-an-interview-with-michael-albert-by-michael-albert|newspaper=ZNet|date=July 4, 2007|author=DC Tedrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lower wages====

The terms &quot;employee&quot; or &quot;worker&quot; have often been replaced by &quot;associate&quot;. This plays up the allegedly voluntary nature of the interaction, while playing down the subordinate status of the wage laborer, as well as the worker-boss class distinction emphasized by labor movements. Billboards, as well as TV, Internet and newspaper advertisements, consistently show low-wage workers with smiles on their faces, appearing happy.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara. ''Bright-Sided: How Positive Thinking Is Undermining America''&lt;/ref&gt;

Job interviews and other data on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries – particularly in the growing service sector – indicate that the more workers depend on low wages, and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and expect them to feign unremunerative motivation. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara. ''Nickled and Dimed''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, employers in the service industry have justified unstable, part-time employment and low wages by playing down the importance of service jobs for the lives of the wage laborers (e.g. just temporary before finding something better, student summer jobs etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=joke+jobs+naomi+klein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w8RjENro0U&amp;sig=KIQ1UqJj8rkzPMxj5RhFdR04Grs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=o45DTc74F47msQOyo4nBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false No space, no choice, no jobs, no logo] By Naomi Klein&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social activists objecting to the [[market system]] or [[price system]] of wage working, historically have considered [[syndicalism]], [[worker cooperative]]s, [[workers' self-management]] and [[workers' control]] as possible alternatives to the current wage system.&lt;ref name=&quot;globetrotter.berkeley.edu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;socialissues.wiseto.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spunk.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133&quot;/&gt;

===Labor and government===
The American philosopher [[John Dewey]] believed that until &quot;industrial feudalism&quot; is replaced by &quot;industrial democracy,&quot; politics will be &quot;the shadow cast on society by big business&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As long as politics is the shadow cast on society by big business, the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance&quot;, in &quot;The Need for a New Party&quot; (1931), Later Works 6, p163&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]] has postulated in his [[investment theory of party competition]] that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=CU8oyIlNyQcC&amp;dq=investment+theory+party+competition&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qilco5PlJF&amp;sig=NknYgcSaZF0OQ2ilcwDuz6kJssM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_8uYSvTDDof-tQOZx92pAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Thomas Ferguson, Golden rule: the investment theory of party competition and the logic of money-driven political systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Noam chomsky cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Noam Chomsky]]

[[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that political theory tends to blur the 'elite' function of government:

{{quote |“Modern political theory stresses Madison's belief that &quot;in a just and a free government the rights both of property and of persons ought to be effectually guarded.&quot; But in this case too it is useful to look at the doctrine more carefully. There are no rights of property, only rights to property that is, rights of persons with property,...&quot;

&quot;[In] representative democracy, as in, say, the United States or Great Britain [...] there is a monopoly of power centralized in the state, and secondly – and critically – [...] the representative democracy is limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere [...] That is, as long as individuals are compelled to rent themselves on the market to those who are willing to hire them, as long as their role in production is simply that of ancillary tools, then there are striking elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of democracy very limited, if even meaningful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19760725.htm |title=The Relevance of Anarcho-syndicalism |last=Chomsky| first=Noam| date=July 25, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on environmental degradation===
[[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]] philosophy professor John Clark and libertarian socialist philosopher [[Murray Bookchin]] have criticized the system of wage labor for encouraging environmental destruction, arguing that a self-managed industrial society would better manage the environment. They, like other anarchists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionE An Anarchist FAQ Section E – What do anarchists think causes ecological problems?]&lt;/ref&gt; attribute much of the industrial revolution's pollution to the &quot;hierarchical&quot; and &quot;competitive&quot; economic relations accompanying it.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. ''Remaking Society'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. ''The Future of the Ecology Movement'', pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. ''Which Way for the Ecology Movement?'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John. ''The Anarchist Moment'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John. [http://library.nothingness.org/articles/anar/en/display/305 A Social Ecology]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment contracts===
Some criticize wage slavery on strictly contractual grounds, e.g. [[David Ellerman]] and [[Carole Pateman]], arguing that the [[employment contract]] is a legal fiction in that it treats human beings juridically as mere tools or inputs by abdicating responsibility and self-determination, which the critics argue are inalienable. As Ellerman points out, &quot;[t]he employee is legally transformed from being a co-responsible partner to being only an input supplier sharing no legal responsibility for either the input liabilities [costs] or the produced outputs [revenue, profits] of the employer’s business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&amp;Pol-Econ/translatio-v-concessio-P-and-S-final.pdf Ellerman, David, ''Translatio versus Concessio'', 16]&lt;/ref&gt; Such contracts are inherently invalid &quot;since the person remain[s] a de facto fully capacitated adult person with only the contractual role of a non-person . . .&quot; as it is impossible to physically transfer self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&amp;Pol-Econ/translatio-v-concessio-P-and-S-final.pdf Ellerman, David, ''Translatio versus Concessio'', 14]&lt;/ref&gt; As Pateman argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The contractarian argument is unassailable all the time it is accepted that abilities can ‘acquire’ an external relation to an individual, and can be treated as if they were property. To treat abilities in this manner is also implicitly to accept that the ‘exchange’ between employer and worker is like any other exchange of material property . . . The answer to the question of how property in the person can be contracted out is that no such procedure is possible. Labour power, capacities or services, cannot be separated from the person of the worker like pieces of property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&amp;Pol-Econ/translatio-v-concessio-P-and-S-final.pdf Ellerman, David, ''Translatio versus Concessio'', 32]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a modern liberal-capitalist society, the employment contract is enforced while the enslavement contract is not; the former being considered valid because of its consensual/non-coercive nature, and the later being considered inherently invalid, consensual or not. The noted economist [[Paul Samuelson]] described this discrepancy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Since slavery was abolished, human earning power is forbidden by law to be
capitalized. A man is not even free to sell himself; he must rent himself at a wage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&amp;Pol-Econ/Inalienable-rights-and-contracts.pdf Ellerman, David, ''Inalienable Rights and Contracts'', 21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some advocates of laissez-faire capitalism, among them philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], address this inconsistency in modern societies, arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&amp;Pol-Econ/translatio-v-concessio-P-and-S-final.pdf Ellerman, David, ''Translatio versus Concessio'', 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others like [[Murray Rothbard]] allow for the possibility of [[debt slavery]], asserting that a lifetime labour contract can be broken so long as the slave pays appropriate damages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[I]f A has agreed to work for life for B in exchange for 10,000 grams of gold, he will have to return the proportionate amount of property if he terminates the arrangement and ceases to work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Man, Economy, and State'', vol. I , p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
Many [[abolitionist]]s in the United States regarded the analogy of wage workers as wage slaves to be spurious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner, Eric 1998. p. 66&quot;/&gt; They believed that wage workers were &quot;neither wronged nor oppressed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNall 95&quot;/&gt; The abolitionist and former slave [[Frederick Douglass]] declared &quot;Now I am my own master&quot; when he took a paying job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Douglass 95&quot;/&gt; 
However, [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the republicans &quot;did not challenge the notion that those who spend their entire lives as wage laborers were comparable to slaves&quot;, though they argued that the condition was different, as laborers were likely to have the opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving [[self-employment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;
 
Some advocates of laissez-faire capitalism, among them philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], have said that inalienable rights can be waived if they are done so voluntary: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, David. [http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&amp;Pol-Econ/translatio-v-concessio-P-and-S-final.pdf ''Translatio versus Concessio'']. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Schools of economics==
In mainstream, [[neoclassical economics]] philosophy, [[wage labor]] is seen as the [[Labour economics|voluntary sale of one's own time and efforts]], just like a carpenter would sell a chair, or a farmer would sell wheat. It is considered neither an antagonistic nor abusive relationship, and carries no particular moral implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mankiw |first=N. Gregory |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Worth |year=2002 |edition=5th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian economics]] argues that a person is not &quot;free&quot; unless they can sell their labor, because otherwise that person has no self-ownership and will be owned by a &quot;third party&quot; of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanaction&quot;&gt;[http://www.mises.org/humanaction/pdf/ha_10.pdf interpersonal exchange] on The Ludwig von Mises Institute accessed at March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Post Keynesian economics]] perceives wage slavery as resulting from [[inequality of bargaining power]] between labor and capital, which exists when the economy does not &quot;allow labor to organize and form a strong countervailing force&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rima, Ingrid Hahne; Forstater, Mathew; Mongiovi, Gary; Pressman, Steven. [http://books.google.com/books?id=qb47lG7sf4AC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=post-keynesianism+wage+slavery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fBZFjCiRQ4&amp;sig=hWrETFhbK2r8FyimFw3FHw53nvA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FmsQT4iGM6b-iQKOvdy8DQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Post Keynesian macroeconomics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://debunkingeconomics.com/Papers/Marx/Keen_Marx_Thesis.pdf Keen Marx Thesis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main forms of [[Socialist economics]] perceive wage slavery differently:

1. – [[Libertarian Socialism]] sees it as a lack of [[workers' self-management]] in the context of substituting state and capitalist control with political and economic decentralization and [[confederation]].

2. – [[State socialism|State-socialists]] view it as an injustice perpetrated by capitalists and solved by state control of the [[means of production]].
